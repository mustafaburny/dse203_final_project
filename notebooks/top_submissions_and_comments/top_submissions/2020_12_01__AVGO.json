        "selftext": "**The latest jobless numbers came in bad while the stock market keeps pushing forward, is a stock market crash coming soon? Let\u2019s talk about this and the latest stock market news**\n\nHey everyone! So let\u2019s start with the recap off Friday as we saw the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HD8WbDT) leading the way up 0,88%, with the [DOW Industrial](https://ibb.co/sCt0FJj) close behind up 0,83% and the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/dDhWbBG) also gaining a decent amount, up 0,7% with all 3 big indexes closing at all-time highs.\n\nWe saw more than \u00be of the [stocks](https://ibb.co/CB6cSMn) advancing despite below average volume as companies either small, mid or large cap value or growth [stocks](https://ibb.co/qCNqN5G) were gaining except large-cap growth. \n\nThe best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/d6f58Mf) were Energy and Materials up over 2% while Utilities finished 1% down on Friday, as Utilities were the only sector to finish the week losing significant ground, with Consumer Discretionary also dropping just 0,12%. With the rest of the sectors in the green, Energy, Health Care, Technology and Communication being the biggest gainers finishing the week up over 2%.\n\n[Utilities](https://ibb.co/Bz8TnvP) have been hit hard in the last year as residential consumers and small businesses have been able to defer paying power bills, this will continue to hold down the sector for now with the debt still increasing.\n\nThe VIX also dropped more than 2% on [Friday](https://ibb.co/18qjBx7) and finished the [week](https://ibb.co/7KyfPxQ) over 5% down as the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/sKhhfx6) from Friday shows us that there were plenty of gains to be made especially in the Energy Sectors as well as Financials, with the big companies from the Tech and Communication sectors doing worse than the rest of the market.\n\nFor the week though this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/92hRtQL) shows that Apple was one of the biggest gainers alongside Semiconductors and Energy Names while Health Care companies like JNJ and Pfizer also did very good.\n\nThe big indexes all finished higher for the [week](https://ibb.co/b3Gb4HN) with the SP500 up 1,7%, the Nasdaq Composite up 2,1% and the Dow up 1% with renewed hopes for a stimulus package being back on the table.\n\nHere are the most interesting economic [reports](https://ibb.co/j84CkLT) for next week, it will be a light week in terms of economic data but still, the market may be volatile and trends may change depending on some of the results.\n\nSo, on Friday [November JOBS](https://ibb.co/r0JPtCs) came in much lower than anticipated, coming in at 245K vs de 610K in October and 469K estimated while the unemployment [rate](https://ibb.co/M9mNBMT) dropped to 6,7% a bit better than expected and down from 6,9% in the past month. Still there are over 10million people unemployed, this number more than doubling since the start on February. The [net addition](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) of jobs in November was the [smallest](https://ibb.co/dWKmZWH) since May as government jobs were the [worst performing](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) while transportation and warehousing jobs continue to increase, as big companies \u2026 aka Amazon has hired almost 3thousand people per day this year. But the bad news is that [long-term](https://ibb.co/HFZFhyC) unemployment is approaching the peaks from the Great Recession and that is not good news for the economy or the stock market as over 3,9 million people have been out of work for at least 6 months. \n\nSo, this is pretty bad news as mortgages in [forbearance](https://ibb.co/NLcDmYP) just slightly declined this week, by just 39K with more and more plans planned to expire in December, over 1M more exactly, more than 40% of active cases.\n\nThis may finally put some extra pressure on the Congress to agree to a relief package maybe even passing it alongside the government [funding bill](https://ibb.co/1qkTnsD) that is still debated and has over 300 issues that the parties don\u2019t agree on. \n\nThis is becoming more and more obvious as [cases](https://ibb.co/6y9FTjV) in the US continue to rise, coming in over 200k in the last 2 days and the economy will soon feel the pressure from this, I expect the next month or two of economic data to not be so good, this may be the time the market sees a 5-10% correction before moving on higher on more positive things like the availability of the vaccine, the passing of the torch In the Presidency and a possible relief package.\n\nYes, this will continue to add to the [US DEBT](https://ibb.co/QjSPcdB), but even though I don\u2019t have any partisan views, a good structured relief bill would do wonders for the economy as a bridge to when the vaccine will finally be widely available.\n\nYes, I know that the global debt is set to reach $200 trillion but the DEBT-to-GDP [ratio](https://ibb.co/LhWkxKJ) is projected to slowly go back down in the next couple of years.\n\nOther numbers that came in on Friday were [Factory ORDERS](https://ibb.co/xm7JJ2Q) which came in better than expected at +1%. While a new Redfin report indicates an increase in [average home prices](https://ibb.co/pXYNGcz) year over year of 16% with the number of pending home [sales up](https://ibb.co/2nw00m3) almost 30% over last year while new listings of home sales is [up just 9%](https://ibb.co/v3nyLPZ) since 2019 and dropping rather fast in the last months with sales of homes going for all time-high [prices](https://ibb.co/gmvRPd7) at 99,5% of the asking price as the real estate market keeps booming along.\n\nThe other number that came in on Friday and was not so good was the [trade deficit](https://ibb.co/42nsy2W), which widened even more in the last month by almost $2B.\n\nSo next week is again pretty slow in [earnings reports](https://ibb.co/Xkr4f4P) with the most interesting ones on being Chewy, GameStop, Adobe, LuluLemon, Dave&amp;Busters, Costco, Oracle and Broadcom.\n\nI own a small stake in all of them except Oracle and GameStop. I don\u2019t see such a big growth opportunity with Oracle while GameStop I believe will struggle to turn around the business with very though e-commerce competition.\n\nWe will also have a number of new [IPOs](https://ibb.co/0jQWwTf) this week from DoorDash, AirBNB, C3.ai, Hydrofarm and Pubmatic. The first 3 are more interesting for myself but I will only take a first look at AirBNB and at what price that stock goes public to maybe get some action, I think we will a much bigger price than the 44-50$ price range to begin with for public trading. I also expect the same thing to happen with DoorDash which has already raised the IPO [pricing](https://ibb.co/Y8VSCpV) to 90-95$ but I am not very interested to buy that stock, as this type of economy has hugely benefited them and it might see a decrease rather than an increase in the next couple of years.\n\nSo, guys I still believe the stock market has upside in front of it, especially in the next 2 years, but you should tread careful for now, I think a possible correction might be just ahead before we move on higher, as you can see in this [CHART](https://ibb.co/9g0bJdj), a wedge formation is continuing to from with more and more tension, I believe there is about a 6,5% possible downside to the market at the moment before eventually getting back on track next year and going toward the 4000 level. And especially with the most recent jobless numbers in the US, I would try to diversify a little more especially with some EAST-ASIA exposure in countries like South Korea, Singapore and China also.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "I am absolutely devastated. I had 39 AVGO 390c 12/18-12/24 Calendar Spreads. They were extremely ITM so essentially worthless. They also expired tomorrow and additionally, AVGO's ex-dividend day is tomorrow so Robinhood informed me to close the position to avoid assignment.\n\nI attempted to sell the position for the LOWEST possible price. 1 cent per spread. However, because these options had 0 volume, it was not even possible to do that. I couldn't just sell them for 0 cents either. I also couldn't just exercise both options to \"delete\" the spread. Basically, I was stuck holding.\n\nOk, I figured my options would just be assigned tomorrow and all disappear. NOPE. Robinhood, at EOD, forced my individual options to be closed, despite the fact that the short options actually cost MORE than the long options, likely because of shitty bid-ask spreads from extremely low volume. I check my phone after market close to find my account balance had gone from over $800 to -$1200.\n\nTL:DR, Robinhood sold my worthless calendar spreads for less than -$0.50 per spread. Robinhood won't let me take a screenshot of my trading history. I've messaged the support team but I'm highly skeptical they'll cover my $2000. I don't know how it's possibly legal though to force my spreads to sell for a negative value. All I know is I'm fucking destroyed.",

        "selftext": "Gather round you hopeless autists. We have to talk. Listen to me you hopeless stupid fucking retards.  \nThe only reason I am not posting this on r/investing is because you asstards need help. There is some  \nserious chicken fucking tendies to be made here.  \nI'm the guy who famously claimed that Bob Swan, Intel CEO, should fabricate a silicone butt and fuck it  \nduring Intel's next earning call to appease stock holders instead of going over their financials. (See: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j6ioot/intel\\_is\\_fucked/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j6ioot/intel_is_fucked/)) As it turns out, I was right and Bob Swan showed everyone how much of a dipshit he really is and how he literally knows nothing about this industry. I doubled my principal on my last Intel put and I plan to do the same with my next more here.  \nFirst, let us a take a good look at what happened to intel. There is so much wrong with that company and I talked about it a lot in my last post. This analyst, Stacy Rasgon, who actually seems to have a basic understanding of this shit, sums it up fairly well. Click the fucking link asshole. Listen to him.  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzTg6vWgDhQ  \nSo what do we have here:  \n  \"If you start digging in, theres almost no good news here. Gross margins have collapsed.\"  \n  \"This is the beginning of the bear thesis which seems to be embedded in the numbers here.\"  \n  \"Current trajectory of the business does not look good.\"  \nJesus Christ. Should have gone with the silicone butt bobby. Intel is ACTUALLY on fire. So what the fuck does intel plan to do about it? Bob Swan said himself on the earnings call that he wants to go with TSMC. Interesting choice Bobby Boy. Interesting because for once this is not a bad decision. But WHY would Bob Swan want to go with TSMC?  \nTSMC is perhaps the most strategically important company in the world right now. The American government has dramatically increased military operations with Taiwan.   \nOne very critical point that the average wsb idiot misses is that TSMC is only a foundry. Because of this they can focus only on improving their chip-manufacturing and not have to worry at all about selling/marketing the chips. Some of the major customers of TSMC are \\[3\\]:  \n\n\n* AMD\n* Apple (25% of TSMC revenue)\n* Broadcom\n* Marvell\n* MediaTek\n* Nvidia\n* Qualcomm\n* Xilinx\n\nSoon intel as well. Simply put, if any one of those companies above do well then TSMC wins. Their financials are perfect, they are the world leaders in their covid-proof industry, the only fab with a 5nm process and have a ton of massive customers for whom they have great relationships with (they built and bankrolled a new fabrication center just for Apple for fucks sake). If you pay close attention to this stuff, you may have heard how Nvidia recently went to Samsung for fabrication, yeah, Nvidia backtracked quickly on that and they are going back to TSMC due to Samsungs shit yields \\[4\\].\n\n  \n**Stop massaging your wife's boyfriend's vas deferens and listen up.** The American government  \nis currently preparing for a war with china over TSMC. The US is rapidly heading from a cold to a hot war with China. Some experts, such as Niall Furgeson, a well respected Stanford historian is already calling it \"Cold War 2\" \\[7\\].  \nThere is a video you must watch on this topic. It is produced by a Chinese-Hating-Korean-Trump-Supporter but it is most primary sources from China and it sums up quite well the China internal sentiment on this issue. (Click it you fucking autist):  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2uP\\_8YoJTU&amp;ab\\_channel=KoreanaJones  \nWell, shit. So here we are:\n\n* The US can no longer fabricate semiconductors, only Taiwan can.\n* America will do everything is can as a matter of national security to protect TSMC.\n* USA bans China's only serious semi conductor fabricator SMIC. \\[5\\]\n* USA bans anyone from doing business with Chinese tech firms like Huawei. TSMC even confirmed AGAIN they will not fabricate for Huawei. \\[6\\]\n* Taiwan HATES China so they don't actually even want to work with their shitty fake tech companies.\n* Semiconductors are critical to a modern economy/military. (Xi JinPing has said this himself.)\n* Taiwan's military is a joke compared to China's so they will do everything to appease the Americans  \n  for the survival of their nation.\n* Hong Kong proved to the world, especially Taiwan, that China has zero interest in honoring any governance agreements made. This raises the stakes for Taiwan dramatically as a cooperation with China means a complete erasure of their culture and history.\n* ASML, the people who make the machines for TSMC, are a German company. Unsurprisingly, Germany has taken a similar stance, including military aid, for Taiwan. ASML is a \"crown jewel\" for Germany and they make a shit ton supporting TSMC.\n\n  \nSo what is the bear case for a company that is at the heart of US/Taiwan/Germany/Europe national security interests? A company which is ACTUALLY technologically superior to their competition and is basically the only game in town?  \nThe bear case is potential war with China. But if that happens your positions are going to shit anyway.\n\n**Options (Wish I bought more):**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r9uchpxpd0561.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ba1bc3a98783399ddfe80637b527ceb032ec742\n\n  \n**Stocks:**\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knuge7gsd0561.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b72bd468a5e77f97a423835eaaf2e87b6c1d8275\n\n**References**\n\n1.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 4, 2020**\n\nStocks hit record levels again today despite disappointing data on job creation in November. The DOW and S&amp;P 500 each hit a record-high intraday, led by energy and financial stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA) finished the day 0.8% up, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.84%, and the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.41% up.\n\nYesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Pfizer (PFE) is experiencing supply chain issues that could result in only half of the estimated vaccines entering distribution. Pfizer, along with partner BioNTech (BNTX) announced plans to ship 50 million vaccines by year-end, half of the 100 million doses previously expected. The company says it still anticipates delivering over 1 billion doses by the end of 2021.\n\nToday, the Labor Department released their November jobs report, which showed the slowest pace of job growth since April\u2019s record spike in unemployment. Non-farm payrolls grew by just 245,000, much lower than the 460,000 expected. The deceleration in recovery is likely due to the record spike in infections this month and the reimposition of certain restrictions across the United States. However, it is important to note that recent job data has surprised to the upside. The weekly unemployment reported released yesterday showed the first drop in new unemployment claims in three weeks.\n\nAs market participants and economist upgrade their estimates for 2021, many believe that cyclical and rotation stocks, like energy, financial, and reopening stocks,  that were hardest hit by the pandemic will extend gains into next year. Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual said, \u201cAs you move into 2021, there will be broader economic growth, it will be more inclusive, you will see continued fiscal stimulus \u2013 I do believe we will get a package. You\u2019ll see the Fed continue. You have pent-up demand. Think about the rotation that we\u2019ve been talking about \u2026 it\u2019s underway right now and it will continue into 2021. Think value, think small-cap, think emerging markets.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the United States once again set single-day records for new infections and deaths yesterday. According to Johns Hopkins University, there were more 211,762 new cases and 2,858 deaths reported yesterday, overtaking the previous record of 205,000 new infections and 2,760 deaths set yesterday. California Governor Gavin Newsom announced he would impose extremely strict stay-at-home orders when intensive care units reach less than 15% availability, which he expects to happen soon.

        "selftext": "**DoorDash just went public in a crazy overvalued IPO, AirBNB will follow today. Today we get earnings from Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco &amp; more. Let\u2019s talk about this and everything about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/bzmy8C4) drop almost 2% and suffering its biggest loss since October after the 4-day win streak, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Kw3DKxD) also dropped .80% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/9GvPGh5) did much better, down just .35% for the day. We saw a huge spike in the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/RcShWPM) of over 7% closing at the highest level since the 23rd of November.\n\nWe saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/YkqyTgh) as finally some stocks have started to move below the moving averages on about average volume for the day.\n\nWe saw most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/Wfn4Trj) in the red yesterday as Tech and Communications suffered the most dropping more than 1% for the day, with small gains being made in just the Industrials, Energy and Materials sectors as Growth companies suffered the most [yesterday](https://ibb.co/5hQKP88), especially the Large-Caps as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/V9bfV71), with all the big FAANG names and other big tech companies being deep in the red as Apple, Amazon, and Netflix dropped more than 2% for the day, while FB, Google and Microsoft also lost over 1%, but the big loser yesterday was Tesla losing 7% for the day.\n\nToday we will get some critical economic [data](https://ibb.co/qnkdTJz), and if this disappoints, we might see another big drop in the stock market, as the jobless claims will start us off in the early morning.\n\nAlongside this economic data, today the [FDA](https://ibb.co/0906d6L) may approve the emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine, that could lead to a vaccine rollout starting next week. This might help the markets have a more positive reaction if the FDA grants the authorization.\n\nOne good thing in my opinion is that the most recent [survey](https://ibb.co/5WPhj8B) from the AAII showed a slight decrease in Bullish and Neutral investors while the Bearish camp gained more than 4% in the last week.\n\nInvestors had gotten very bullish in the last weeks and this usually is a contrarian indicator, so seeing this small drop is a good thing to see, as I want more and more people to start feeling bearish so I can find and buy stocks at more attractive prices than the current ones. So, the more bearish people get, the more I like to get on and buy stocks. But still\u2026 there is to much of a concentration in the bull\u2019s camp so we might have to wait a little, for more fear to appear in the stock market.\n\nPositive indicators also popped up yesterday as Wholesale [invetories](https://ibb.co/WxPPLpS) rose more than expected in October, as this led the Atlanta FED to maintain they\u2019re Q4 GDP [estimates](https://ibb.co/SBZPtZP), while [Goldman](https://ibb.co/sQ42gCg) also thinks the economy will recover faster than expected starting with Q4 and going on next year.\n\nWhile on the jobs front, October job opening came in [better](https://ibb.co/4VdrTbQ) than expected at over 6,6M, as the job opening rate stood at 6,7% while the quits rate at just 2,2%.\n\nSo, DoorDash went live [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LJtbPtH) at 182$ which is insane in my opinion, the current price gives the company a [valuation](https://ibb.co/kcBcpYW) of over $70B, more than 4 times what the company raised at the last private fundraising six months ago. This valuation is higher than Chipotle, Yum Brands, Domino\u2019s and many others from the food industry.\n\nAnd by the way, don\u2019t forget the stock is [trading](https://ibb.co/CP0Qgbr) at over 30 times sales of this year, which were hugely boosted by the current situation, and that food delivery is really hard for any company, especially one that expects to grow to have a share of more than 50% of the entire world in the sector so that it can justify the current valuation.\n\nOne of the biggest gainers from this is SoftBank as they have a big stake in the company. The shares of SoftBank [skyrocketed](https://ibb.co/GnTSqJf) yesterday to new highs in almost two decades. Like almost every time, the biggest gainers in this IPOs are the banks and not us the retail investors.\n\nWith the other big [IPO](https://ibb.co/Ld0pMdz) yesterday being C3.ai which also opened way above the IPO price, as investors can\u2019t get enough of this stock\u2019s, I don\u2019t think this is a healthy hype for this type of IPOs, investors expect every new company to just skyrocket but, not all of them will, and paying such a high premium is not worth it most time, better wait for a pullback before getting some action on these stocks.\n\nToday we will see [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/Hxd70Tb) go public, as the valuation for this company also gets higher and higher, as they have started selling shares for 68$ even higher than the latest targeted price between 56-60$. And if DoorDash is any [indication](https://ibb.co/8cb3yTs), I don\u2019t think we will be able to get our hands on this stock below 100$. Way above my 70-80$ max price that I am willing to pay, so I am going to wait this out also until they have a pullback, maybe once the first earnings come out, that will be the case. But if somehow the IPO is under 80$ and especially under 70$ I would be willing to get some action.\n\nSome other [news](https://ibb.co/H4Pxqmq) from the stock market which pushed companies like Facebook lower came in when almost every US state filed a lawsuit against the company. In the long run, if this happens just like with the Google lawsuit, the sum of the parts of the company is bigger than the company itself, so I don\u2019t really have any worries long-term about Facebook or Google, as they are the 2 of the biggest advertising platforms in the world.\n\nWhile [REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/0X85Cb4) is starting to make a small comeback in New York, as leases jumped 30% year over year in November to around 4000 new ones, but it will still take a very long time before things go back to where they stood before this year.\n\nAlso, we will have a lot of earnings results today as [Oracle](https://ibb.co/jb5CPPV), Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco, Broadcom and others report.\n\nI expect [Lululemon](https://ibb.co/J2MBWD2) to beat the estimates and the stock to regain momentum after it has struggled since the beginning of September. And just like analysts from Raymond James [said](https://ibb.co/gFL3T0s), the only underlying story problem for investors it\u2019s the valuation, but this will soon go away, as people will buy this brand even more once the reopening begins.\n\nLikewise, [Dave &amp; Buster's](https://ibb.co/L0rY2YS) may have smaller loses than expected last quarter as restaurants weren\u2019t hit so badly like before or like this quarter.\n\nWhile [BROADCOM](https://ibb.co/b5kYKLB) stands to benefit a lot from the recent move in semiconductor industry especially for data centers that stands to benefit them a lot.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/D19qrSc) will also report earnings after the close, and is expected to show over 14% growth in eps and revenues since last year, as they are one of the best retailers to own as a shareholder, even if they always trade at a premium.\n\nAdobe just released earnings while writing this post and here are the excelent results that the company [posted](https://ibb.co/kyzBLjv). Now let's see how the stock reacts, will it go down or up?\n\nSo, guys, don\u2019t forget not to panic sell when you see a big red day in the markets, just look at this Wells Fargo [chart](https://ibb.co/yQwKpt0).\n\nInvestors who added 30% more exposure to equities, and took the money from investment-grade fixed income largely outperform the rest of the investors, while the average investor who does a quarterly rebalancing also did very good and is still up over 10% for the year, while investors who reduced the equity exposure by 50% and put that money into fixed income or kept it in cash are up just 2%. With by far the worst results seen in investors who removed all of the exposure to equities, they are down 6% for the year.\n\nJust be patient, trust the companies that you like and keep investing every time you can. In the long-run markets will always go UP &amp; UP.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "**The latest jobless numbers came in bad while the stock market keeps pushing forward, is a stock market crash coming soon? Let\u2019s talk about this and the latest stock market news**\n\nHey everyone! So let\u2019s start with the recap off Friday as we saw the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HD8WbDT) leading the way up 0,88%, with the [DOW Industrial](https://ibb.co/sCt0FJj) close behind up 0,83% and the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/dDhWbBG) also gaining a decent amount, up 0,7% with all 3 big indexes closing at all-time highs.\n\nWe saw more than \u00be of the [stocks](https://ibb.co/CB6cSMn) advancing despite below average volume as companies either small, mid or large cap value or growth [stocks](https://ibb.co/qCNqN5G) were gaining except large-cap growth.\n\nThe best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/d6f58Mf) were Energy and Materials up over 2% while Utilities finished 1% down on Friday, as Utilities were the only sector to finish the week losing significant ground, with Consumer Discretionary also dropping just 0,12%. With the rest of the sectors in the green, Energy, Health Care, Technology and Communication being the biggest gainers finishing the week up over 2%.\n\n[Utilities](https://ibb.co/Bz8TnvP) have been hit hard in the last year as residential consumers and small businesses have been able to defer paying power bills, this will continue to hold down the sector for now with the debt still increasing.\n\nThe VIX also dropped more than 2% on [Friday](https://ibb.co/18qjBx7) and finished the [week](https://ibb.co/7KyfPxQ) over 5% down as the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/sKhhfx6) from Friday shows us that there were plenty of gains to be made especially in the Energy Sectors as well as Financials, with the big companies from the Tech and Communication sectors doing worse than the rest of the market.\n\nFor the week though this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/92hRtQL) shows that Apple was one of the biggest gainers alongside Semiconductors and Energy Names while Health Care companies like JNJ and Pfizer also did very good.\n\nThe big indexes all finished higher for the [week](https://ibb.co/b3Gb4HN) with the SP500 up 1,7%, the Nasdaq Composite up 2,1% and the Dow up 1% with renewed hopes for a stimulus package being back on the table.\n\nHere are the most interesting economic [reports](https://ibb.co/j84CkLT) for next week, it will be a light week in terms of economic data but still, the market may be volatile and trends may change depending on some of the results.\n\nSo, on Friday [November JOBS](https://ibb.co/r0JPtCs) came in much lower than anticipated, coming in at 245K vs de 610K in October and 469K estimated while the unemployment [rate](https://ibb.co/M9mNBMT) dropped to 6,7% a bit better than expected and down from 6,9% in the past month. Still there are over 10million people unemployed, this number more than doubling since the start on February. The [net addition](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) of jobs in November was the [smallest](https://ibb.co/dWKmZWH) since May as government jobs were the [worst performing](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) while transportation and warehousing jobs continue to increase, as big companies \u2026 aka Amazon has hired almost 3thousand people per day this year. But the bad news is that [long-term](https://ibb.co/HFZFhyC) unemployment is approaching the peaks from the Great Recession and that is not good news for the economy or the stock market as over 3,9 million people have been out of work for at least 6 months.\n\nSo, this is pretty bad news as mortgages in [forbearance](https://ibb.co/NLcDmYP) just slightly declined this week, by just 39K with more and more plans planned to expire in December, over 1M more exactly, more than 40% of active cases.\n\nThis may finally put some extra pressure on the Congress to agree to a relief package maybe even passing it alongside the government [funding bill](https://ibb.co/1qkTnsD) that is still debated and has over 300 issues that the parties don\u2019t agree on.\n\nThis is becoming more and more obvious as [cases](https://ibb.co/6y9FTjV) in the US continue to rise, coming in over 200k in the last 2 days and the economy will soon feel the pressure from this, I expect the next month or two of economic data to not be so good, this may be the time the market sees a 5-10% correction before moving on higher on more positive things like the availability of the vaccine, the passing of the torch In the Presidency and a possible relief package.\n\nYes, this will continue to add to the [US DEBT](https://ibb.co/QjSPcdB), but even though I don\u2019t have any partisan views, a good structured relief bill would do wonders for the economy as a bridge to when the vaccine will finally be widely available.\n\nYes, I know that the global debt is set to reach $200 trillion but the DEBT-to-GDP [ratio](https://ibb.co/LhWkxKJ) is projected to slowly go back down in the next couple of years.\n\nOther numbers that came in on Friday were [Factory ORDERS](https://ibb.co/xm7JJ2Q) which came in better than expected at +1%. While a new Redfin report indicates an increase in [average home prices](https://ibb.co/pXYNGcz) year over year of 16% with the number of pending home [sales up](https://ibb.co/2nw00m3) almost 30% over last year while new listings of home sales is [up just 9%](https://ibb.co/v3nyLPZ) since 2019 and dropping rather fast in the last months with sales of homes going for all time-high [prices](https://ibb.co/gmvRPd7) at 99,5% of the asking price as the real estate market keeps booming along.\n\nThe other number that came in on Friday and was not so good was the [trade deficit](https://ibb.co/42nsy2W), which widened even more in the last month by almost $2B.\n\nSo next week is again pretty slow in [earnings reports](https://ibb.co/Xkr4f4P) with the most interesting ones on being Chewy, GameStop, Adobe, LuluLemon, Dave&amp;Busters, Costco, Oracle and Broadcom.\n\nI own a small stake in all of them except Oracle and GameStop. I don\u2019t see such a big growth opportunity with Oracle while GameStop I believe will struggle to turn around the business with very though e-commerce competition.\n\nWe will also have a number of new [IPOs](https://ibb.co/0jQWwTf) this week from DoorDash, AirBNB, C3.ai, Hydrofarm and Pubmatic. The first 3 are more interesting for myself but I will only take a first look at AirBNB and at what price that stock goes public to maybe get some action, I think we will a much bigger price than the 44-50$ price range to begin with for public trading. I also expect the same thing to happen with DoorDash which has already raised the IPO [pricing](https://ibb.co/Y8VSCpV) to 90-95$ but I am not very interested to buy that stock, as this type of economy has hugely benefited them and it might see a decrease rather than an increase in the next couple of years.\n\nSo, guys I still believe the stock market has upside in front of it, especially in the next 2 years, but you should tread careful for now, I think a possible correction might be just ahead before we move on higher, as you can see in this [CHART](https://ibb.co/9g0bJdj), a wedge formation is continuing to from with more and more tension, I believe there is about a 6,5% possible downside to the market at the moment before eventually getting back on track next year and going toward the 4000 level. And especially with the most recent jobless numbers in the US, I would try to diversify a little more especially with some EAST-ASIA exposure in countries like South Korea, Singapore and China also.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 7th, 2020.\n\n# **Any progress on stimulus could give the market a boost in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/stimulus-hope-markets-focus-next-week.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stimulus to help the economy and vaccines to stop the virus are expected to the be the main focus in markets in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Efforts to move along a fiscal package in Congress picked up momentum in the past week with Congressional leaders sounding conciliatory, and a bi-partisan group of senators pushing their own $900 billion proposal.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt probably boils down to how much [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell is willing to deal, and I don\u2019t know what the answer is to that,\u201d said Mike Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to happen, next week is the week. The government runs out of money on Friday. Congress has to come up with a funding scheme.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists have said the two events could be tied, but Congress could also push through a spending resolution without including stimulus. Some programs will expire at the end of the month, if Congress does not provide funding, including unemployment benefits for millions of Americans.\n*****\n&gt; The on again, off again stimulus talks have led to skepticism in the market, and sets it up for a move higher if there is anything officially announced. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s fully baked in. I would say the stimulus is a positive catalyst, unless it\u2019s less than $900 billion,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.\n*****\n&gt; While stocks surged in the past week, bond yields also moved higher. Yields move opposite price, and bond yields have been rising on stimulus expectations. More spending means more debt, and that sends rates higher.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year was at 0.97% Friday, and appeared ready to move back to the 1% level for the first time since March.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIs it the case here, stimulus is already factored in, and will people take their money and run?\u201d said Schumacher.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.7% in the past week, ending Friday at 3,699, a record high. The Dow also ended up 1% at a record 30,218, and Nasdaq gained 2.1% to a record 12,464.\n*****\n&gt; # Getting jabbed\n&gt; Vaccine news has been a catalyst for the market\u2019s surge since early November, when Pfizer first revealed the high efficacy of its vaccine. Since then Moderna and Astra-Zeneca both revealed results of their own vaccines.\n*****\n&gt; A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee meets Thursday on emergency use authorization for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey\u2019re starting to roll it out in the U.K, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to be watched here to see how it unfolds,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist Prudential Financial. \u201cThat\u2019s the next issue for the market. The deliveries, the distributions. Are people being jabbed? These are all questions the market is concerned about about because they\u2019re looking forward to it unrolling smoothly in the U.S.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 3 million people will be vaccinated in the initial rollout. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is expected to be approved the following week, and by year-end both vaccines are expected to reach 20 million people in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe vaccine news has started to see a bit of diminishing return in terms of its wow factor,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some volatility around the logistics.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the virus remains in the forefront for the market because of the continuing spread and its economic impact as activities are shut down. California Thursday announced new restrictions with stay at home advisories in some regions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe big question is how long does the Covid surge last?\u201d Krosby said.\n*****\n&gt; The virus shutdowns appear to be behind a slowdown in the labor market, and economists say it could slow activity into the first quarter. November job growth of 245,000 was about 200,000 less than expected. That makes Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims more important for markets.\n*****\n&gt; There is also CPI and PPI inflation data Thursday and Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere is this push pull in the market regarding inflationary pressures,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cIt\u2019s not expected, which is why if it does print higher, it could ignite the conversation regarding inflation.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PZEBIS8.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ypJI3Vy.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/s01kzjN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/7Y1RKiX.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nF9LHWm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/F99YkSI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/00G6LqZ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8OK0Nmw.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tgMnGUY.png))**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PDrxDY8.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5rCf9oe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/VsZzlKU.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/moiEQsJ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks and Bonds Both in Rally Mode\n\n&gt; When it comes to equity market performance in a given month, it doesn't get much better than November. While the S&amp;P 500's total return of 10.95% in the month was only the second-best monthly performance of the year, it was still enough to rank as the third-best month for the S&amp;P 500 in the last thirty years and just the ninth month since 1980 that it was up 10%+.\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the S&amp;P 500's annualized total return over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares the current returns to the historical average. For the last year, the S&amp;P 500's total return has been 17.5% which is nearly six full percentage points higher than the historical average. For the last two years, the annualized return has been nearly as strong at 16.8%, and it is actually even stronger relative to the historical average of 10.5%. Moving further out the time horizon, the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns drift lower, and while the five and ten-year annualized returns are greater than average, the S&amp;P 500's annualized gain of 7.3% in the last 20 years is more than 3.5 percentage points below the historical average of 10.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-SP-500-Act-vs-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; The last couple of years haven't just been strong for equities. Over the last year, long-term US Treasuries, as measured by the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year US Treasury Index, have rallied 15.7%, which is more than six full percentage points greater than the historical average of 9.5%. Over the last two years, returns have been even stronger with an annualized gain of nearly 20%, or more than double the historical average of 9.1%! While the last two years have been strong for US Treasuries, the last five, ten, and twenty years have all seen returns of between one and two percentage points below their historical average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120LT-Treas-Act-vs-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; Lately, when you see rallies in the equity market, it tends to be accompanied by a decline in treasuries as yields rise. In November, though, that wasn't the case. Even with the S&amp;P 500 up 10.95%, long-term US Treasuries rallied just over 1%. So how uncommon is it for stocks to rally like they did in November while bonds also rally. Actually, it is not very uncommon at all. The table below shows the nine months since 1980 where the S&amp;P 500's total return in a given month was 10% or more, and of those months, long-term treasuies also rallied in every month but one (October 2011).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-Stocks-Up-10.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Manufacturer Recovery Continues\n\n&gt; This morning, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released a less positive outlook for the US manufacturing sector. The headline number for ISM's Manufacturing index fell from 59.3 last month down to 57.5. A drop was expected, but the actual results were worse than the drop to 58.0 that had been forecasted. That reading indicates that the manufacturing sector continued to grow in November but at a slower rate than October.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; Similar to the various Federal Reserve bank surveys from around the country, breadth in the November report was more negative than in recent months. Of the ten indices excluding the headline number, only three were higher in November: Backlog Orders, Supplier Deliveries, and Export Orders. Additionally, two indices\u2014Customer Inventories and Employment\u2014showed contractionary readings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Table1.png))**\n\n&gt; One theme of the report was that orders remain very healthy. New Orders fell from 67.9 to 65.1, but that is a sixth consecutive month of expansionary readings. Although the index was lower this month, meaning new order growth decelerated, it remains in the top decile of historical readings. As new orders have continued to grow, so too have backlogs. The index for Backlog Orders has continued to press higher, rising to 56.9 from 55.7. That is in the 88th percentile of all months and is now at the highest level since August of 2018. Demand continues to improve with new orders coming in at a historically strong pace, even though it is slower than last month, and order backlogs have once again risen as a result.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Orders.png))**\n\n&gt; As new order growth decelerated, so too did production. The index fell from 63.0 in October to 60.8 last month. That is still consistent with growth (readings above 50) in production but at the slowest rate since June. One factor that potentially had an impact on the slowdown in production is issues with suppliers. The index for Supplier Deliveries rose for the fourth month in a row in November and reached the highest level since May. Higher readings in the Supplier Deliveries index indicates longer lead times and vice versa. In other words, products from suppliers have been taking longer to reach manufacturers, in turn, impacting productivity.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Prod-Supp.png))**\n\n&gt; Although suppliers appear to have some constraints and production has slowed slightly, business inventories rose for the second month in a row even as more and more firms report that customer inventories are too low. The index for Customer Inventories now sits in the bottom 2% of historical readings after dropping another 0.4 points in November. At 36.3, the index is at the lowest level since June of 2010. That low reading can be considered positive for future production.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Inventorie.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Gains In November Steal From Santa\n\n&gt; What a month November was! Here are some of the highlights:\n\n&gt; * Best month for Dow since January 1987 (11.9%) and best November since 1928\n&gt; * Best month ever for the STOXX 600 (16.7%)\n&gt; * Best month ever for the Russell 2000 (18.3%)\n&gt; * Best month for the S&amp;P 500 (10.8%) and Nasdaq (11.8%) since April 2020\n&gt; * Best month for Dow Transports since October 2011 (12.1%)\n&gt; * Best month from PHLX Semiconductor Index since March 2003 (18.4%)\n&gt; * Best month for Industrials (16.0%) and Financials (16.8%) since April 2009\n&gt; * Second best month ever for energy (28.0%)\n\n&gt; A way better than expected earnings season, a likely split Congress, and major breakthroughs on the vaccine front all helped stocks soar last month,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAdd ongoing support from the Federal Reserve as the cherry on top and we are looking at a truly historic month on many levels.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s all the Dow monthly returns since 1900. Last month was the best return since January 1987. Now before you go out and sell because you see 1987, remember the S&amp;P 500 added another 20% the seven months after the huge gains in early 1987.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It was the best November for the S&amp;P 500 since November 1928.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Small caps soared on the likelihood of taxes staying lower due to a divided Congress and vaccine progress, with the Russell 2000 adding more than 18% for the best month ever, topping the previous record from February 2000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What happens after a big month? Well, history says a 10% monthly gain is quite bullish. In fact, we had a 10% plus rally back in April 2020 and shared this same chart at that time. Sure enough, returns have been strong this time around as well. \u201cThe bottom line is the huge gains in November could actually be the start of something much stronger,\u201d according to Ryan Detrick. \u201cAlso, this was the second month of 2020 with a 10% gain. The only other year to do that? 1982, which kicked off a historic bull market.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Turning to December, this month is widely known to be quite bullish, as Santa comes to town, people feel good, and stocks tend to do well. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1950, December has been the second best month of the year, with only November better. December had been the best month of the year until the historic 9.2% drop in 2018. As a result, December hasn\u2019t been quite as strong over the past 10 and 20 years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Breaking it down even more, a big rally in November can potentially steal some of December\u2019s thunder. As after a 5% or 10% rally in November, the returns in December are more muted. The flipside to this though is if the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 10% for the year (like 2020), then stocks have benefited from some performance chasing and have tended to do better.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What does it all mean? After the historic move in November we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see below average returns in December. We do believe this is a new bull market and lasting economic cycle of growth, but overall sentiment is getting quite stretched and this increases the potential for some near-term weakness.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, December 14, 2020**\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones pulled back Monday, with market participants closely monitoring the rollout of Pfizer\u2019s (PFE) vaccine in the US and stimulus negotiations in Washington. The tech-heavy Nasdaq outperformed the other indices, finishing the day roughly 0.5% up. \n\nOver the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s coronavirus vaccine for use in individuals aged 16 and older. Distribution of the vaccine is scheduled to start today and will prioritize frontline health care workers and nursing-home residents. . In response to the vaccine news, analysts at Bank of America said, \u201cWith the vaccine now shipping, we expect greater reaction from the broader market over the potential return to normal. However, we caution much work remains to vaccine the population and don\u2019t expect to see major progress until mid-2021.\u201d In order to safely and fully reopen the economy and return to some semblance of normalcy, a safe and efficient vaccine is required. That said, widespread distribution of the vaccine is likely to take a few months, so until then we must all continue to do our part to flatten the curve. , Dr. Robert Redfield, the Director of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) said, \u201cThe reality is December and January and February are going to be rough times. I actually believe they\u2019re going to be the most difficult in the public health history of this nation, largely because of the stress that\u2019s going to be put on our health-care system.\u201d\n\nModerna\u2019s (MRNA) vaccine, which uses similar technology to Pfizer\u2019s, is under review with the FDA as well and could be granted authorization in the coming days. The company first filed its request for emergency use authorization in late November, about one week after Pfizer\u2019s request. The U.S. government on Friday said it doubled its orders of Moderna\u2019s vaccine to 200 million.\n\nToday, a group of bipartisan lawmakers unveiled the specific language of their $908 billion stimulus package proposed last week. The proposal will be composed of two different bills. One will include $748 billion for the vaccine rollout, aid for small businesses, and enhanced unemployment benefits. The $160 billion proposal includes aid for state and local governments and liability protections for businesses. Here at Psycho, we think it is extremely unlikely any sort that any sort of stimulus will pass through the Senate until after Georgia\u2019s election and the Biden Administration takes power.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* After a monster day on Friday, Disney (DIS) pulled back around 3.5% today. \n* NIO recently signed an agreement with a state-woned electric grid company in China to construct 100 battery charging and swapping station in 2021.\n* More than a dozen Google services, including Gmail and YouTube, were experiencing issues Monday morning, interrupting access for individuals and businesses.\n* United Health Group target raised by SVB Leerik from $378 to $390 OUTPERFORM. Stock currently around $330s.\n* Marathon Patent Group (MARA) target raised by HC Wainwright from $7.50 to $9 BUY. Stock currently around $5.50.\n* Fedex (FDX) target raised by Credit Suisse from $322 to $365 at OUTPERFORM. Stock currently around $295.\n* Broadcom (AVGO) target raised by Argus from $400 to $460. This one has many analysts upgrades in the two weeks, keep an eye out. Stock currently around $410.\n* MindMed, (MMED), a OTC company we featured in our weekly newsletter is up 35% today!!! Amazing gain. Company is at the cutting edge of developing therapies using psychedelics. Compass Pathways (CMPD) is another company in this industry, IPOd in September. Company recently filed for inclusion into the New York Stock Exchange\n* Anthem (ANTM) target raised by SVB Leerik from $370 to $400 at OUTPERFORM. Stock currently around $300\n* Ambarella (AMBA) target raised by Morgan Stanley (MS) from $83 to $98 at OVERWEIGHT, Stock currently around $88.\n\n\u201cYou will face many defeats in life, but never let yourself be defeated.\u201d - Maya Angelou",

        "selftext": "**The latest jobless numbers came in bad while the stock market keeps pushing forward, is a stock market crash coming soon? Let\u2019s talk about this and the latest stock market news**\n\nHey everyone! So let\u2019s start with the recap off Friday as we saw the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HD8WbDT) leading the way up 0,88%, with the [DOW Industrial](https://ibb.co/sCt0FJj) close behind up 0,83% and the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/dDhWbBG) also gaining a decent amount, up 0,7% with all 3 big indexes closing at all-time highs.\n\nWe saw more than \u00be of the [stocks](https://ibb.co/CB6cSMn) advancing despite below average volume as companies either small, mid or large cap value or growth [stocks](https://ibb.co/qCNqN5G) were gaining except large-cap growth.\n\nThe best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/d6f58Mf) were Energy and Materials up over 2% while Utilities finished 1% down on Friday, as Utilities were the only sector to finish the week losing significant ground, with Consumer Discretionary also dropping just 0,12%. With the rest of the sectors in the green, Energy, Health Care, Technology and Communication being the biggest gainers finishing the week up over 2%.\n\n[Utilities](https://ibb.co/Bz8TnvP) have been hit hard in the last year as residential consumers and small businesses have been able to defer paying power bills, this will continue to hold down the sector for now with the debt still increasing.\n\nThe VIX also dropped more than 2% on [Friday](https://ibb.co/18qjBx7) and finished the [week](https://ibb.co/7KyfPxQ) over 5% down as the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/sKhhfx6) from Friday shows us that there were plenty of gains to be made especially in the Energy Sectors as well as Financials, with the big companies from the Tech and Communication sectors doing worse than the rest of the market.\n\nFor the week though this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/92hRtQL) shows that Apple was one of the biggest gainers alongside Semiconductors and Energy Names while Health Care companies like JNJ and Pfizer also did very good.\n\nThe big indexes all finished higher for the [week](https://ibb.co/b3Gb4HN) with the SP500 up 1,7%, the Nasdaq Composite up 2,1% and the Dow up 1% with renewed hopes for a stimulus package being back on the table.\n\nHere are the most interesting economic [reports](https://ibb.co/j84CkLT) for next week, it will be a light week in terms of economic data but still, the market may be volatile and trends may change depending on some of the results.\n\nSo, on Friday [November JOBS](https://ibb.co/r0JPtCs) came in much lower than anticipated, coming in at 245K vs de 610K in October and 469K estimated while the unemployment [rate](https://ibb.co/M9mNBMT) dropped to 6,7% a bit better than expected and down from 6,9% in the past month. Still there are over 10million people unemployed, this number more than doubling since the start on February. The [net addition](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) of jobs in November was the [smallest](https://ibb.co/dWKmZWH) since May as government jobs were the [worst performing](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) while transportation and warehousing jobs continue to increase, as big companies \u2026 aka Amazon has hired almost 3thousand people per day this year. But the bad news is that [long-term](https://ibb.co/HFZFhyC) unemployment is approaching the peaks from the Great Recession and that is not good news for the economy or the stock market as over 3,9 million people have been out of work for at least 6 months.\n\nSo, this is pretty bad news as mortgages in [forbearance](https://ibb.co/NLcDmYP) just slightly declined this week, by just 39K with more and more plans planned to expire in December, over 1M more exactly, more than 40% of active cases.\n\nThis may finally put some extra pressure on the Congress to agree to a relief package maybe even passing it alongside the government [funding bill](https://ibb.co/1qkTnsD) that is still debated and has over 300 issues that the parties don\u2019t agree on.\n\nThis is becoming more and more obvious as [cases](https://ibb.co/6y9FTjV) in the US continue to rise, coming in over 200k in the last 2 days and the economy will soon feel the pressure from this, I expect the next month or two of economic data to not be so good, this may be the time the market sees a 5-10% correction before moving on higher on more positive things like the availability of the vaccine, the passing of the torch In the Presidency and a possible relief package.\n\nYes, this will continue to add to the [US DEBT](https://ibb.co/QjSPcdB), but even though I don\u2019t have any partisan views, a good structured relief bill would do wonders for the economy as a bridge to when the vaccine will finally be widely available.\n\nYes, I know that the global debt is set to reach $200 trillion but the DEBT-to-GDP [ratio](https://ibb.co/LhWkxKJ) is projected to slowly go back down in the next couple of years.\n\nOther numbers that came in on Friday were [Factory ORDERS](https://ibb.co/xm7JJ2Q) which came in better than expected at +1%. While a new Redfin report indicates an increase in [average home prices](https://ibb.co/pXYNGcz) year over year of 16% with the number of pending home [sales up](https://ibb.co/2nw00m3) almost 30% over last year while new listings of home sales is [up just 9%](https://ibb.co/v3nyLPZ) since 2019 and dropping rather fast in the last months with sales of homes going for all time-high [prices](https://ibb.co/gmvRPd7) at 99,5% of the asking price as the real estate market keeps booming along.\n\nThe other number that came in on Friday and was not so good was the [trade deficit](https://ibb.co/42nsy2W), which widened even more in the last month by almost $2B.\n\nSo next week is again pretty slow in [earnings reports](https://ibb.co/Xkr4f4P) with the most interesting ones on being Chewy, GameStop, Adobe, LuluLemon, Dave&amp;Busters, Costco, Oracle and Broadcom.\n\nI own a small stake in all of them except Oracle and GameStop. I don\u2019t see such a big growth opportunity with Oracle while GameStop I believe will struggle to turn around the business with very though e-commerce competition.\n\nWe will also have a number of new [IPOs](https://ibb.co/0jQWwTf) this week from DoorDash, AirBNB, C3.ai, Hydrofarm and Pubmatic. The first 3 are more interesting for myself but I will only take a first look at AirBNB and at what price that stock goes public to maybe get some action, I think we will a much bigger price than the 44-50$ price range to begin with for public trading. I also expect the same thing to happen with DoorDash which has already raised the IPO [pricing](https://ibb.co/Y8VSCpV) to 90-95$ but I am not very interested to buy that stock, as this type of economy has hugely benefited them and it might see a decrease rather than an increase in the next couple of years.\n\nSo, guys I still believe the stock market has upside in front of it, especially in the next 2 years, but you should tread careful for now, I think a possible correction might be just ahead before we move on higher, as you can see in this [CHART](https://ibb.co/9g0bJdj), a wedge formation is continuing to from with more and more tension, I believe there is about a 6,5% possible downside to the market at the moment before eventually getting back on track next year and going toward the 4000 level. And especially with the most recent jobless numbers in the US, I would try to diversify a little more especially with some EAST-ASIA exposure in countries like South Korea, Singapore and China also.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, December 7, 2020**\n\nStocks performed mixed today, with the S&amp;P and Dow Jones pulling back while the tech-heavy Nasdaq set a new record high intraday. In the last two trading sessions, the three major indices each recorded new record-highs, with market participants optimistic of a relatively quick rollout of a vaccine and additional fiscal stimulus. \n\nLast Friday, the Labor Department released their November jobs report, which showed the slowest pace of job growth since April\u2019s record spike in unemployment. Non-farm payrolls grew by just 245,000, much lower than the 460,000 expected. The deceleration in recovery is likely due to the record spike in infections recently and the reimposition of certain restrictions across the United States. In an effort to support the economy, a bipartisan group of Senators unveiled a new stimulus proposal worth $908 billion, a sum greater than the ceiling Senate Leader Mitch McConnel (Rep.) set but below the Democrat\u2019s original $2 billion proposal. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Dem.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Dem.) have indicated they support the proposal and Senator Bill Cassidy (Rep.) told Fox News he is confident the President and Senator McConnell will support the bill. We\u2019ll have to wait and see how it plays out but we do not expect the passage of any stimulus at least until Biden\u2019s administration takes over.\n\nLooking ahead, market participants will continue to eagerly follow developments on the coronavirus vaccine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to convene its outside scientific advisory board on Thursday to discuss Pfizer\u2019s (PFE) emergency use authorization request for its vaccine. The advisors could vote as soon as that day whether to recommend that the FDA green-light the inoculation and allow the first phase of roll-outs to states. Moderna (MRNA) has also filed an emergency use authorization with the FDA. The FDA is expected to make an announcement about Moderna\u2019s vaccine sometime this week as well. \n\nDespite countless calls from health officials and politicians to stay home for Thanksgiving. According to the Transportation and Security Administration (TSA), an estimated 10 million people traveled in an airplane in the week of Thanksgiving, most likely to visit family members. It seems we are now paying the consequences, with new infections, hospitalizations, and deaths reporting several new records last week. However, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, says the full impact of Thanksgiving gatherings hasn\u2019t been seen yet. He said, \u201cThe blip from Thanksgiving isn't even here yet. So we\u2019re getting those staggering numbers of new cases and hospitalizati0ns before we even feel the full brunt of the Thanksgiving holiday\u201d. The US is nearing an average of 200,000 new daily infections. As of Sunday, there were On Sunday, there were 173,457 new infections, 101,487 hospitalized patients, the fifth consecutive day the US surpassed 100,000 hospitalizations, and 1,111 deaths (thankfully lower than the 2,800 a few days ago). \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* After underperforming last week, our PsychoPick of Hyliion (HYLN) is finally starting to perform. Never dipped below our designated stop loss. Stock up nearly 7% today.\n* A Dish Network Corp. subsidiary will pay $210 million in penalties related to alleged telemarketing violations, in a settlement with the Justice Department and four states due to unlawful telemarketing calls to consumers.\n* Tesla (TSLA) was on a tear today, up almost 7% at the time of writing, reaching new all-time highs!!!!\n* China\u2019s trade surplus hits record $75 billion as November exports surge 2.1% year-over-year, primarily propelled by American consumer demand.\n* There was a decline in European stocks following reports that Brexit talks to reach a trade deal with the European Union could collapse as soon as Mondaay, according to Yahoo Finance.\n* Targa Resources (TRGP) target raised by Royal Bank of Canada from $26 to $34 OUTPERFORM. Stock currently $26.50.\n* Kura Oncology (KURA) with two bullish target increases. Stock currently $37.\n   * Barclays from $40 to $47 at OVERWEIGH\n   * HC Wainwright from $40 to $45 BUY\n* Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) target raised by Rosenblatt Securities from $116 to $120 at BUY.

        "selftext": "**The latest jobless numbers came in bad while the stock market keeps pushing forward, is a stock market crash coming soon? Let\u2019s talk about this and the latest stock market news**\n\nHey everyone! So let\u2019s start with the recap off Friday as we saw the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HD8WbDT) leading the way up 0,88%, with the [DOW Industrial](https://ibb.co/sCt0FJj) close behind up 0,83% and the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/dDhWbBG) also gaining a decent amount, up 0,7% with all 3 big indexes closing at all-time highs.\n\nWe saw more than \u00be of the [stocks](https://ibb.co/CB6cSMn) advancing despite below average volume as companies either small, mid or large cap value or growth [stocks](https://ibb.co/qCNqN5G) were gaining except large-cap growth. \n\nThe best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/d6f58Mf) were Energy and Materials up over 2% while Utilities finished 1% down on Friday, as Utilities were the only sector to finish the week losing significant ground, with Consumer Discretionary also dropping just 0,12%. With the rest of the sectors in the green, Energy, Health Care, Technology and Communication being the biggest gainers finishing the week up over 2%.\n\n[Utilities](https://ibb.co/Bz8TnvP) have been hit hard in the last year as residential consumers and small businesses have been able to defer paying power bills, this will continue to hold down the sector for now with the debt still increasing.\n\nThe VIX also dropped more than 2% on [Friday](https://ibb.co/18qjBx7) and finished the [week](https://ibb.co/7KyfPxQ) over 5% down as the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/sKhhfx6) from Friday shows us that there were plenty of gains to be made especially in the Energy Sectors as well as Financials, with the big companies from the Tech and Communication sectors doing worse than the rest of the market.\n\nFor the week though this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/92hRtQL) shows that Apple was one of the biggest gainers alongside Semiconductors and Energy Names while Health Care companies like JNJ and Pfizer also did very good.\n\nThe big indexes all finished higher for the [week](https://ibb.co/b3Gb4HN) with the SP500 up 1,7%, the Nasdaq Composite up 2,1% and the Dow up 1% with renewed hopes for a stimulus package being back on the table.\n\nHere are the most interesting economic [reports](https://ibb.co/j84CkLT) for next week, it will be a light week in terms of economic data but still, the market may be volatile and trends may change depending on some of the results.\n\nSo, on Friday [November JOBS](https://ibb.co/r0JPtCs) came in much lower than anticipated, coming in at 245K vs de 610K in October and 469K estimated while the unemployment [rate](https://ibb.co/M9mNBMT) dropped to 6,7% a bit better than expected and down from 6,9% in the past month. Still there are over 10million people unemployed, this number more than doubling since the start on February. The [net addition](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) of jobs in November was the [smallest](https://ibb.co/dWKmZWH) since May as government jobs were the [worst performing](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) while transportation and warehousing jobs continue to increase, as big companies \u2026 aka Amazon has hired almost 3thousand people per day this year. But the bad news is that [long-term](https://ibb.co/HFZFhyC) unemployment is approaching the peaks from the Great Recession and that is not good news for the economy or the stock market as over 3,9 million people have been out of work for at least 6 months. \n\nSo, this is pretty bad news as mortgages in [forbearance](https://ibb.co/NLcDmYP) just slightly declined this week, by just 39K with more and more plans planned to expire in December, over 1M more exactly, more than 40% of active cases.\n\nThis may finally put some extra pressure on the Congress to agree to a relief package maybe even passing it alongside the government [funding bill](https://ibb.co/1qkTnsD) that is still debated and has over 300 issues that the parties don\u2019t agree on. \n\nThis is becoming more and more obvious as [cases](https://ibb.co/6y9FTjV) in the US continue to rise, coming in over 200k in the last 2 days and the economy will soon feel the pressure from this, I expect the next month or two of economic data to not be so good, this may be the time the market sees a 5-10% correction before moving on higher on more positive things like the availability of the vaccine, the passing of the torch In the Presidency and a possible relief package.\n\nYes, this will continue to add to the [US DEBT](https://ibb.co/QjSPcdB), but even though I don\u2019t have any partisan views, a good structured relief bill would do wonders for the economy as a bridge to when the vaccine will finally be widely available.\n\nYes, I know that the global debt is set to reach $200 trillion but the DEBT-to-GDP [ratio](https://ibb.co/LhWkxKJ) is projected to slowly go back down in the next couple of years.\n\nOther numbers that came in on Friday were [Factory ORDERS](https://ibb.co/xm7JJ2Q) which came in better than expected at +1%. While a new Redfin report indicates an increase in [average home prices](https://ibb.co/pXYNGcz) year over year of 16% with the number of pending home [sales up](https://ibb.co/2nw00m3) almost 30% over last year while new listings of home sales is [up just 9%](https://ibb.co/v3nyLPZ) since 2019 and dropping rather fast in the last months with sales of homes going for all time-high [prices](https://ibb.co/gmvRPd7) at 99,5% of the asking price as the real estate market keeps booming along.\n\nThe other number that came in on Friday and was not so good was the [trade deficit](https://ibb.co/42nsy2W), which widened even more in the last month by almost $2B.\n\nSo next week is again pretty slow in [earnings reports](https://ibb.co/Xkr4f4P) with the most interesting ones on being Chewy, GameStop, Adobe, LuluLemon, Dave&amp;Busters, Costco, Oracle and Broadcom.\n\nI own a small stake in all of them except Oracle and GameStop. I don\u2019t see such a big growth opportunity with Oracle while GameStop I believe will struggle to turn around the business with very though e-commerce competition.\n\nWe will also have a number of new [IPOs](https://ibb.co/0jQWwTf) this week from DoorDash, AirBNB, C3.ai, Hydrofarm and Pubmatic. The first 3 are more interesting for myself but I will only take a first look at AirBNB and at what price that stock goes public to maybe get some action, I think we will a much bigger price than the 44-50$ price range to begin with for public trading. I also expect the same thing to happen with DoorDash which has already raised the IPO [pricing](https://ibb.co/Y8VSCpV) to 90-95$ but I am not very interested to buy that stock, as this type of economy has hugely benefited them and it might see a decrease rather than an increase in the next couple of years.\n\nSo, guys I still believe the stock market has upside in front of it, especially in the next 2 years, but you should tread careful for now, I think a possible correction might be just ahead before we move on higher, as you can see in this [CHART](https://ibb.co/9g0bJdj), a wedge formation is continuing to from with more and more tension, I believe there is about a 6,5% possible downside to the market at the moment before eventually getting back on track next year and going toward the 4000 level. And especially with the most recent jobless numbers in the US, I would try to diversify a little more especially with some EAST-ASIA exposure in countries like South Korea, Singapore and China also.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 11, 2020**\n\nStocks traded mixed today, falling in the morning before reversing in the last few hours of the session as prospects for a near-term stimulus bill further dimmed and coronavirus cases continue to climb. The Nasdaq \n\nSenate Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have rejected a $908 billion bipartisan proposal put forth last week, with key disagreements remaining over the size and scope of the bill. Senator John Thune, the chamber\u2019s No. 2 Republican, said the group of GOP and Democratic senators trying to forge a compromise likely cannot produce a solution to limiting the liability of employers in connection with Covid-19 infections that will satisfy Republicans. Democrats probably won\u2019t like the result either, he added. \u201cMy sense is that they\u2019re not going to get there on the liability language.\u201d Democrats have similarly balked at the White House\u2019s $916 billion plan, which excludes $300 a week in augmented unemployment benefits. Like we have said before, we don\u2019t expect any resolution in stimulus talks at least until the Senate majority is decided and the Biden administration takes over. \n\nYesterday, the FDA met with an outside counsel to discuss the approval of the Pfizer vaccine. The counsel greenlit the vaccine candidate, opening the door for official approval any day now. \u201cWhen you have 2,000 to 3,000 people a day\u2014a day\u2014dying of coronavirus, to me this was a clear choice,\u201d said Ofer Levy, an advisory panel member and director of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, after Thursday\u2019s vote.\n\nCoronavirus cases in the United States continue to spike, despite expectation that Pfizer\u2019s vaccine will be approved soon. The country recording more than 200,000 daily new cases for the fourth day straight. The number of hospitalized patients remains well over 100,000 and the number of deaths yesterday was 2,923, the second-worst death toll of the pandemic (Wednesday was the record.)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Disney (DIS) stock was up more than 13% up today after the company revealed it had 86.8 million subscribers in their streaming services, which vastly outperformed the company\u2019s expectation of 60-90 million subs by 2024, per Yahoo Finance. Management now expects that number to balloon to 230 million to 260 million globally during that period. Crazy!\n* Yesterday, (NIO) announced plans to sell an additional shares of stock given the recent performance of the stock. Dilution is mainly the reason the stock is down 7% today, in our opinion.\n* Electric delivery van company Electric Last Mile is set to go public through a SPAC merger with Forum Merger III (FIII).\n* Softbank (SFTBY) to sell 80% its stake in robot-developer Boston Dynamics to Hyundai for roughly $800 million.\n* Dave &amp; Busters (PLAY) target raised by Deutsche Bank (DB) $32 to $37 at BUY.

        "selftext": "**DoorDash just went public in a crazy overvalued IPO, AirBNB will follow today. Today we get earnings from Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco &amp; more. Let\u2019s talk about this and everything about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/bzmy8C4) drop almost 2% and suffering its biggest loss since October after the 4-day win streak, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Kw3DKxD) also dropped .80% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/9GvPGh5) did much better, down just .35% for the day. We saw a huge spike in the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/RcShWPM) of over 7% closing at the highest level since the 23rd of November.\n\nWe saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/YkqyTgh) as finally some stocks have started to move below the moving averages on about average volume for the day.\n\nWe saw most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/Wfn4Trj) in the red yesterday as Tech and Communications suffered the most dropping more than 1% for the day, with small gains being made in just the Industrials, Energy and Materials sectors as Growth companies suffered the most [yesterday](https://ibb.co/5hQKP88), especially the Large-Caps as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/V9bfV71), with all the big FAANG names and other big tech companies being deep in the red as Apple, Amazon, and Netflix dropped more than 2% for the day, while FB, Google and Microsoft also lost over 1%, but the big loser yesterday was Tesla losing 7% for the day.\n\nToday we will get some critical economic [data](https://ibb.co/qnkdTJz), and if this disappoints, we might see another big drop in the stock market, as the jobless claims will start us off in the early morning.\n\nAlongside this economic data, today the [FDA](https://ibb.co/0906d6L) may approve the emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine, that could lead to a vaccine rollout starting next week. This might help the markets have a more positive reaction if the FDA grants the authorization.\n\nOne good thing in my opinion is that the most recent [survey](https://ibb.co/5WPhj8B) from the AAII showed a slight decrease in Bullish and Neutral investors while the Bearish camp gained more than 4% in the last week.\n\nInvestors had gotten very bullish in the last weeks and this usually is a contrarian indicator, so seeing this small drop is a good thing to see, as I want more and more people to start feeling bearish so I can find and buy stocks at more attractive prices than the current ones. So, the more bearish people get, the more I like to get on and buy stocks. But still\u2026 there is to much of a concentration in the bull\u2019s camp so we might have to wait a little, for more fear to appear in the stock market.\n\nPositive indicators also popped up yesterday as Wholesale [invetories](https://ibb.co/WxPPLpS) rose more than expected in October, as this led the Atlanta FED to maintain they\u2019re Q4 GDP [estimates](https://ibb.co/SBZPtZP), while [Goldman](https://ibb.co/sQ42gCg) also thinks the economy will recover faster than expected starting with Q4 and going on next year.\n\nWhile on the jobs front, October job opening came in [better](https://ibb.co/4VdrTbQ) than expected at over 6,6M, as the job opening rate stood at 6,7% while the quits rate at just 2,2%.\n\nSo, DoorDash went live [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LJtbPtH) at 182$ which is insane in my opinion, the current price gives the company a [valuation](https://ibb.co/kcBcpYW) of over $70B, more than 4 times what the company raised at the last private fundraising six months ago. This valuation is higher than Chipotle, Yum Brands, Domino\u2019s and many others from the food industry.\n\nAnd by the way, don\u2019t forget the stock is [trading](https://ibb.co/CP0Qgbr) at over 30 times sales of this year, which were hugely boosted by the current situation, and that food delivery is really hard for any company, especially one that expects to grow to have a share of more than 50% of the entire world in the sector so that it can justify the current valuation.\n\nOne of the biggest gainers from this is SoftBank as they have a big stake in the company. The shares of SoftBank [skyrocketed](https://ibb.co/GnTSqJf) yesterday to new highs in almost two decades. Like almost every time, the biggest gainers in this IPOs are the banks and not us the retail investors.\n\nWith the other big [IPO](https://ibb.co/Ld0pMdz) yesterday being C3.ai which also opened way above the IPO price, as investors can\u2019t get enough of this stock\u2019s, I don\u2019t think this is a healthy hype for this type of IPOs, investors expect every new company to just skyrocket but, not all of them will, and paying such a high premium is not worth it most time, better wait for a pullback before getting some action on these stocks.\n\nToday we will see [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/Hxd70Tb) go public, as the valuation for this company also gets higher and higher, as they have started selling shares for 68$ even higher than the latest targeted price between 56-60$. And if DoorDash is any [indication](https://ibb.co/8cb3yTs), I don\u2019t think we will be able to get our hands on this stock below 100$. Way above my 70-80$ max price that I am willing to pay, so I am going to wait this out also until they have a pullback, maybe once the first earnings come out, that will be the case. But if somehow the IPO is under 80$ and especially under 70$ I would be willing to get some action.\n\nSome other [news](https://ibb.co/H4Pxqmq) from the stock market which pushed companies like Facebook lower came in when almost every US state filed a lawsuit against the company. In the long run, if this happens just like with the Google lawsuit, the sum of the parts of the company is bigger than the company itself, so I don\u2019t really have any worries long-term about Facebook or Google, as they are the 2 of the biggest advertising platforms in the world.\n\nWhile [REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/0X85Cb4) is starting to make a small comeback in New York, as leases jumped 30% year over year in November to around 4000 new ones, but it will still take a very long time before things go back to where they stood before this year.\n\nAlso, we will have a lot of earnings results today as [Oracle](https://ibb.co/jb5CPPV), Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco, Broadcom and others report.\n\nI expect [Lululemon](https://ibb.co/J2MBWD2) to beat the estimates and the stock to regain momentum after it has struggled since the beginning of September. And just like analysts from Raymond James [said](https://ibb.co/gFL3T0s), the only underlying story problem for investors it\u2019s the valuation, but this will soon go away, as people will buy this brand even more once the reopening begins.\n\nLikewise, [Dave &amp; Buster's](https://ibb.co/L0rY2YS) may have smaller loses than expected last quarter as restaurants weren\u2019t hit so badly like before or like this quarter.\n\nWhile [BROADCOM](https://ibb.co/b5kYKLB) stands to benefit a lot from the recent move in semiconductor industry especially for data centers that stands to benefit them a lot.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/D19qrSc) will also report earnings after the close, and is expected to show over 14% growth in eps and revenues since last year, as they are one of the best retailers to own as a shareholder, even if they always trade at a premium.\n\nAdobe just released earnings while writing this post and here are the excelent results that the company [posted](https://ibb.co/kyzBLjv). Now let's see how the stock reacts, will it go down or up?\n\nSo, guys, don\u2019t forget not to panic sell when you see a big red day in the markets, just look at this Wells Fargo [chart](https://ibb.co/yQwKpt0).\n\nInvestors who added 30% more exposure to equities, and took the money from investment-grade fixed income largely outperform the rest of the investors, while the average investor who does a quarterly rebalancing also did very good and is still up over 10% for the year, while investors who reduced the equity exposure by 50% and put that money into fixed income or kept it in cash are up just 2%. With by far the worst results seen in investors who removed all of the exposure to equities, they are down 6% for the year.\n\nJust be patient, trust the companies that you like and keep investing every time you can. In the long-run markets will always go UP &amp; UP.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content!

It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.

        "selftext": "**DocuSign crushes earnings and AMC may go bankrupt. Lemonade spiked yesterday over 20% while Pfizer confirmed delivery numbers, let\u2019s talk about this and everything new in the stock market**\n\nHey everyone! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the DOW leading the way up almost 0,3% with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/G9JLH78) close behind up 0,23% and finishing at a new record high while the broader market [SP500](https://ibb.co/7rMK8RY) finished barely down for the day. All 3 of them were trading a lot higher intraday before the most recent Pfizer [news](https://ibb.co/qCXxh0Q) popped up as they are only expected to ship half of the doses that were initially planned, but people spooked at this to much in my opinion. This thing was already known, when they published the candidate data in November, they also [announced](https://ibb.co/cDtdMCy) this number, but people runed away way to fast before going more into the data. Pfizer did not cut supply, they just explained why this happened in this latest headline. It is way better for companies to under-promise and over-deliver than the other way around.\n\nThe [VIX](https://ibb.co/HYrVJNH) also saw a spike around the Pfizer news and finished higher for the day while 59% of companies were advancing with almost 150 new highs and just 3 new lows on below average volume of 11,5 billion shares compared to 11,7 billion shares in the last 20 trading days. [CHART](https://ibb.co/6PVC7Lr)\n\nThe best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/2t3kk7m) yesterday were Energy and Real Estate while Utilities finished more than 1% down for the day with small and mid-cap growth companies [leading](https://ibb.co/sP2rMzd) the way while the large-caps where lagging the market as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/d2cJ7hZ) as all the FAANG stocks were down with Microsoft also joining them. While TESLA continued to be red hot and Alibaba has finally regained some momentum.\n\nHere is the most important [ECONOMIC DATA](https://ibb.co/w6b2bxv) that will be released today as we will get nonfarm payrolls and unemployment rates in the early morning alongside the trade deficit, with Factory orders numbers coming in a bit latter. \n\nThe [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/7GrND6j) are largely higher today not only in the US but also Europe is [gaining](https://ibb.co/mXsLDSb) momentum after Germany manufacturing [orders](https://ibb.co/9NVsjQw) rose for the sixth straight month in October and [Asia](https://ibb.co/7zhQnDt) as the global retail sector saw an [increase](https://ibb.co/k4dCN3f) of 30% in transactions with the whole Black Friday to Cyber Monday period doing very well this year.\n\nWhile yesterday we got numbers on the [NOVEMBER ISM](https://ibb.co/hcmvzgg) as it continued to a sixth straight month of expansion with employment being the biggest gainer in the index with even greater numbers coming in from the [PMI COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/GHcFV4g) with the fastest growth since 2015 as employment rose at the fastest pace in the history of the survey.\n\nAlso, the Jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/7txF4QQ) came in whey lower than expected at 712k more than 60k below estimated with continuing claims dropping for the first time in the last 9 months to under 6 million\n\nMeanwhile we also got some sales number for October in the [SEMI sector](https://ibb.co/VTy4BvP) yesterday, as sales had big increases Y/Y and M/M with all regions ramping up sales on a monthly basis. This is great news for companies like Nvidia, QCOM, AVGO and many more.\n\nMoving on to the auto sector the US light vehicle sales [forecast](https://ibb.co/THKtD9y) has seen an improved outlook for next year, up around 10% from 2020 at around 15.6 million with US [EV SALES](https://ibb.co/Hdk0qqq) increasing over 70% next year, this could be a huge boost to Tesla and other EV ramping up players like GM and FORD.\n\nThis is great news for Tesla after a big bear on the company just [trimmed](https://ibb.co/25tcFhJ) his short position on TESLA\n\n[Lemonade](https://ibb.co/wLqdKCS) had a big jump yesterday after the Motley Fool [published](https://ibb.co/PrJVJ5G) a long pitch for this company. I also own this stock and I believe it can become a very big player in the insurance business in the future. At the moment the company still only has a small market cap but I plan to own this for the long-term(5+years) as I expect great things from them. But don\u2019t just rush today in the stock because it spiked 20%, wait for it to cool off, maybe dollar cost average on it.\n\nWhile I am very interested to see what Disney [announces](https://ibb.co/hZDjxwk) next week as they may give new information on how the streaming business is doing and what the plans for the company are looking forward as 30% of the revenues of the company came from parks in the last years. I don\u2019t think that parks are ever going to be such a big part of the company as streaming and content production will lead the way. But I still like this company very much as it is one of my biggest portfolio holdings and I can see this stock rising to 170$ in the near future.\n\nA couple of companies released earnings yesterday as DocuSign [beat](https://ibb.co/znppzsn) the top and bottom line with billings coming in at $440M way over the consensus of $386M due to many more customers using the electronic signature to close contracts. While they also offered [guidance](https://ibb.co/34Hfnsz) for next quarter of around $404M to $408M also better than consensus at $387M as the stock is up 5% pre-market. \n\nWhile Marvell [missed](https://ibb.co/nCx5nHF) on expectations as the company cited supply issues constraints that are limiting the capability to satisfy demand. \n\nBad [news](https://ibb.co/yWJz3Kg) also came in for AMC with Warner\u2019s decision to send all they\u2019re 2021 movies directly to streaming on the same day as the theatrical release. This combined with the fact that AMC is filling to sell around [200M shares](https://ibb.co/Lkjkt5G), makes me think that this company is going to have the same route as Hertz. The cinema business wasn\u2019t doing so great since 2017, and this might be the final blow for the industry.\n\nAnd one final thought, it might be a good opportunity to get long on Dave &amp; Busters, Chewy, Adobe and Lululemon for next week, as I think they are all poised for good quarterly results. So, I will give all of them a small allocation today as I think there might be some good upside here in a few days, as there is a lot of money still on the sidelines with the most recent AAII asset [survey](https://ibb.co/7SRKkzk) showing that investors have more than 18% in cash on hands that can be pumped in the stock market.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "**Disney lays out the plans for the future, the FDA advisory panel gives their OK. What\u2019s my price target and should you buy DoorDash and AirBnB? Let\u2019s talk about this and everything about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Good morning! So let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we only saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/1RgJRtS) gaining some ground, up more than half a % while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/vQY7s6C) finished .13% down and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/BcgtnC2) fell just below 30k, losing .23% for the day. All 3 indexes traded way lower in the beginning of the day after the jobless claims came in, but recovered once the FDA Advisory panel meeting started. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/SwcQnHs) finish higher for the day after it opened at over 23 to start us off.\n\nAlmost 60% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/qdWy3jk), but the volume was way below average for most of them, with the Energy sector being the only significant gainer, up 3% for the day while most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/5xskzgj) were flat or even lost ground for the day. On a factor [basis](https://ibb.co/Z28KH04), only large-cap value companies from the industrial sector suffered big yesterday, as small cap growth companies outperformed.\n\nYou can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y0jvPBX), that big caps, with the exception of Apple and Tesla did struggle yesterday, while most of the companies with big gains were from the oil &amp; gas industry, with Chevron gaining more than 3% for the day, while Exxon, Total and BP also had big gains.\n\nThe numbers that came in [yesterday](https://ibb.co/MPxZS56) on the economic front where mixed. As initial and continuing jobless claims came in [worse](https://ibb.co/NmgdXbJ) than expected, as more than 850K people filed for initial claims up more than 125K since the last week and what the analysts [expected](https://ibb.co/KrGcRk7), as this was the biggest spike in initial claims since march, while the continuing claims also rose for the first time since September. I am wondering, will [this](https://ibb.co/0X6FCH5) finally push the congress to act on a relief bill? I think the economy really needs it as a bridge to better times. Just look at the [EU](https://ibb.co/ncSgyWd), they have finally agreed on $2.2T budget and stimulus package to help the Eurozone get through the difficult times.\n\nBetter numbers came in from the consumer price [index](https://ibb.co/NjLW663), as the index rose by .2%, after it was unchanged in October, but this should be taken with a grain of salt, as most of consumer confidence increase comes from the high-income [consumers](https://ibb.co/DVJ5nK9), while people who have an income under $50K still struggling.\n\nAlso, the Federal [Budget](https://ibb.co/8BFdyZ7) came in better than expected as the deficit shrank more in November compared to October and compared to last year\u2019s month.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/pP78rTs) is a slow day in terms of economic data, but we do get a final read on the Producer price index and the consumer sentiment index.\n\nWe also finally got the [FDA](https://ibb.co/9gLsrh6) panel of outside experts meeting yesterday, which saw the panel vote 17 FOR, 4 against and one abstain. The only small concerns were on the topic of 16 and 17-year old\u2019s as some experts argued that there is insufficient data on that subgroup, but I don\u2019t think that is a case for concern, as the vaccine is likely going to take a while until young people will start to get the shot, as they are one of the least impacted groups. This is great news, as the FDA does usually follow up this committee advice, so we can see the FDA Emergency use authorization very very soon. Vaccine doses are already ready go within 24hours of the authorization so, things will start to move rather fast after that.\n\nSo, we got some earnings numbers yesterday from a lot of companies, let\u2019s talk about them a little.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/C040BWf) posted a beat on the top and bottom line with e-commerce sales rising by more than 80%, while [comparable](https://ibb.co/YQQknbj) sales in stores were more than 17%. With both EPS and revenue beating the estimates, I think this might be the time to get into COSTCO, as they are one of the best retailers in the world, they always trade at a premium, the [stock](https://ibb.co/QnQNJGJ) is just about 5% from the all-time high and is far from overbought territory. I really like them as they have also rewarded shareholders constantly both with great growth and dividends.\n\n[Broadcom](https://ibb.co/St74KMD) also posted a great beat on EPS and an 11% increase in revenues, fueled by a great beat in the semiconductor segment, while also posting a free cash flow of over $3B, way better than expected, as they also increased the quarterly dividend by 11% and have made a lot of [senior](https://ibb.co/hcMS6Vs) leadership changes yesterday, but the [stock](https://ibb.co/TB97nhZ) is down more than 2% in pre-market trading despite a lot of great numbers.\n\nThe company has most of its [revenues](https://ibb.co/bLbzgKL) coming from semiconductor solutions, this is very good as the [global](https://ibb.co/GfZGfnz) semiconductor sales have increased more than 5% in FY2020 and are expected to increase more than 8% for FY 2021, way better than the previous [outlook](https://ibb.co/MSrLh0p) of 6,2%.\n\nThe company also posted all time [highs](https://ibb.co/1vM8WP0) in net revenue, free cash flows, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA, while the compound annual [growth](https://ibb.co/zRW1jLZ) of the dividend since FY2016 is almost 50%. I think I might be investing even more in this company especially if they have a pullback.\n\nNext let\u2019s go to Lululemon who also [posted](https://ibb.co/qF1NnnN) a beat on EPS and Revenues, while comparable sales were up 19% with better gross and operating margins than expected. This was led by a huge [rise](https://ibb.co/zfKRJX5) in the international markets which will continue to expand as they gain more recognition overseas.\n\nA smaller company that [reported](https://ibb.co/2WMrybz) yesterday was Dave &amp; Buster\u2019s as the losses were smaller than expected as comparable store sales declined by 66% as the restrictions in the restaurant industry keeps hammering away. The stock was trading +4% in after hours as investors may have though of an even worse result.\n\nMoving on, [Adobe](https://ibb.co/Vjwwprm) also released earnings before the market opened yesterday, after a delayed earnings release. They posted a great beat on EPS and the revenues while also giving great guidance for next year, way above the consensus, with more than $15B in revenues and a EPS of over $11. The company also announced a new $15B share buyback [program](https://ibb.co/cKBbMpF) which will increase the value of the stock through the next 4 years while also have a strong [growth](https://ibb.co/G7BySxH) path, and despite all of this the stock [lost](https://ibb.co/Bnkk60T) more than 1,4% for the day.\n\nThe other earnings report that was released yesterday was from [Oracle](https://ibb.co/KsSGZNW), they also posted a great beat on the top and bottom line, but didn\u2019t offer any guidance as that kind of disappointed investors and dipped about 1% in after hours. I don\u2019t really have a great grasp of the company\u2019s growth potential is right now.\n\nWe also got the Disney Investors meeting, in which the company share a lot of new great things. First of all, [Disney+](https://ibb.co/kJRc01G) has gone up another 18% since just 4 weeks ago, and is up to more than 86M subscribers, with the total number for the company\u2019s streaming services surpassing 137M as they plan to expand Disney+ in Eastern Europe, South Korea, Hong Kong and other markets next year.\n\nThe company also [expects](https://ibb.co/4skfTC8) to have more than 230M subscribers by 2024, a very big increase from the prior estimate, while they are also planning on raising the monthly fee starting in March.\n\nThey plan to [release](https://ibb.co/F0G0C84) a lot of new content directly to Disney+, which is another big hit to the cinema world. With the Marvel and Star Wars series being big blockbusters for the movie industry.\n\nThey presented so much new [content](https://ibb.co/8jpZtWN) for the company, that it took them more than 2 hours to talk about all of this.\n\nBut they also [said](https://ibb.co/DWwJ1tg) that these decisions are temporary, and that they still prefer theatrical releases especially for blockbusters, so, there is still some hope for cinema\u2019s, but maybe not just right now, it will take years to recover from this, and they will probably have to largely reduce the number of screens so that they may become profitable again.\n\nSo, over 100 new content releases per year is a lot for the [company](https://ibb.co/fFD4vhs), this was a very good investors meeting that pleased investors, as the company is [trading](https://ibb.co/Y86n6HD) \\+7,5% in pre-market.\n\nDisney is my second biggest position in my portfolio and I am really happy with what the company presented today. I think this stock may get to 200$ easily when the parks and entertainment business goes back online, as that accounted for 1/3 of the revenues before this year.\n\nIn other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/NL6sXcT), NIO will offer 60M shares, with an additional 9M shares option for underwriters. The stock fell sharply after the news, dropping more than 6% in After-hours [trading](https://ibb.co/85PycWh).\n\nAlso, Qualcomm suffered after the close yesterday, as the shares fell more than 5% after [news](https://ibb.co/5h4syVT) popped that Apple is moving to a develop their first cellular modem which will replace the Qualcomm modem in iPhone. The shares dropped as Qualcomm gets about 11% of its revenue from Apple.\n\nSo, one last thing that I want to talk about is the recent IPOs from DoorDash and AirBnb.\n\nAirBNB also went public yesterday and [started](https://ibb.co/PCNjM3W) trading at $146, way above the $68 IPO price. This means the company has a [market cap](https://ibb.co/QNmGhqy) of over $100B, way higher than its rival Booking at $86B market cap and even [higher](https://ibb.co/cyp2hz1) than some of the biggest hotels in the world, Marriot &amp; Hilton. The [stock](https://ibb.co/C9P3McG) even hit a new high of $165, I believe this happened as brokers started to get hands on the shares and orders started to fill in, but the stock did go back down to finish at $144, that means the stock gained more than 112% just in one day. The stock is down again more than 2% in pre-market guys. \n\nI would avoid these stocks as much as I can as I believe they are well overhyped at the moment. I think we can see a pullback that may offer a better opportunity in AirBnb after the first earnings results. I would buy this company only if it drops to around 80$ as a price target, if not I maintain my sell opinion on the stock, though I personally, am not shorting any stock due to the risk of the high volatility associated with this companies as they have a very small share float.\n\nWhile my opinion on [DoorDash](https://ibb.co/qkqSz1t) is that we might not see a pullback or correction as soon as AirBnb as demand will probably continue to be strong for at least a couple of quarters, before the growth slows down as well as very though future comps. We might see a drop in price then, as I think this stock is also well overvalued. I also maintain my sell opinion on this stock and just like with AirBNB, I am not going to touch this stock, I think a reasonable PT for DoorDash as a sell is about 100$. But I would try to stay away as much as possible, I\u2019d rather go and find better growth opportunities in other companies, and not waste time and money on these 2 stocks. \n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 7th, 2020.\n\n# **Any progress on stimulus could give the market a boost in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/stimulus-hope-markets-focus-next-week.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stimulus to help the economy and vaccines to stop the virus are expected to the be the main focus in markets in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Efforts to move along a fiscal package in Congress picked up momentum in the past week with Congressional leaders sounding conciliatory, and a bi-partisan group of senators pushing their own $900 billion proposal.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt probably boils down to how much [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell is willing to deal, and I don\u2019t know what the answer is to that,\u201d said Mike Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to happen, next week is the week. The government runs out of money on Friday. Congress has to come up with a funding scheme.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists have said the two events could be tied, but Congress could also push through a spending resolution without including stimulus. Some programs will expire at the end of the month, if Congress does not provide funding, including unemployment benefits for millions of Americans.\n*****\n&gt; The on again, off again stimulus talks have led to skepticism in the market, and sets it up for a move higher if there is anything officially announced. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s fully baked in. I would say the stimulus is a positive catalyst, unless it\u2019s less than $900 billion,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.\n*****\n&gt; While stocks surged in the past week, bond yields also moved higher. Yields move opposite price, and bond yields have been rising on stimulus expectations. More spending means more debt, and that sends rates higher.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year was at 0.97% Friday, and appeared ready to move back to the 1% level for the first time since March.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIs it the case here, stimulus is already factored in, and will people take their money and run?\u201d said Schumacher.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.7% in the past week, ending Friday at 3,699, a record high. The Dow also ended up 1% at a record 30,218, and Nasdaq gained 2.1% to a record 12,464.\n*****\n&gt; # Getting jabbed\n&gt; Vaccine news has been a catalyst for the market\u2019s surge since early November, when Pfizer first revealed the high efficacy of its vaccine. Since then Moderna and Astra-Zeneca both revealed results of their own vaccines.\n*****\n&gt; A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee meets Thursday on emergency use authorization for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey\u2019re starting to roll it out in the U.K, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to be watched here to see how it unfolds,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist Prudential Financial. \u201cThat\u2019s the next issue for the market. The deliveries, the distributions. Are people being jabbed? These are all questions the market is concerned about about because they\u2019re looking forward to it unrolling smoothly in the U.S.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 3 million people will be vaccinated in the initial rollout. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is expected to be approved the following week, and by year-end both vaccines are expected to reach 20 million people in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe vaccine news has started to see a bit of diminishing return in terms of its wow factor,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some volatility around the logistics.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the virus remains in the forefront for the market because of the continuing spread and its economic impact as activities are shut down. California Thursday announced new restrictions with stay at home advisories in some regions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe big question is how long does the Covid surge last?\u201d Krosby said.\n*****\n&gt; The virus shutdowns appear to be behind a slowdown in the labor market, and economists say it could slow activity into the first quarter. November job growth of 245,000 was about 200,000 less than expected. That makes Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims more important for markets.\n*****\n&gt; There is also CPI and PPI inflation data Thursday and Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere is this push pull in the market regarding inflationary pressures,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cIt\u2019s not expected, which is why if it does print higher, it could ignite the conversation regarding inflation.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PZEBIS8.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ypJI3Vy.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/s01kzjN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/7Y1RKiX.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nF9LHWm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/F99YkSI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/00G6LqZ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8OK0Nmw.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tgMnGUY.png))**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PDrxDY8.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5rCf9oe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/VsZzlKU.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/moiEQsJ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks and Bonds Both in Rally Mode\n\n&gt; When it comes to equity market performance in a given month, it doesn't get much better than November. While the S&amp;P 500's total return of 10.95% in the month was only the second-best monthly performance of the year, it was still enough to rank as the third-best month for the S&amp;P 500 in the last thirty years and just the ninth month since 1980 that it was up 10%+.\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the S&amp;P 500's annualized total return over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares the current returns to the historical average. For the last year, the S&amp;P 500's total return has been 17.5% which is nearly six full percentage points higher than the historical average. For the last two years, the annualized return has been nearly as strong at 16.8%, and it is actually even stronger relative to the historical average of 10.5%. Moving further out the time horizon, the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns drift lower, and while the five and ten-year annualized returns are greater than average, the S&amp;P 500's annualized gain of 7.3% in the last 20 years is more than 3.5 percentage points below the historical average of 10.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-SP-500-Act-vs-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; The last couple of years haven't just been strong for equities. Over the last year, long-term US Treasuries, as measured by the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year US Treasury Index, have rallied 15.7%, which is more than six full percentage points greater than the historical average of 9.5%. Over the last two years, returns have been even stronger with an annualized gain of nearly 20%, or more than double the historical average of 9.1%! While the last two years have been strong for US Treasuries, the last five, ten, and twenty years have all seen returns of between one and two percentage points below their historical average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120LT-Treas-Act-vs-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; Lately, when you see rallies in the equity market, it tends to be accompanied by a decline in treasuries as yields rise. In November, though, that wasn't the case. Even with the S&amp;P 500 up 10.95%, long-term US Treasuries rallied just over 1%. So how uncommon is it for stocks to rally like they did in November while bonds also rally. Actually, it is not very uncommon at all. The table below shows the nine months since 1980 where the S&amp;P 500's total return in a given month was 10% or more, and of those months, long-term treasuies also rallied in every month but one (October 2011).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-Stocks-Up-10.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Manufacturer Recovery Continues\n\n&gt; This morning, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released a less positive outlook for the US manufacturing sector. The headline number for ISM's Manufacturing index fell from 59.3 last month down to 57.5. A drop was expected, but the actual results were worse than the drop to 58.0 that had been forecasted. That reading indicates that the manufacturing sector continued to grow in November but at a slower rate than October.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; Similar to the various Federal Reserve bank surveys from around the country, breadth in the November report was more negative than in recent months. Of the ten indices excluding the headline number, only three were higher in November: Backlog Orders, Supplier Deliveries, and Export Orders. Additionally, two indices\u2014Customer Inventories and Employment\u2014showed contractionary readings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Table1.png))**\n\n&gt; One theme of the report was that orders remain very healthy. New Orders fell from 67.9 to 65.1, but that is a sixth consecutive month of expansionary readings. Although the index was lower this month, meaning new order growth decelerated, it remains in the top decile of historical readings. As new orders have continued to grow, so too have backlogs. The index for Backlog Orders has continued to press higher, rising to 56.9 from 55.7. That is in the 88th percentile of all months and is now at the highest level since August of 2018. Demand continues to improve with new orders coming in at a historically strong pace, even though it is slower than last month, and order backlogs have once again risen as a result.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Orders.png))**\n\n&gt; As new order growth decelerated, so too did production. The index fell from 63.0 in October to 60.8 last month. That is still consistent with growth (readings above 50) in production but at the slowest rate since June. One factor that potentially had an impact on the slowdown in production is issues with suppliers. The index for Supplier Deliveries rose for the fourth month in a row in November and reached the highest level since May. Higher readings in the Supplier Deliveries index indicates longer lead times and vice versa. In other words, products from suppliers have been taking longer to reach manufacturers, in turn, impacting productivity.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Prod-Supp.png))**\n\n&gt; Although suppliers appear to have some constraints and production has slowed slightly, business inventories rose for the second month in a row even as more and more firms report that customer inventories are too low. The index for Customer Inventories now sits in the bottom 2% of historical readings after dropping another 0.4 points in November. At 36.3, the index is at the lowest level since June of 2010. That low reading can be considered positive for future production.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Inventorie.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Gains In November Steal From Santa\n\n&gt; What a month November was! Here are some of the highlights:\n\n&gt; * Best month for Dow since January 1987 (11.9%) and best November since 1928\n&gt; * Best month ever for the STOXX 600 (16.7%)\n&gt; * Best month ever for the Russell 2000 (18.3%)\n&gt; * Best month for the S&amp;P 500 (10.8%) and Nasdaq (11.8%) since April 2020\n&gt; * Best month for Dow Transports since October 2011 (12.1%)\n&gt; * Best month from PHLX Semiconductor Index since March 2003 (18.4%)\n&gt; * Best month for Industrials (16.0%) and Financials (16.8%) since April 2009\n&gt; * Second best month ever for energy (28.0%)\n\n&gt; A way better than expected earnings season, a likely split Congress, and major breakthroughs on the vaccine front all helped stocks soar last month,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAdd ongoing support from the Federal Reserve as the cherry on top and we are looking at a truly historic month on many levels.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s all the Dow monthly returns since 1900. Last month was the best return since January 1987. Now before you go out and sell because you see 1987, remember the S&amp;P 500 added another 20% the seven months after the huge gains in early 1987.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It was the best November for the S&amp;P 500 since November 1928.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Small caps soared on the likelihood of taxes staying lower due to a divided Congress and vaccine progress, with the Russell 2000 adding more than 18% for the best month ever, topping the previous record from February 2000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What happens after a big month? Well, history says a 10% monthly gain is quite bullish. In fact, we had a 10% plus rally back in April 2020 and shared this same chart at that time. Sure enough, returns have been strong this time around as well. \u201cThe bottom line is the huge gains in November could actually be the start of something much stronger,\u201d according to Ryan Detrick. \u201cAlso, this was the second month of 2020 with a 10% gain. The only other year to do that? 1982, which kicked off a historic bull market.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Turning to December, this month is widely known to be quite bullish, as Santa comes to town, people feel good, and stocks tend to do well. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1950, December has been the second best month of the year, with only November better. December had been the best month of the year until the historic 9.2% drop in 2018. As a result, December hasn\u2019t been quite as strong over the past 10 and 20 years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Breaking it down even more, a big rally in November can potentially steal some of December\u2019s thunder. As after a 5% or 10% rally in November, the returns in December are more muted. The flipside to this though is if the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 10% for the year (like 2020), then stocks have benefited from some performance chasing and have tended to do better.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What does it all mean? After the historic move in November we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see below average returns in December. We do believe this is a new bull market and lasting economic cycle of growth, but overall sentiment is getting quite stretched and this increases the potential for some near-term weakness.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, December 28, 2020**\n\nStocks rose Monday after President Trump finally signed the $900 billion virus relief package following a multi-day delay. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.87% up, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.01% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.66% up.\n\nLast weekend, President Trump suggested he might not sign the new $900 billion coronavirus relief package Congress recently approved. Over the weekend, Trump finally signed the $900 billion stimulus package recently passed by Congress. In approving the bill, Trump also signed the $1.4 trillion fiscal spending bill for next year, averting a government shutdown. The bill includes another round of direct checks to Americans, this time for only $600, enhanced federal unemployment benefits of $300 per week, and approximately $325 billion in aid for small businesses and replenishes the Paycheck Protection Program.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi is set to hold a roll call vote over a separate measure to increase the direct payments on Monday, after having failed to pass it through unanimous consent on Thursday. It is unclear whether or when the Republican-controlled Senate would take up the measure.\n\nUnfortunately, December has been the nation's deadliest month since the Covid-19 pandemic's start -- with more than 63,000 Americans lost to the virus in the past 26 days. In comparison, the entire month of November saw about 36,964 deaths. The heightened death toll follows a brutal two months that saw the average of daily new coronavirus cases spike from around 90,000 at the start of November to over 200,000 by the end of December. \n\nThe authorization of Moderna (MRNA) and Pfizer\u2019s (PFE) coronavirus vaccines offer hope that a medical solution for the pandemic is coming, but experts continue to warn that while the end is in sight, we must continue to do our part in the next few months to flatten the curve as much as possible while we wait for widespread distribution of the vaccine. \n\nExperts have warned of another surge in coronavirus stemming from holiday travel. According to the TSA, more than 7 million people were screened at airport security points in the US, the second busiest week of travel since Thanksgiving. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States said, \u201cWe very well might see a post-seasonal -- in the sense of Christmas, New Years -- surge,\u201d implying that holiday travel and private gatherings taking place could lead to another surge in cases, similar to what happened in the weeks following Thanksgiving. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Big tech-stocks like Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) performed very well today.\n* Goldman Sachs economists upgraded their forecast for first-quarter gross domestic product growth to 5% from 3% annualized, citing the boost to consumer spending the $900 billion stimulus package will confer.\n* Regulators over the weekend called for Alibaba (BABA) affiliate Ant Group to \u201crectify\u201d its business practices and focus more narrowly on its core digital payments business. This came about a month after Beijing scuttled Ant Group\u2019s planned $34.5 billion initial public offering in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Alibaba (BABA) shares slid last week in sympathy\n* Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) target raised by Mizuho from $92 to $102 at BUY. Stock currently around $92.\n* Broadcom (AVGO) target raised by Mizuho from $460 to $480 at BUY. Stock currently around $435.\n* Clean Harbors (CLH) target raised by Needham &amp; Co from $75 to $91 at BUY. Stock currently around $76.\n* Lam Research (LRCX) target raised by Mizuho from $410 to $530 at BUY. Stock currently around $480.\n* CarMax (KMX) target raised by Argus from $105 to $110. Stock currently around $91.\n* Micron Technology (MU) target raised by Mizuho from $75 to $85 at BUY.

        "selftext": "**Disney lays out the plans for the future, the FDA advisory panel gives their OK. What\u2019s my price target and should you buy DoorDash and AirBnB? Let\u2019s talk about this and everything about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Good morning! So let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we only saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/1RgJRtS) gaining some ground, up more than half a % while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/vQY7s6C) finished .13% down and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/BcgtnC2) fell just below 30k, losing .23% for the day. All 3 indexes traded way lower in the beginning of the day after the jobless claims came in, but recovered once the FDA Advisory panel meeting started. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/SwcQnHs) finish higher for the day after it opened at over 23 to start us off.\n\nAlmost 60% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/qdWy3jk), but the volume was way below average for most of them, with the Energy sector being the only significant gainer, up 3% for the day while most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/5xskzgj) were flat or even lost ground for the day. On a factor [basis](https://ibb.co/Z28KH04), only large-cap value companies from the industrial sector suffered big yesterday, as small cap growth companies outperformed.\n\nYou can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y0jvPBX), that big caps, with the exception of Apple and Tesla did struggle yesterday, while most of the companies with big gains were from the oil &amp; gas industry, with Chevron gaining more than 3% for the day, while Exxon, Total and BP also had big gains.\n\nThe numbers that came in [yesterday](https://ibb.co/MPxZS56) on the economic front where mixed. As initial and continuing jobless claims came in [worse](https://ibb.co/NmgdXbJ) than expected, as more than 850K people filed for initial claims up more than 125K since the last week and what the analysts [expected](https://ibb.co/KrGcRk7), as this was the biggest spike in initial claims since march, while the continuing claims also rose for the first time since September. I am wondering, will [this](https://ibb.co/0X6FCH5) finally push the congress to act on a relief bill? I think the economy really needs it as a bridge to better times. Just look at the [EU](https://ibb.co/ncSgyWd), they have finally agreed on $2.2T budget and stimulus package to help the Eurozone get through the difficult times.\n\nBetter numbers came in from the consumer price [index](https://ibb.co/NjLW663), as the index rose by .2%, after it was unchanged in October, but this should be taken with a grain of salt, as most of consumer confidence increase comes from the high-income [consumers](https://ibb.co/DVJ5nK9), while people who have an income under $50K still struggling.\n\nAlso, the Federal [Budget](https://ibb.co/8BFdyZ7) came in better than expected as the deficit shrank more in November compared to October and compared to last year\u2019s month.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/pP78rTs) is a slow day in terms of economic data, but we do get a final read on the Producer price index and the consumer sentiment index.\n\nWe also finally got the [FDA](https://ibb.co/9gLsrh6) panel of outside experts meeting yesterday, which saw the panel vote 17 FOR, 4 against and one abstain. The only small concerns were on the topic of 16 and 17-year old\u2019s as some experts argued that there is insufficient data on that subgroup, but I don\u2019t think that is a case for concern, as the vaccine is likely going to take a while until young people will start to get the shot, as they are one of the least impacted groups. This is great news, as the FDA does usually follow up this committee advice, so we can see the FDA Emergency use authorization very very soon. Vaccine doses are already ready go within 24hours of the authorization so, things will start to move rather fast after that.\n\nSo, we got some earnings numbers yesterday from a lot of companies, let\u2019s talk about them a little.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/C040BWf) posted a beat on the top and bottom line with e-commerce sales rising by more than 80%, while [comparable](https://ibb.co/YQQknbj) sales in stores were more than 17%. With both EPS and revenue beating the estimates, I think this might be the time to get into COSTCO, as they are one of the best retailers in the world, they always trade at a premium, the [stock](https://ibb.co/QnQNJGJ) is just about 5% from the all-time high and is far from overbought territory. I really like them as they have also rewarded shareholders constantly both with great growth and dividends.\n\n[Broadcom](https://ibb.co/St74KMD) also posted a great beat on EPS and an 11% increase in revenues, fueled by a great beat in the semiconductor segment, while also posting a free cash flow of over $3B, way better than expected, as they also increased the quarterly dividend by 11% and have made a lot of [senior](https://ibb.co/hcMS6Vs) leadership changes yesterday, but the [stock](https://ibb.co/TB97nhZ) is down more than 2% in pre-market trading despite a lot of great numbers.\n\nThe company has most of its [revenues](https://ibb.co/bLbzgKL) coming from semiconductor solutions, this is very good as the [global](https://ibb.co/GfZGfnz) semiconductor sales have increased more than 5% in FY2020 and are expected to increase more than 8% for FY 2021, way better than the previous [outlook](https://ibb.co/MSrLh0p) of 6,2%.\n\nThe company also posted all time [highs](https://ibb.co/1vM8WP0) in net revenue, free cash flows, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA, while the compound annual [growth](https://ibb.co/zRW1jLZ) of the dividend since FY2016 is almost 50%. I think I might be investing even more in this company especially if they have a pullback.\n\nNext let\u2019s go to Lululemon who also [posted](https://ibb.co/qF1NnnN) a beat on EPS and Revenues, while comparable sales were up 19% with better gross and operating margins than expected. This was led by a huge [rise](https://ibb.co/zfKRJX5) in the international markets which will continue to expand as they gain more recognition overseas.\n\nA smaller company that [reported](https://ibb.co/2WMrybz) yesterday was Dave &amp; Buster\u2019s as the losses were smaller than expected as comparable store sales declined by 66% as the restrictions in the restaurant industry keeps hammering away. The stock was trading +4% in after hours as investors may have though of an even worse result.\n\nMoving on, [Adobe](https://ibb.co/Vjwwprm) also released earnings before the market opened yesterday, after a delayed earnings release. They posted a great beat on EPS and the revenues while also giving great guidance for next year, way above the consensus, with more than $15B in revenues and a EPS of over $11. The company also announced a new $15B share buyback [program](https://ibb.co/cKBbMpF) which will increase the value of the stock through the next 4 years while also have a strong [growth](https://ibb.co/G7BySxH) path, and despite all of this the stock [lost](https://ibb.co/Bnkk60T) more than 1,4% for the day.\n\nThe other earnings report that was released yesterday was from [Oracle](https://ibb.co/KsSGZNW), they also posted a great beat on the top and bottom line, but didn\u2019t offer any guidance as that kind of disappointed investors and dipped about 1% in after hours. I don\u2019t really have a great grasp of the company\u2019s growth potential is right now.\n\nWe also got the Disney Investors meeting, in which the company share a lot of new great things. First of all, [Disney+](https://ibb.co/kJRc01G) has gone up another 18% since just 4 weeks ago, and is up to more than 86M subscribers, with the total number for the company\u2019s streaming services surpassing 137M as they plan to expand Disney+ in Eastern Europe, South Korea, Hong Kong and other markets next year.\n\nThe company also [expects](https://ibb.co/4skfTC8) to have more than 230M subscribers by 2024, a very big increase from the prior estimate, while they are also planning on raising the monthly fee starting in March.\n\nThey plan to [release](https://ibb.co/F0G0C84) a lot of new content directly to Disney+, which is another big hit to the cinema world. With the Marvel and Star Wars series being big blockbusters for the movie industry.\n\nThey presented so much new [content](https://ibb.co/8jpZtWN) for the company, that it took them more than 2 hours to talk about all of this.\n\nBut they also [said](https://ibb.co/DWwJ1tg) that these decisions are temporary, and that they still prefer theatrical releases especially for blockbusters, so, there is still some hope for cinema\u2019s, but maybe not just right now, it will take years to recover from this, and they will probably have to largely reduce the number of screens so that they may become profitable again.\n\nSo, over 100 new content releases per year is a lot for the [company](https://ibb.co/fFD4vhs), this was a very good investors meeting that pleased investors, as the company is [trading](https://ibb.co/Y86n6HD) \\+7,5% in pre-market.\n\nDisney is my second biggest position in my portfolio and I am really happy with what the company presented today. I think this stock may get to 200$ easily when the parks and entertainment business goes back online, as that accounted for 1/3 of the revenues before this year.\n\nIn other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/NL6sXcT), NIO will offer 60M shares, with an additional 9M shares option for underwriters. The stock fell sharply after the news, dropping more than 6% in After-hours [trading](https://ibb.co/85PycWh).\n\nAlso, Qualcomm suffered after the close yesterday, as the shares fell more than 5% after [news](https://ibb.co/5h4syVT) popped that Apple is moving to a develop their first cellular modem which will replace the Qualcomm modem in iPhone. The shares dropped as Qualcomm gets about 11% of its revenue from Apple.\n\nSo, one last thing that I want to talk about is the recent IPOs from DoorDash and AirBnb.\n\nAirBNB also went public yesterday and [started](https://ibb.co/PCNjM3W) trading at $146, way above the $68 IPO price. This means the company has a [market cap](https://ibb.co/QNmGhqy) of over $100B, way higher than its rival Booking at $86B market cap and even [higher](https://ibb.co/cyp2hz1) than some of the biggest hotels in the world, Marriot &amp; Hilton. The [stock](https://ibb.co/C9P3McG) even hit a new high of $165, I believe this happened as brokers started to get hands on the shares and orders started to fill in, but the stock did go back down to finish at $144, that means the stock gained more than 112% just in one day. The stock is down again more than 2% in pre-market guys.\n\nI would avoid these stocks as much as I can as I believe they are well overhyped at the moment. I think we can see a pullback that may offer a better opportunity in AirBnb after the first earnings results. I would buy this company only if it drops to around 80$ as a price target, if not I maintain my sell opinion on the stock, though I personally, am not shorting any stock due to the risk of the high volatility associated with this companies as they have a very small share float.\n\nWhile my opinion on [DoorDash](https://ibb.co/qkqSz1t) is that we might not see a pullback or correction as soon as AirBnb as demand will probably continue to be strong for at least a couple of quarters, before the growth slows down as well as very though future comps. We might see a drop in price then, as I think this stock is also well overvalued. I also maintain my sell opinion on this stock and just like with AirBNB, I am not going to touch this stock, I think a reasonable PT for DoorDash as a sell is about 100$. But I would try to stay away as much as possible, I\u2019d rather go and find better growth opportunities in other companies, and not waste time and money on these 2 stocks.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

On a factor [basis](https://ibb.co/Z28KH04), only large-cap value companies from the industrial sector suffered big yesterday, as small cap growth companies outperformed.\n\nYou can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y0jvPBX), that big caps, with the exception of Apple and Tesla did struggle yesterday, while most of the companies with big gains were from the oil &amp; gas industry, with Chevron gaining more than 3% for the day, while Exxon, Total and BP also had big gains.\n\nThe numbers that came in [yesterday](https://ibb.co/MPxZS56) on the economic front where mixed. As initial and continuing jobless claims came in [worse](https://ibb.co/NmgdXbJ) than expected, as more than 850K people filed for initial claims up more than 125K since the last week and what the analysts [expected](https://ibb.co/KrGcRk7), as this was the biggest spike in initial claims since march, while the continuing claims also rose for the first time since September. I am wondering, will [this](https://ibb.co/0X6FCH5) finally push the congress to act on a relief bill? I think the economy really needs it as a bridge to better times. Just look at the [EU](https://ibb.co/ncSgyWd), they have finally agreed on $2.2T budget and stimulus package to help the Eurozone get through the difficult times.\n\nBetter numbers came in from the consumer price [index](https://ibb.co/NjLW663), as the index rose by .2%, after it was unchanged in October, but this should be taken with a grain of salt, as most of consumer confidence increase comes from the high-income [consumers](https://ibb.co/DVJ5nK9), while people who have an income under $50K still struggling.\n\nAlso, the Federal [Budget](https://ibb.co/8BFdyZ7) came in better than expected as the deficit shrank more in November compared to October and compared to last year\u2019s month.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/pP78rTs) is a slow day in terms of economic data, but we do get a final read on the Producer price index and the consumer sentiment index.\n\nWe also finally got the [FDA](https://ibb.co/9gLsrh6) panel of outside experts meeting yesterday, which saw the panel vote 17 FOR, 4 against and one abstain. The only small concerns were on the topic of 16 and 17-year old\u2019s as some experts argued that there is insufficient data on that subgroup, but I don\u2019t think that is a case for concern, as the vaccine is likely going to take a while until young people will start to get the shot, as they are one of the least impacted groups. This is great news, as the FDA does usually follow up this committee advice, so we can see the FDA Emergency use authorization very very soon. Vaccine doses are already ready go within 24hours of the authorization so, things will start to move rather fast after that.\n\nSo, we got some earnings numbers yesterday from a lot of companies, let\u2019s talk about them a little.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/C040BWf) posted a beat on the top and bottom line with e-commerce sales rising by more than 80%, while [comparable](https://ibb.co/YQQknbj) sales in stores were more than 17%. With both EPS and revenue beating the estimates, I think this might be the time to get into COSTCO, as they are one of the best retailers in the world, they always trade at a premium, the [stock](https://ibb.co/QnQNJGJ) is just about 5% from the all-time high and is far from overbought territory. I really like them as they have also rewarded shareholders constantly both with great growth and dividends.\n\n[Broadcom](https://ibb.co/St74KMD) also posted a great beat on EPS and an 11% increase in revenues, fueled by a great beat in the semiconductor segment, while also posting a free cash flow of over $3B, way better than expected, as they also increased the quarterly dividend by 11% and have made a lot of [senior](https://ibb.co/hcMS6Vs) leadership changes yesterday, but the [stock](https://ibb.co/TB97nhZ) is down more than 2% in pre-market trading despite a lot of great numbers.\n\nThe company has most of its [revenues](https://ibb.co/bLbzgKL) coming from semiconductor solutions, this is very good as the [global](https://ibb.co/GfZGfnz) semiconductor sales have increased more than 5% in FY2020 and are expected to increase more than 8% for FY 2021, way better than the previous [outlook](https://ibb.co/MSrLh0p) of 6,2%.\n\nThe company also posted all time [highs](https://ibb.co/1vM8WP0) in net revenue, free cash flows, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA, while the compound annual [growth](https://ibb.co/zRW1jLZ) of the dividend since FY2016 is almost 50%. I think I might be investing even more in this company especially if they have a pullback.\n\nNext let\u2019s go to Lululemon who also [posted](https://ibb.co/qF1NnnN) a beat on EPS and Revenues, while comparable sales were up 19% with better gross and operating margins than expected. This was led by a huge [rise](https://ibb.co/zfKRJX5) in the international markets which will continue to expand as they gain more recognition overseas.\n\nA smaller company that [reported](https://ibb.co/2WMrybz) yesterday was Dave &amp; Buster\u2019s as the losses were smaller than expected as comparable store sales declined by 66% as the restrictions in the restaurant industry keeps hammering away. The stock was trading +4% in after hours as investors may have though of an even worse result.\n\nMoving on, [Adobe](https://ibb.co/Vjwwprm) also released earnings before the market opened yesterday, after a delayed earnings release. They posted a great beat on EPS and the revenues while also giving great guidance for next year, way above the consensus, with more than $15B in revenues and a EPS of over $11. The company also announced a new $15B share buyback [program](https://ibb.co/cKBbMpF) which will increase the value of the stock through the next 4 years while also have a strong [growth](https://ibb.co/G7BySxH) path, and despite all of this the stock [lost](https://ibb.co/Bnkk60T) more than 1,4% for the day.\n\nThe other earnings report that was released yesterday was from [Oracle](https://ibb.co/KsSGZNW), they also posted a great beat on the top and bottom line, but didn\u2019t offer any guidance as that kind of disappointed investors and dipped about 1% in after hours. I don\u2019t really have a great grasp of the company\u2019s growth potential is right now.\n\nWe also got the Disney Investors meeting, in which the company share a lot of new great things. First of all, [Disney+](https://ibb.co/kJRc01G) has gone up another 18% since just 4 weeks ago, and is up to more than 86M subscribers, with the total number for the company\u2019s streaming services surpassing 137M as they plan to expand Disney+ in Eastern Europe, South Korea, Hong Kong and other markets next year.\n\nThe company also [expects](https://ibb.co/4skfTC8) to have more than 230M subscribers by 2024, a very big increase from the prior estimate, while they are also planning on raising the monthly fee starting in March.\n\nThey plan to [release](https://ibb.co/F0G0C84) a lot of new content directly to Disney+, which is another big hit to the cinema world. With the Marvel and Star Wars series being big blockbusters for the movie industry.\n\nThey presented so much new [content](https://ibb.co/8jpZtWN) for the company, that it took them more than 2 hours to talk about all of this.\n\nBut they also [said](https://ibb.co/DWwJ1tg) that these decisions are temporary, and that they still prefer theatrical releases especially for blockbusters, so, there is still some hope for cinema\u2019s, but maybe not just right now, it will take years to recover from this, and they will probably have to largely reduce the number of screens so that they may become profitable again.\n\nSo, over 100 new content releases per year is a lot for the [company](https://ibb.co/fFD4vhs), this was a very good investors meeting that pleased investors, as the company is [trading](https://ibb.co/Y86n6HD) \\+7,5% in pre-market.\n\nDisney is my second biggest position in my portfolio and I am really happy with what the company presented today. I think this stock may get to 200$ easily when the parks and entertainment business goes back online, as that accounted for 1/3 of the revenues before this year.\n\nIn other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/NL6sXcT), NIO will offer 60M shares, with an additional 9M shares option for underwriters. The stock fell sharply after the news, dropping more than 6% in After-hours [trading](https://ibb.co/85PycWh).\n\nAlso, Qualcomm suffered after the close yesterday, as the shares fell more than 5% after [news](https://ibb.co/5h4syVT) popped that Apple is moving to a develop their first cellular modem which will replace the Qualcomm modem in iPhone. The shares dropped as Qualcomm gets about 11% of its revenue from Apple.\n\nSo, one last thing that I want to talk about is the recent IPOs from DoorDash and AirBnb.\n\nAirBNB also went public yesterday and [started](https://ibb.co/PCNjM3W) trading at $146, way above the $68 IPO price. This means the company has a [market cap](https://ibb.co/QNmGhqy) of over $100B, way higher than its rival Booking at $86B market cap and even [higher](https://ibb.co/cyp2hz1) than some of the biggest hotels in the world, Marriot &amp; Hilton. The [stock](https://ibb.co/C9P3McG) even hit a new high of $165, I believe this happened as brokers started to get hands on the shares and orders started to fill in, but the stock did go back down to finish at $144, that means the stock gained more than 112% just in one day. The stock is down again more than 2% in pre-market guys. \n\nI would avoid these stocks as much as I can as I believe they are well overhyped at the moment. I think we can see a pullback that may offer a better opportunity in AirBnb after the first earnings results. I would buy this company only if it drops to around 80$ as a price target, if not I maintain my sell opinion on the stock, though I personally, am not shorting any stock due to the risk of the high volatility associated with this companies as they have a very small share float.\n\nWhile my opinion on [DoorDash](https://ibb.co/qkqSz1t) is that we might not see a pullback or correction as soon as AirBnb as demand will probably continue to be strong for at least a couple of quarters, before the growth slows down as well as very though future comps. We might see a drop in price then, as I think this stock is also well overvalued. I also maintain my sell opinion on this stock and just like with AirBNB, I am not going to touch this stock, I think a reasonable PT for DoorDash as a sell is about 100$. But I would try to stay away as much as possible, I\u2019d rather go and find better growth opportunities in other companies, and not waste time and money on these 2 stocks. \n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 7th, 2020.\n\n# **Any progress on stimulus could give the market a boost in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/stimulus-hope-markets-focus-next-week.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stimulus to help the economy and vaccines to stop the virus are expected to the be the main focus in markets in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Efforts to move along a fiscal package in Congress picked up momentum in the past week with Congressional leaders sounding conciliatory, and a bi-partisan group of senators pushing their own $900 billion proposal.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt probably boils down to how much [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell is willing to deal, and I don\u2019t know what the answer is to that,\u201d said Mike Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to happen, next week is the week. The government runs out of money on Friday. Congress has to come up with a funding scheme.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists have said the two events could be tied, but Congress could also push through a spending resolution without including stimulus. Some programs will expire at the end of the month, if Congress does not provide funding, including unemployment benefits for millions of Americans.\n*****\n&gt; The on again, off again stimulus talks have led to skepticism in the market, and sets it up for a move higher if there is anything officially announced. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s fully baked in. I would say the stimulus is a positive catalyst, unless it\u2019s less than $900 billion,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.\n*****\n&gt; While stocks surged in the past week, bond yields also moved higher. Yields move opposite price, and bond yields have been rising on stimulus expectations. More spending means more debt, and that sends rates higher.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year was at 0.97% Friday, and appeared ready to move back to the 1% level for the first time since March.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIs it the case here, stimulus is already factored in, and will people take their money and run?\u201d said Schumacher.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.7% in the past week, ending Friday at 3,699, a record high. The Dow also ended up 1% at a record 30,218, and Nasdaq gained 2.1% to a record 12,464.\n*****\n&gt; # Getting jabbed\n&gt; Vaccine news has been a catalyst for the market\u2019s surge since early November, when Pfizer first revealed the high efficacy of its vaccine. Since then Moderna and Astra-Zeneca both revealed results of their own vaccines.\n*****\n&gt; A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee meets Thursday on emergency use authorization for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey\u2019re starting to roll it out in the U.K, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to be watched here to see how it unfolds,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist Prudential Financial. \u201cThat\u2019s the next issue for the market. The deliveries, the distributions. Are people being jabbed? These are all questions the market is concerned about about because they\u2019re looking forward to it unrolling smoothly in the U.S.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 3 million people will be vaccinated in the initial rollout. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is expected to be approved the following week, and by year-end both vaccines are expected to reach 20 million people in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe vaccine news has started to see a bit of diminishing return in terms of its wow factor,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some volatility around the logistics.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the virus remains in the forefront for the market because of the continuing spread and its economic impact as activities are shut down. California Thursday announced new restrictions with stay at home advisories in some regions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe big question is how long does the Covid surge last?\u201d Krosby said.\n*****\n&gt; The virus shutdowns appear to be behind a slowdown in the labor market, and economists say it could slow activity into the first quarter. November job growth of 245,000 was about 200,000 less than expected. That makes Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims more important for markets.\n*****\n&gt; There is also CPI and PPI inflation data Thursday and Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere is this push pull in the market regarding inflationary pressures,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cIt\u2019s not expected, which is why if it does print higher, it could ignite the conversation regarding inflation.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PZEBIS8.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ypJI3Vy.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/s01kzjN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/7Y1RKiX.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nF9LHWm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/F99YkSI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/00G6LqZ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8OK0Nmw.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tgMnGUY.png))**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PDrxDY8.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5rCf9oe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/VsZzlKU.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/moiEQsJ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks and Bonds Both in Rally Mode\n\n&gt; When it comes to equity market performance in a given month, it doesn't get much better than November. While the S&amp;P 500's total return of 10.95% in the month was only the second-best monthly performance of the year, it was still enough to rank as the third-best month for the S&amp;P 500 in the last thirty years and just the ninth month since 1980 that it was up 10%+.\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the S&amp;P 500's annualized total return over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares the current returns to the historical average. For the last year, the S&amp;P 500's total return has been 17.5% which is nearly six full percentage points higher than the historical average. For the last two years, the annualized return has been nearly as strong at 16.8%, and it is actually even stronger relative to the historical average of 10.5%. Moving further out the time horizon, the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns drift lower, and while the five and ten-year annualized returns are greater than average, the S&amp;P 500's annualized gain of 7.3% in the last 20 years is more than 3.5 percentage points below the historical average of 10.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-SP-500-Act-vs-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; The last couple of years haven't just been strong for equities. Over the last year, long-term US Treasuries, as measured by the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year US Treasury Index, have rallied 15.7%, which is more than six full percentage points greater than the historical average of 9.5%. Over the last two years, returns have been even stronger with an annualized gain of nearly 20%, or more than double the historical average of 9.1%! While the last two years have been strong for US Treasuries, the last five, ten, and twenty years have all seen returns of between one and two percentage points below their historical average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120LT-Treas-Act-vs-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; Lately, when you see rallies in the equity market, it tends to be accompanied by a decline in treasuries as yields rise. In November, though, that wasn't the case. Even with the S&amp;P 500 up 10.95%, long-term US Treasuries rallied just over 1%. So how uncommon is it for stocks to rally like they did in November while bonds also rally. Actually, it is not very uncommon at all. The table below shows the nine months since 1980 where the S&amp;P 500's total return in a given month was 10% or more, and of those months, long-term treasuies also rallied in every month but one (October 2011).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-Stocks-Up-10.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Manufacturer Recovery Continues\n\n&gt; This morning, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released a less positive outlook for the US manufacturing sector. The headline number for ISM's Manufacturing index fell from 59.3 last month down to 57.5. A drop was expected, but the actual results were worse than the drop to 58.0 that had been forecasted. That reading indicates that the manufacturing sector continued to grow in November but at a slower rate than October.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; Similar to the various Federal Reserve bank surveys from around the country, breadth in the November report was more negative than in recent months. Of the ten indices excluding the headline number, only three were higher in November: Backlog Orders, Supplier Deliveries, and Export Orders. Additionally, two indices\u2014Customer Inventories and Employment\u2014showed contractionary readings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Table1.png))**\n\n&gt; One theme of the report was that orders remain very healthy. New Orders fell from 67.9 to 65.1, but that is a sixth consecutive month of expansionary readings. Although the index was lower this month, meaning new order growth decelerated, it remains in the top decile of historical readings. As new orders have continued to grow, so too have backlogs. The index for Backlog Orders has continued to press higher, rising to 56.9 from 55.7. That is in the 88th percentile of all months and is now at the highest level since August of 2018. Demand continues to improve with new orders coming in at a historically strong pace, even though it is slower than last month, and order backlogs have once again risen as a result.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Orders.png))**\n\n&gt; As new order growth decelerated, so too did production. The index fell from 63.0 in October to 60.8 last month. That is still consistent with growth (readings above 50) in production but at the slowest rate since June. One factor that potentially had an impact on the slowdown in production is issues with suppliers. The index for Supplier Deliveries rose for the fourth month in a row in November and reached the highest level since May. Higher readings in the Supplier Deliveries index indicates longer lead times and vice versa. In other words, products from suppliers have been taking longer to reach manufacturers, in turn, impacting productivity.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Prod-Supp.png))**\n\n&gt; Although suppliers appear to have some constraints and production has slowed slightly, business inventories rose for the second month in a row even as more and more firms report that customer inventories are too low. The index for Customer Inventories now sits in the bottom 2% of historical readings after dropping another 0.4 points in November. At 36.3, the index is at the lowest level since June of 2010. That low reading can be considered positive for future production.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Inventorie.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Gains In November Steal From Santa\n\n&gt; What a month November was! Here are some of the highlights:\n\n&gt; * Best month for Dow since January 1987 (11.9%) and best November since 1928\n&gt; * Best month ever for the STOXX 600 (16.7%)\n&gt; * Best month ever for the Russell 2000 (18.3%)\n&gt; * Best month for the S&amp;P 500 (10.8%) and Nasdaq (11.8%) since April 2020\n&gt; * Best month for Dow Transports since October 2011 (12.1%)\n&gt; * Best month from PHLX Semiconductor Index since March 2003 (18.4%)\n&gt; * Best month for Industrials (16.0%) and Financials (16.8%) since April 2009\n&gt; * Second best month ever for energy (28.0%)\n\n&gt; A way better than expected earnings season, a likely split Congress, and major breakthroughs on the vaccine front all helped stocks soar last month,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAdd ongoing support from the Federal Reserve as the cherry on top and we are looking at a truly historic month on many levels.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s all the Dow monthly returns since 1900. Last month was the best return since January 1987. Now before you go out and sell because you see 1987, remember the S&amp;P 500 added another 20% the seven months after the huge gains in early 1987.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It was the best November for the S&amp;P 500 since November 1928.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Small caps soared on the likelihood of taxes staying lower due to a divided Congress and vaccine progress, with the Russell 2000 adding more than 18% for the best month ever, topping the previous record from February 2000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What happens after a big month? Well, history says a 10% monthly gain is quite bullish. In fact, we had a 10% plus rally back in April 2020 and shared this same chart at that time. Sure enough, returns have been strong this time around as well. \u201cThe bottom line is the huge gains in November could actually be the start of something much stronger,\u201d according to Ryan Detrick. \u201cAlso, this was the second month of 2020 with a 10% gain. The only other year to do that? 1982, which kicked off a historic bull market.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Turning to December, this month is widely known to be quite bullish, as Santa comes to town, people feel good, and stocks tend to do well. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1950, December has been the second best month of the year, with only November better. December had been the best month of the year until the historic 9.2% drop in 2018. As a result, December hasn\u2019t been quite as strong over the past 10 and 20 years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Breaking it down even more, a big rally in November can potentially steal some of December\u2019s thunder. As after a 5% or 10% rally in November, the returns in December are more muted. The flipside to this though is if the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 10% for the year (like 2020), then stocks have benefited from some performance chasing and have tended to do better.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What does it all mean? After the historic move in November we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see below average returns in December. We do believe this is a new bull market and lasting economic cycle of growth, but overall sentiment is getting quite stretched and this increases the potential for some near-term weakness.

        "selftext": "**DocuSign crushes earnings and AMC may go bankrupt. Lemonade spiked yesterday over 20% while Pfizer confirmed delivery numbers, let\u2019s talk about this and everything new in the stock market**\n\nHey everyone! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the DOW leading the way up almost 0,3% with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/G9JLH78) close behind up 0,23% and finishing at a new record high while the broader market [SP500](https://ibb.co/7rMK8RY) finished barely down for the day. All 3 of them were trading a lot higher intraday before the most recent Pfizer [news](https://ibb.co/qCXxh0Q) popped up as they are only expected to ship half of the doses that were initially planned, but people spooked at this to much in my opinion. This thing was already known, when they published the candidate data in November, they also [announced](https://ibb.co/cDtdMCy) this number, but people runed away way to fast before going more into the data. Pfizer did not cut supply, they just explained why this happened in this latest headline. It is way better for companies to under-promise and over-deliver than the other way around.\n\nThe [VIX](https://ibb.co/HYrVJNH) also saw a spike around the Pfizer news and finished higher for the day while 59% of companies were advancing with almost 150 new highs and just 3 new lows on below average volume of 11,5 billion shares compared to 11,7 billion shares in the last 20 trading days. [CHART](https://ibb.co/6PVC7Lr)\n\nThe best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/2t3kk7m) yesterday were Energy and Real Estate while Utilities finished more than 1% down for the day with small and mid-cap growth companies [leading](https://ibb.co/sP2rMzd) the way while the large-caps where lagging the market as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/d2cJ7hZ) as all the FAANG stocks were down with Microsoft also joining them. While TESLA continued to be red hot and Alibaba has finally regained some momentum.\n\nHere is the most important [ECONOMIC DATA](https://ibb.co/w6b2bxv) that will be released today as we will get nonfarm payrolls and unemployment rates in the early morning alongside the trade deficit, with Factory orders numbers coming in a bit latter. \n\nThe [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/7GrND6j) are largely higher today not only in the US but also Europe is [gaining](https://ibb.co/mXsLDSb) momentum after Germany manufacturing [orders](https://ibb.co/9NVsjQw) rose for the sixth straight month in October and [Asia](https://ibb.co/7zhQnDt) as the global retail sector saw an [increase](https://ibb.co/k4dCN3f) of 30% in transactions with the whole Black Friday to Cyber Monday period doing very well this year.\n\nWhile yesterday we got numbers on the [NOVEMBER ISM](https://ibb.co/hcmvzgg) as it continued to a sixth straight month of expansion with employment being the biggest gainer in the index with even greater numbers coming in from the [PMI COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/GHcFV4g) with the fastest growth since 2015 as employment rose at the fastest pace in the history of the survey.\n\nAlso, the Jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/7txF4QQ) came in whey lower than expected at 712k more than 60k below estimated with continuing claims dropping for the first time in the last 9 months to under 6 million\n\nMeanwhile we also got some sales number for October in the [SEMI sector](https://ibb.co/VTy4BvP) yesterday, as sales had big increases Y/Y and M/M with all regions ramping up sales on a monthly basis.

At the moment the company still only has a small market cap but I plan to own this for the long-term(5+years) as I expect great things from them.

I don\u2019t think that parks are ever going to be such a big part of the company as streaming and content production will lead the way. But I still like this company very much as it is one of my biggest portfolio holdings and I can see this stock rising to 170$ in the near future.\n\nA couple of companies released earnings yesterday as DocuSign [beat](https://ibb.co/znppzsn) the top and bottom line with billings coming in at $440M way over the consensus of $386M due to many more customers using the electronic signature to close contracts.

        "selftext": "**DoorDash just went public in a crazy overvalued IPO, AirBNB will follow today. Today we get earnings from Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco &amp; more. Let\u2019s talk about this and everything about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/bzmy8C4) drop almost 2% and suffering its biggest loss since October after the 4-day win streak, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Kw3DKxD) also dropped .80% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/9GvPGh5) did much better, down just .35% for the day. We saw a huge spike in the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/RcShWPM) of over 7% closing at the highest level since the 23rd of November.\n\nWe saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/YkqyTgh) as finally some stocks have started to move below the moving averages on about average volume for the day.\n\nWe saw most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/Wfn4Trj) in the red yesterday as Tech and Communications suffered the most dropping more than 1% for the day, with small gains being made in just the Industrials, Energy and Materials sectors as Growth companies suffered the most [yesterday](https://ibb.co/5hQKP88), especially the Large-Caps as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/V9bfV71), with all the big FAANG names and other big tech companies being deep in the red as Apple, Amazon, and Netflix dropped more than 2% for the day, while FB, Google and Microsoft also lost over 1%, but the big loser yesterday was Tesla losing 7% for the day.\n\nToday we will get some critical economic [data](https://ibb.co/qnkdTJz), and if this disappoints, we might see another big drop in the stock market, as the jobless claims will start us off in the early morning.\n\nAlongside this economic data, today the [FDA](https://ibb.co/0906d6L) may approve the emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine, that could lead to a vaccine rollout starting next week. This might help the markets have a more positive reaction if the FDA grants the authorization.\n\nOne good thing in my opinion is that the most recent [survey](https://ibb.co/5WPhj8B) from the AAII showed a slight decrease in Bullish and Neutral investors while the Bearish camp gained more than 4% in the last week. \n\nInvestors had gotten very bullish in the last weeks and this usually is a contrarian indicator, so seeing this small drop is a good thing to see, as I want more and more people to start feeling bearish so I can find and buy stocks at more attractive prices than the current ones. So, the more bearish people get, the more I like to get on and buy stocks. But still\u2026 there is to much of a concentration in the bull\u2019s camp so we might have to wait a little, for more fear to appear in the stock market.\n\nPositive indicators also popped up yesterday as Wholesale [invetories](https://ibb.co/WxPPLpS) rose more than expected in October, as this led the Atlanta FED to maintain they\u2019re Q4 GDP [estimates](https://ibb.co/SBZPtZP), while [Goldman](https://ibb.co/sQ42gCg) also thinks the economy will recover faster than expected starting with Q4 and going on next year.\n\nWhile on the jobs front, October job opening came in [better](https://ibb.co/4VdrTbQ) than expected at over 6,6M, as the job opening rate stood at 6,7% while the quits rate at just 2,2%.\n\nSo, DoorDash went live [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LJtbPtH) at 182$ which is insane in my opinion, the current price gives the company a [valuation](https://ibb.co/kcBcpYW) of over $70B, more than 4 times what the company raised at the last private fundraising six months ago. This valuation is higher than Chipotle, Yum Brands, Domino\u2019s and many others from the food industry.\n\nAnd by the way, don\u2019t forget the stock is [trading](https://ibb.co/CP0Qgbr) at over 30 times sales of this year, which were hugely boosted by the current situation, and that food delivery is really hard for any company, especially one that expects to grow to have a share of more than 50% of the entire world in the sector so that it can justify the current valuation.\n\nOne of the biggest gainers from this is SoftBank as they have a big stake in the company. The shares of SoftBank [skyrocketed](https://ibb.co/GnTSqJf) yesterday to new highs in almost two decades. Like almost every time, the biggest gainers in this IPOs are the banks and not us the retail investors.\n\nWith the other big [IPO](https://ibb.co/Ld0pMdz) yesterday being C3.ai which also opened way above the IPO price, as investors can\u2019t get enough of this stock\u2019s, I don\u2019t think this is a healthy hype for this type of IPOs, investors expect every new company to just skyrocket but, not all of them will, and paying such a high premium is not worth it most time, better wait for a pullback before getting some action on these stocks.\n\nToday we will see [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/Hxd70Tb) go public, as the valuation for this company also gets higher and higher, as they have started selling shares for 68$ even higher than the latest targeted price between 56-60$. And if DoorDash is any [indication](https://ibb.co/8cb3yTs), I don\u2019t think we will be able to get our hands on this stock below 100$. Way above my 70-80$ max price that I am willing to pay, so I am going to wait this out also until they have a pullback, maybe once the first earnings come out, that will be the case. But if somehow the IPO is under 80$ and especially under 70$ I would be willing to get some action.\n\nSome other [news](https://ibb.co/H4Pxqmq) from the stock market which pushed companies like Facebook lower came in when almost every US state filed a lawsuit against the company. In the long run, if this happens just like with the Google lawsuit, the sum of the parts of the company is bigger than the company itself, so I don\u2019t really have any worries long-term about Facebook or Google, as they are the 2 of the biggest advertising platforms in the world.\n\nWhile [REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/0X85Cb4) is starting to make a small comeback in New York, as leases jumped 30% year over year in November to around 4000 new ones, but it will still take a very long time before things go back to where they stood before this year.\n\nAlso, we will have a lot of earnings results today as [Oracle](https://ibb.co/jb5CPPV), Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco, Broadcom and others report.\n\nI expect [Lululemon](https://ibb.co/J2MBWD2) to beat the estimates and the stock to regain momentum after it has struggled since the beginning of September. And just like analysts from Raymond James [said](https://ibb.co/gFL3T0s), the only underlying story problem for investors it\u2019s the valuation, but this will soon go away, as people will buy this brand even more once the reopening begins.\n\nLikewise, [Dave &amp; Buster's](https://ibb.co/L0rY2YS) may have smaller loses than expected last quarter as restaurants weren\u2019t hit so badly like before or like this quarter.\n\nWhile [BROADCOM](https://ibb.co/b5kYKLB) stands to benefit a lot from the recent move in semiconductor industry especially for data centers that stands to benefit them a lot.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/D19qrSc) will also report earnings after the close, and is expected to show over 14% growth in eps and revenues since last year, as they are one of the best retailers to own as a shareholder, even if they always trade at a premium. \n\nAdobe just released earnings while writing this post and here are the excelent results that the company [posted](https://ibb.co/kyzBLjv). Now let's see how the stock reacts, will it go down or up?\n\nSo, guys, don\u2019t forget not to panic sell when you see a big red day in the markets, just look at this Wells Fargo [chart](https://ibb.co/yQwKpt0). \n\nInvestors who added 30% more exposure to equities, and took the money from investment-grade fixed income largely outperform the rest of the investors, while the average investor who does a quarterly rebalancing also did very good and is still up over 10% for the year, while investors who reduced the equity exposure by 50% and put that money into fixed income or kept it in cash are up just 2%. With by far the worst results seen in investors who removed all of the exposure to equities, they are down 6% for the year.\n\nJust be patient, trust the companies that you like and keep investing every time you can. In the long-run markets will always go UP &amp; UP.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "**DoorDash just went public in a crazy overvalued IPO, AirBNB will follow today. Today we get earnings from Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco &amp; more. Let\u2019s talk about this and everything about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/bzmy8C4) drop almost 2% and suffering its biggest loss since October after the 4-day win streak, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Kw3DKxD) also dropped .80% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/9GvPGh5) did much better, down just .35% for the day. We saw a huge spike in the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/RcShWPM) of over 7% closing at the highest level since the 23rd of November.\n\nWe saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/YkqyTgh) as finally some stocks have started to move below the moving averages on about average volume for the day.\n\nWe saw most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/Wfn4Trj) in the red yesterday as Tech and Communications suffered the most dropping more than 1% for the day, with small gains being made in just the Industrials, Energy and Materials sectors as Growth companies suffered the most [yesterday](https://ibb.co/5hQKP88), especially the Large-Caps as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/V9bfV71), with all the big FAANG names and other big tech companies being deep in the red as Apple, Amazon, and Netflix dropped more than 2% for the day, while FB, Google and Microsoft also lost over 1%, but the big loser yesterday was Tesla losing 7% for the day.\n\nToday we will get some critical economic [data](https://ibb.co/qnkdTJz), and if this disappoints, we might see another big drop in the stock market, as the jobless claims will start us off in the early morning.\n\nAlongside this economic data, today the [FDA](https://ibb.co/0906d6L) may approve the emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine, that could lead to a vaccine rollout starting next week. This might help the markets have a more positive reaction if the FDA grants the authorization.\n\nOne good thing in my opinion is that the most recent [survey](https://ibb.co/5WPhj8B) from the AAII showed a slight decrease in Bullish and Neutral investors while the Bearish camp gained more than 4% in the last week. \n\nInvestors had gotten very bullish in the last weeks and this usually is a contrarian indicator, so seeing this small drop is a good thing to see, as I want more and more people to start feeling bearish so I can find and buy stocks at more attractive prices than the current ones. So, the more bearish people get, the more I like to get on and buy stocks. But still\u2026 there is to much of a concentration in the bull\u2019s camp so we might have to wait a little, for more fear to appear in the stock market.\n\nPositive indicators also popped up yesterday as Wholesale [invetories](https://ibb.co/WxPPLpS) rose more than expected in October, as this led the Atlanta FED to maintain they\u2019re Q4 GDP [estimates](https://ibb.co/SBZPtZP), while [Goldman](https://ibb.co/sQ42gCg) also thinks the economy will recover faster than expected starting with Q4 and going on next year.\n\nWhile on the jobs front, October job opening came in [better](https://ibb.co/4VdrTbQ) than expected at over 6,6M, as the job opening rate stood at 6,7% while the quits rate at just 2,2%.\n\nSo, DoorDash went live [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LJtbPtH) at 182$ which is insane in my opinion, the current price gives the company a [valuation](https://ibb.co/kcBcpYW) of over $70B, more than 4 times what the company raised at the last private fundraising six months ago. This valuation is higher than Chipotle, Yum Brands, Domino\u2019s and many others from the food industry.\n\nAnd by the way, don\u2019t forget the stock is [trading](https://ibb.co/CP0Qgbr) at over 30 times sales of this year, which were hugely boosted by the current situation, and that food delivery is really hard for any company, especially one that expects to grow to have a share of more than 50% of the entire world in the sector so that it can justify the current valuation.\n\nOne of the biggest gainers from this is SoftBank as they have a big stake in the company. The shares of SoftBank [skyrocketed](https://ibb.co/GnTSqJf) yesterday to new highs in almost two decades. Like almost every time, the biggest gainers in this IPOs are the banks and not us the retail investors.\n\nWith the other big [IPO](https://ibb.co/Ld0pMdz) yesterday being C3.ai which also opened way above the IPO price, as investors can\u2019t get enough of this stock\u2019s, I don\u2019t think this is a healthy hype for this type of IPOs, investors expect every new company to just skyrocket but, not all of them will, and paying such a high premium is not worth it most time, better wait for a pullback before getting some action on these stocks.\n\nToday we will see [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/Hxd70Tb) go public, as the valuation for this company also gets higher and higher, as they have started selling shares for 68$ even higher than the latest targeted price between 56-60$. And if DoorDash is any [indication](https://ibb.co/8cb3yTs), I don\u2019t think we will be able to get our hands on this stock below 100$. Way above my 70-80$ max price that I am willing to pay, so I am going to wait this out also until they have a pullback, maybe once the first earnings come out, that will be the case. But if somehow the IPO is under 80$ and especially under 70$ I would be willing to get some action.\n\nSome other [news](https://ibb.co/H4Pxqmq) from the stock market which pushed companies like Facebook lower came in when almost every US state filed a lawsuit against the company. In the long run, if this happens just like with the Google lawsuit, the sum of the parts of the company is bigger than the company itself, so I don\u2019t really have any worries long-term about Facebook or Google, as they are the 2 of the biggest advertising platforms in the world.\n\nWhile [REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/0X85Cb4) is starting to make a small comeback in New York, as leases jumped 30% year over year in November to around 4000 new ones, but it will still take a very long time before things go back to where they stood before this year.\n\nAlso, we will have a lot of earnings results today as [Oracle](https://ibb.co/jb5CPPV), Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco, Broadcom and others report.\n\nI expect [Lululemon](https://ibb.co/J2MBWD2) to beat the estimates and the stock to regain momentum after it has struggled since the beginning of September. And just like analysts from Raymond James [said](https://ibb.co/gFL3T0s), the only underlying story problem for investors it\u2019s the valuation, but this will soon go away, as people will buy this brand even more once the reopening begins.\n\nLikewise, [Dave &amp; Buster's](https://ibb.co/L0rY2YS) may have smaller loses than expected last quarter as restaurants weren\u2019t hit so badly like before or like this quarter.\n\nWhile [BROADCOM](https://ibb.co/b5kYKLB) stands to benefit a lot from the recent move in semiconductor industry especially for data centers that stands to benefit them a lot.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/D19qrSc) will also report earnings after the close, and is expected to show over 14% growth in eps and revenues since last year, as they are one of the best retailers to own as a shareholder, even if they always trade at a premium. \n\nAdobe just released earnings while writing this post and here are the excelent results that the company [posted](https://ibb.co/kyzBLjv). Now let's see how the stock reacts, will it go down or up?\n\nSo, guys, don\u2019t forget not to panic sell when you see a big red day in the markets, just look at this Wells Fargo [chart](https://ibb.co/yQwKpt0). \n\nInvestors who added 30% more exposure to equities, and took the money from investment-grade fixed income largely outperform the rest of the investors, while the average investor who does a quarterly rebalancing also did very good and is still up over 10% for the year, while investors who reduced the equity exposure by 50% and put that money into fixed income or kept it in cash are up just 2%. With by far the worst results seen in investors who removed all of the exposure to equities, they are down 6% for the year.\n\nJust be patient, trust the companies that you like and keep investing every time you can. In the long-run markets will always go UP &amp; UP.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "**The latest jobless numbers came in bad while the stock market keeps pushing forward, is a stock market crash coming soon? Let\u2019s talk about this and the latest stock market news**\n\nHey everyone! So let\u2019s start with the recap off Friday as we saw the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HD8WbDT) leading the way up 0,88%, with the [DOW Industrial](https://ibb.co/sCt0FJj) close behind up 0,83% and the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/dDhWbBG) also gaining a decent amount, up 0,7% with all 3 big indexes closing at all-time highs.\n\nWe saw more than \u00be of the [stocks](https://ibb.co/CB6cSMn) advancing despite below average volume as companies either small, mid or large cap value or growth [stocks](https://ibb.co/qCNqN5G) were gaining except large-cap growth. \n\nThe best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/d6f58Mf) were Energy and Materials up over 2% while Utilities finished 1% down on Friday, as Utilities were the only sector to finish the week losing significant ground, with Consumer Discretionary also dropping just 0,12%. With the rest of the sectors in the green, Energy, Health Care, Technology and Communication being the biggest gainers finishing the week up over 2%.\n\n[Utilities](https://ibb.co/Bz8TnvP) have been hit hard in the last year as residential consumers and small businesses have been able to defer paying power bills, this will continue to hold down the sector for now with the debt still increasing.\n\nThe VIX also dropped more than 2% on [Friday](https://ibb.co/18qjBx7) and finished the [week](https://ibb.co/7KyfPxQ) over 5% down as the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/sKhhfx6) from Friday shows us that there were plenty of gains to be made especially in the Energy Sectors as well as Financials, with the big companies from the Tech and Communication sectors doing worse than the rest of the market.\n\nFor the week though this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/92hRtQL) shows that Apple was one of the biggest gainers alongside Semiconductors and Energy Names while Health Care companies like JNJ and Pfizer also did very good.\n\nThe big indexes all finished higher for the [week](https://ibb.co/b3Gb4HN) with the SP500 up 1,7%, the Nasdaq Composite up 2,1% and the Dow up 1% with renewed hopes for a stimulus package being back on the table.\n\nHere are the most interesting economic [reports](https://ibb.co/j84CkLT) for next week, it will be a light week in terms of economic data but still, the market may be volatile and trends may change depending on some of the results.\n\nSo, on Friday [November JOBS](https://ibb.co/r0JPtCs) came in much lower than anticipated, coming in at 245K vs de 610K in October and 469K estimated while the unemployment [rate](https://ibb.co/M9mNBMT) dropped to 6,7% a bit better than expected and down from 6,9% in the past month. Still there are over 10million people unemployed, this number more than doubling since the start on February. The [net addition](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) of jobs in November was the [smallest](https://ibb.co/dWKmZWH) since May as government jobs were the [worst performing](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) while transportation and warehousing jobs continue to increase, as big companies \u2026 aka Amazon has hired almost 3thousand people per day this year. But the bad news is that [long-term](https://ibb.co/HFZFhyC) unemployment is approaching the peaks from the Great Recession and that is not good news for the economy or the stock market as over 3,9 million people have been out of work for at least 6 months. \n\nSo, this is pretty bad news as mortgages in [forbearance](https://ibb.co/NLcDmYP) just slightly declined this week, by just 39K with more and more plans planned to expire in December, over 1M more exactly, more than 40% of active cases.\n\nThis may finally put some extra pressure on the Congress to agree to a relief package maybe even passing it alongside the government [funding bill](https://ibb.co/1qkTnsD) that is still debated and has over 300 issues that the parties don\u2019t agree on. \n\nThis is becoming more and more obvious as [cases](https://ibb.co/6y9FTjV) in the US continue to rise, coming in over 200k in the last 2 days and the economy will soon feel the pressure from this, I expect the next month or two of economic data to not be so good, this may be the time the market sees a 5-10% correction before moving on higher on more positive things like the availability of the vaccine, the passing of the torch In the Presidency and a possible relief package.\n\nYes, this will continue to add to the [US DEBT](https://ibb.co/QjSPcdB), but even though I don\u2019t have any partisan views, a good structured relief bill would do wonders for the economy as a bridge to when the vaccine will finally be widely available.\n\nYes, I know that the global debt is set to reach $200 trillion but the DEBT-to-GDP [ratio](https://ibb.co/LhWkxKJ) is projected to slowly go back down in the next couple of years.\n\nOther numbers that came in on Friday were [Factory ORDERS](https://ibb.co/xm7JJ2Q) which came in better than expected at +1%. While a new Redfin report indicates an increase in [average home prices](https://ibb.co/pXYNGcz) year over year of 16% with the number of pending home [sales up](https://ibb.co/2nw00m3) almost 30% over last year while new listings of home sales is [up just 9%](https://ibb.co/v3nyLPZ) since 2019 and dropping rather fast in the last months with sales of homes going for all time-high [prices](https://ibb.co/gmvRPd7) at 99,5% of the asking price as the real estate market keeps booming along.\n\nThe other number that came in on Friday and was not so good was the [trade deficit](https://ibb.co/42nsy2W), which widened even more in the last month by almost $2B.\n\nSo next week is again pretty slow in [earnings reports](https://ibb.co/Xkr4f4P) with the most interesting ones on being Chewy, GameStop, Adobe, LuluLemon, Dave&amp;Busters, Costco, Oracle and Broadcom.\n\nI own a small stake in all of them except Oracle and GameStop. I don\u2019t see such a big growth opportunity with Oracle while GameStop I believe will struggle to turn around the business with very though e-commerce competition.\n\nWe will also have a number of new [IPOs](https://ibb.co/0jQWwTf) this week from DoorDash, AirBNB, C3.ai, Hydrofarm and Pubmatic. The first 3 are more interesting for myself but I will only take a first look at AirBNB and at what price that stock goes public to maybe get some action, I think we will a much bigger price than the 44-50$ price range to begin with for public trading. I also expect the same thing to happen with DoorDash which has already raised the IPO [pricing](https://ibb.co/Y8VSCpV) to 90-95$ but I am not very interested to buy that stock, as this type of economy has hugely benefited them and it might see a decrease rather than an increase in the next couple of years.\n\nSo, guys I still believe the stock market has upside in front of it, especially in the next 2 years, but you should tread careful for now, I think a possible correction might be just ahead before we move on higher, as you can see in this [CHART](https://ibb.co/9g0bJdj), a wedge formation is continuing to from with more and more tension, I believe there is about a 6,5% possible downside to the market at the moment before eventually getting back on track next year and going toward the 4000 level. And especially with the most recent jobless numbers in the US, I would try to diversify a little more especially with some EAST-ASIA exposure in countries like South Korea, Singapore and China also.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

Under the terms of the agreement, Slack shareholders will receive $26.79 in cash and 0.0776 shares of Salesforce common stock for each Slack share, representing an enterprise value of approximately $27.7 billion based on the closing price of Salesforce\u2019s common stock on November 30, 2020.\n\n&gt; The board of directors of each of Salesforce and Slack have approved the transaction and the Slack board recommends that Slack stockholders approve the transaction and adopt the merger agreement.

        "selftext": "**Basics**\n\nSalesforce is a San Fransisco company that offers **C**ustomer **R**elation **M**anagement software (and hence the symbol CRM). It's not a  joke company like many other shilled on WSB. Salesforce has a market cap of $200 billion and is one of the 30 companies listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).\n\n**What Happened**\n\nThis is the price chart for Salesforce (CRM) last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9sqm4nur2a361.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e71b4aee8595c1e3a5a2f1220fedc017c21153f2\n\nThe sharp drop happened right after the earning call. Was the earnings number disappointing? No, in fact, it was stellar. While the average expected EPS was $0.75 per share, the actual number turned out to be $1.74.\n\nBut Salesforce also announced that it's in the process of acquiring Slack (WORK) for 27.7 billion dollars. Some experts said Salesforce is overpaying for Slack and a huge sell-off followed, resulting in a 40 billion drop in Salesforce market cap.\n\nSo, think about it. Salesforce acquires a company for 27.7 billion and its market cap goes down by 40 billion. In other words, 2+2=3, while usually with a merger you expect 2+2=5.\n\n**What Happened Next**\n\nAfter the initial shock, analysts and the public started to reassess the situation, and many actually praised the acquisition.\n\nJim Cramer (the guy who is the WSB for boomers) [said \"Salesforce Has 100% Upside After Buying Slack\"](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-salesforce-100-upside-173302345.html). He's been shilling the stock on his show every day as well.\n\nMultiple analysts upgraded their Salesforce recommendation to Strong Buy and raised their price target.\n\nSince then, the initial price gap has been filled a little. The price is currently about $226. But a full recovery to pre-EC prices ($240s) and higher seems imminent.\n\nTraders have a \"3-Day Rule\" according to which they don't touch a stock that has fallen sharply and suddenly for 3 days to let it sink to its lowest and see where it goes from there. Those 3 days for CRM are passed and it seems to be rising.\n\n**What's Coming**\n\n[Salesforce Investor day](https://investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2020/Investor-Day-2020/default.aspx) is on Tuesday (Dec 8) in the morning. They will probably clarify the necessity of the slack acquisition and their plans to profitably integrate it into their core business.\n\nAlso, a lot of institutions see this drop as a good opportunity to get in, so the demand is high.\n\n**What Positions**\n\nDo NOT buy weekly or far OTM options. Consider the following (ranked from riskiest to safest):\n\n\\- 230C 12/18/2020\n\n\\- 250C End of year-February\n\n\\- 270C March-May 2021\n\n\\- 300C June-July 2021\n\n\\- The stock (CRM) if you want to hold for 6 months or more.\n\n**When to Buy**\n\nDo not FOMO. I don't want you to buy in pre-market or when it starts high on Monday and then curse my name when it goes down some in 2 hours.\n\nI think this will certainly go up, both short term and long term,  but there will be dips along the way. Wait for the dips to buy in.",

        "selftext": "**Tesla and NIO shares are jumping after good news, while NIKOLA tumbles after GM goes for a much smaller agreement, the stock market loses ground as investors take profits, let\u2019s talk about this and much more about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Welcome! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/2g68hFq) finish about flat for the day, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/cr8CXVz) finished about half a percent down for the day and the [DOW INDUSTRIAL](https://ibb.co/9tFCX3j) was the biggest losers down almost 1% thought all 3 of them were down even bigger intraday. So, both the SP and the DOW finished with record monthly gains, the SP finish up 10,9% for the month above the previous record of 10,2% exactly 40 years ago, while the DOW finished up 11,9% and topped the previous record from 1987 with the Nasdaq also having its best month since the middle of the dot-com boom in 2001. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/4g07SHm) also finished down more than 1% for the day though at one point it almost hit the 23 mark.\n\nAlmost 70% of companies were declining yesterday on above average volume, as I believe investors were taking profits after the big gains from this huge November rally that we had. [CHART](https://ibb.co/0XvY72g)\n\nEnergy was the biggest loser yesterday as the whole [sectors](https://ibb.co/JBTt3Bt) finished down more than 5% while the only 2 sectors in the green were Technology and Health Care as we saw [value plays](https://ibb.co/SBGP6jS) struggling through the day while large cap growth companies were gaining, led by Apple as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/xf7mqtc), which finished the day up over 2% while the whole financial and energy sectors were down big.\n\nHere are the biggest economic [data](https://ibb.co/yV5rQ23) that we are expecting today, as we will see numbers from the MARKIT PMI and the ISM INDEX with vehicle sales arriving later in the day. Also only one big company is expected to report earnings today, [Salesforce](https://ibb.co/YTK19Tr), which is also expected to close a deal today to buy Slack in a cash-only deal. Salesforce is expected to maintain its EPS flat year over year with revenues increasing by more than 16%. I fully expect this to be beaten as this company has gone under appreciated in my opinion as smaller cloud companies have seen the bulk of the stock market gains. If they manage to buy Slack that will be a very positive thing for the company\u2019s future as they will move on to bring a new challenge to the Microsoft bundle. [SLACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/GRjM1wk)\n\nGreat news came in the early morning today, as the OECD [revised](https://ibb.co/mc2dhhd) it\u2019s GDP contraction up 0,3% with a real GDP growth forecasted at over 4% next year and 3,7% in 2022 as China is expected to account for one-third of the world economic growth next year, it might be the time to get more into that part of the stock market as they are expected to have a GDP growth of 8% next year.\n\nAlso, despite dropping more than 3% yesterday, Tesla saw it\u2019s shares bounce back after the [news](https://ibb.co/hdMz1px) that it will be added at full float-adjusted market cap all at once on Dec. 21 due to its ability to accommodate big trades. With other good news coming yesterday also as China finally [approved](https://ibb.co/6n8hzP7) the selling of the Model Y in the country.\n\nAlso relating to the EV world, NIO just [announced](https://ibb.co/m91nYNp) while writing this post an increase of over 100% in delivery numbers for November to over 5 thousand cars. As they company keeps it over 100% year over year deliveries increase and are expected to continue the accelerations of production capacity to accommodate the bigger order numbers.\n\nWhile the hydrogen power Nikola seen it\u2019s share drop yesterday after a worse than expected [deal](https://ibb.co/1nQ2bb5) with GM, as GM has pulled back from its initial far bigger commitment with Nikola as the 2 companies signed a non-binding memorandum that expires at the end of next year, so things may get even worse for Nikola as they also scrapped plans to build the Nikola Badger electric pickup and will refund order deposits for the truck. This resulted in an over 25% drop in Nikola [shares](https://ibb.co/ZMMj5rY) and I expect this to go even lower, as the former CEO Milton will see about 130 million shares unlocked today and a total unlock of 161 million shares, that is more than the [current free float](https://ibb.co/z8vzVTj) shares available for the company at 117 million. If he decides to sell those, that will crush the stock\u2026 So, I think a 15-16 $ price in the near future is possible even with Milton selling his shares.\n\nGood news for 2 of the biggest 3 companies in the world Apple and Amazon [announced](https://ibb.co/RCwxB2s) that they will team up to offer new cloud computing services for AWS users to be able to create and test apps remotely. This will be a big positive for both companies as Amazon will benefit from more cloud services usage while Apple continues to expand the software and services business.\n\nOther great news came for retailers as Shopify [announced](https://ibb.co/KLD25BH) that sales were up 75% year over year as the Black Friday to Cyber Monday sales are booming, this bolds well for companies like Lowe\u2019s, Home Depot, Amazon and many others.\n\nWhile on the vaccine front, Moderna\u2019s candidate is [expected](https://ibb.co/HB8fdnm) to be review in mid-December. I believe the stock has gone way over it\u2019s head and has passed big players in the pharma industry like Vertex and Regeneron though for Moderna this will be they\u2019re first product to be released to the market, I think this stock is well over-hyped at this price, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s worth more than 100$ in the long-run as more vaccines will become available with far cheaper prices.\n\nThe only big company that reported earnings yesterday was [ZOOM](https://ibb.co/FB33wzw) as they beat expectations by [23 cents](https://ibb.co/GJXzrxj). The stock did fall more than 5% in after-hours trading as I expected as the total number of paying customers was only up 17% quarter over quarter with far bigger increases in free users that created bigger bills and drove the profit margins lower to 66% way below the 72% analysts expected. I believe the company faces a though 2021 year as they will have very difficult comps to take on, but I believe this will remain a winner in the longer run. So I sold out of my position on Zoom before this earnings but I will keep an eye on them, if the price drops below 400$ I would be willing to buy the stock once again.\n\nMeanwhile Biden has announced [his top picks](https://ibb.co/8XrnvpQ) for economic appointments and nominations and I believe this are very friendly picks for the stock market as he has gone with more central liberal picks and hasn\u2019t gone to far to the left.\n\nSo I still believe the stock market is in a bull run for the moment with lot of great catalysts like the [PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION](https://ibb.co/T26q9Fz) being more and more certain, and a very likely split government after the Georgia Senate runoff election. So, with at least 2 vaccines right around the corner and treatments for the illness also getting better by the day, this will lead to a gradual reopening of the economy as less and less industries will suffer and the whole economy will eventually go back to normal. Also, the end of the US-China trade war might be in sight or at least a reduction in the trade tensions between the two biggest economies as Biden is close to taking over the Presidency in the US.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "I made a [post with my plays on Sunday](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/k818np/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_last_week/) and entered position on most of them by Tuesday morning. Monday was difficult because most stocks on the list were up 4-5%. Here are my current positions and plan for each of them. It's important to have an idea of what you want to do with your positions. If you aren't comfortable holding something at it's current price point then its time to re-adjust your positions.\n\nI had great gains Tuesday by market close, which got blasted yesterday, and up yet again today. Beauty of this all is by selling these puts I dont mind getting assigned, but I'm also collecting premium on theta while the market decides to play chop with itself.\n\n# Positions\n\n**CRM:** This was from last week's earnings YOLO. Looks like I will be assigned tomorrow around $221 level. My break-even price for the shares when I get assigned will be around $225. I can sell the $225 covered call next week and collect a decent premium, maybe 1%. I'm not worried about this position.\n\n**DKNG**: From my plans this week DKNG was looking at a great target to sell puts at. Currently up 25%, I will close the position once it hits 60% profit.\n\n**FROG**: Honestly, I don't know much about this company. I saw it dropped a decent amount from the highs recently so I sold some puts. This one is kind of a YOLO but premiums were incredible.\n\n**PLTR**: Opened this position yesterday even though it wasn't on my list. It was down a good amount yesterday so I saw an opportunity to sell puts here and collect some premium.\n\n**RKT**: This one has gone according to plan. $20 level is like a brick wall for this stock, I view selling puts around that level to be nearly free money (nothing is ever free).

        "selftext": "This one is quick since the CRM alert, don\u2019t expect them this often. For those of you who missed the CRM Calls purchase point Wednesday morning and know what the fuck you are doing, I think writing the shit out CRM Puts is still a money move. But I suppose some people might want a cheaper call premium play, with less news and shit, and most you fucking idiots need all the help you can get. \n\nBBY is another strong options play, I\u2019ll be looking to purchase early next week based on futures and overall market sentiment. But another drop today closed the deal for me. Sticking with ATM calls due to low cost, and we could definitely fall into the 95 range briefly. \n\nWeekly puts are incredibly cheap, consider mildly protecting your call position over the next two weeks if investing significant equity (sell them fast though!). But this decline is undoubtedly near an end and this bitch is turning around shortly for a couple of reasons. \nDon\u2019t get too technical about the purchase point, current market value is solid as it is. \n\nFirst off I don\u2019t like this company in terms of a long term prospect, given the Covid sales bump combined with the vaccine news, but cases are worse then they\u2019ve ever been. Essentially a 9/11 every couple of days.. So that\u2019s good for this one I guess... but as I will probably explain every time, when I give these alerts I\u2019m telling you the price will move upwards enough within the expiration date to exceed theta, but I don\u2019t provide sell points. \n\nFirst thing first, the boys at Best Buy are doing a good old fashioned buyback this quarter, so that helps make things guaranteed. We are down well below short moving averages and at our five year moving averages for those of you that give a shit. \n\nThe company has been performing exceptionally during quarantine and has a strong bottom line (Yes I know it went down a bit due to logistical costs of online sales). We will definitely see some positive growth over the next month or two, and it\u2019s another clear example of a stock that is being majorly oversold post earnings. \n\nIf you start typing under the impression I think BBY is going to fly to 125 in two weeks you\u2019re a fucking idiot. Don\u2019t bag hold dumb fucks, especially if you buy OTM calls. \n\nDon\u2019t think writing puts is an awful strategy on this one either, but think CRM is still better, and you can soak up way more premium with its current IV and volume.",

        "selftext": "Fk [C3.Ai](https://C3.Ai) with such retarded opening i really hope that it crashes and burns after the hype so we all can pick it up cheap. At this point im not expecting any ipos to be cheap just purely based on the hype were seeing right now. But here is just a DD i did for it. The company has **an interesting business model in which that the company will partner up with another company to create an application that is proven to increase efficiency, reduce cost, track measurements for analysis purposes and so on and will then proceed to sell the same implementation to other companies that may benefit from the applications**. The revenue is mainly based on the subscription models to create steady stream of revenue. The company is lead by Tom Siebel, the pioneer of the customer relationship management software business that sold his company to Oracle for 6 billion in 2006 and C3.AI is his next level creation to revolutionize the world. **C3.AI is listed as one of the top disruptors of 2020 is backed up by Microsoft and spring creek capital with 50 million of stocks and $ 100 million investment respectively. C3.AI announced the partnership with Raytheon Technologies to develop AI solutions for aerospace and defense missions for government customers, including the U.S. Air Force and intelligence community. They also announced partnership with Microsoft and Adobe for a new customer \u2013 relationship management software seeking to comeback Salesforce INC.** The potential **for C3.AI is limitless because of how broad the scope can be. With a successful implementation of an application, C3.AI could easily spin it off to implement such applications to other industries with incredible scalability and tremendous reduction to developing cost**. Before we dive into what the company actually does, here is the overview of the company. \n\n**Financial wise, the company has**\n\n\\- **A whopping 71% yoy growth**\n\n\\- **86% subscription revenue**\n\n\\- **A $271 billion TAM by 2024.** \n\n\\- **Narrowing income loss thanks to the rapid growth**\n\n**The AI technology is a proven technology and is one that is being used daily to help industries moving faster into digital transformation. The currently capability and usage of the AI software is as followed** \n\n\\- **Make 1.1Billion predictions per day**\n\n\\- **Has 4.8million machine learning models in production use**\n\n\\- **Has 622 million sensors generating data for the C3.AI suite**\n\n\\- **Has 770 unique enterprise and extraprise source data integration** \n\n\\- **Has 50 Million businesses and consumers touched daily**\n\n**Notable market successes:**\n\n\\- **Banks are able to enhance securities lending optimization with estimated value of 14 billion in additional daily trades deployed in 52 weeks**\n\n\\- **Healthcare managements are able to enhance production optimization with estimated value of 300% increase in unit production deployed in 4 weeks**\n\n\\- **Oil and gas companies are able to predictive maintenance for offshore oil rigs and is able to recapture $28million per year in avoided shutdowns** \n\nWhat is C3.AI\n\nC3.ai is an enterprise AI software company that provides software as a service, applications that enable the rapid deployment of enterprise AI applications of extraordinary scale and complexity that offer significant social and economic benefit. \n\n**Two primary software solutions:**\n\n**1.** **C3 AI suite: designed to allow customers to apply design, develop, and deploy enterprise AI application to any type (basically a platform that allows you to develop your own applications)**\n\n**2.** **C3 AI Application: include a large and growing family of industry specific and application specific turnkey Ai solutions that can be immediately installed and deployed (a prebuilt application that is ready to go for implementations)**\n\nThe market entry growth strategy of C3.AI is focus on partnering and coordinating with lighthouse customers (the big companies including AWS, Baker Huges, FIS, Google, IBM and Microsoft) to create a proven and scalable applications that work to increase efficiency, cut down on costs and to record measurements on a massive scale for analysis purposes. With the established applications. \n\n**C3.AI is then able to** \n\n**1.** **Expand those same use cases across similar companies**\n\n**2.** **Establish middle market sales organizations, including tele sales, and online sales**\n\n**3.** **Leverage on marketing partners as enterprise and mid-market distribution channels**\n\nReal world user case:\n\nEngie \u2013 largest power producer in the world with\n\n\\- 114.4 GW power production capacity\n\n\\- $67 billion annual revenue in europoors money\n\n\\- 153k employees, operated in 70 counties \n\nWith the partnership with Engie, C3.Ai developed and deployed performance optimization for gas power plants, efficiency optimization of heating and cooling plants, energy analysis and management for enterprise and consumer customers, and anomaly detection of wind turbines. **C3 was able to bring the scalability required to build industrial AI based application with over 1million sensors, 5 million end points and 17mil measurements per day with the end result of bringing estimated 1.5 billion in annual economic benefits**\n\n\\- Wind turbines with in 12 weeks of deployment sees 2-3% increase in performance resulting in 15-22Mil annual economic value\n\n\\- Heating and cooling plants see 2-3% saving in energy consumption costs with $3mil annual economic value\n\n\\- Application in analyze energy for metered facility on the Ohio State university campus and is expected to see 25% energy saving within 10 years within 16 weeks of deployment \n\n\\- Application to analyze and forecast consumption for electricity and gas retail customers in France of 2.6Mil electricity consumers and 8.6mil has consumers with deployment of 6 months \n\n**Revenue model**\n\n\\- **Term subscriptions of the C3.AI Suite**\n\n\\- **Term subscriptions of C3.AI applications**\n\n\\- **Monthly runtime fee of C3 AI Applications and customer-developed application built using the C3.AI suite, usage based upon CPU- hour consumption**\n\n\\- **Professional services fees associated with training and assisting customers**\n\nIn the case of Engie, C3.AI would be making money from subscriptions to C3.AI suite and applications, setting up required trackers for measurements, developing AI applications, a monthly runtime fee if Engie is continuing to develop new applications with C3.AI. With the proven applications and set up, C3.AI then would be able to sell them to other companies that could also benefit from same implementation. **With Biden focusing on green energy infrastructures, one could expect the demand of the applications to increase.**\n\nTheir AI has also been used in sectors like utilities, banking, aerospace &amp; defense, healthcare, retail, telecommunications, smart cities, and transportation. **With already proven and prebuilt applications listed below that could be implemented into broader and more general sector.** \n\n\\- **Anti-money laundering**\n\n\\- **COVID-19 Data lake**\n\n\\- **AI CRM**\n\n\\- **Energy management**\n\n\\- **Fraud detection**\n\n\\- **Inventory optimization**\n\n\\- **Predictive maintenance**\n\n\\- **Production schedule optimization**\n\n\\- **Readiness**\n\n\\- **Sensor health**\n\n\\- **Supply network risk** \n\n**As C3.Ai continues to work with various more different sectors to create more applications, C3.AI will be able to reach into more boarder market. With already established applications in various broad sectors, C3.AI is going to take AI to the next level by focusing on deep penetration into business solutions, aerospace and defense with the partnership with Microsoft, Adobe and Raytheon Technologies to fully dominate the sectors.** \n\n **TLDR:** \n\n**There is none cause im too lazy to type one.**",

        "selftext": "Currently allocating the majority of my portfolio to SPACs as they\u2019ve been paying up well lately! Here\u2019s a list with concise commentary (concise because I don\u2019t enter into details of DD, but comment/ask away):\n\n- DMYD - world\u2019s 2nd largest supplier of data for online gambling/betting companies. This industry is growing fast and steady\u2026it is very hot atm, but imo is being shadowed by speculative industries like EV/Autonomous driving/AI. When more people realize this industry is a sure thing, I expect healthy returns!\n\n- THCB - maker of EV batteries, there\u2019s rumors they\u2019ll be supplying Tesla, read somewhere they\u2019re preparing to build facilities right next to Tesla\u2019s future production site in Germany. To me this is a pure speculative play, if the rumors get confirmed I\u2019d expect the stock to double from current levels of 15-17$. NOTE: they have an unbinding letter of intent to merge, not yet a done deal, or else I suspect the stock would already be past 20$ based on those rumors.\n\n- ROCH - this company has exclusive rights to use a patented methodology to recycle plastics. The patent owner is P&amp;G (Procter &amp; Gamble). What really turned my head was that the company is backed by P&amp;G, L\u2019Oreal, Total, and some other mammoths\u2026while being priced fairly cheap with lots of upside potential, this is an investment worth looking at!\n\n- GHIV - large mortgage seller with huge recent growth, plus expected further growth in the near future. What triggered my attention is that the company is already committed to paying dividends even before going public (to me this is unheard of\u2026we\u2019ve all gotten used to companies that lose money\u2026and here\u2019s one that\u2019s not only profitable it\u2019s also ready to pay dividends right away!)\n\n- BFT - fintech business, like a smaller version of Stripe. Think this was a record breaking SPAC that priced the company at 9b pro forma. The whole online payments/banking is hot atm, I don\u2019t expect this business to ever compete with PayPal but if it keeps growing as it is, it\u2019ll definitely be acquired (and we all know how acquisitions pay off! Salesforce just bought Slack for 28b, it was half that a week before the offer!)\n\n- STPK - battery optimization AI. It\u2019s complex stuff I couldn\u2019t bother to fully understand, but ticks all the boxes for the current speculative market\u2026so I got a small position because we all know the current market isn\u2019t too worried with fundamentals, it\u2019s more concerned with keywords.\n\n- PSTH and IPOF - both don\u2019t have a target to merge yet, but both have lots of potential! PSTH is  a 4b SPAC lead by Bill Ackman, and the latter is the largest SPAC (1.6b) from a series of successful deals by Social Capital Hedosophia. I expect at least one of these to eventually catch a huge fish, like Sportradar, Stripe or even Bloomberg!\n\nAlso LAZR I bought as a SPAC (GMHI) for 15$. I think the CEO is going far\u2026 people like him have the potential to become the next Elon Musks, Mark Zuckerbergs or Bill Gates. It may still be early to call, but from his track record I\u2019m very optimistic. I mean he started the company at 17, dropped out of Stanford, is backed by Peter Thiel, is a billionaire at age 25, seems obsessed in his mission to develop, improve and deliver\u2026in time we will see.",

        "selftext": "**SALESFORCE CRUSHES EARNINGS AND ACQUIRES SLACK, NIKOLA STOCK CONTINUES TO TUMBLE AS WE FINALLY GET THE FIRST VACCINE APPROVAL IN THE UK, LET\u2019S DISCUSS THIS AND MORE ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET**\n\nHey everyone! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PzNKCYh) leading the way up almost 1,3%, finishing at a new record high, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/syB7wP4) also up over 1,1% and finishing at a new record high, while the [DOW](https://ibb.co/HggpWGF) had smaller gains but was still up to intraday records before finishing over +0,6% for the day. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/SDCq7vf) rose for the day after opening at 20,2 and as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/0n1TDKt) big gains were led by the FAANG stocks with Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix gaining over 2% for the day while Amazon and Microsoft also were up at least 1%. This pulled the big indexes higher as they account for a big part of them.\n\nOver 60% of companies were advancing on average volume while companies moving above important moving averages continued to climb as we are going into a very risky market, as to many companies are trading high at the moment and are due for a correction. [CHART](https://ibb.co/DfgJ12R)\n\nThe biggest gaining [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/T8NPW6W) yesterday were Communications, Financials and Technology with most sectors being in the green, except industrial, as the laggards from yesterday were small cap growth companies and especially those from CHINA, like NIO, Alibaba and others, that have suffered from the recent news that the US is looking to delist some of them if they do not meet new standards. [CHART](https://ibb.co/gmpRVWW)\n\nHere are the most interesting economic events and data for [TODAY](https://ibb.co/cyp7x5W), as we will see how Mortgage Applications and ADP Jobs are going. Afterwards a couple of FED leaders will speak before we can take a look at how the Petroleum Inventories are going.\n\nWhile [GREAT NEWS](https://ibb.co/1d6y1yh) started to pop in the early morning as the UK has become the first country to authorize the Pfizer vaccine for use.\n\nThis news are already baked in the market in my opinion as investors were already expecting this to happen sooner rather than later, but this are still very good news to hear, as a confirmation is still great to have, rather than just expectations. I expect the US will soon follow in the next 10-14 days to approve both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine, that might just have a bigger impact on the stock market, but I would be careful until then, as we might get a correction in the stock market after this huge rally before we can move on even higher, as I fully expect this bull market to continue into 2021 and 2022.\n\nWell yesterday, as I expected Nikola [tumbled again](https://ibb.co/2hzPCJL) after the insider lockup period expired, as only the possibility of Milton selling his shares has spooked the market after an already bad day with the GM deal disappointing investors. As the original deal is null and void with GM not taking any stake in Nikola or helping with the engineering or manufacturing of the Badger pickup truck. The only good thing in sight for the company is the possible hydrogen fueling station network partnership by year end as announced by the management. I maintain my sell opinion on this stock as I predicted a 15-16$ in the future when the stock was trading over 20, I think it has more room to go down, it might go to single digits in the long run, as the company has become very shady after the fiasco with the misleading tactics and no breaking new fuel cell technology.\n\nOn the other hand, Salesforce crushed [earnings](https://ibb.co/XCzz5Mz) expectations, as they beat the EPS by almost 1$ and had a revenue beat of over 160 million$. They also raised [guidance](https://ibb.co/JRf2G3j) for both revenue and EPS for next year way above the consensus while also maintaining cash and equivalents at over $9B, up 45% for the year.\n\nThe company also officially [announced](https://ibb.co/whYVfzC) the acquiring of Slack in a deal worth almost $28B. This will result in the Slack software being incorporated in every aspect of Salesforce cloud offering. This 2 will be the biggest competitors yet for Microsoft. So, I believe after the dust settles, and CRM stock finally gets back on track, we will have a good long term growth opportunity with Salesforce.\n\nSlack also reported earnings yesterday after the bell as the company [posted](https://ibb.co/N6Qnw7M) a beat of estimates and an increase in paid customers and billings.\n\nWe also got some [numbers](https://ibb.co/6rNGCnZ) from Cyber Monday sales as the spending increase over 15% but, this was not enough to meet all the estimates as holiday shopping has been probably spread through the whole month of November and will continue to go strong in December in my opinion.\n\nWhile on the economic front news were not so great as the [November ISM](https://ibb.co/3yM4Hwc) index fell shy of expectations with light vehicles [sales](https://ibb.co/PG09TRf) dropping by almost 1 million from last month and are way below the year ago period.\n\nBut we did see some big improvements in [construction spending](https://ibb.co/cc5z2wq), as the numbers came in about half a % better than consensus and are up 3,7% year over year while the [November PMI](https://ibb.co/6JzRnJ1) index saw the biggest improvement in over 6 years.\n\nThe biggest earnings that will be released today will be from [CrowdStrike](https://ibb.co/RvSk8SJ) and [Okta](https://ibb.co/RDrYy8K), as I expect both of them to turn out a positive EPS, as we might see some momentum in this stocks if they don\u2019t disappoint.\n\nI greatly expect the [IPO](https://ibb.co/pKzxhmK) of AirBNB, as this could become a company that will benefit a lot from the reopening of the world in the next year or two.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "SalesForce ($CRM) is a business that I have used and admired for awhile now. I think Marc Benioff is a great innovative CEO. They have great financials, growth, and a wide competitive moat. I've wanted to own them for awhile but the price seemed to high for what I typically buy.  \n\n\nI actually do like their acquisition of Slack. Wall street seems to think they overpaid and has punished them, down more than 10% on the news and 20% in the last 2 weeks, despite a very strong quarter. Overall their growth is incredibly strong, their margins are 80%, and although $200B valuation seems insane, if they continue their current growth and build out their CRM, and businesses like Tableau and Slack, they could more than justify it and catch up to the rest of the cloud kings.  \n\n\nWhat are people's thoughts on the acquisition and CRM's current price?",

        "selftext": "The last several week I've been posting my plays by selling cash-secured-puts and also buying shares. I thought maybe you guys here at r/StockMarket might appreciate this post. This week I closed up roughly $1,500 which was about 2% of the buying power I used for my plays. The market performed the same, so all in all was a pretty solid week and am happy with the positions I entered, the ones I closed, and also the ones I still have open.\n\nI get a lot of messages from people asking me when do I sell my position if it goes against me? When should I sell to take profit? When a position goes against me I will try to roll it out to a further down strike price and further out expiration date. I will usually do this only once, if I feel it. Otherwise I will just take assignment. As for taking profits, if I get a quick 60% in just a day or two, I will close and look for a better opportunity.\n\nAs an example, here are my positions I screen-shotted mid-week when I was getting absolutely hammered, and screen-shotted again Friday afternoon just before closing some out. You can see the positions are all the same, I wasn't stressed about having a red week since I was something like 16 wins out of 16 plays going into this week. Looks like I'll keep the win streak going for now. CRM is my only position looking contested right now.\n\n**What am I doing?**\n\nI do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 4 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.\n\nI watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays &amp; levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.\n\n# Here's a few things regarding my strategy\n\n**1.** I don't over-leverage with spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a \"Theta Gang\" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.\n\n**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.\n\n**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.\n\n**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling and shares!\n\nHonestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.\n\n# Open Positions From Last Week\n\n**CRM:** This was an earnings YOLO that went against me. I sold the $230 strike and the stock dropped from $240 to $220 after earnings. This play expires next week so if the stock price gets a pop back over $230 I will most likely be able to close at 50% profit. Similarly if it goes down I will most likely be getting assigned. This option will be extremely volatile since it's close to being ATM and also expires this week.\n\n**PLTR:** This ticker wasn't on my watchlist last week, but when I saw it trading down 10% the other day I had to sell some puts. IV was/is incredibly high so I have almost a 15% return I am collecting through premium. My plays expire end of December, but are already in the green.\n\n**TDOC:** I'm expecting this to continue it's uptrend and I don't believe my strike will get contested, but you never know. I will hold this until closer to expiration or if I get to 80%+ profit.\n\n# Master Plays This Week\n\nI've added a range of tickers with lower stock prices that I'm watching so you folks with smaller accounts can look at some options as well.\n\n**FROG ($68)**\n\n[Frog Chart](https://imgur.com/ZGeQ1YM)\n\nI can't say I know much about FROG (Frog LTD), but I do know they have super high IV and premiums are verrrry nice. The stock was trading down 30% from the October highs, but has caught some momentum recently and is up 10% from the lows. Chart is still really new and trends are difficult to identify. I like the risk to reward selling a $60 put at the support line where it's bounced off of multiple times.\n\n**Positions I'm Watching:**\n\n1. Jan 15, 2021 $60 put for $3.50 or $350 premium. Return: 5.8%. Break-even share price: $56.50.\n2. Shares with price target $71-75\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DKNG ($49)**\n\n[DKNG chart](https://imgur.com/TpyFbai)\n\nDKNG has been bouncing around with no clear direction. Trend is still up and has some support in the lower to mid $40s and a very strong support at $36, but that would be a 30% drop from here. In my opinion any dip into $45 will be bought. I like this ticker for long-term as well.\n\n**Positions I'm Watching:**\n\n1. Dec 31, 2020 $45 put for $1.80 or $180 premium. Return: 4.0%. Break-even share price: $43.20\n2. Shares with price target $50+\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CRSR ($35)**\n\n[CRSR chart](https://imgur.com/uyV19xh)\n\nCRSR chart has gone up and up since IPO. It has a huge breakout 2 weeks ago with an even quicker reversal last week. After the sharp reversal to the downside I like the entry point with selling some January 15 puts at the $25 strike. To lose on this position the stock would need to drop another 35% from current levels.\n\n**Positions I'm Watching:**\n\n1. Jan 15, 2021 $25 put for $1.00 or $100 premium. Return: 4.0%. Break-even share price: $24.00\n2. Shares with price target $37-40\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SFIX ($35) - Earnings YOLO**\n\n[SFIX chart](https://imgur.com/bpsUizB)\n\nSFIX has been on an uptrend without merit. Revenues and profitability have been on the decline since covid. They tanked hard on their last 3 earnings on lackluster performance and dropped 15% on the last earnings report alone. Not good. For that reason IV and premiums are super high for next week's earnings report, Tuesday after market close. Normally I would say this chart is super over-extended, but the stock just dropped 20% last week. I like the level it's currently at to sell some puts for earnings here.\n\n**Positions I'm Watching:**\n\n1. Dec 18, 2020 $32 put for $1.60 or $160 premium. Return: 5.0%. Break-even share price: $30.40\n2. I don't recommend shares for this as since the stock is super volatile and can swing in any direction. I prefer selling puts and getting assigned the shares at another 10% discount, if it gets there. Otherwise I collect 5% return on premium in just 2 weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PLTR (23$)**\n\n[PLTR chart](https://imgur.com/54xJ6Yx)\n\nPLTR is similar to CRSR where the chart is too new to identify trends. The stock recent tripled before coming back down to earth. Currently sitting at around $23-24. We might see it come back down to $18, but I like the entry point here selling some puts 3-4 weeks out.\n\n**Positions I'm Watching:**\n\n1. Jan 8, 2021 $20 put for $1.50 or $150 premium. Return: 7.5%. Break-even share price: $18.50.\n2. I also like the entry here for a long-term hold. Shares could have a great return in the next 6 months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RKT ($19)**\n\n[RKT chart](https://imgur.com/meQRjq8)\n\nRKT was on my list last week, but for some reason my post missed the chart and description. I added it again here. This ticker has been consolidating for 3 months just looking to explode to the upside. $20 has been a magnet recently and doesn't stray too far from the price. IV is also quite high for this name and can provide some good return. I'll be selling strikes below the $20.\n\n**Positions I'm Watching:**\n\n1. Dec 31, 2020 $19 put for $0.95 or $95 premium. Return: 5.05%. Break-even share price $18.05.\n2. Similar to PLTR I see good long-term return here for shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Last week's positions](https://imgur.com/NUNuXq0)",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, December 2, 2020**\n\nThe market rallied throughout the session after opening in the red, with the indexes holding near-record levels, with market participants optimistic that the approval and distribution of a vaccine could come relatively soon. Coronavirus cases in the United States are still on the rise, unfortunately. \n\nIn recent weeks, investors have been cheering positive vaccine developments from companies like Pfizer (PFE), Moderna (MRNA), and AstraZeneca (AZN), fueling optimism that distribution of an effective medical solution for COVID-19 is coming relatively soon. Moderna and Pfizer have already submitted their vaccines to European and American health administrations for emergency use authorization. According to CBS News, during a conference call, Vice President Mike Pence told state governors that distribution of a vaccine could begin as early as mid-December. According to audio obtained by CBS News, Vice Presiden Pence said, \u201cWe strongly believe the vaccine distribution process could begin as soon as the week of December 14. With the news that Moderna is joining Pfizer in submitting for emergency use authorization, we continue to be on pace.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the number of patients hospitalized with COVID set another record, with the Center of Disease Control (CDC) Director warning of difficult times ahead if the curve is not flattened again soon. As of yesterday, there are more than 98,000 people hospitalized, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Hospital systems across the nations are warning they are reaching capacity and are lacking resources. In response, Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC warned, \"The reality is, December and January and February are going to be rough times. I actually believe they're going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation, largely because of the stress that's going to be put on our health care system.\u201d\n\nYesterday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers unveiled a new $908 billion targeted stimulus. The lawmakers say their plan aims to find common ground on some of the most pressing issues, and it could be used as a framework for the next stimulus package. The bill includes money for local and state governments, additional business protections, and to fund vaccine research and distribution. House Speaker Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have both supported the bill. It is unlikely any sort of bill will pass through Congress but we will keep you updated surrounding this situation.\n\nHighlights\n\n* The UK became the first country to approve Pfizer\u2019s (PFE) coronavirus vaccine.\n* Salesforce (CRM) fell more than 9% after the company announced it would be purchasing workplace messaging software company Slack (WORK) in its largest-ever deal valued at $27.7 billion, confirming a week\u2019s worth of media reports over the tie-up. The announcement coincided with Salesforce\u2019s third-quarter earnings results, which topped estimates, though its fourth-quarter profit guidance disappointed.\n* United Parcel Service (UPS) was forced to impose shipping restrictions on some large retailers such as Gap Inc. and Nike Inc. this week, an early sign that the pandemic-fueled online shopping season is stretching delivery networks to their limits. UPS is metering the flow of packages into its network to preserve its performance during one of the busiest shipping weeks of the year. \n   * Fedex (FDX) has followed suit to an extent by increasing shipping prices and holding merchants to volume agreements\n* Alphabet (GOOG) announced the acquisition of Actifo, a company that specializes in data back-up and recovery in the event of a disaster\n* Salesforce (CRM) target increase by JMP Securities from $272 to $282 at OUTPERFORM\n* Fate Therapeutics (FATE) target raised by Barclays from $60 to $70 at OVERWEIGHT. Stock currently around $61.\n* NetApp (NTAP) target raised by Credit Suisse from $54 to $64 at OUTPERFORM. Stock gained 10% for the day to close at $59\n* Peleton (PTON) target raised by Needham &amp; Co. from $125 to $140 at BUY. Stock rallied to $117 intra day and closed even at $112\n* Red Rock Resorts $RRR target raised by Macquarie from $28 to $30. Stock currently around $22\n* Suncor $SU target raised by Barclays from $29 to $31. Very notable because stock only around $16.\n* UnitedHealth Group $UNH with multiple target bullish price target increases from notable analysts. Average price target around $375 and rating of OVERWEIGHT\n* Children\u2019s Place (PLCE) was up almost 8% on the day after Wedbush increased price target to $48 from $32 yesterday\n\n\"If your dreams don't scare you, they are too small\" -Richard Branson",

WORK was a pandemic stock with a solid product and real revenue, and still, they managed to miss the insane valuations that others got due to Microsoft's hard reaction (scared?) and frankly bad PR from Slack. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now What?**\n\nWhat do I know. But all future indicators and past performance point to major tendies. CRM price targets paint a great story for 2021. Salesforce was in a major upward trend before the Slack acquisition announcement. Benioff has demonstrated to be a great dealmaker. The Slack acquisition reinforces Salesforce's intention to dominate the enterprise software landscape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou know that \"stonks only go up\", but did you know that Salesforce is part of the Dow as of Aug 2020 and belongs to the S&amp;P 500? Who do you think will prop the them up going forward? You got it right, Sales fucking force dot com.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTD;LR: Not gonna tell you what to do, but I have 250 CRM and 500 WORK shares. 5x 1/08 $225C, and 1x 12/18 $230C. Planning to load up on calls once the upward trend becomes clear (to avoid getting wiped out, yes I'm being conservative, but my Slack play paid out well).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhatever you do, please be careful with way OTM calls and short expiration. A lot of people were burned by WORK because of that. Salesforce is a $200B company that is not a meme stock; for options, it moves slowly until it doesn't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR^(2): CRM + WORK = \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": " SNOWflake earnings come out today! Regardless of results, I want to try explaining what SNOW does in layman's terminology so everyone can have an understanding.\n\nI work at a Fortune 100 company, leading a tech team. I've seen a lot of companies start investing in SNOWflake to scale their digital and analytical capabilities. Here's a summary of what they do:\n\n\u00b7 Snowflake solves for a really important problem in Corporate America's IT, where IT is constantly under pressure to deliver the most value with the least amount of work. \n\n\u00b7 Here's an analogy for what SNOW does - imagine you had important customer data that will allow you to figure out who are the most profitable customers (so you can tell your sales reps to focus on those leads first). However, that data is spread amongst multiple tables in different file formats such as Word, Excel, and PDF. You need a simple way to consolidate that data in order to make sense out of it. SNOW enables that - we can take data from multiple sources such as big cloud platforms like Amazon web services and Microsoft, and combine it with internal on-premise data so we can have one consolidated structured / semi-structured data set so all your data scientists can understand how one data point (e.g., age, education level) correlates with profitability.\n\nThis is why [salesforce.com](https://salesforce.com/) and Warren Buffet invested in SNOW, because SNOW makes life easy, enable all the analytics that corporations are looking for, and allows partners like Salesforce to overcome any internal IT resource constraints that they are selling their services to. The buzzwords you all hear about from Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence, are all reliant on having the right data infrastructure in place. Regardless of how earnings today, this is a long term play if you believe that all corporations are investing in this space. Earnings come out today! \n\nHope this helps, I'm curious if others have better analogies or simpler ways to explain the business!",

The grid you\u2019re currently on is using technology that was developed in the 1920s. You gotta build these lines from the source plant to the homes and a significant amount of electricity will be lost in transit. On top of this, the infrastructure has been criminally neglected since 80s in the USA and elsewhere. Do you think these things are maintained? Of course somebody is maintaining them isn\u2019t it? Nope (only superficially). The California fires that PG&amp;E plead guilty to, that killed about a hundred people in 2018 were a testament to the current state of maintenance that goes on. Link: [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html)\n\nTesla is building a future where micro grids and macro grids would trade electricity. Imagine your neighborhood with solar on each roof and battery storage in each house. You\u2019ll be trading amongst yourself (neighborhood). And your neighborhood will be trading electricity with the macro grid. This is only possible with a cutting-edge AI powered software. Tesla is building it. Welcome to the glimpse of the future. This is how it will be everywhere. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) **Develop Grid Level Battery Storage**  **\u2013** In the future the majority of the energy will be obtained from Sun (think of this like indirect fusion source. Sun is a giant fusion reactor in the sky and you\u2019ll be tapping into a microscopic percentage of energy that Sun is sending towards Earth. This microscopic percentage is enough to run the entire civilization which you think utilizes gigantic amount of energy. Everything is relative. So what you\u2019re really consuming globally is laughable at the relative scale of energy Sun is sending towards your planet. \n\nSince Sun doesn\u2019t shine at night, and sometimes it\u2019s cloudy, you gotta build battery farms to store energy for night. Nothing too complicated conceptually. Tesla is building products known as Megapacks that on the face of it beat Peaker Plants that are powered by fossils in terms of cost, space required, and efficiency. The energy industry is all about cost, so Tesla has won. This revolution has just begun. Testament to Tesla\u2019s supreme product is Australia which decided to double Tesla\u2019s battery farm in terms of capacity because it saved them so many millions. The technology has been proven and Tesla is now getting contracts bigger than the previous ones every year. For instance PG&amp;E is currently building the largest battery farm in the US using Tesla\u2019s Megapacks. This part of their business is going to be equal to auto business within this decade. Future is now, old man. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) **Develop consumer/business level battery storage \u2013** You need to have localized power generation and storage as well as grid level. This is the future. For instance, when all 2 billion of the vehicles (as of today) go electric in 30 years, the global electricity requirement is going to double. DOUBLE. So you gotta have localized storage and production. When you\u2019ll buy a new house, a significant part of the cost will be the local storage battery plant. You wouldn\u2019t buy a house that doesn\u2019t have its own plant. Tesla is building something known as Tesla Powerwalls. Again, the leading product in its segment, to address this market that has barely begun to develop. This is the future. \n\n4) **Develop solar panels and solar roofs \u2013** Cost of manufacturing solar panels at this point is the cost of doing dry walls. It\u2019s really cheap and Tesla will ride down the cost curve and be able to compete with Chinese subsidy-fuelled solar panel cost decline. This is because Tesla will be building the solar panels locally in different continents and that would trump over the logistics cost addition of importing from China. So it\u2019s up to you whether you wanna import from China or get the entire package from Tesla. Barely any difference in cost would exist. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe solar roofs do not have competition. This market does not exist. This is a very difficult product to manufacture but every rich person would get it on their roof and eventually everyone. Initially the spurt growth would come from the large builders who\u2019d be ordering en masse for large-scale projects as well as rich people. Tesla has come out with one design, soon there will be 4 and that\u2019s that. Tesla will dominate this market which they\u2019re building from scratch. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5)** **Develop company OS for running the entire company from factory to sales. (They don't use Salesforce, etc.)** **-** So you thought Tesla was using Salesforce? ;) Did you think Tesla was able to achieve the profitability and the margins and the customer satisfaction that they did with the help of Salesforce? ;) For anybody aware of the B2B software, you know how big of a deal this is. Using an industry software that\u2019s the standard prevents you from iterating quickly over your business processes. You become a slave to the features that exist in these Salesforce like software. Tesla studied all of this in 2012, and gave a public remark that you can still find, that the industry standard software would not be sufficient. They have finally realized their goal of Tesla Company OS. They run everything from factories to sales on this software. They run literally everything that Tesla does on this. This is something that other companies cannot even conceptualize to make because it\u2019s laughable generally to even think something like \u201cwe\u2019re gonna make our own business software\u201d. Imagine GM thinking this. On top of this, this Tesla Company OS engineering team is badass and they quickly iterate and add new feature and process whenever required. THIS IS THE REASON TESLA ACHIEVED PROFITIBILITY AND HIGHEST MARGINS. THIS. NOTHING ELSE. THIS SOFTWARE. (But don\u2019t tell anybody about this, okay? ;) )   \n   \n \n\n**6)** **Selling Insurance Products \u2013** Oh no, Warren. He once famously said when asked about Tesla insurance \u201can auto company is about as likely to succeeed in insurance business as an insurance company is likely to succeed in auto business\u201d. Little did he understand insurance of automobiles of the future. Tesla has all the data with regards to your cars. More data than any other insurance company can ever have. Tesla has 360\\* camera data, vehicle sensor logs, etc. All of this is proprietary. You can maybe gain access to GPS and front-cam via dash camera if you\u2019re a 3rd party insurance company, but you cannot compete with Tesla on the magnitude and diversity of data that Tesla has. Getting into insurance is a difficult process, but Tesla will prevail and eventually offer it everywhere. They\u2019re currently offering it in California only. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**7)** **Develop RNA microfactories for vaccines \u2013** As per Elon, he doesn\u2019t expect this to be a big product from a finance stand-point but they\u2019re developing these machines to build cutting-edge vaccines. You can solve diseases like it\u2019s a software problem and who knows how much Tesla will decide to get into this market. They\u2019ve currently partnered with CureVac in Germany. Remember Bill Gates saying that Elon doesn\u2019t know anything about vaccines? Well, he\u2019s an idiot. Because Tesla is partnered with CureVac \u2013 a company BILL GATES IS INVESTED IN TO BUILD VACCINES. IT IS ELON WHO IS MAKING THE MACHINES THAT BUILDS VACCINES FOR BILL GATES. Idiot, consumed by jealousy. Next.   \n   \n \n\n**8)** **Materials engineering for alloys used for making their vehicles \u2013** Oh no\u2026Oh no. The material engineering is one of the most difficult things to do on this planet. There simply aren\u2019t people smart enough to even understand basics of it. Testament to this? THE TEAM THAT DOES MATERIALS ENGINEERING FOR SPACEX is the same team that does it for Tesla. Why? Nobody else knows how to do it. Please contact Tesla if you know how to do it. These alloys add to the advantage of safety and weight of their vehicles. Furthermore, the armor glass which will be built of Cybertruck is not something you can just buy off the self. This is the latest thing they\u2019re building. Don\u2019t tell anybody that Tesla uses its own alloys. This is a secret between you and I. ;) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**9)** **Develop next-gen capital machinery for their next-gen factories \u2013** Why do you think Tesla acquired the Grohmann Automation? They keep making these acquisitions but nobody wants to pay attention. The vehicles that are coming off the lines require machinery that doesn\u2019t exist - for manufacturing. Tesla does this in-house. An exception to this is the giant casting machines that are being purchased from Italy. On the whole, Tesla is bringing the dawn of automotive manufacturing revolution finally in 2021. The sheer re-imagining of car manufacturing is a little scary for the rest of the industry so they want to ignore this. Model Y that will be built in 2021 in Germany will be structurally different from the one in USA and China. This is because of the giant casting machines. Anyway, so the bottom line is Tesla is reimagining how manufacturing is done and this sounds simple but is a monumental thing that nobody else wants to embark on. Those companies like VW do something known as catalog engineering. This is when you buy a catalogue magazine and order the machines with pretty pictures. Then you are slave to the machines that you\u2019ve purchased for manufacturing cars. Elon has repeatedly said since 2 years, that Tesla\u2019s long term advantage is not software (it is not the #1 according to him) but rather manufacturing. How can this be? Isn\u2019t Tesla a noob? Well, people are in for a surprise. Tesla is going to out-manufacture the rest of the industry. You cannot beat this advantage. Other companies literally won\u2019t have the machines that Tsla is using to build their vehicles. How do you compete?   \n   \n \n\n**10)**  **Develop FSD Compuer Chip (their own silicon like Apple's M1) \u2013** So we\u2019re talking about industry leading inference chip that is based on an important concept of redundancy. There are two redundant CPUs in there because of which you\u2019re fine if one fails. You can run FSD software locally and very safely. This is cryptographically signed, so you cannot just reverse-engineer it and put it in your copy-cat car. No chip competes with Tesla\u2019s in terms of the wattage consumed and in terms of compute ability. FSD requires a great inference computer and while this capacity hasn\u2019t been yet full utilized as the chip is too strong and software still nascent, it will be soon. Nvidia has promised to come out with \u201cbetter chip\u201d next to next year but alas, by the end of 2021, Tesla would be coming out with the next gen FSD Inference Computer Chip. This will already beat anything that is in development right now. They win again on the in-car computer. Now you would like to think only in terms of compute advantage, but think deeply about wattage problem. The more the chip consumes the less the car has range. Tesla\u2019s range doesn\u2019t just come from the best-in-industry motors but from a lot of places. FSD computer is one great contributor to the high overall range. Other companies will be using third party stuff that will be generalized and power hungry. Ouch. They lose again. On fundamentals, let\u2019s not even talk about compute\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**11)**  **Develop Super-Computer with proprietary silicon for neural network training like Google's TPU** **- \"Tesla Dojo\"** **-** So this is something the industry hadn\u2019t even conceptualized because they were debating whether Lidar is good or bad. Tesla is building the most powerful supercomputer that will be on the exaFlop level. This is not something that anybody can just venture into. Tesla is building their own silicon for this and this computer will be live next year (towards end). In order to achieve FSD you need to turn road driving into a game. You gotta make everything from collection of data to processing and training neural networks to updating cars automatic. This is not currently possible. But Tesla will make it possible with this computer. THIS IS A GOD DAMN SUPER COMPUTER LITERALLY SUPER COMPUTER that is BETTER THAN WHAT IS OUT THERE. The current TOP SUPER COMPUTER is ABOUT HALF THAT OF 1 exaFLOP. Good luck competing with this. Also, Google and AWS have been put on watch because Elon publically said that this computer is going to be offered as AWS-like service as well. Please continute debating Lidar while Elon takes over the world via this Skynet Cyberdyne System.   \n   \n \n\n**12)**  **Mine lithium \u2013** Hold your horses, it\u2019s getting a little crazy. Tesla just purchased 10,000 acres in Nevada to mine lithium using Table Salt. TABLE SALT. So well, they\u2019ve already come up with a revolutionary way to mine lithium and they will be more efficient therefore save more on cost. So they\u2019ll have this interesting advantage. Obviously, eventually, they\u2019ll move into more aspects of mining and and processing and keep on increasing their cost advantage. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**13)**  **Manufacture cells, modules, batteries \u2013** Please refer to the Battery Day Presentation, they will dominate. They\u2019re going to be structurally putting the batteries in the structure of the vehicles itself. What this means is that there won\u2019t be battery boxes inside your car, but rather that battery cells will be integrated as part of the car structure. This is the transition that occurred in planes. The fuel is now part of the wings. This was earlier not the case. The dry electrode technology that Tesla is going to be using in their cells is going to get rid of the ovens that are required. This in and of itself is going to enable them to have terawatt level manufacturing since you need such a small space and your process speed is increased by many multiples. There is no way to explain cells without going technical so just know this that Tesla\u2019s cells are going to be the industry leading. They won\u2019t be able to produce them enough for a very long time so initially these will be put into their higher-end vehicles.\n\n**The rest of the points are self-explanatory.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: Invest in GM, Ford, VW, etc. Short Tesla.**",

        "selftext": "For those of you haven\u2019t checked out C3.ai yet you really need to do yourself a favour and take a peak.\n\nI think it\u2019s quite easy to write this one off without much though because it\u2019s up like 150% in two days, but you\u2019d be making a mistake.\n\nI feel strongly that all the other major IPOs way over priced themselves and then still over performed, whereas $AI was priced a bit more appropriately and then over performed.\n\nFirst off, their Harvard educated CEO is a big deal and has successfully raised a unicorn in the past. Competent leadership is the first thing you should look for when assessing a risky stock, and these guys check that box.\n\nThe quick and dirty explanation of why you should be interested in $AI is that in addition to their ongoing software contracts (Shell, Caterpillar, US Airforce etc) **C3 is partnering with Adobe and Microsoft to create a CRM that is driven by AI.**\n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know, a CRM is any piece of software that a company uses to manage and track clients, customers, sales, communications, emails, web posts, etc etc all in one spot.\n\nWhenever you talk to a customer service rep and they are taking all your info and typing away, that person is working on a CRM.\n\nI work with CRMs in my marketing business, and the fact that I am skilled in CRMs is the primary reason I am worth hiring for most of my clients. As a digital marketing contractor, my CRM skills are more important than my contributions on social media and web dev.\n\nI am speaking from personal experience when I telling you, CRMs are a big deal. They are the back bone of e-commerce and digital workspaces.\n\nThe only major player that is soaking up CRM market share right now is Salesforce, which is currently worth a $200B.\n\nMicrosoft threw $50m into the IPO for $AI because they are in it for the long haul with these guys, and the investment was an attractive alternative other than a full takeover. You need to take note when Microsoft does things like this.\n\nWith Microsoft and Adobe in the mix, you have everything you could possibly need to make a comprehensive and user friendly CRM that is powered by AI. More importantly, those two companies have their claws in every single private and public organization in the world.\n\nConverting people to this new CRM they are making will be easy for them.\n\nAnd if you want to completely ignore the AI CRM component of this company, you can also consider that C3.ai is also comparable to Palantir and Snowflake. Those stocks are worth $50B and $100B respectively.\n\nWith C3.ai trading at $12B, this one is a no brainer.\n\nIn today\u2019s IPO mania, I see no reason this company doesn\u2019t carry a $20B market cap very soon.\n\nIn the long run, I see this company as a potential very very smart investment.\n\nDo not be discouraged by the insane growth it has already seen.\n\nPS: I am in for shares at $119.50. It\u2019s also worth noting I got into Palantir at $10 for 80% of my account back when everyone on reddit told me that was a stupid investment. I am just as confident about $AI today as I was $PLTR a few months ago.",

        "selftext": "**SALESFORCE CRUSHES EARNINGS AND ACQUIRES SLACK, NIKOLA STOCK CONTINUES TO TUMBLE AS WE FINALLY GET THE FIRST VACCINE APPROVAL IN THE UK, LET\u2019S DISCUSS THIS AND MORE ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET**\n\nHey everyone! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PzNKCYh) leading the way up almost 1,3%, finishing at a new record high, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/syB7wP4) also up over 1,1% and finishing at a new record high, while the [DOW](https://ibb.co/HggpWGF) had smaller gains but was still up to intraday records before finishing over +0,6% for the day. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/SDCq7vf) rose for the day after opening at 20,2 and as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/0n1TDKt) big gains were led by the FAANG stocks with Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix gaining over 2% for the day while Amazon and Microsoft also were up at least 1%. This pulled the big indexes higher as they account for a big part of them.\n\nOver 60% of companies were advancing on average volume while companies moving above important moving averages continued to climb as we are going into a very risky market, as to many companies are trading high at the moment and are due for a correction. [CHART](https://ibb.co/DfgJ12R)\n\nThe biggest gaining [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/T8NPW6W) yesterday were Communications, Financials and Technology with most sectors being in the green, except industrial, as the laggards from yesterday were small cap growth companies and especially those from CHINA, like NIO, Alibaba and others, that have suffered from the recent news that the US is looking to delist some of them if they do not meet new standards. [CHART](https://ibb.co/gmpRVWW)\n\nHere are the most interesting economic events and data for [TODAY](https://ibb.co/cyp7x5W), as we will see how Mortgage Applications and ADP Jobs are going. Afterwards a couple of FED leaders will speak before we can take a look at how the Petroleum Inventories are going.\n\nWhile [GREAT NEWS](https://ibb.co/1d6y1yh) started to pop in the early morning as the UK has become the first country to authorize the Pfizer vaccine for use.\n\nThis news are already baked in the market in my opinion as investors were already expecting this to happen sooner rather than later, but this are still very good news to hear, as a confirmation is still great to have, rather than just expectations. I expect the US will soon follow in the next 10-14 days to approve both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine, that might just have a bigger impact on the stock market, but I would be careful until then, as we might get a correction in the stock market after this huge rally before we can move on even higher, as I fully expect this bull market to continue into 2021 and 2022.\n\nWell yesterday, as I expected Nikola [tumbled again](https://ibb.co/2hzPCJL) after the insider lockup period expired, as only the possibility of Milton selling his shares has spooked the market after an already bad day with the GM deal disappointing investors. As the original deal is null and void with GM not taking any stake in Nikola or helping with the engineering or manufacturing of the Badger pickup truck. The only good thing in sight for the company is the possible hydrogen fueling station network partnership by year end as announced by the management. I maintain my sell opinion on this stock as I predicted a 15-16$ in the future when the stock was trading over 20, I think it has more room to go down, it might go to single digits in the long run, as the company has become very shady after the fiasco with the misleading tactics and no breaking new fuel cell technology.\n\nOn the other hand, Salesforce crushed [earnings](https://ibb.co/XCzz5Mz) expectations, as they beat the EPS by almost 1$ and had a revenue beat of over 160 million$. They also raised [guidance](https://ibb.co/JRf2G3j) for both revenue and EPS for next year way above the consensus while also maintaining cash and equivalents at over $9B, up 45% for the year.\n\nThe company also officially [announced](https://ibb.co/whYVfzC) the acquiring of Slack in a deal worth almost $28B. This will result in the Slack software being incorporated in every aspect of Salesforce cloud offering. This 2 will be the biggest competitors yet for Microsoft. So, I believe after the dust settles, and CRM stock finally gets back on track, we will have a good long term growth opportunity with Salesforce.\n\nSlack also reported earnings yesterday after the bell as the company [posted](https://ibb.co/N6Qnw7M) a beat of estimates and an increase in paid customers and billings.\n\nWe also got some [numbers](https://ibb.co/6rNGCnZ) from Cyber Monday sales as the spending increase over 15% but, this was not enough to meet all the estimates as holiday shopping has been probably spread through the whole month of November and will continue to go strong in December in my opinion.\n\nWhile on the economic front news were not so great as the [November ISM](https://ibb.co/3yM4Hwc) index fell shy of expectations with light vehicles [sales](https://ibb.co/PG09TRf) dropping by almost 1 million from last month and are way below the year ago period.\n\nBut we did see some big improvements in [construction spending](https://ibb.co/cc5z2wq), as the numbers came in about half a % better than consensus and are up 3,7% year over year while the [November PMI](https://ibb.co/6JzRnJ1) index saw the biggest improvement in over 6 years.\n\nThe biggest earnings that will be released today will be from [CrowdStrike](https://ibb.co/RvSk8SJ) and [Okta](https://ibb.co/RDrYy8K), as I expect both of them to turn out a positive EPS, as we might see some momentum in this stocks if they don\u2019t disappoint.\n\nI greatly expect the [IPO](https://ibb.co/pKzxhmK) of AirBNB, as this could become a company that will benefit a lot from the reopening of the world in the next year or two.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "**Snowflake flops on earnings, while CrowdStrike and Okta spike, Will Chinese companies get delisted from the US? Let\u2019s talk about what happened yesterday in the stock market** \n\nHey everyone! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw both the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/sKKNVjr) and the [SP500](https://ibb.co/PzxfrWt) up about 0,2% with the SP closing at a new record high while the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/f909849) trailed and finished just below the previous close, down only 0,05%. We did see a spike in the [VIX](https://ibb.co/QMqhtMv) of almost 2% as this was quite a volatile day with the market dropping at the open before regaining traction in the middle of the trading day. We saw a relatively even market yesterday as 56% of companies were advancing on below average volume as most of the companies continue to trade well above the moving averages. The leading [sectors](https://ibb.co/d0740g8) yesterday were Energy and Financials with Materials and Real Estate lagging the market as [Small and Large Cap value plays](https://ibb.co/hLDgLmm) kept the market positive with companies like Boeing being up [more than 5%](https://ibb.co/b3jRN2s) for the day after good news on multiple fronts like Ryanair [probably](https://ibb.co/8xpKXxQ) acquiring new planes and the [first flights made](https://ibb.co/qmJNkPc) with the new 737 by American. \n\n[STOCK MARKET CHART](https://ibb.co/BPVFx2d)\n\nHere is a complete [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TKsdbDn) from yesterday as we saw an even market as I said earlier, with Salesforce being the only big looser in big caps as the stock continued to dive after the Slack news. I think this was a great opportunity to buy the stock in a dip as I doubled my portfolio value on the company from 1,5% to 3% of my portfolio while also getting in [more](https://ibb.co/Pr47Th5) on Boeing, Apple, Netflix and a couple of other companies.\n\nWe also got the AAII investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/KxkbTbb) yesterday as the percentage of bulls has increased constantly in the last month. This is usually a very bad sign for the stock market as corrections, consolidations or even crashes occur when people tend be over-bullish. I don\u2019t think this will be the case at least for a couple of weeks, though I think we are poised for a small market correction in the near future before moving on even higher.\n\nHere is the most interesting [economic data](https://ibb.co/PD2XBsn) that will be released today as we get new jobless claims as well as services PMI and ISM. I expect the jobless claims to continue to get worse sadly for the next couple of weeks at least until the vaccine starts to get distributed with ADP November jobs [numbers](https://ibb.co/S6V64xJ) coming in yesterday shy of forecasts and at the lowest level since July, this is not great news for the jobless claims that will pop up early today. [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/wQ3mK2b) \n\nGreat news came in this morning as the US is [expected](https://ibb.co/vYp0LDT) to have capability to immunize at least 100 million people by the end of February, that is great news, as specialist believe a herd immunity can be reached if there are about 60-80% of people either immunized or have already developed natural antibodies.\n\nWe also have a couple of interesting earnings [scheduled](https://ibb.co/6nJjrRY) for Today, as I expect Kroger to beat the estimates, though I didn\u2019t get any action on this, I did get some [action](https://ibb.co/y0ThT5D) on [Marvell](https://ibb.co/34x6mpN) as I bought the stock about a week ago. While I expected Dollar General to do alright and I think we might see some disappointment in [DocuSign](https://ibb.co/BPsz5Mj) just like I thought we would see bad reaction to great earnings with Zoom.\n\n\\[Later Edit:\n\n\\-Dollar General [reported](https://ibb.co/gJPRpXM) a beat on top &amp; bottom line but did not offer guidance and the shares of the company have pulled back in pre-market trading 1,6%\n\n\\-Kroger [beats EPS](https://ibb.co/bgsMckw) by 0,05$ but misses on revenue by $310M, shares down 4% pre-market\\] \n\nAlongside Marvell which I expect to beat the estimates of 25cents per share and also beat on revenue, I also [bought](https://ibb.co/y0ThT5D) Okta which released earnings yesterday and [crushed](https://ibb.co/VmvBzYV) expectations as recurring [subscription revenue](https://ibb.co/nftnckz) grew by more than 40% year over year as well as big increases in operating margins, billings and customers. This led the stock to [spike 8%](https://ibb.co/xzyy0qr) after hours as I will make a good profit on the investment and may even consider holding this position for the long term in the company.\n\nAlso, one other staple company from my [portfolio](https://ibb.co/pKbNy8M), CrowdStrike released earnings yesterday and delivered great [results](https://ibb.co/dgyfn8g) as the annual recurring [revenue](https://ibb.co/N6vhWfW) has grown more than 80% year over year while adding over 11hundred new subscriptions this quarter while also improving [gross margins](https://ibb.co/THfGJ2c) by 2%. The company also gave guidance for next quarter way over analyst expectations as that made the [stock soar 13%](https://ibb.co/ZGxbsRx)\n\nThe only big disappointment from earnings released yesterday was [SNOWFLAKE](https://ibb.co/6BhYKHC) as they have suffered the same way as Palantir in the first earnings report as analysts were expecting even bigger numbers after the huge rally the stock has had since the IPO. One Morgan Stanley analyst said that they needed to deliver around a 140% growth of revenue to make a good impact on the stock as the company\u2019s revenue only grew up 102%. If it continues to drop it might find the way to a good entry point, but for the moment I believe this price is to high for the company.\n\nWe also got news yesterday as the House [passed](https://ibb.co/w0Ly1MP) the billt hat allows Chinese companies to be delisted if they do not comply with new auditing rules, as this measure is expected to by signed fast by Trump.\n\nI think this is good news for investors in the long-run as I don\u2019t believe big companies like Alibaba will suffer from this, with BABA being audited by established PWC Hong Kong auditors, though this might be a bigger problem for smaller companies that are not able to follow the rules. I still believe Alibaba is a great company to buy at this price point as the company has [dropped](https://ibb.co/W283kbG) due to bad news developments in the last 2 months, but I think has a lot of room to go higher, even testing the previous highs of 319$ and surpassing them, especially with this holiday season having great sales numbers.\n\nThis news combined with the recent [upgrade](https://ibb.co/c2mwgPc) at Goldman was music to the ears of Tesla investors as the stock rose almost 3% after hours and erased the daily losses.\n\nOther news came as the House is expected to vote on the [MORE ACT](https://ibb.co/RgjnPgY), though this will be surely blocked in the Senate, this is still good news for the cannabis sector as states will likely legalize this way before we can a national bill.\n\nWhile Palantir dropped big yesterday after Morgan Stanley [warned](https://ibb.co/m4NsSWr) for a negative-risk reward in the stock as the stock has dropped more than 20% in the last 5 trading days, I sold out of my position on Palantir for a 40% profit recently but I may get back in if the price starts to make more sense.\n\nSo, with the latest developments, I believe investors should not forget about the FAANG stocks that have brought us back from the depths of the March lows. [FACEBOOK](https://ibb.co/gFd1S5R) still gives small business that will be back when the economy returns the best bang for the buck in advertising, especially with the great platform that Instagram has become.\n\nWhile [APPLE](https://ibb.co/j4YW4Qy) seems to be doing very well with the iPhone 12 sales and the new 5G cycle while also growing the services business very fast, that will bring them more and more steady cash flows for the company.\n\nDespite missing the latest sub numbers, [NETFLIX](https://ibb.co/LJ8fr37), is still producing a lot of great content, has the most subs and the most content available for streaming and I believe they will remain the best in business alongside with Disney+\n\nWhat can you say about [AMAZON](https://ibb.co/nrD5qnY) as they are a death star for every sector they get in\u2026 E-commerce is here to stay, and Amazon still has huge room for growth especially in Europe and Asia. \n\nWhile [GOOGLE](https://ibb.co/tz2htpn) was the laggard for most of the year, with travel &amp; entertainment returning to advertising, this will be very good for the company, as travel is the biggest advertiser usually.\n\nThis companies will remain great owns for the long run, even if they underperform now, which I don\u2019t expect, in the long-run this will remain some of the biggest winners in this new economy.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget December is usually a great month for stocks as people tend to not take profits on capital gains at the end of the year, so it is likely that people will keep the winners while also receiving a boost from the stock market Santa Claus effect.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

        "selftext": "Hello All -   \n\n\nHoping to run something by the folks here for feedback. Salesforce is acquiring slack for a deal partially funded through stock ( $26.79 a share and .0776 shares of Salesforce). Currently WORK is priced at $42.90 and CRM at $221 - So it seems as if WORK stocks are pricing salesforce at around $207 when the deal closes (another way to say this would be that if the deal were to close today the price of WORK would be $43.90)  \n\n\nI'm trying to understand what the pros and cons are of the following two strategies:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Buy WORK Mar 2021 35.00 call @ $8.00:**  \n**a. Bull case 1** \\- **CRM @ 240**. That should mean that WORK should trade at $45.4 and this call should be worth $10.4 which would be a 30% gain  \n**b. Bull case 2 - CRM @ 250** . That should mean that WORK should trade at $46.2 and this call should be worth $11.2 which would be a 40% gain  \n**c. Bear case 1** is CRM @ 200 and work will be priced at $42.31 and the options would be worth 7.31 which would be an 8% loss  \nd**. Bear case 2** \\- Deal falls through. WORK prices craters. Options expire worthless\n2. **CRM Mar 2021 200.000 call @ $31.70:**  \n**a. Bull case 1** \\- **CRM @ 240**. This call should be worth $40 and I'd see a gain of 26% (Similar to bull case 1 with WORK call option)  \n**b. Bull case 2** \\- **CRM @ 250**. This call should be worth $50 and I'd see a gain of 57.7% (significantly lower than with to bull case w with WORK call option)  \n**c. Bear case** \\- **CRM @ 200.**  The options would be expire worthless resulting in a 100% loss\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm leaning towards option 1 i.e. buying WORK Mar 2021 calls because of the lower downside risk and am willing to accept a relatively limited upside. I am also long on CRM stock and would be happy to own at today's prices. Additionally I am assuming that the chances of the deal falling through are negligible.\n\nQuestions:\n\n* Please feel free to poke holes in my logic :). What am I missing or not thinking about?\n* Typically how long do these deals take to close? Looked up tableau aquisition and that completed in 2 months\n* How many options contracts of WORK would give me the same exposure as 1 contract of CRM? This should be easy math but I'm a little lost\n* Considering combining call options purchase with a put sale to improve returns but haven't spent the time to think through that yet - Any thoughts on this would be appreciated\n\nThanks for your feedback",

        "selftext": "From what little background I was able to gather from a HBR case study of [C3.AI](https://C3.AI),\n\n1. Siebel has a very successful track record of Oracle and Siebel Systems. Both of them have been leader of relational database systems and CRM, respectively.\n2. The initial idea of C3 started of as a tool to track corporates carbon footprint, which made quite a few conglomorates interested initially. But with no government carbon tax, there was no incentive for anyone to get this tool.\n3. During that time, Siebel has a terrible foot injury, and when he eventually recovers, he sees shit flying around C3.\n4. He pivots the enterprise in the IoT sector, since he knows that utility companies are still interested in his ideas and he is known to look in the right direction at the time of crisis. He gets that reputation from the industry elites.\n5. Pivoting to IoT, gets him further access to funds which he uses to deploy more IoT devices to create smart grids. These devices are able to work together and predict failures andpain points successfullly.\n6. With this success, he announces the name change to [c3.ai](https://c3.ai) and goes on to get government/military contracts.\n\nWith all that said, talking about the product which [C3.AI](https://C3.AI) offers:\n\n1. Its not a single product. It is similar to App store of ML apps. They are providing an ecosystem to leverage machine learning in a number of different sectors.\n2. They have customers limited to one per sector, because those customers are actually PoC for this model. And it shows that it is working.\n\nI would be happy to be proven wrong in my understanding of why this firm isn't an absolute buy. I'm not someone who dabbles in stock market, but this company has piqued my interest. And the last time that happened, was with CrowdStrike Security, which I still avidly follow.",

Zoom customers can then find and use these apps to enhance their Zoom experience.\n\nFrom the Zoom press release:\n\n&gt;\u201cZapps\\* help surface all the applications you need to be productive &amp; enable the free flow of information between teams before, during or after the meeting\u201d  \n*\\*Thankfully, after this press release, Zoom made the wise decision to change the name from Zapps to simply Zoom Apps.*\n\nMany big companies have already launched apps on the Zoom marketplace:\n\n* Slack have launched a Zoom integration that allows you to launch a Zoom meeting directly from a Slack channel.\n* Hubspot have launched an app that allows you to automatically track Zoom meeting information in your Hubspot CRM such as number of attendees and attendee names.\n\nWhile the idea of an enterprise company like Zoom launching an app store is definitely noteworthy**,** it\u2019s actually nothing new. Enterprise app stores have been around for quite a while In fact, Salesforce\u2019s App Exchange app store actually predates the Apple App Store by a year or two.\n\nWhen executed correctly, this enterprise app store strategy (often called a \u2018platform\u2019 strategy) can create tremendous business value.\n\nIn this post, I'll explain the benefits of this platform strategy and list some exciting public companies using it to their advantage.\n\n### The enterprise platform strategy\n\nBefore digging into the enterprise platform strategy, it\u2019s important to note that there are many different types of software platforms. Two of the most common types of software platforms are technology platforms and computing platforms.\n\n* Technology platform like AWS and Twilio allow developers to easily integrate with these platforms to perform a particular function. EG hosting a website on AWS.\n* Computing platform like Google Android and Apple iOS allow developers to build and sell apps/tools through the computing platform\u2019s app store. EG Candy Crush.\n\nThis post is focused on companies who employ a particular type of platform strategy; ***the enterprise platform strategy***. This strategy is in some ways a combination of a technology platform and a computing platform.\n\nThe enterprise platform strategy is when an enterprise/B2B software company provides 3rd party developers with tools to build apps and integrations which can then be used in conjunction with the platform company\u2019s products. These apps and integrations are then sold through the platform company\u2019s app store. This is very similar to the iOS app stores where a 3rd part developer might build a new mobile gaming app which users can purchase and use on their iPhone.\n\nA good example is Salesforce\u2019s AppExchange app store. There are thousands of apps and integrations that Salesforce customers can buy on AppExchange to be used in conjunction with Salesforce products. For example:\n\n* The Hellosign Salesforce app allows customers to create, send and sign contracts all without having to leave the Salesforce CRM product.\n* The Simple Survey Salesforce app allows you to create surveys to send to your customers all without having to leave Salesforce.\n* The Translate.com Salesforce app makes it easy to translate customer requests from various languages into your company\u2019s preferred language.\n\n### Benefits of the enterprise platform strategy\n\nLaunching an enterprise app store is essentially a strategy of moving from a narrow software solution to a broader (and more valuable) platform.\n\nWhen executed properly, a platform strategy can create the following big benefits for enterprise companies:\n\n* **More revenue.** The first benefit is pretty straightforward. Much in the same way that Apple takes a % cut of all revenue from apps sold on its app store, the enterprise can take a cut of all app sales on their platform.\n* **New customers and new markets.** A platform strategy provides opportunities for new customer acquisition in 2 ways:  \n\n   * First, many of the apps/integrations that launch on an enterprise platform are big businesses in their own right. Big businesses with lots of customers. When they launch an integration on the platform, it is likely that a certain % of their customers will see big value in the integration and become customers of the platform company.\n   * Secondly, many of the apps/integrations will fulfil the tail-end of \u201cmust-have\u201d customer requirements that aren\u2019t a core focus for the platform company. To use the previous Translate.com Salesforce app example, there may have been quite a few customers for whom the ability to translate tickets is a must-have requirement before using any CRM. It may have been years before Salesforce had the capacity to build internal translations functionality. But by launching a platform, they have allowed other companies to build apps which solve for these tail-end must-have requirements, thus converting more potential customers who otherwise would have used a different CRM tool.\n* **Platform companies can focus more on core competencies.** One of the biggest questions any enterprise company faces is where to put resources? For many companies, there is huge pressure from big customers to solve a myriad of tail-end must-have requirements. But platform companies don\u2019t have this problem. They can focus their efforts on their core strategy, building software that creates the most value for their full customer ecosystem.\n* **Massive customer value creation.** Similar to the above point, a successfully executed platform strategy creates an almost exponential amount of value for customers. As the platform grows with more and more apps being added the amount of value and functionality available to customers grows with it. The platform company could never build the same amount of software on their own.\n* **Stronger customer moat.** When customers buy and use apps through an enterprise app store, the platform company owns the relationship between the customer and the app. As customers adopt more and more apps, they become more heavily integrated with the platform company\u2019s products. This increase product stickiness and makes it far more difficult for customers to switch to a competitor.\n\n### What to look for in an enterprise platform company\n\nNot all enterprise platforms are created equal. In fact, in an API-first world where most products can integrate with others, it is almost a default strategy for a SaaS company once they get to a particular size.\n\nWhen analysing an enterprise platform company as a potential investment, here are some things to look out for:\n\n* **Excellent developer tools.** An enterprise platform strategy is almost entirely dependant on the quality of apps built on the platform. If customers don\u2019t use the apps, the platform is redundant. One of the most important things that a platform company can do to ensure that lots of high quality apps are built is to provide 3rd party developers with the right tools to build high-quality apps. Look for things like comprehensive documentation, visual app builders, easy to use APIs and a forum/community where 3rd party developers can collaborate and get help.  \n\n   * For an example of a high quality developer ecosystem, look at Intercom.\n* **Apps not integrations.** Many of the tools listed on an enterprise app store will be integrations between the enterprise\u2019s products and another big company\u2019s products. These integration typically allow you to send data back and forth between each tool. For example, the Intercom Salesforce app allows you to send customer data between both systems. While these integrations do provide a lot of value, a strong enterprise platform will also have lots of independent applications exclusively built for that platform. Independent applications mean that the platform ecosystem is big enough and healthy enough to sustain individual businesses being built on top of it.  \n\n   * The Zendesk and Shopify platforms are great examples of platforms with lots of independent apps.\n* **Reviews &amp; Feedback.** To understand if an enterprise platform strategy is successful, you need to understand if customers are actively using (and getting value from) the apps on the enterprise app store. One simple way to do this is to just go to the app store and look around. If there are lots of apps with customer-provided reviews and feedback, then you are likely looking at an active, robust platform ecosystem.\n\n### Enterprise platform companies\n\nBelow are some companies that are, in my opinion, executing the enterprise platform strategy very well and are therefore potential investment opportunities.\n\nWhile a well-executed platform strategy doesn\u2019t automatically make a company a good investment (it\u2019s still important to analyse these companies in their entirety) , it definitely makes the company more attractive.\n\n*(Please note, that this is not investment advice and just some companies that I'm excited about for my personal portfolio)*\n\n#### Zendesk ($ZEN)\n\nFrom an enterprise platform perspective, Zendesk is ticking all the right boxes. It has excellent developer tools, lots and lots of independent apps and a customer base that are heavily using the app platform (A large number of apps have over 500 reviews, which is very good for a business app in an enterprise app store).\n\nOne of the most interesting things about Zendesk\u2019s app marketplace is how useful it has been for Zendesk in acquiring new customers and moving into new markets. It has also been really helpful for Zendesk customers who had to rapidly adapt to changes this year which occurred due to the Covid pandemic. From the Zendesk Q3 shareholder letter:\n\n&gt;*\u201cIn 2020, Cabify was faced with quickly moving its Excellence Support team of more than 200 agents to remote work, requiring new methods for tracking timesheets and productivity to sustain its KPIs. Support managers leveraged integrations from the Zendesk Marketplace to help bridge this transition.\u201d*\n\n#### Salesforce ($CRM)\n\nYou can\u2019t talk about enterprise platforms without talking about Salesforce\u2019s AppExchange. AppExchange (which has over 3000 individual apps) has driven a huge amount of business and shareholder value for Salesforce. 3 things stand out in particular about Salesforce\u2019s platform play:\n\n1. **The size of the companies built on the platform.** As discussed earlier, a strong enterprise platform will have lots of apps built exclusively for that platform (not just partner integrations). Salesforce has these apps in spades. The size of the businesses that have been built just on the Salesforce Platform is staggering. FinancialForce is an ERP software provider built on top of AppExchange which has raised over $186 million in funding. Billion dollar businesses are being built on top of Salesforce!\n2. **Acquisition Opportunities.** Many of the companies that Salesforce has acquired over the years originally had apps available on AppExchange. This is a really intelligent strategy by Salesforce. Salesforce can look at the most popular AppExchange apps and acquire the ones with the most potential.\n3. **What happens to Slack?** Salesforce recently announced that it will be acquiring Slack. It will be interesting to see how this is managed from a platform perspective. Slack also has a pretty robust enterprise app store. It will be interesting to see if this is folded into the AppExchange environment or if they are kept separate. My bet is on separate but this presents an interesting challenge to the \u2018authority\u2019 of the Salesforce platform.\n\n#### Shopify ($Shop)\n\nShopify is a particularly interesting company to think about from a platform perspective since it essentially has 2 platforms. It is a platform for merchants to sell products to consumers. But it is also a platform where app developers can build and sell different applications to those merchants.\n\nThe Shopify app store is incredibly extensive with everything from fraud protection apps to search engine optimisation apps. The ecosystem is very active with lots of individual, standalone applications and many apps having over 3000 reviews.\n\n#### Zoom ($ZM)\n\nI can\u2019t open this post by talking about Zoom without mentioning it as a potential investment target. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a little early to say whether or not this strategy has been successful for Zoom. However, if successful it is a huge opportunity for the company to move from being a video conferencing solution to a broader, more valuable platform.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you found this post valuable pease let me know below. Would be happy to post more.\n\nI struggled a bit to identify a lot of software companies that have executed this strategy well. If you have any suggestions on companies that I should have included please let me know :) Would also be really interesting to hear of any companies who haven't used this strategy yet but who could be very successful if they did.

        "selftext": "So, the way I have been buying stock is I have a list of securities I wanna buy. And whenever I have $500 saved on average, I spend that on a particular stock. For example, I could spend $500 and buy 10 shares of KO at $52 or whatever it is now.\n\nNow, it would depend on the stock as well. If I wanted to buy something big ticket like Salesforce, I would prolly spend around $1000-$1500 and pickup 4-6 shares rather than only 2 at the current rate of $240 or whatever (this is just to give an example into my process of thinking)\n\nThe reasoning behind this is that I don't want to have too big a chunk of my portfolio into a particular stock. However, as my portfolio grows, I could buy shares of the same stock later on. I just don't want to put 1/3 or 1/2 my money egg in one basket.\n\nIs this reasonable? How do you do it?",

        "selftext": "Hey guys! So I'm currently working on an investing simulation on Investopedia and need help with short-term trading and day trading. Would also love advice for long-term investing for my own personal real portfolio. \n\nSo to start with my personal real portfolio, started it early this year and currently at +85.66% with about 20K invested. Portfolio currently consists of Apple, Amazon, Costco, Disney, Netflix, Nvidia, Starbucks, Square, and Twilio. Might look to invest some more, would it be recommended to buy some more shares of the same stock? \n\nFor the Investopedia simulator I only have 1-2 months left of the semester. Given an $100K budget I spent about 15K each on Amazon, Tesla, Apple, Starbucks and CRM. Now I'm looking to do some short term and day trading. Just purchased 5K into FedEx and Paypal today, so I have a decent amount around 15K left for daytrading. The problem is I have no knowledge on how to do it, how to look at what stocks might be good, when to sell based on profit/loss, etc. Any advice/resources would be greatly appreciated!",

        "selftext": "**Tesla and NIO shares are jumping after good news, while NIKOLA tumbles after GM goes for a much smaller agreement, the stock market loses ground as investors take profits, let\u2019s talk about this and much more about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Welcome! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/2g68hFq) finish about flat for the day, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/cr8CXVz) finished about half a percent down for the day and the [DOW INDUSTRIAL](https://ibb.co/9tFCX3j) was the biggest losers down almost 1% thought all 3 of them were down even bigger intraday. So, both the SP and the DOW finished with record monthly gains, the SP finish up 10,9% for the month above the previous record of 10,2% exactly 40 years ago, while the DOW finished up 11,9% and topped the previous record from 1987 with the Nasdaq also having its best month since the middle of the dot-com boom in 2001. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/4g07SHm) also finished down more than 1% for the day though at one point it almost hit the 23 mark.\n\nAlmost 70% of companies were declining yesterday on above average volume, as I believe investors were taking profits after the big gains from this huge November rally that we had. [CHART](https://ibb.co/0XvY72g)\n\nEnergy was the biggest loser yesterday as the whole [sectors](https://ibb.co/JBTt3Bt) finished down more than 5% while the only 2 sectors in the green were Technology and Health Care as we saw [value plays](https://ibb.co/SBGP6jS) struggling through the day while large cap growth companies were gaining, led by Apple as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/xf7mqtc), which finished the day up over 2% while the whole financial and energy sectors were down big.\n\nHere are the biggest economic [data](https://ibb.co/yV5rQ23) that we are expecting today, as we will see numbers from the MARKIT PMI and the ISM INDEX with vehicle sales arriving later in the day. Also only one big company is expected to report earnings today, [Salesforce](https://ibb.co/YTK19Tr), which is also expected to close a deal today to buy Slack in a cash-only deal. Salesforce is expected to maintain its EPS flat year over year with revenues increasing by more than 16%. I fully expect this to be beaten as this company has gone under appreciated in my opinion as smaller cloud companies have seen the bulk of the stock market gains. If they manage to buy Slack that will be a very positive thing for the company\u2019s future as they will move on to bring a new challenge to the Microsoft bundle. [SLACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/GRjM1wk)\n\nGreat news came in the early morning today, as the OECD [revised](https://ibb.co/mc2dhhd) it\u2019s GDP contraction up 0,3% with a real GDP growth forecasted at over 4% next year and 3,7% in 2022 as China is expected to account for one-third of the world economic growth next year, it might be the time to get more into that part of the stock market as they are expected to have a GDP growth of 8% next year.\n\nAlso, despite dropping more than 3% yesterday, Tesla saw it\u2019s shares bounce back after the [news](https://ibb.co/hdMz1px) that it will be added at full float-adjusted market cap all at once on Dec. 21 due to its ability to accommodate big trades. With other good news coming yesterday also as China finally [approved](https://ibb.co/6n8hzP7) the selling of the Model Y in the country.\n\nAlso relating to the EV world, NIO just [announced](https://ibb.co/m91nYNp) while writing this post an increase of over 100% in delivery numbers for November to over 5 thousand cars. As they company keeps it over 100% year over year deliveries increase and are expected to continue the accelerations of production capacity to accommodate the bigger order numbers.\n\nWhile the hydrogen power Nikola seen it\u2019s share drop yesterday after a worse than expected [deal](https://ibb.co/1nQ2bb5) with GM, as GM has pulled back from its initial far bigger commitment with Nikola as the 2 companies signed a non-binding memorandum that expires at the end of next year, so things may get even worse for Nikola as they also scrapped plans to build the Nikola Badger electric pickup and will refund order deposits for the truck. This resulted in an over 25% drop in Nikola [shares](https://ibb.co/ZMMj5rY) and I expect this to go even lower, as the former CEO Milton will see about 130 million shares unlocked today and a total unlock of 161 million shares, that is more than the [current free float](https://ibb.co/z8vzVTj) shares available for the company at 117 million. If he decides to sell those, that will crush the stock\u2026 So, I think a 15-16 $ price in the near future is possible even with Milton selling his shares.\n\nGood news for 2 of the biggest 3 companies in the world Apple and Amazon [announced](https://ibb.co/RCwxB2s) that they will team up to offer new cloud computing services for AWS users to be able to create and test apps remotely. This will be a big positive for both companies as Amazon will benefit from more cloud services usage while Apple continues to expand the software and services business.\n\nOther great news came for retailers as Shopify [announced](https://ibb.co/KLD25BH) that sales were up 75% year over year as the Black Friday to Cyber Monday sales are booming, this bolds well for companies like Lowe\u2019s, Home Depot, Amazon and many others.\n\nWhile on the vaccine front, Moderna\u2019s candidate is [expected](https://ibb.co/HB8fdnm) to be review in mid-December. I believe the stock has gone way over it\u2019s head and has passed big players in the pharma industry like Vertex and Regeneron though for Moderna this will be they\u2019re first product to be released to the market, I think this stock is well over-hyped at this price, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s worth more than 100$ in the long-run as more vaccines will become available with far cheaper prices.\n\nThe only big company that reported earnings yesterday was [ZOOM](https://ibb.co/FB33wzw) as they beat expectations by [23 cents](https://ibb.co/GJXzrxj). The stock did fall more than 5% in after-hours trading as I expected as the total number of paying customers was only up 17% quarter over quarter with far bigger increases in free users that created bigger bills and drove the profit margins lower to 66% way below the 72% analysts expected. I believe the company faces a though 2021 year as they will have very difficult comps to take on, but I believe this will remain a winner in the longer run. So I sold out of my position on Zoom before this earnings but I will keep an eye on them, if the price drops below 400$ I would be willing to buy the stock once again.\n\nMeanwhile Biden has announced [his top picks](https://ibb.co/8XrnvpQ) for economic appointments and nominations and I believe this are very friendly picks for the stock market as he has gone with more central liberal picks and hasn\u2019t gone to far to the left.\n\nSo I still believe the stock market is in a bull run for the moment with lot of great catalysts like the [PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION](https://ibb.co/T26q9Fz) being more and more certain, and a very likely split government after the Georgia Senate runoff election. So, with at least 2 vaccines right around the corner and treatments for the illness also getting better by the day, this will lead to a gradual reopening of the economy as less and less industries will suffer and the whole economy will eventually go back to normal. Also, the end of the US-China trade war might be in sight or at least a reduction in the trade tensions between the two biggest economies as Biden is close to taking over the Presidency in the US.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion and other thoughts on the stock market!\n\nHave a great and see you next time!",

The subscription model continues to expand, as the company's sales and margins increase significantly and are more predictable than with one-off payments. The business models of many companies will have to adapt, especially due to the corona crisis. The subscription model will therefore continue to spread beyond the tech companies.  This is exactly where Zuora comes in, a SaaS platform to maintain and manage subscription services. \n\nIn my opinion, such a tool is particularly helpful for small and medium-sized companies in order to manage invoices, check payments and analyze sales. And by specializing in the subscription model, you can set yourself apart from the well-known ones like SAP and Salesforce. The founder and CEO of Zuora was previously Chief Strategy Officer at Salesforce, so he definitely knows his stuff. You also have well-known customers (e.g. Zoom, Dazn, Daimler, Siemens, Microsoft, Nvidia, GoPro etc.), in whose success you also participate, and you also work with consulting firms such as Accenture, Deloitte and PwC.  \n\nThe growth was a bit disappointing lately, so the price crashed a bit, but recently it has recovered somewhat and is in a clear uptrend. The price (currently $ 11.70) is still far from the all-time high of $ 37.80 shortly after the IPO 2018 and the KUV is 5 compared to other SaaS companies such as B. ServiceNow or Zendesk cheap, so I see upside potential. In September they shot up to $ 17.80 within days of the numbers, which should be the target again in the medium term. With the hype that such disruptive companies are experiencing this year, at least I wouldn't be surprised.

To me, ADBE represents the best of the \u201creopening trade\u201d without the shit fundamentals and the \u201cgrowth trade\u201d without the pre-earnings run up or IV spike. \n\n\nAdobe is the holy grail of creatives on marketing teams everywhere. I expect this avalanche of ad money to trickle down to ADBE subscriptions. \n\nThe stock is down today because they just completed an acquisition.

        "selftext": "*#Clown Market DD:*# Buckle up buckaroos I'm gonna show you how to wine and dine on tendies at Wendys this very Wednesday. Neither Bull, nor Bear, I am full-on Clown and this is my native market. Given the recent Clownish trends, which unequivocally guarantee future results (*cf.* \"New Paradigm\" inflection point of [Figure A](https://transportgeography.org/?page_id=9035), the contents of Airbnb's S-1 disclosure statement (available [here](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-306257/)) and other SEC filings (available [here](https://sec.report/CIK/0001559720)) are completely irrelevant, like seatbelts on a seadoo. \n\n**TLDR;** Imagine an amount of money you are willing to lose and then double it. Buy ABNB at Fidelity on IPO day, shares on Wednesday afternoon, and calls the following week.\n\nNow before you parade down the street blasting your kazoo, let's go over WHY to buy. UBER IPO'd last year at $41. This was a typical case of insider investors realizing their shares of a shitty, unprofitable company were better off in the hands of retail mothershmuckers. UBER has become even less profitable in the interim, so naturally the stock price has risen to $54. Now some of you bigbrains might be furrowing your fiveheads--ABNB has a clear path to profitability and has indeed [turned a profit](https://www.cnet.com/news/airbnb-first-profit-home-rental-travel-startups/) on multiple occasions. My elf ears hear you ask:\n\n&gt;\"Under Clownmarket rules doesn't this mean ABNB will trade flat like a boomer bond?\" \n\n\"Nein!\" is my reply. Fear not, for ABNB posted a [$322m loss](https://www.vox.com/2020/2/12/21134477/airbnb-loss-profit-ipo-safety-tech-marketing) last year. Although it's not as sexy as [TSLA's $862m loss](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272130/net-loss-of-tesla/) in the same year, we can hope ABNB's costs of expanding into China will swell like an ass-eater's lymph nodes. The analysts certainly think so. Cordwell has a price target of [$75 a share](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ABNB/price-target/) following the likely $45-$50 IPO target.\n\nAlthough Airbnb is clearly just Uber for your mattress, some skeptics demand more metrics. Compare Booking.com (BKNG) which IPO'd at $483.99 in 1999 and dropped to $7.88 by 2001. Could this happen to ABNB? Absolutely not. Why? Because I got bedbugs once at a booking.com dive with fake pics, and I didn't even call their customer service to get my eleven dollars back. Contrast that with when I got kicked out of an Airbnb in Bali six years ago, I got on the phone with a **specialist** who **investigated** my **case** and gave me a bunch of store credit for shit I didn't even ask for. Add in the fact that BKNG now trades at $2125 and you've got yourself a real *fuck it why not* scenario.  \n\nAnd finally, *Google Trends* [shows \"airbnb\" is half as hype as \"tesla\"](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=airbnb,tesla) which logically puts ABNB at 50% of TSLA's $558b valuation, =$279b, which would put ABNB's share price at $465.\n\nPut the kazoos away boys, this 10-bagger calls for a fanfaronade of vuvuzelas!",

S&amp;P\u2019s clients will be able to work with the index provider to create customized indices and other benchmarking tools on cryptocurrencies, S&amp;P and Lukka said in a joint statement.  S&amp;P and Lukka hope more reliable pricing data will make it easier for investors to access the new asset class, and reduce some of the risks of the very volatile and speculative market, they said.\n\n&gt; \u201cWith digital assets such as cryptocurrencies becoming a rapidly emerging asset class, the time is right for independent, reliable and user-friendly benchmarks,\u201d said Peter Roffman, global head of innovation and strategy at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. The move by one of the world\u2019s most well-known index providers could help cryptocurrencies become more mainstream investments. It comes as bitcoin continues to soar to record highs against the dollar, boosted by increased demand from investors who say the virtual currency is a hedge against inflation and a safe-haven asset.\n\n&gt; Bitcoin was trading at $19,300 in latest trading on Thursday, having soared around 170% this year. Cryptocurrencies have been around for more than a decade, but have started attracting more interest from large financial companies over the last few years.\n\n&gt; Large firms including Fidelity Investments and Japan\u2019s Nomura Holdings Inc have starting safeguarding bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies for institutional investors, while major exchanges have started offering bitcoin derivatives. The emergence of more mainstream market infrastructure has made the asset class more accessible for institutional investors, with hedge fund managers such as Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller saying they include bitcoin in their broad investment strategies.",

Emerging markets fund managers have been swapping U.S. listings of widely held stocks like Alibaba Group Holding (BABA), JD.com (JD), NetEase (NTES) for their secondary listings in Hong Kong listings for months, in anticipation of the measure. \n\nThat's right. The absolute *worst* thing that can happen is that your shares get swapped to Hong Kong's stock exchange. The article explained that Interactive Brokers, Fidelity, and Schwab, for example, already offer retail traders like us access to HK's exchange.\n\nGranted that NIO and XPEV are not on the Hong Kong exchange yet. But they have three years to comply with the US rule. That's plenty of time to secure a spot on the Hong Kong exchange. And Hong Kong would *love* to have them.

Why is it a range?)\n\nSo if I were to buy this contract, it would be an option to sell x100 shares of MSTR at 310 up until 1/15/21, and it would cost $3,665 (the median of the spread?)?\n\nIs that accurate so far?\n\nIf so, let\u2019s say on 1/15/21 that MSTR is at 300.  A difference of $10 x 100 shares for $1000 is far less than the $3,665 I mentioned above though, so a net loss.\n\nIn fact, by my math MSTR would have to drop to 273 to break even. (Is that right, or am I mistaken on the premium?)\n\nLastly..exercise vs. sell: I assume the vast majority of the time I would want to sell the contract rather than exercise.  \n\nSell: what kind of basis would the contract sell for?  Is there a good way to estimate before entering into a contract?\n\nExercise: if you don\u2019t own shares of a put contract, how would you exercise it?

        "selftext": "I just had a rather frustrating call with TDA. I've been tinkering with options for a little under a year now. I started on fidelity selling CC's against a large position I owned. I also opened an account at TDA that was intended for more active options trading when that CC finally hit at Fidelity, since Fidelity's website is kinda wonky for options trading.\n\nWhen I opened the account at TDA, I selected options access, margin, futures, forex, margin, advanced features, etc. After opening the account, I saw that literally none of those were on the account (!). I called them, and they stated that they were approved and would show up the next day. Some did, some didn't. Options *looked* like it was.\n\nI've been daytrading stocks in the account in the interim. Not too bad either - doubled the account. Well, fast forward to this morning. I tried purchasing a 2022 LEAP with the intention of doing PMCCs, and I got an error that \"it would create an illegal position\" error (!!).\n\nSo, I get on the phone with TDA and they tell me that I was never approved for options (!!!). I explain the history. They say they don't see it (!!!!). They also say that during the application, the request for additional account features was never filled out (!!!!!), which is BS because I literally picked through it with a fine tooth comb.\n\nOk, fine. So I re-apply. This time, they only give me L1 options, and some L2. No ability to do spreads.\n\nAnd I'm locked there for another 90 days. After 3 attempts to enable options at my desired level now - at creation, after creation, and now this, I give TF up. I told the rep that I'm probably going to close the account since I have L3 options at fidelity, spreads were part of my strategy, and they gave me some spiel about \"well its for your own safety, we are much more strict than fidelity, we want you to have more experience, we aren't trying to win your business.\" (!!!!!!!)\n\nAt that line, I said \"well done then.\" and hung up.\n\nI'll pull my cash back out and either move back to Fidelity (though I hate their website for options trading, and I don't have a machine where I can run active trader pro). I've also heard a lot of love towards tastyworks, but the commissions see really high. I wanted to avoid RH because of really bad experiences there as an early user. I've also heard some love towards webull.\n\nI get there's an obligation to \"protect me from myself\" but GD this is frustrating when I already have that level of access elsewhere, and was told by their support that I was approved. It's even more frustrating when it feels like support is trying to gaslight you, and then waves you off like you aren't important when you point it out.",

        "selftext": "Currently in a sticky situation at EOY (age 27). I\u2019m a self employed 1099 (individual owner and only employee) with an S-Corp. I\u2019ve paid myself a \u2018reasonable salary\u2019 this year. I have my Roth IRA in Fidelity, and I made the maximum contribution in early January. My personal ST gains from stock this year is around $200K (2000% YTD). I just realized that I will exceed the income contribution limit for Roth IRA. I spoke to Fidelity about this issue and they have given me two options: either withdraw the contribution and get penalized plus taxes at ordinary or do a conversion to traditional and then back to Roth IRA plus file Form 8606 every year.\n\nAs of right now, my Roth IRA has a 95% YTD return. Although I understand that this return may not be consistent and be lucky, and that I may have to rebalance as I get older, I still want to be able to aggressive and choose my own positions. Playing around with the compound interest calculator: maximum annual contribution, 15-20% average yield, and a 30 year period, this is a no brainer on after-tax savings. \n\nI specifically want a after-tax option to invest. Is the best way to continue funding traditional Roth and then convert every year or to open a Roth 401K employer side and fund it ($19K contribution limit?)? Secondly, where is the best option to open an employer Roth 401K, how much may it cost, and would I even be able to manage my own fund or does it have to be in a target/passive index?\n\nThank you",

        "selftext": "Between a recent inheritance, and cash I've been stockpiling in a savings account, I have \\~$325k cash collecting dust. I need your help! lol. I'm 40, no kids, no financial obligations. This money  is growing rapidly based on my income, at the rate of $5-10k/month. I need to put this money to work, and would really appreciate input from you all - especially people who've been in a similar situation where they've come into a large sum unexpectedly and didn't have prior experience with money on that scale. For context, I'm self-employed, and I've been maxing out my retirement contributions annually (in terms of the maximum I can contribute to have a tax advantage). I've even had crazy luck with my retirement account, it's up \\~25% on the year. I earn roughly $200k/yr, and COVID has not, and will not impact business (it's growing). I've put together roughly \\~450k in net worth in the past three years, starting at ground zero, so in relative terms all of this wealth is new. Other than my mortgage I'm debt free - my mortgage is 2.99 % fixed for 30 years, so paying this down doesn't seem like the right move, at least not right now.\n\nSome questions:\n\n* has anyone navigated this type of situation recently?\n* does anyone have experience having their savings/retirement actively managed? Fidelity offers this for a reasonable monthly fee\n* can I trust financial advisors? any 'tells' I can watch out for?\n* are there any mistakes / pitfalls you guys have made that you could help me avoid?\n* should I wait until after the transition of power before making any moves? politics aside, these are dicey times and whatever is going to happen will transpire by the end of next month\n* can anyone recommend effective means of giving? I'd like to take a slice of ROI and get that to people who need it. I read that 1 in 5 kids here is hungry, and that's criminal\n* Whether that's cash or gold bricks, I'm going to make a 'doomsday fund' to keep at home - I'm not a prepper, but banks have failed, once in my lifetime - can someone give some advice on this? Was thinking \\~10k in cash/gold\n\nMy goals:\n\n* would prefer this to be relatively hands off - get some safety nets in place (stop loss etc), stick to relatively boring equities, etc etc. my income is such I don't have to get aggressive here\n* early retirement - I'd love to scale back to a 3 day work ASAP, and I'm not materialistic - there will be no Mercedes in the driveway, no vacations in St. Tropez, it's just not my style\n* real estate - I'd like to expand into rental properties, I'm in the St. Pete FL area and there's no shortage of people looking to rent\n\nANY advice you all could share would truly be appreciated. Criticism/suggestion regarding my current thoughts and plans is also welcomed. I've done really well recently, but it's amateur hour and I'm aware of this. PLEASE share any mistakes major mistakes you've made in similar situations - IMO the best thing I can do is avoid common pitfalls, but I'm looking to do more than drop this into gov't bonds.\n\nThank you!",
