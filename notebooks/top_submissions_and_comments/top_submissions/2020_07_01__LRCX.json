Early in the week, Republicans will unveil their stimulus package proposal, which will then be debated as Friday\u2019s deadline nears for the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve also meets on and is likely to discuss other steps it can take. It\u2019s not likely, however, to make any moves as it wraps up on Wednesday, other than to assure markets it will continue to use extraordinary programs to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; Then on Thursday, the government will release a big number many investors have been dreading \u2014 the first official reading of second quarter gross domestic product, which which should show how hard the economy crashed when it was abruptly shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a contraction of about 35% in the second quarter, followed by a bounce back in the third quarter. But the size of that comeback could be directly impacted by how much stimulus Congress gives the economy, and how much the coronavirus continues to impact businesses and economic activity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s a clear understanding of how much the economy has leaned on the crutch of government stimulus, both fiscally and monetarily,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cEveryone will be watching for what will replace the $600 a week, and that will be the most important component of whatever plan they come up with.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The $600 weekly payment to about 30 million unemployed Americans expires Friday, and it is unlikely Congress will have a plan before that date. Strategists expect the amount to be cut in half, and Boockvar said the amount of that payment will directly impact the size of the boost to the economy\n*****\n&gt; The stimulus and tech earnings could both be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat the package looks like will be a huge deal, particularly on the unemployment benefits side, and whether tech companies can exceed the bar,\u201d said Boockvar. \u201cThat\u2019s very hard for them right now. So if they miss, does that mean it\u2019s going to be a negative for tech and not the whole market? Are we going to keep rotating to value from growth because tech has been so dominant it could take everything down?\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to decline by 40.3% for the second quarter, based on the results of companies that have already reported and estimates, according to Refinifiv\u2019s I/B/E/S. Technology earnings are expected to have one of the smallest profit declines, at just 4.4% on average.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq, which had rallied to record highs this summer, ended lower for a second week, while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe earnings numbers overall, they\u2019ve been pretty good. It\u2019s just the basic problem with the stock market right now is that valuations are still pretty high,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cOther parts of the market that maybe look cheap on a price-to-book basis, their earnings have been hit. In the case of certain retailers, airlines, you have to worry about when their business is going to come back, if ever.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 80% of the companies already reporting have beaten Wall Street estimates. That is well above the average beat rate of about 65%, since 1994.\n*****\n&gt; Dozens of major companies report in the coming week, including Facebook on Wednesday and Alphabet and Amazon on Thursday. Pharmaceuticals Merck, Pfizer and Eli Lilly are expected to report, and consumer products names Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s and Procter &amp; Gamble also release results. Big oil, Exxon Mobil and Chevron report Friday.\n*****\n&gt; # Stimulus from Congress and the Fed\n&gt; Strategists expect Congress to ultimately adopt a new stimulus package of between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, but after the GOP plan is introduced it will have to be squared with Democrats\u2019 proposals. The House has its own $3 trillion spending plan. It is unlikely an agreement can be approved before unemployment benefits expire Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBipartisan negotiations between the White House, House, and Senate are officially underway, but we expect brinkmanship before passage. Trump administration officials also diverge on their expectations on timing, which remains optimistically by the end of July, and possibly stretching into August under the more \u2018realistic\u2019 case,\u201d writes Ed Mills, policy strategist at Raymond James.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills expects the $600 weekly payment to be cut to $300 or $400, and he said it\u2019s possible there would be more funds given to a Payroll Protection Program, to help small businesses.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOverall, momentum is building for the next package and the final price tag is arguably moving up (closer to $1.5 -2 trillion),\u201d Mills noted. Congress has already allocated $2.4 trillion in prior spending.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed will be discussing its own stimulus, and some economists expect it could again be talking about new tactics to keep interest rates low. One idea is a policy of forward guidance, where the Fed would steer market expectations more explicitly. Another is the Fed would use targeted Treasury purchases to control specific interest rates. But no new programs are expected to be announced.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey pretty much told us, they\u2019re all in. They told us they\u2019re willing to do whatever else it takes,\u201d said Keon. \u201cThe Fed is not going to be our problem. The Fed just told us they\u2019re going to do anything they can do to soften the blow from the virus.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/rshk3gVX/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/y6nsD6FQ/marketdata3.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/nrVx3NtG/finvizfuts1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/NLhf0Rdn/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/gJmb01rb/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/vBhFxX6g/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Jn6YWFkq/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/85PX9Gjc/maketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/fRgk0Fb6/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/C57tdKXj/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/HknGcQpj/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/FsD5HPX2/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/Nfgvt3S6/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week\n\n&gt; The earnings slate continues to ramp up next week with 712 total companies scheduled to report. In the table below, we show the largest stocks by market cap that are set to report quarterly results. On Monday, there will be no company with a market cap above $100 billion reporting with the largest companies being Alexandria Real Estate (ARE) and multiple banks. On Tuesday, payment processor Visa (V) will be out with earnings in addition to Pfizer (PFE), Amgen (AMGN), McDonald's (MCD), and Raytheon (RTX). Visa has historically averaged the strongest stock price reaction to earnings of these names but it has gapped down for six straight quarters. That will be followed by another payment processor, Paypal (PYPL) on Wednesday. In addition to Paypal, Facebook (FB) is also scheduled to report that same day. While both stocks have averaged over 2% gains on earnings days historically, ServiceNow (NOW) has seen an even stronger performance with an average gain of 3.64%. Another major earnings report that will be widely watched is Boeing (BA) to get a gauge on how demolished travel demand has affected the company. On Thursday, three of the world's largest stocks will also be out with earnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG). Each one has averaged a 1%+ gain on earnings days. Apple (AAPL) has seen some of the strongest results in recent history with last quarter snapping a streak of four consecutive triple plays. On Friday, two of the largest energy stocks, Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), will round out the week and July's earning calendar. Both stocks have historically averaged declines on earnings days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/Earn3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dollar Weakness May Continue\n\n&gt; The US dollar was remarkably strong during the first quarter of 2020, benefitting from the flight to safety and rallying to nearly a 10% year-to-date gain at the stock market\u2019s low point on March 23. However, as equity markets have recovered, and the US has continued to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the dollar has given up nearly all of those gains. We think this trend may continue, and if so, it would have important implications for a range of asset classes.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a more diversified basket than the commonly cited DXY Index, is nearing a critical uptrend line. A break of this support could mean that weakness seen over the past few months is more than just an unwinding of the flight to safety. Through Wednesday, the index was down more than 1% for the week and tracking toward its fourth straight weekly loss.\n\n&gt; This isn\u2019t just a technical story though. As we explored last month, rising twin deficits have historically been followed by a weaker dollar, meaning the fundamentals support this move as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/July-23-picture.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The commodity rally is another reason to believe the market may be looking toward a weaker dollar. Commodities are typically viewed as having an inverse relationship with the dollar since the dollar is effectively the denominator of a hard asset. Gold prices are up more than 20% year to date, copper just traded to its highest level in more than two years, and silver prices have appreciated 28% this month alone.\n\n&gt; As for the implications of a weaker dollar, according to LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201ca weaker US dollar may be a slight negative for US consumers\u2019 buying power, but for investors\u2019 portfolios the implications are overwhelmingly positive. Commodities are rallying, US multinational companies benefit from foreign buyers being able to afford more of their goods, and international stocks do well as their underlying currencies appreciate.\u201d\n\n&gt; Recent history bears this out. The last calendar year that saw a significant dollar decline was 2017 when the Bloomberg Dollar Index fell more than 8%. The S&amp;P 500 Index rallied more than 19% on a price return basis; however, international stocks fared even better. The MSCI EAFE Index and MSCI Emerging Markets Index gained 22% and 34%, respectively, and 2017 represented the only year since 2012 that either outperformed the US.\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Gets the Gold for YTD Performance\n\n&gt; In last night's Closer, we took a look at the massive rallies of late in the precious metals space. Gold (GLD) reached its highest level since 2011, but silver's (SLV) performance on the day was even more of a sight to behold with gains in the top 1% of all days since SLV began trading in 2006. Silver (SLV) rose 6.15% for its best day since March 24th when the metal rose 7.96%. Whereas the silver to gold ratio has been in a constant downtrend over the past decade (indicating underperformance of silver relative to gold), yesterday's big gains led to a breakout of this downtrend. With SLV trading higher by over 5% yet again this morning, that downtrend is being broken even more significantly, and that is even with SLV off the pre-market highs above $21.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; As recently as the final days of June, SLV was actually sitting on a loss year to date. That was a far cry from the performance of some of the best-performing assets of the year at the time like the Tech heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) which was up over 14% and the long term Treasuries ETF (TLT) which was up over 21.5%. Silver's yellow cousin, gold, was likewise sitting on a sizeable gain of 16.6%. Pivot ahead to today and the picture is very different. Around this morning's premarket highs when SLV was trading above $21, it actually topped QQQ, TLT, and GLD as the best performing asset in 2020. That is even with each of these other ETFs also trading higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Hot Julys Often Bring Late-Summer/Autumn Buys\n\n&gt; Despite persistent pandemic setbacks, bleak economic and corporate numbers, geopolitical tensions, civic unrest and a knock-down, drag-out election battle, the U.S. stock market has proven rather resilient. After suffering the shortest bear market in history that lasted only 40 days the velocity and strength of the V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low has been impressive.\n\n&gt; Massive fiscal stimulus, the return of ZIRP (zero interest rate policy), vaccine promise and the boon of the \u201cstay-at-home\u201d economy have sent the market higher again here in July with NASDAQ tacking on new all-time highs, though the Dow and S&amp;P 500 continue to struggle. As of yesterday\u2019s close this put DJIA up 4.6%, S&amp;P 500 up 5.7% and NASDAQ up 6.4% for the month of July at yesterday\u2019s close, qualifying this as a \u201cHot July Market\u201d.\n\n&gt; Gains of this magnitude for July, however, have frequently been followed by a late-summer or autumn selloffs and better buying opportunities than now. In the past, full-month July gains in excess of 3.5% for DJIA have been followed historically by declines of -7.2% on average (-4.7% median decline) in the Dow with a low at some point in the last 5 months of the year. The low in 2018 came a bit late, but it was just 2 days into winter. There were also prior lower prices in late October and November.\n\n&gt; Climbing COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths have forced rollbacks and pauses of economic reopening plans and travel restrictions. Coupled with an uptick in jobless claims and other troublesome economic readings and forecasts as well as elevated valuations, exuberant sentiment, technical resistance and seasonal weakness, stocks are ripe for a pullback. Today\u2019s selloff: case in point. This will likely set up a great buy as the $13+ trillion flows through the global economy into US stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8b02cd9a08b7fedd5996d544420d9cd8/cb70e70b199ba14d-04/s500x750/c8010183a653633c81747813512c8c74ed5214a2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$PYPL** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$APHA** \n&gt; * **$EBAY** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$RTX** \n&gt; * **$AZN** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$SAP** \n&gt; * **$QCOM** \n&gt; * **$CNC** \n&gt; * **$MO** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$GOOG** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$GILD**\n&gt; * **$NOW** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$DXCM** \n&gt; * **$ABCB** \n&gt; * **$BUD** \n&gt; * **$JBLU** \n&gt; * **$CLF** \n&gt; * **$PINS** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$WING** \n&gt; * **$LRCX**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/fRgk0Fb6/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/kg5BG97Q/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR MONDAY, JULY 27TH, 2020!](https://i.postimg.cc/ZR2gdg5q/eram01.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8D2LRQ6.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/C6Upp8Y.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/O5wY9g7.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MjSLIaQ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EictqLG.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XGrwuKt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HMjc0WJ.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/0hMH94x.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vFJ1WH4.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7otjSsD.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/7g6UICu.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FKHIibS.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/l21kL5q.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/rrBxXn7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/X4senHx.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KqxX8LC.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/3l48OVf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.31.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0VTb4f4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.31.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Amazon.com, Inc. -\n&gt; **Amazon.com, Inc.
