        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 24th, 2020.\n\n# **Coronavirus fears spoiled a solid earnings season and will further dominate markets ahead\u2019  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/coronavirus-fears-ruin-solid-earnings-season-and-cloud-growth-picture.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The coronavirus outbreak ruined for investors what was a solid earnings reporting season and is casting a pall on forecasts for this quarter and the rest of this year. And now with most of the earnings season in the books, look for the latest coronavirus headlines to fill the vacuum and weigh on stocks the rest of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Fourth-quarter profit growth for S&amp;P 500 companies came in at 3.1%, and if the energy sector is excluded, the growth rate was 6.0%, according to Refinitiv. Just about four weeks ago, analysts expected a slight decline.\n*****\n&gt; However, the deluge of solid corporate results was largely overlooked by investors who are focusing on the spillover impact from the coronavirus on U.S. corporations. Stocks post losses this week as a jump in confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths deepened concerns about slowing global economic growth. Major U.S. companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Procter &amp; Gamble have sounded alarms on the disease, warning of a dent in profits down the road.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe virus is totally underrated,\u201d CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer said on Friday.\u201cWhat I think is a little too premature is they all presume that it is going to be solved within a foreseeable time frame. At what point do we say that many, many companies are going to be hurt by the virus [and] we\u2019re paying too much for stocks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018More cautious than usual\u2019\n&gt; Wall Street analysts have been quick to slash their earnings expectations for the next quarter in light of the fast-spreading virus. Expectations for earnings growth in the first quarter have been cut in half to just 3.2% from more than 6% at the start of 2020, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Companies themselves are also lowering guidance for earnings growth in the near future. There have been more U.S. companies issuing below-consensus guidance for the next quarter than those with upbeat forecasts, marking the weakest ratio in a February since 2014, according to Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile guidance is typically weak in the first quarter as corporates set a low bar, it has been more cautious than usual this earnings season, likely due to the coronavirus,\u201d Subramanian said in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Nearly half of the S&amp;P 500 companies have cited coronavirus during their earnings call this season, according to FactSet. These companies\u2019 average revenue exposure to China is 7.2%, compared to 4.8% exposure for the average S&amp;P 500 company.\n*****\n&gt; As of Friday, China\u2019s National Health Commission reported more than 75,000 confirmed cases and over 2,000 deaths on the mainland. South Korea has also reported more than 200 cases. Meanwhile, World health officials said the outbreak in Iran is \u201cvery worrisome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cLost in those headlines is corporate America\u2019s impressive performance this earnings season,\u201d John Lynch, LPL Financial\u2019s chief investment strategist, said in a note. \u201cCompanies have done an admirable job growing profits considering stiff headwinds.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ePo2a9q.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ClwuPuJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/jpEvLyH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/flHhHRv.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HyjYjBt.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/XCThMbQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TN0RBSk.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ixAr7Su.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DjB46T2.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ncauH0T.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/x4XfkyA.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yeknvyf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hOU10RV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Earnings Season Observations\n\n&gt; The recent news that technology giant Apple would miss its fourth quarter 2020 revenue targets has understandably increased investor anxiety surrounding the potential economic impact of the coronavirus (now called COVID-19). Lost in those headlines is corporate America\u2019s impressive performance this earnings season.\n\n&gt; \u201cCompanies have done an admirable job growing profits considering stiff headwinds,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cDespite slowing global economic growth, weakness in capital investment and manufacturing, a strong US dollar, and a huge drop in energy sector profits, S&amp;P 500 companies are impressively grinding out 1-2 percentage points of overall earnings growth.\u201d The fourth quarter earnings growth may cement the third quarter of 2019 as the trough, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day below.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Some highlights of this earnings season:\n\n&gt; * **Solid revenue upside**. A solid 65% of S&amp;P 500 Index companies have beaten revenue estimates, the highest level since second quarter 2018 and well above the long-term average at 57%. S&amp;P 500 companies have produced a larger-than-normal nearly one percentage point positive revenue surprise and are tracking to a 3.5% top-line increase.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/revenue-tracking-nicely-ahead-of-expectations-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; * **Respectable earnings upside despite headwinds**. The earnings beat rate at 71% is slightly above the 10-year average (70%). S&amp;P 500 earnings growth has surprised by a solid 4.4% so far despite economic, currency, and commodity headwinds.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; * **Consider the energy drag**. Though 1-2% overall earnings growth isn\u2019t much, the gain is approximately 4%, excluding the energy sector.\n&gt; * ** Sector standout**. One of the most China-exposed sectors produced one of the biggest upside earnings surprises: Technology. Technology sector earnings growth is tracking to a 5% year-over-year increase, about 9 percentage points above prior estimates.\n&gt; * **Reassuring outlooks**. Estimates for S&amp;P 500 earnings per share in 2020 have only fallen by about 0.9% since December 31, 2019. Though these numbers may come down a bit more in the coming days and the China situation remains fluid, this modest reduction reflects U.S. companies\u2019 resilience overall amid significant supply chain disruptions.\n\n*****\n\n# Election Year March: Performance Haunted By Steep 1980 Declines\n\n&gt; Boisterous March markets tend to drive prices up early in the month and batter stocks at month end. Julius Caesar failed to heed the famous warning to \u201cbeware the Ides of March\u201d but investors have been served well when they have. Stock prices have a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously, during the latter days of the month. In March 2001, DJIA plunged 1469 points (-11.8%) from March 9 to the 22.\n\n&gt; Normally a decent performing market month, March is somewhat above average in election years with advances 64.7% of the time with a 1.0% average DJIA gain since 1952. S&amp;P 500 has also advanced 64.7% of the time since 1952, but gains have been slightly better at 1.2%, on average. NASDAQ has not fared well in March in election years since 1972. Due to a 17.1% loss in 1980, March is NASDAQ\u2019s second worst month of the election year. Similarly, March 1980\u2019s steep losses adversely affect Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 indices.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9950c2a54b4059c3ffe0481a83cf281a/573a7bf3eae7af17-3d/s400x600/7703526bf6d4a2214d4e4b75883edec7f23d56af.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Performance Throughout The Presidencies\n\n&gt; As markets were closed to observe Presidents Day yesterday and the 2020 Presidential election continues to ramp up, we thought it would be a good time to check up on stock performance during different administrations. In the table below, we show the performance of the Dow during the administrations of every US president since 1900 in addition to the annualized return. In the time since President Trump was sworn into office, the Dow has risen 46.9%. On an annualized basis, the 13.3% return places the current administration in 3rd place for the strongest performance. Only the Clinton administration in the 1990s and Coolidge administration in the 1920s have observed stronger annualized gains. The one caveat of course is that President Trump's term (or terms) has yet to end. Comparing Democratic and Republican administrations since 1900, Democratic presidencies have tended to average stronger returns than their Republican peers, so the stock market's returns under President Trump have deviated somewhat from the norm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021820-Presidents1.png))**\n\n&gt; While it is impossible to say what a candidate's election will mean for the market, at the moment betting markets favor the incumbent to win the presidency while Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg go back and forth in taking the number 2 spot, hovering around 15%-16%. Come Super Tuesday (March 3rd) when we could finally see more clarity on the Democratic side, the back and forth between Bloomberg and Sanders might become more one-sided.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021820-EBO.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yet Another Corona Friday\n\n&gt; The major indices decided it was five o'clock somewhere right off the bat today as they experience yet another \"Corona Friday\". More concerns around the coronavirus have sent stocks lower with the S&amp;P 500 down around 1.1% as of this writing and the Nasdaq down nearly 2% today. Declines on a Friday have become par for the course in 2020. Fridays have been the weakest day of the week so far in 2020; the only one to average a decline. On average, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 0.52% on Fridays while the next worst day has been Monday which has averaged a gain of 0.19%. Fridays have also been the day that the S&amp;P 500 has closed higher the least. Only 28.6% of Fridays this year have seen the S&amp;P 500 finish in the green. That compares to a positive close more than three-quarters of the time on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. While it has averaged a gain of 0.24%, Tuesdays have also experienced a positive close less than half of the time.

All three indexes are well above their respective historical averages for this time of an election year. NASDAQ has in fact already exceeded its average full election year performance going back to 1972. Bullish sentiment and momentum appear to be firmly in place and historical election year patterns suggests strength could easily continue for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 into May. NASDAQ\u2019s surge higher could be vulnerable to a retreat sooner, in March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/baea2768b612eb15dbd047fbc0cff07b/5100d48ef25e7c53-d2/s500x750/10e181f3beef5c191c7ec0ad2bf7e50a0e449324.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Dow Without Boeing (BA)\n\n&gt; For more than a year now, Boeing (BA) has been plagued by the 737 MAX crisis which has weighed on shares of the plane manufacturer with it now currently down nearly 20% from when the initial groundings took place on March 10th of last year. Despite this, while underperforming the broader market due to the 737 issues, the stock is actually still up just over 5% since the start of 2019.\n\n&gt; Even though BA has lagged, it is still the highest-priced of the 30 stocks in the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average. Currently trading around $338.50, the only stocks in the index holding a candle to BA are Apple (AAPL) and UnitedHealth (UNH), which also trade north of $300 per share. That means these stocks have the highest weighting in the index and therefore have a much larger impact than other stocks on the Dow's performance.\n\n&gt; With BA's issues, a number of people have pondered the what-ifs for the Dow had the company not had the issues with the 737. Would we have already broken out the Dow 30K hats were it not for BA? In the chart below, we show the actual performance of the DJIA and have overlaid the performance of an 'alternate Dow' showing its performance if BA had not been in the index since the start of 2019. We used the start of 2019 instead of the actual date of the groundings as it is a little less arbitrary. By our calculations, while we would be a bit closer, even if BA wasn't in the index since the start of 2019, we wouldn't quite be at Dow 30K yet. As shown, our alternate Dow would be almost 1% or 266 points higher if Boeing was not included in the index since the start of 2019.\n\n&gt; While BA has been a drag on the DJIA since last March, it also provided a big boost to the index in early 2018 before the 737 issues hit the stock. In fact, at the start of March 2017, BA was up over 36% YTD and the spread between the Dow's performance with and without BA was around 700 points in the other direction as it is now!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021920-Dow-wo-BA-2.png))**\n\n&gt; Another example of this dynamic in which high priced stocks have a greater impact on the index was observed on Tuesday when Apple's (AAPL) stock fell after the company warned that Q1 revenues would be shy of prior guidance due to the coronavirus. The warnings sent shares down over 3% at its intraday lows, but the stock only finished down 1.83%. While there were equivalent or larger declines like Dow (DOW) or Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) in Tuesday's session, AAPL's declines by far weighed on the index more than any other stock. Of the Dow's 165.89 point decline, AAPL contributed 40.35 points. Fortunately, UNH helped to mitigate some of those losses as it had a positive impact on the index of +22.79 points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021920-Dow2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 21st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXVxywH87mg))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.23.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BYND**\n&gt; * **$SQ** \n&gt; * **$HD** \n&gt; * **$SPCE** \n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$M** \n&gt; * **$CRON** \n&gt; * **$CHK** \n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$TTD** \n&gt; * **$AMRN** \n&gt; * **$SHAK** \n&gt; * **$KOS** \n&gt; * **$AWI** \n&gt; * **$SDC** \n&gt; * **$LOW** \n&gt; * **$ILPT** \n&gt; * **$CLVS** \n&gt; * **$TNDM** \n&gt; * **$IQ** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$CRI** \n&gt; * **$SPNS** \n&gt; * **$TJX** \n&gt; * **$CTB** \n&gt; * **$ETSY** \n&gt; * **$TREE** \n&gt; * **$KEYS** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$GWPH** \n&gt; * **$W** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$WEN** \n&gt; * **$CROX** \n&gt; * **$DIN** \n&gt; * **$DNR** \n&gt; * **$LL** \n&gt; * **$DORM** \n&gt; * **$GH** \n&gt; * **$OXY** \n&gt; * **$MGI** \n&gt; * **$AMT** \n&gt; * **$JCP** \n&gt; * **$CBRL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DjB46T2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/qvtfNhx.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/kpCRctt.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3PTK97f.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eNbMCOD.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/qV7qy6J.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.25.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eNgrHgV.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FopcLUz.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2yyK6HI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dsgBu6B.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9VYkHyk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/5mFOqR0.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rd8JhvX.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/WrX9hNT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jsCwSCH.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/fzm6EPP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lKtvBHM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.28.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Beyond Meat, Inc. $117.45\n&gt; **Beyond Meat, Inc.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 24th, 2020.\n\n# **Coronavirus fears spoiled a solid earnings season and will further dominate markets ahead\u2019  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/coronavirus-fears-ruin-solid-earnings-season-and-cloud-growth-picture.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The coronavirus outbreak ruined for investors what was a solid earnings reporting season and is casting a pall on forecasts for this quarter and the rest of this year. And now with most of the earnings season in the books, look for the latest coronavirus headlines to fill the vacuum and weigh on stocks the rest of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Fourth-quarter profit growth for S&amp;P 500 companies came in at 3.1%, and if the energy sector is excluded, the growth rate was 6.0%, according to Refinitiv. Just about four weeks ago, analysts expected a slight decline.\n*****\n&gt; However, the deluge of solid corporate results was largely overlooked by investors who are focusing on the spillover impact from the coronavirus on U.S. corporations. Stocks post losses this week as a jump in confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths deepened concerns about slowing global economic growth. Major U.S. companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Procter &amp; Gamble have sounded alarms on the disease, warning of a dent in profits down the road.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe virus is totally underrated,\u201d CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer said on Friday.\u201cWhat I think is a little too premature is they all presume that it is going to be solved within a foreseeable time frame. At what point do we say that many, many companies are going to be hurt by the virus [and] we\u2019re paying too much for stocks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018More cautious than usual\u2019\n&gt; Wall Street analysts have been quick to slash their earnings expectations for the next quarter in light of the fast-spreading virus. Expectations for earnings growth in the first quarter have been cut in half to just 3.2% from more than 6% at the start of 2020, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Companies themselves are also lowering guidance for earnings growth in the near future. There have been more U.S. companies issuing below-consensus guidance for the next quarter than those with upbeat forecasts, marking the weakest ratio in a February since 2014, according to Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile guidance is typically weak in the first quarter as corporates set a low bar, it has been more cautious than usual this earnings season, likely due to the coronavirus,\u201d Subramanian said in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Nearly half of the S&amp;P 500 companies have cited coronavirus during their earnings call this season, according to FactSet. These companies\u2019 average revenue exposure to China is 7.2%, compared to 4.8% exposure for the average S&amp;P 500 company.\n*****\n&gt; As of Friday, China\u2019s National Health Commission reported more than 75,000 confirmed cases and over 2,000 deaths on the mainland. South Korea has also reported more than 200 cases. Meanwhile, World health officials said the outbreak in Iran is \u201cvery worrisome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cLost in those headlines is corporate America\u2019s impressive performance this earnings season,\u201d John Lynch, LPL Financial\u2019s chief investment strategist, said in a note. \u201cCompanies have done an admirable job growing profits considering stiff headwinds.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ePo2a9q.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ClwuPuJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/jpEvLyH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/flHhHRv.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HyjYjBt.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/XCThMbQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TN0RBSk.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ixAr7Su.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DjB46T2.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ncauH0T.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/x4XfkyA.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yeknvyf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hOU10RV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Earnings Season Observations\n\n&gt; The recent news that technology giant Apple would miss its fourth quarter 2020 revenue targets has understandably increased investor anxiety surrounding the potential economic impact of the coronavirus (now called COVID-19). Lost in those headlines is corporate America\u2019s impressive performance this earnings season.\n\n&gt; \u201cCompanies have done an admirable job growing profits considering stiff headwinds,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cDespite slowing global economic growth, weakness in capital investment and manufacturing, a strong US dollar, and a huge drop in energy sector profits, S&amp;P 500 companies are impressively grinding out 1-2 percentage points of overall earnings growth.\u201d The fourth quarter earnings growth may cement the third quarter of 2019 as the trough, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day below.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Some highlights of this earnings season:\n\n&gt; * **Solid revenue upside**. A solid 65% of S&amp;P 500 Index companies have beaten revenue estimates, the highest level since second quarter 2018 and well above the long-term average at 57%. S&amp;P 500 companies have produced a larger-than-normal nearly one percentage point positive revenue surprise and are tracking to a 3.5% top-line increase.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/revenue-tracking-nicely-ahead-of-expectations-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; * **Respectable earnings upside despite headwinds**. The earnings beat rate at 71% is slightly above the 10-year average (70%). S&amp;P 500 earnings growth has surprised by a solid 4.4% so far despite economic, currency, and commodity headwinds.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; * **Consider the energy drag**. Though 1-2% overall earnings growth isn\u2019t much, the gain is approximately 4%, excluding the energy sector.\n&gt; * **Sector standout**. One of the most China-exposed sectors produced one of the biggest upside earnings surprises: Technology. Technology sector earnings growth is tracking to a 5% year-over-year increase, about 9 percentage points above prior estimates.\n&gt; * **Reassuring outlooks**. Estimates for S&amp;P 500 earnings per share in 2020 have only fallen by about 0.9% since December 31, 2019. Though these numbers may come down a bit more in the coming days and the China situation remains fluid, this modest reduction reflects U.S. companies\u2019 resilience overall amid significant supply chain disruptions.\n\n*****\n\n# Election Year March: Performance Haunted By Steep 1980 Declines\n\n&gt; Boisterous March markets tend to drive prices up early in the month and batter stocks at month end. Julius Caesar failed to heed the famous warning to \u201cbeware the Ides of March\u201d but investors have been served well when they have. Stock prices have a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously, during the latter days of the month. In March 2001, DJIA plunged 1469 points (-11.8%) from March 9 to the 22.\n\n&gt; Normally a decent performing market month, March is somewhat above average in election years with advances 64.7% of the time with a 1.0% average DJIA gain since 1952. S&amp;P 500 has also advanced 64.7% of the time since 1952, but gains have been slightly better at 1.2%, on average. NASDAQ has not fared well in March in election years since 1972. Due to a 17.1% loss in 1980, March is NASDAQ\u2019s second worst month of the election year. Similarly, March 1980\u2019s steep losses adversely affect Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 indices.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9950c2a54b4059c3ffe0481a83cf281a/573a7bf3eae7af17-3d/s400x600/7703526bf6d4a2214d4e4b75883edec7f23d56af.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Performance Throughout The Presidencies\n\n&gt; As markets were closed to observe Presidents Day yesterday and the 2020 Presidential election continues to ramp up, we thought it would be a good time to check up on stock performance during different administrations. In the table below, we show the performance of the Dow during the administrations of every US president since 1900 in addition to the annualized return. In the time since President Trump was sworn into office, the Dow has risen 46.9%. On an annualized basis, the 13.3% return places the current administration in 3rd place for the strongest performance. Only the Clinton administration in the 1990s and Coolidge administration in the 1920s have observed stronger annualized gains. The one caveat of course is that President Trump's term (or terms) has yet to end. Comparing Democratic and Republican administrations since 1900, Democratic presidencies have tended to average stronger returns than their Republican peers, so the stock market's returns under President Trump have deviated somewhat from the norm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021820-Presidents1.png))**\n\n&gt; While it is impossible to say what a candidate's election will mean for the market, at the moment betting markets favor the incumbent to win the presidency while Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg go back and forth in taking the number 2 spot, hovering around 15%-16%. Come Super Tuesday (March 3rd) when we could finally see more clarity on the Democratic side, the back and forth between Bloomberg and Sanders might become more one-sided.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021820-EBO.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yet Another Corona Friday\n\n&gt; The major indices decided it was five o'clock somewhere right off the bat today as they experience yet another \"Corona Friday\". More concerns around the coronavirus have sent stocks lower with the S&amp;P 500 down around 1.1% as of this writing and the Nasdaq down nearly 2% today. Declines on a Friday have become par for the course in 2020. Fridays have been the weakest day of the week so far in 2020; the only one to average a decline. On average, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 0.52% on Fridays while the next worst day has been Monday which has averaged a gain of 0.19%. Fridays have also been the day that the S&amp;P 500 has closed higher the least. Only 28.6% of Fridays this year have seen the S&amp;P 500 finish in the green. That compares to a positive close more than three-quarters of the time on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. While it has averaged a gain of 0.24%, Tuesdays have also experienced a positive close less than half of the time.

All three indexes are well above their respective historical averages for this time of an election year. NASDAQ has in fact already exceeded its average full election year performance going back to 1972. Bullish sentiment and momentum appear to be firmly in place and historical election year patterns suggests strength could easily continue for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 into May. NASDAQ\u2019s surge higher could be vulnerable to a retreat sooner, in March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/baea2768b612eb15dbd047fbc0cff07b/5100d48ef25e7c53-d2/s500x750/10e181f3beef5c191c7ec0ad2bf7e50a0e449324.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Dow Without Boeing (BA)\n\n&gt; For more than a year now, Boeing (BA) has been plagued by the 737 MAX crisis which has weighed on shares of the plane manufacturer with it now currently down nearly 20% from when the initial groundings took place on March 10th of last year. Despite this, while underperforming the broader market due to the 737 issues, the stock is actually still up just over 5% since the start of 2019.\n\n&gt; Even though BA has lagged, it is still the highest-priced of the 30 stocks in the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average. Currently trading around $338.50, the only stocks in the index holding a candle to BA are Apple (AAPL) and UnitedHealth (UNH), which also trade north of $300 per share. That means these stocks have the highest weighting in the index and therefore have a much larger impact than other stocks on the Dow's performance.\n\n&gt; With BA's issues, a number of people have pondered the what-ifs for the Dow had the company not had the issues with the 737. Would we have already broken out the Dow 30K hats were it not for BA? In the chart below, we show the actual performance of the DJIA and have overlaid the performance of an 'alternate Dow' showing its performance if BA had not been in the index since the start of 2019. We used the start of 2019 instead of the actual date of the groundings as it is a little less arbitrary. By our calculations, while we would be a bit closer, even if BA wasn't in the index since the start of 2019, we wouldn't quite be at Dow 30K yet. As shown, our alternate Dow would be almost 1% or 266 points higher if Boeing was not included in the index since the start of 2019.\n\n&gt; While BA has been a drag on the DJIA since last March, it also provided a big boost to the index in early 2018 before the 737 issues hit the stock. In fact, at the start of March 2017, BA was up over 36% YTD and the spread between the Dow's performance with and without BA was around 700 points in the other direction as it is now!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021920-Dow-wo-BA-2.png))**\n\n&gt; Another example of this dynamic in which high priced stocks have a greater impact on the index was observed on Tuesday when Apple's (AAPL) stock fell after the company warned that Q1 revenues would be shy of prior guidance due to the coronavirus. The warnings sent shares down over 3% at its intraday lows, but the stock only finished down 1.83%. While there were equivalent or larger declines like Dow (DOW) or Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) in Tuesday's session, AAPL's declines by far weighed on the index more than any other stock. Of the Dow's 165.89 point decline, AAPL contributed 40.35 points. Fortunately, UNH helped to mitigate some of those losses as it had a positive impact on the index of +22.79 points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021920-Dow2.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BYND**\n&gt; * **$SQ** \n&gt; * **$HD** \n&gt; * **$SPCE** \n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$M** \n&gt; * **$CRON** \n&gt; * **$CHK** \n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$TTD** \n&gt; * **$AMRN** \n&gt; * **$SHAK** \n&gt; * **$KOS** \n&gt; * **$AWI** \n&gt; * **$SDC** \n&gt; * **$LOW** \n&gt; * **$ILPT** \n&gt; * **$CLVS** \n&gt; * **$TNDM** \n&gt; * **$IQ** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$CRI** \n&gt; * **$SPNS** \n&gt; * **$TJX** \n&gt; * **$CTB** \n&gt; * **$ETSY** \n&gt; * **$TREE** \n&gt; * **$KEYS** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$GWPH** \n&gt; * **$W** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$WEN** \n&gt; * **$CROX** \n&gt; * **$DIN** \n&gt; * **$DNR** \n&gt; * **$LL** \n&gt; * **$DORM** \n&gt; * **$GH** \n&gt; * **$OXY** \n&gt; * **$MGI** \n&gt; * **$AMT** \n&gt; * **$JCP** \n&gt; * **$CBRL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DjB46T2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/qvtfNhx.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/kpCRctt.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3PTK97f.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eNbMCOD.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/qV7qy6J.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.25.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eNgrHgV.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FopcLUz.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2yyK6HI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dsgBu6B.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9VYkHyk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/5mFOqR0.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rd8JhvX.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/WrX9hNT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jsCwSCH.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/fzm6EPP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lKtvBHM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.28.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Beyond Meat, Inc. $117.45\n&gt; **Beyond Meat, Inc.

Also recall last year CRM missed RPO guidance.\n\nLonger term, Tableau is increasingly seen as the next multi-year up-sell opportunity.

        "selftext": "BULL GANG GANG checking in here. I've made $600 so far trading my student loan money (JK i actually made $900 but I lost $300 on some really retarded shit but I do know the difference between a put and a call option so far so I am learning). Anyways, I think the mods have released me from my one month ban in purgatory, so I will share some lessons I've learned while investing autsitcally:\n\nI learned what a put option is - a put option means you put your money in the toilet and flush it. I bought $15 put options for $SPCE and it did not work out. Fuck the gay bears and the gay mods, the bull market will LAST FOREVER.\n\nDon't invest all of your student loan money in Dogecoin. I lost like $150 which could have bought a bunch of tendies. Stock options &gt; crypto because when you trade crypto you can lose half of your money but when you trade options you lose all your money and I've never been a glass half full kind of guy. Lao Tzu, Daoism's daddy, said that a bowl is most useful only when it's empty and my bank account is about to be the biggest bowl ever. I want to smoke the biggest bowl ever.\n\nI am currently all in on $CRM. While $AAPL is getting fucked by the CORONAVIRUS, and my wife is geting fucked by her boyfriend, SALESFORCE is a buy. They are releasing their earnings on Tuesday, and when they outperform, all of my money, which is invested in $CRM stock or $CRM call options, will go to the moon and I can buy so many tendies. SOFTWARE is immune to the coronavirus and software makes my soft 1 inch pp turn into a HARD 2 incher. I'm thinking I'm going to buy a plane ticket to vegas so I can make it rain after SALESFORCE prints me money.\n\nGOD BLESS AMERICA. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE STUDENT LOAN MONEY, UNCLE SAM, IT WILL TURN ME INTO A MILLIONAIRE!",

        "selftext": "I was drinking my coffee when 'the flash crash' of 2/20/20 occurred.  The stupidity of the CNBC anchors spouting the same shit for the first 10 minutes was phenomenal.  'Fears of corona must have finally taken hold,' 'Trump just tweeted' (it was some banal shit that wasn't one of his usual pumps), all stupid shit their Masters in Finance degree and kneepads in risk-adverse mindset has trained them to say and has gotten them to a cushy 6 figure gig. Eventually the only hard dick dude on the air \\[source file:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp-Jw-5Kx8k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp-Jw-5Kx8k)\\], Rick Santelli notes a large Acra dump of Tech ETFs by a single seller.  Someone with tens of bills if not more decided on a casual Thursday mid-morning sale of what was enough to shake up the confidence of the entire tech industry and market as large that you saw continued Friday.\n\nSo we're in a late stage market where we all raise eye brows on any growth company that has a lower than 75 P/E since they clearly don't give a fuck about growing enough like a good little baby company should. Kinda sketchy but hey shit is going to keep going up right?  Based on how a 2% down day wiped people here, clearlying you're not YOLOing but actually FOMOing in disguise and what I'm here to diagnose you with is the FOMO on how America is shitting on just about every country's economy right now but you've too stupid to know anything aside from SPY and QQQ/TQQQ. At least you're smart enough to not know UDOW. Even then, did you know QQQ holds United Airlines? Imagine how much the CEO had to bribe Invesco to get his shit, stale company listed with the likes of Amazon and Intel.  Congrats on investing in a shit company when what you really just want is AMD/MSFT/Alphabet etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not going to go any more indepth on American economic supremacy than stating the thesis: \n\n*Institutional capital flight from uncertain and poor yielding foreign markets is causing a massive cash influx. With factors such as foreign dollar denominated debt and the race to the bottom in terms of other country's attempts at devaluing their currency to have competitive export pricing relative to their shit quality exports, the USD is overly buoyant. With a size-queen president who bullies the federal chairman into doing his bidding cuz he's going for a high score in the game of the stock market just like us with our portfolios,  we are in a perpetual state of tits not being able to go up in the U.S. stock market. Given ETFs (particularly market cap weighted) receive a bulk of this capital flight, it causes a deanchoring of intrinsic price vs market price i.e. price discovery is less-existent than before, leaving one exposed and not agile enough against algos to sudden market moves resulting in getting fucked in the ass repeatedly even when they do find a nice little value stock to play with. Also value stock seekers are just bears in disguise don't let them fool you.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat doesn't mean there won't be sector specific pullbacks like what mr. money bags caused on Thursday morning. So why be 100% in TQQQ if you want to capture American growth?  Lot of chinese shit on there anyways like lmao NIO.  It's an all NASDAQ ETF, they'll let anyone with 50k post a ticker and place a holding company in US lands to try to claw some of their country's cash back.  But yeah, stocks are going up duh, so how do you not die during these pullbacks decided by people who are called 'sir' by their staff?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Leveraged Currency ETFs**: (Examples:  $YCS 2x short yen,  $DEUR 4x long usd vs euro )\n\nLot of things to note with these.  A lot of them are thinly traded so feel free to get fucked placing a market order.  A lot of them have thin options so understand you're trading with market makers so if you place an order at ask and get cold feet the next day, yes you will be selling at bid and Citadel thanks you for the 60 bucks or whatever. I have read the prospectus of a few of these and note for the 4x leveraged ones they try to replicate one day at a time worth of value change at one specific time.  So it won't be constantly rebalancing through the day which is a plus.  However it also suffers even greater from the 5% off of 100 = 95 and then the next day it gains back 5% but oh look you're not at 100 you're 99.75 or some shit, so volatile markets they naturally decay very quick.  Sustained progression in one direction not so much which is what we are betting on.\n\n**Leveraged Country/Regions ETFs**: (Example: $YANG 3x bear china, $EPF 2x bear Euro, $ARGT 1x long argentina i.e. buy puts lmao)\n\nSo China people still eat bat soup and spread infections due to it.  Worse are the westerners who believe that story and controlled state media when the penalties for those who break from the party line is sitting beside some Uighurs in a concentration camp in Xinjiang.  There are a lot of good ones in particular YANG but as you start looking at specific countries they thin out.  Germany has some good ones to buy puts on as when they start to falter it will be magnified by the low hanging fruit countries in the Eurozone. ARGT up there in the example is non-existent for options but hey be a market maker for a day and buy a leap and be the only open interest on all of CBOE for an ETF. Oh fun fact did you know that you receive a fine of 500k in Argentina if you use your own inflation figures and not the governments?  Find countries like that and short them as all their smart money is leaving the minimum legally required in their countries (looking at you Japan), and investing in shitty US companies (looking at you SoftBank) as they elected their shit leadership in the first place.  Also buying puts against the Africa ETF is racist but please look at the portfolio holdings; the Van Eyck one is nearly all South Africa which weirdly enough is not a representative market of some Tacoma driving, AK47 brandishing warlords in Nigeria cutting off petroleum exports from West Africa.  I also just learned West Africa isn't even a country yet South Africa is!  Wild as fuck this planet we live on!\n\nTreasury ETFs:\n\nTLT the only one you need until the Fed really start printing cash pushing up short term interest rates but given other countries are in the negatives we will probably keep pushing our rates lower meaning the instrinsic value of long dated ones will be worth more.  Gonna be honest these are kinda boring.\n\n**Leveraged Treasury ETF**s:\n\nTMF is TLT's daddy that spits in your mom's mouth when giving her anal in your childhood bed.  It's 3x that so you might actually be able to retire rich.\n\n**Leveraged Volatility** (Example: UVXY, TVIX)\n\nUse these sparingly.  They are kinda gay in that they have a high correlation with shit like TQQQ going down but they do spike in world events which is cool because America may still be the bees knees but just because Russia invaded China doesn't mean our economy isn't going to do anything other than prosper long term selling weapons to both sides - so why get cucked when TQQQ goes down due to it even though most of NASDAQ will just sell robot tank truck AI CRM shared-work-space packages and make more money.\n\nSo feel free to keep losing half your portfolio every down 2% down day or realize that while you intrinsically understand America is doing super good right now, you just don't know how to capture it aside from the same three ETFs that get talked about on here ad nauseum.  Here are a few more for u to lose money on also. Oh also don't use futures or do it whatever idc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk thank you for coming to my Ted Talk if you read that all just know you took advice from someone with 4k in their portfolio, so positions as always:\n\n [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Klimt-missionaires-02.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Klimt-missionaires-02.jpg)",

(CNBC)\n* Treasury Department data shows the budget deficit for the first fourth months of fiscal 2020 at $389.2 billion. That\u2019s a 25% gain over the same period last year and already about 40% of the total deficit for fiscal 2019. Over the past 12 months, the gap has been nearly $1.1 trillion as the national debt has swelled past $23 trillion.

That brings the country\u2019s total death toll to 1,367 as the number of people infected hit 59,804. China\u2019s Hubei province said it\u2019s starting to include \u201cclinically diagnosed\u201d cases in its figures and that 13,332 of the new cases fall under that classification. In the U.S., the CDC confirmed a new case in California, taking the total number of cases in the country to 14.

Facebook (FB) and other major companies have pulled out of MWC in recent days amid growing fears over the deadly outbreak. (CNBC)\n* The Iowa Democratic Party chairman is stepping down from his position, eight days after the Iowa caucuses became a national fiasco for the Democrats. \u201cAs chair of this party, I am deeply sorry for what happened and bear the responsibility for any failures on behalf of the Iowa Democratic Party,\u201d Troy Price said. (NBC News)\n* Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick dropped out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, after he barely received support in either the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary.

Kirsten Gillibrand, who dropped out of the 2020 presidential race back in August, unveiled her new proposal for digital privacy legislation, including a new federal agency to enforce consumers\u2019 privacy rights online.

The major averages all had their best weekly gains in months despite that Friday drop, but the trend is clearly negative as we head into the new week. The Nasdaq\u2019s weekly gain last week was its largest since November 2018, even after a 0.5% fall on Friday. Tech has been February\u2019s strongest sector so far, and the Consumer Staples sector finished last week at a record high.

It\u2019s also proposing to continue tax cuts for individuals through 2035 at a cost of $1.4 trillion, a figure that serves as a rough placeholder for President Donald Trump\u2019s promised \u201cTax Cuts 2.0.\u201d (CNBC)\n* Treasury yields move higher ahead of Trump\u2019s 2021 budget (CNBC)\n* No economic releases are on today\u2019s calendar.

Tesla posted 10 consecutive weekly gains and have risen 127% over that span. (CNBC)\n* China\u2019s National Health Commission said it confirmed 3,062 new coronavirus cases and 97 additional deaths, mostly in Hubei province. The government said a total of 40,171 cases have been confirmed and 908 people have died in the country.

Bernie Sanders remains at the top of the Democratic field in a new NBC News/Marist poll of tomorrow\u2019s New Hampshire primary.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, who had a dismal showing in the Iowa caucuses, comes in at 13%.

Sanders\u2019 campaign plans to ask for a \u201cpartial recanvass\u201d of the results of last week\u2019s Iowa caucuses. (NBC News &amp; AP)\n* Sen. Josh Hawley is proposing putting the Federal Trade Commission, an independent agency, within the Department of Justice, which is part of the executive branch. The proposal is likely to raise alarms about removing the independence of a key regulatory body, especially as Democrats have speculated about Attorney General William Barr\u2019s closeness to Trump. (CNBC)\n* Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the leader of Germany\u2019s Christian Democratic Union and the expected successor of Angela Merkel, will not run for chancellor. She will also give up the leadership of the CDU in the summer, according to an unnamed source cited by Reuters, setting in motion a party leadership contest. (CNBC)\n* L Brands (LB) is nearing a deal to sell its Victoria\u2019s Secret brand to private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal that could be announced as soon this week. It\u2019s not clear what role L Brands CEO Les Wexner would have in such a deal, as he\u2019s under mounting pressure due to his ties to the late sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein. (CNBC)\n* The federally appointed oversight board in charge of Puerto Rico\u2019s ongoing record debt restructuring saga announced they have come to terms with bondholders of around $35 billion, which accounts for nearly 50% of the bankrupt island\u2019s total debt load. The deal will cut the Commonwealth\u2019s outstanding bond debt from $35 billion to approximately $11 billion.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 10th, 2020.\n\n# **Markets could see a turbulent week as investors watch coronavirus, economy and Fed testimony  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/07/markets-could-see-a-turbulent-week-as-investors-watch-coronavirus-economy-and-election.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The uncertainty around the coronavirus could continue to carry more weight in markets than corporate earnings or the consumer inflation and spending data expected in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testifies Tuesday and Wednesday in his bi-annual appearance before Congress, and investors are watching to see if Powell looks ready to move away from the Fed\u2019s neutral stand on interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; Trading was volatile in the past week, with stocks sharply higher four of the five days as investors viewed the virus\u2019 progress to be less rapid than feared. But by Friday, the death of the doctor who discovered the illness and the addition of restrictions in Shenzen, a key manufacturing hub, were among the headlines that renewed investor fears. By Friday, 31,000 people were reported to be infected, mostly in China, but the amount of new cases slowed for a second day, according to the World Health Organization.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were lower Friday even after a much stronger-than-expected January employment report showed 225,000 jobs were created \u2014 65,000 more than expected. Treasury yields, higher much of the week, edged lower Friday, and the 10-year yield dipped below 1.60% once more.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe data has been very positive, but it\u2019s looking in the rear view mirror. It doesn\u2019t take into account any concerns about the coronavirus yet,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts have said volatility will now be a common theme in the stock market, regardless of which way it trades. That may have been apparent in the story of one stock in the past week \u2014 Tesla.\n*****\n&gt; The electric car maker\u2019s stock shot up in parabolic fashion to a high of $968.99 on Tuesday, and was trading more than $200 below that on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI do believe what happened in Tesla just does show some of the euphoria that got into the marketplace,\u201d said Matt Maley, Miller Tabak chief market strategist. Maley said some investors were comparing the surge higher to 1999, when the tech bubble was building. \u201cI really laugh when people justify the rally by saying, it\u2019s not as crazy as it was in 1999.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Maley said now that the stock has \u201cwashed out\u201d on the upside, there\u2019s likely more downside ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSome of these comments in the last couple of days ... talking about how the retail investors piled into the stock. Of course, that\u2019s usually a sign of a top as well,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Brakes on growth\n&gt; UBS Global Wealth Management\u2019s Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele said next week could provide an important look at how the virus is impacting China\u2019s economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext week, Chinese factories are set to reopen after the extended Lunar New Year holiday, and important indicators to note will be to what extent the virus spreads as people resume travel back to work, and how long it takes for production to return to full capacity,\u201d he wrote, adding he still likes emerging markets despite the potential hit on their economies.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect the impact on the U.S. economy to be minimal, and say it should bounce back quickly.\n*****\n&gt; Thursday\u2019s consumer price index and Friday\u2019s retail sales, industrial production and consumer sentiment will be watched closely by economists. ISM manufacturing data was stronger than expected in the past week, ending a period of contraction that started during the trade war.\n*****\n&gt; The first quarter data has been providing a mixed picture of the economy, ahead of any impacts of the virus. Economists had been expecting manufacturing to get a boost after the trade deal, but Boeing\u2019s production shut down and now the virus could muddy that picture.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s been a little bit of chicken little about the economy for awhile. It ebbs and flows,\u201d said Arone, noting the Fed is the backstop if growth is choked. \u201cMost of the indicators indicate the economy is going to chug along.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell testifies for two days before House and Senate committees on the state of the economy. Markets will be watching his comments closely to see what he has to say on the potential impact of the coronavirus. The markets have begun to price in more than one rate cut for this year, even though the Fed is not forecasting any.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWith the strong jobs, I think it\u2019s going to be more of the same. They raised the bar pretty high for them to signal any policy changes,\u201d said John Roberts, U.S. rate strategist at NatWest Markets. \u201cThey mentioned the coronavirus already. We could get more insight into what they\u2019re thinking about that. That\u2019s the main thing we\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s central bank has been adding stimulus, and that was seen as a booster for global stock markets in the past week.\n*****\n&gt; Capital Economics on Friday said it expects the coronavirus to cost the world economy $280 billion in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf we\u2019re right, then this will mean that global GDP will not grow in [quarter over quarter] terms for the first time since 2009,\u201d the economists wrote in a note. \u201cWe assume the virus will be contained soon, and that lost output is made up in subsequent quarters, so that world GDP reaches the level it would have done had there been no outbreak by the middle of 2021.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings Bonanza\n&gt; Better-than-expected earnings have helped stoke the market\u2019s recent gains. There are dozens of earnings expected in the week ahead, including CVS Health Wednesday and Pepsi, Nvidia and Kraft Heinz Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; So far, more than 70% of companies are beating forecasts and profits are growing by 2.3%, when including both companies that have reported and those expected to report, according to Refinitiv. At the start of the earnings reporting period, earnings growth was expected to decline.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts will also look to companies to continue disclosing how the virus is impacting their operations. VF Corp, for instance, said 60% of its stores in China are now closed, and those that remain open have serous declines.\n*****\n&gt; # Playing Politics\n&gt; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders sent a shudder through markets when he began to rise in the polls ahead of Iowa\u2019s caucuses. But the chaos in declaring a winner in Iowa this past week, leaves the Democratic field wide open. So New Hampshire\u2019s primary Tuesday will also be important.\n*****\n&gt; The left-leaning Sanders is viewed as negative for the stock market, but his main rivals, Joseph Biden and now Pete Buttigieg, who seems to have led in Iowa, are both moderates. Sanders leads in the New Hampshire polls and is expected to win his neighboring state.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s going to continue to matter for quite some time, until we get clarity at least on who the Democratic candidate is going to be,\u201d said Jon Hill, rates strategist at BMO. \u201d[Buttigieg] would be much more business friendly than some of the other candidates.

Unlike the others, the trading day before and the trading day after this three-day holiday weekend are both down on average over the past 40 years. However, the full week before the long holiday weekend has a bullish record. Since 1990 DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced 20 times with average weekly gains of 0.66% and 0.48% respectively. NASDAQ has one additional weekly decline while Russell 2000 has been the strongest, up 23 times with an average gain of 0.79%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/87d4499ef13ff59956f4c6343e3c411e/5b2bbadb398d5a54-f0/s500x750/24f2f57a33d656e400f05e96ccd367ce42aa6af8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Strong Jobs Report to Begin 2020\n\n&gt; U.S. hiring came in stronger than expected in January, rebounding from a disappointing December print.\n\n&gt; Nonfarm payrolls rose by 225,000 in January, far surpassing Bloomberg\u2019s consensus estimates for a 165,000 gain, according to the jobs report released today by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This number may help alleviate some investor unease over December\u2019s somewhat weak reading. We argued at the time that December\u2019s reading likely was due in large part to calendar effects and the volatility of month-to-month changes. We prefer to base our views of the labor market\u2019s vitality on the larger trend, which, has been undeniably strong, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kciking-off-2020-with-a-strong-rebound.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Some investors have questioned how long hiring can remain elevated before we experience a worker shortage or a sharp rise in wages. The answer, according to this report, is not yet.\n\n&gt; In addition to the strong hiring numbers, workers also have enjoyed healthy wage gains. January saw average hourly earnings rise 3.1% year over year, a slight pickup from December, while average hours worked remained unchanged. \u201cToday\u2019s wage number exceeds inflation, meaning workers are growing their purchasing power in real terms and should be able to continue increasing their consumption of goods and services,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cBut the number is also lower than the 4% threshold that has historically signaled an overheating job market and potential for subsequent economic and market volatility. This is a very encouraging report.\u201d\n\n&gt; The one slight blip in today\u2019s release showed the unemployment rate inching 0.1% higher to 3.6%. This was mainly due to changes to the size of the labor force, which affected revisions. Still, given the extremely low unemployment level, the volatility of month-to-month numbers, and the overwhelmingly positive tone of the other data points released today, we feel confident about the prospects for the U.S. consumer to continue powering this economic expansion through 2020 and beyond.\n\n*****\n\n# New Highs Tilt Scales to Bulls\n\n&gt; China is cutting tariffs; the impeachment process has come to an end and the market is at new all-time highs. The coronavirus is still a concern, but apparently not as much as it was less than one week ago. Progress has been made. Official emergency declarations have mobilized a stronger response. China has quickly built additional hospitals and work is underway on a treatment. Gilead (GILD) appears to be the first to offer a potential cure although its drug remdesivir has not been approved to cure any disease yet. These recent developments along with solid earnings, have been the fuel to reverse the market\u2019s late January retreat in just a few trading sessions this month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/eb99cd5eedf67e83954c998976da3a81/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-49/s500x750/705cf31363591f72784f14fed6029effc84a4228.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/07db71096c88ddf9778d29d0bdb69e60/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-86/s500x750/e6f5479d3cea9759bc52d0c99fff7704947ff575.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdb9b967be268f1fcb154d09dfa8553b/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-2c/s500x750/4f3021be20791991f739de9273300f798a7cbf31.jpg))**\n\n&gt; In the above charts, the market\u2019s strength since October can be seen along with second half of January weakness. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have remained comfortably above their respective 200-day moving averages since October. In January only DJIA actually (and briefly) closed below its even higher 50-day moving average. The market\u2019s rebound surge in February has also reversed negative readings from Stochastic, relative strength and MACD indicators.\n\n&gt; Momentum clearly favors the bulls and January\u2019s negative finish remains unconfirmed as of today. As long as economic data and corporate earnings remain positive then the market is likely to continue the trend that has been in place since last October, higher. There are likely to be some dips along the way with the next possible soft patch arriving when earnings season nears its end later this month and/or in the first half of March.\n\n*****\n\n# Typical February Trading: Tepid Month with Solid Mid-Month Rally\n\n&gt; February has historically been a rather bland month. Since 1950, S&amp;P 500 has averaged a measly 0.1%. Over the last 21-year period S&amp;P 500 average performance has declined to a loss of 0.4% in February. February\u2019s first trading day has historically been good, like today, and trading days eight, nine, ten and eleven have offered repeatable long opportunities. Outside of these five days, the balance of February has been rather lacking.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/10b0e0be07d6824e6a082e13a26bc1d9/e1ddcea381248255-b9/s500x750/a2b1e806df3ec07b5e77c69efd297e5802fa1208.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Does A Lower January Have Bears Smiling?\n\n&gt; Stocks got off to a nice start in 2020, until the late January selloff due to the coronavirus outbreak fears. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell only 0.2% for the month, but it did mark the end to a 4-month win streak. Should bulls worry about what a down January might mean for the rest of 2020?\n\n&gt; There\u2019s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests, \u201cAs goes January, so goes the year.\u201d This was first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac, and it has an impressive track record. Simply put, when the first month of the year was green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa). Given stocks closed red in January, how worried should investors be?\n\n&gt; As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&amp;P 500 has been green in January, the index has been up 11.9% on average over the rest of the year (final 11 months) and higher 86% of the time. However, when that first month was red, stocks rose only 1.2% on average over the final 11 months and were higher less than 60% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/so-goes-january-so-goes-the-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another way to look at this data shows the average full year return based on if stocks are higher in January or not. As you can clearly see, stocks have tended to have trouble gaining any traction over the rest of the year after a January loss, while a green January has been quite strong.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-january-barometer.png?ssl=1)**\n\n&gt; It isn\u2019t all bad news though. Remember the S&amp;P 500 was down only 0.2% in January, so one could argue that it was really flat. \u201cYes, a lower January is a potential worry for the bulls,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut it is worth noting the previous 5 times (and 7 of 8) when stocks were lower in January, those final 11 months rallied. So this might not be the clear cut bearish signal so many think it is.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/a-lower-january-hasnt-been-as-bearish-lately.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Trifecta Spoiled by Coronavirus\n\n&gt; The market decline on the last day of January spoiled what would have been the fourth consecutive January Trifecta. S&amp;P 500 finished January down 0.2% and thus the January Barometer was negative.\n\n&gt; Devised by Yale Hirsch in 1972, the January Barometer has registered ten major errors since 1950 for an 85.7% accuracy ratio. This indicator adheres to propensity that as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year. Of the ten major errors Vietnam affected 1966 and 1968. 1982 saw the start of a major bull market in August. Two January rate cuts and 9/11 affected 2001.The market in January 2003 was held down by the anticipation of military action in Iraq. The second worst bear market since 1900 ended in March of 2009 and Federal Reserve intervention influenced 2010 and 2014. In 2016, DJIA slipped into an official Ned Davis bear market in January. Including the eight flat years yields a .743 batting average.\n\n&gt; This year\u2019s combination of a positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days with a full-month January loss has only occurred eleven times (including this year) since 1950. In the previous ten occurrences S&amp;P 500 was down six times in February with an average loss of 1.5%. However, over the remaining 11 months of the year, S&amp;P 500 advanced 80% of the time with an average gain of 7.4%. Full-year performance was positive 70% of the time, but with an average gain of 2.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6df473ecb7e9c5b9c107222c65f3131a/7be8cdb3803e5a29-77/s500x750/284bbb2175287530e6f02fc233a1772dce7a4852.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 7th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.9.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BABA** \n&gt; * **$ROKU** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$NVDA** \n&gt; * **$CVS** \n&gt; * **$CGC** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$UAA** \n&gt; * **$QSR** \n&gt; * **$L** \n&gt; * **$AGN** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$LYFT** \n&gt; * **$TEVA** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$MCY** \n&gt; * **$SAFE** \n&gt; * **$GBDC** \n&gt; * **$GOLD** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$DO** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$D** \n&gt; * **$CYBR**\n&gt; * **$MELI** \n&gt; * **$CHGG** \n&gt; * **$CNA** \n&gt; * **$EXAS** \n&gt; * **$GT** \n&gt; * **$HLT** \n&gt; * **$AYX** \n&gt; * **$AN** \n&gt; * **$APPS** \n&gt; * **$WM** \n&gt; * **$GPN** \n&gt; * **$CRNT** \n&gt; * **$BIP** \n&gt; * **$YETI** \n&gt; * **$MPAA** \n&gt; * **$LSCC** \n&gt; * **$RNG** \n&gt; * **$NMM** \n&gt; * **$JE**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Tvfxbnh.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DYTRi0w.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.11.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sWB49z5.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hiUR1ec.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/w9FUjTz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cPnIcpa.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/BBaSJcZ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tjUpFdY.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/D7eo9EG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Y4rdLiL.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/feUqB85.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TGxgQ96.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.14.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tC78cWW.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. $216.53\n&gt; **Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 10th, 2020.\n\n# **Markets could see a turbulent week as investors watch coronavirus, economy and Fed testimony  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/07/markets-could-see-a-turbulent-week-as-investors-watch-coronavirus-economy-and-election.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The uncertainty around the coronavirus could continue to carry more weight in markets than corporate earnings or the consumer inflation and spending data expected in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testifies Tuesday and Wednesday in his bi-annual appearance before Congress, and investors are watching to see if Powell looks ready to move away from the Fed\u2019s neutral stand on interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; Trading was volatile in the past week, with stocks sharply higher four of the five days as investors viewed the virus\u2019 progress to be less rapid than feared. But by Friday, the death of the doctor who discovered the illness and the addition of restrictions in Shenzen, a key manufacturing hub, were among the headlines that renewed investor fears. By Friday, 31,000 people were reported to be infected, mostly in China, but the amount of new cases slowed for a second day, according to the World Health Organization.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were lower Friday even after a much stronger-than-expected January employment report showed 225,000 jobs were created \u2014 65,000 more than expected. Treasury yields, higher much of the week, edged lower Friday, and the 10-year yield dipped below 1.60% once more.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe data has been very positive, but it\u2019s looking in the rear view mirror. It doesn\u2019t take into account any concerns about the coronavirus yet,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts have said volatility will now be a common theme in the stock market, regardless of which way it trades. That may have been apparent in the story of one stock in the past week \u2014 Tesla.\n*****\n&gt; The electric car maker\u2019s stock shot up in parabolic fashion to a high of $968.99 on Tuesday, and was trading more than $200 below that on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI do believe what happened in Tesla just does show some of the euphoria that got into the marketplace,\u201d said Matt Maley, Miller Tabak chief market strategist. Maley said some investors were comparing the surge higher to 1999, when the tech bubble was building. \u201cI really laugh when people justify the rally by saying, it\u2019s not as crazy as it was in 1999.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Maley said now that the stock has \u201cwashed out\u201d on the upside, there\u2019s likely more downside ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSome of these comments in the last couple of days ... talking about how the retail investors piled into the stock. Of course, that\u2019s usually a sign of a top as well,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Brakes on growth\n&gt; UBS Global Wealth Management\u2019s Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele said next week could provide an important look at how the virus is impacting China\u2019s economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext week, Chinese factories are set to reopen after the extended Lunar New Year holiday, and important indicators to note will be to what extent the virus spreads as people resume travel back to work, and how long it takes for production to return to full capacity,\u201d he wrote, adding he still likes emerging markets despite the potential hit on their economies.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect the impact on the U.S. economy to be minimal, and say it should bounce back quickly.\n*****\n&gt; Thursday\u2019s consumer price index and Friday\u2019s retail sales, industrial production and consumer sentiment will be watched closely by economists. ISM manufacturing data was stronger than expected in the past week, ending a period of contraction that started during the trade war.\n*****\n&gt; The first quarter data has been providing a mixed picture of the economy, ahead of any impacts of the virus. Economists had been expecting manufacturing to get a boost after the trade deal, but Boeing\u2019s production shut down and now the virus could muddy that picture.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s been a little bit of chicken little about the economy for awhile. It ebbs and flows,\u201d said Arone, noting the Fed is the backstop if growth is choked. \u201cMost of the indicators indicate the economy is going to chug along.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell testifies for two days before House and Senate committees on the state of the economy. Markets will be watching his comments closely to see what he has to say on the potential impact of the coronavirus. The markets have begun to price in more than one rate cut for this year, even though the Fed is not forecasting any.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWith the strong jobs, I think it\u2019s going to be more of the same. They raised the bar pretty high for them to signal any policy changes,\u201d said John Roberts, U.S. rate strategist at NatWest Markets. \u201cThey mentioned the coronavirus already. We could get more insight into what they\u2019re thinking about that. That\u2019s the main thing we\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s central bank has been adding stimulus, and that was seen as a booster for global stock markets in the past week.\n*****\n&gt; Capital Economics on Friday said it expects the coronavirus to cost the world economy $280 billion in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf we\u2019re right, then this will mean that global GDP will not grow in [quarter over quarter] terms for the first time since 2009,\u201d the economists wrote in a note. \u201cWe assume the virus will be contained soon, and that lost output is made up in subsequent quarters, so that world GDP reaches the level it would have done had there been no outbreak by the middle of 2021.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings Bonanza\n&gt; Better-than-expected earnings have helped stoke the market\u2019s recent gains. There are dozens of earnings expected in the week ahead, including CVS Health Wednesday and Pepsi, Nvidia and Kraft Heinz Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; So far, more than 70% of companies are beating forecasts and profits are growing by 2.3%, when including both companies that have reported and those expected to report, according to Refinitiv. At the start of the earnings reporting period, earnings growth was expected to decline.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts will also look to companies to continue disclosing how the virus is impacting their operations. VF Corp, for instance, said 60% of its stores in China are now closed, and those that remain open have serous declines.\n*****\n&gt; # Playing Politics\n&gt; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders sent a shudder through markets when he began to rise in the polls ahead of Iowa\u2019s caucuses. But the chaos in declaring a winner in Iowa this past week, leaves the Democratic field wide open. So New Hampshire\u2019s primary Tuesday will also be important.\n*****\n&gt; The left-leaning Sanders is viewed as negative for the stock market, but his main rivals, Joseph Biden and now Pete Buttigieg, who seems to have led in Iowa, are both moderates. Sanders leads in the New Hampshire polls and is expected to win his neighboring state.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s going to continue to matter for quite some time, until we get clarity at least on who the Democratic candidate is going to be,\u201d said Jon Hill, rates strategist at BMO. \u201d[Buttigieg] would be much more business friendly than some of the other candidates. Does that make him more or less electable? If he\u2019s more that could be a market negative development.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has gained 55% since Donald Trump became president, and analysts say he is viewed by investors as having the best policies for the stock market. Some Democrats, particularly Sanders, would raise taxes sharply.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qOqI74J.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/n8uJhuY.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/qSPsa54.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yKvMhID.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qFnHyJw.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Zwtq6za.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Crf7CiP.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wSa5dB3.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8e4snrC.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/O4BbZMh.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4df33Zh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/YwquWUG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/nJe64uF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Week Before Presidents\u2019 Day Bullish since 1990\n\n&gt; Page 100 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 points out Presidents\u2019 Day as the poorest performing holiday of the eight holidays that are tracked. Unlike the others, the trading day before and the trading day after this three-day holiday weekend are both down on average over the past 40 years. However, the full week before the long holiday weekend has a bullish record. Since 1990 DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced 20 times with average weekly gains of 0.66% and 0.48% respectively. NASDAQ has one additional weekly decline while Russell 2000 has been the strongest, up 23 times with an average gain of 0.79%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/87d4499ef13ff59956f4c6343e3c411e/5b2bbadb398d5a54-f0/s500x750/24f2f57a33d656e400f05e96ccd367ce42aa6af8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Strong Jobs Report to Begin 2020\n\n&gt; U.S. hiring came in stronger than expected in January, rebounding from a disappointing December print.\n\n&gt; Nonfarm payrolls rose by 225,000 in January, far surpassing Bloomberg\u2019s consensus estimates for a 165,000 gain, according to the jobs report released today by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This number may help alleviate some investor unease over December\u2019s somewhat weak reading. We argued at the time that December\u2019s reading likely was due in large part to calendar effects and the volatility of month-to-month changes. We prefer to base our views of the labor market\u2019s vitality on the larger trend, which, has been undeniably strong, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kciking-off-2020-with-a-strong-rebound.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Some investors have questioned how long hiring can remain elevated before we experience a worker shortage or a sharp rise in wages. The answer, according to this report, is not yet.\n\n&gt; In addition to the strong hiring numbers, workers also have enjoyed healthy wage gains. January saw average hourly earnings rise 3.1% year over year, a slight pickup from December, while average hours worked remained unchanged. \u201cToday\u2019s wage number exceeds inflation, meaning workers are growing their purchasing power in real terms and should be able to continue increasing their consumption of goods and services,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cBut the number is also lower than the 4% threshold that has historically signaled an overheating job market and potential for subsequent economic and market volatility. This is a very encouraging report.\u201d\n\n&gt; The one slight blip in today\u2019s release showed the unemployment rate inching 0.1% higher to 3.6%. This was mainly due to changes to the size of the labor force, which affected revisions. Still, given the extremely low unemployment level, the volatility of month-to-month numbers, and the overwhelmingly positive tone of the other data points released today, we feel confident about the prospects for the U.S. consumer to continue powering this economic expansion through 2020 and beyond.\n\n*****\n\n# New Highs Tilt Scales to Bulls\n\n&gt; China is cutting tariffs; the impeachment process has come to an end and the market is at new all-time highs. The coronavirus is still a concern, but apparently not as much as it was less than one week ago. Progress has been made. Official emergency declarations have mobilized a stronger response. China has quickly built additional hospitals and work is underway on a treatment. Gilead (GILD) appears to be the first to offer a potential cure although its drug remdesivir has not been approved to cure any disease yet. These recent developments along with solid earnings, have been the fuel to reverse the market\u2019s late January retreat in just a few trading sessions this month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/eb99cd5eedf67e83954c998976da3a81/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-49/s500x750/705cf31363591f72784f14fed6029effc84a4228.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/07db71096c88ddf9778d29d0bdb69e60/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-86/s500x750/e6f5479d3cea9759bc52d0c99fff7704947ff575.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdb9b967be268f1fcb154d09dfa8553b/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-2c/s500x750/4f3021be20791991f739de9273300f798a7cbf31.jpg))**\n\n&gt; In the above charts, the market\u2019s strength since October can be seen along with second half of January weakness. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have remained comfortably above their respective 200-day moving averages since October. In January only DJIA actually (and briefly) closed below its even higher 50-day moving average. The market\u2019s rebound surge in February has also reversed negative readings from Stochastic, relative strength and MACD indicators.\n\n&gt; Momentum clearly favors the bulls and January\u2019s negative finish remains unconfirmed as of today. As long as economic data and corporate earnings remain positive then the market is likely to continue the trend that has been in place since last October, higher. There are likely to be some dips along the way with the next possible soft patch arriving when earnings season nears its end later this month and/or in the first half of March.\n\n*****\n\n# Typical February Trading: Tepid Month with Solid Mid-Month Rally\n\n&gt; February has historically been a rather bland month. Since 1950, S&amp;P 500 has averaged a measly 0.1%. Over the last 21-year period S&amp;P 500 average performance has declined to a loss of 0.4% in February. February\u2019s first trading day has historically been good, like today, and trading days eight, nine, ten and eleven have offered repeatable long opportunities. Outside of these five days, the balance of February has been rather lacking.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/10b0e0be07d6824e6a082e13a26bc1d9/e1ddcea381248255-b9/s500x750/a2b1e806df3ec07b5e77c69efd297e5802fa1208.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Does A Lower January Have Bears Smiling?\n\n&gt; Stocks got off to a nice start in 2020, until the late January selloff due to the coronavirus outbreak fears. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell only 0.2% for the month, but it did mark the end to a 4-month win streak. Should bulls worry about what a down January might mean for the rest of 2020?\n\n&gt; There\u2019s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests, \u201cAs goes January, so goes the year.\u201d This was first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac, and it has an impressive track record. Simply put, when the first month of the year was green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa). Given stocks closed red in January, how worried should investors be?\n\n&gt; As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&amp;P 500 has been green in January, the index has been up 11.9% on average over the rest of the year (final 11 months) and higher 86% of the time. However, when that first month was red, stocks rose only 1.2% on average over the final 11 months and were higher less than 60% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/so-goes-january-so-goes-the-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another way to look at this data shows the average full year return based on if stocks are higher in January or not. As you can clearly see, stocks have tended to have trouble gaining any traction over the rest of the year after a January loss, while a green January has been quite strong.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-january-barometer.png?ssl=1)**\n\n&gt; It isn\u2019t all bad news though. Remember the S&amp;P 500 was down only 0.2% in January, so one could argue that it was really flat. \u201cYes, a lower January is a potential worry for the bulls,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut it is worth noting the previous 5 times (and 7 of 8) when stocks were lower in January, those final 11 months rallied. So this might not be the clear cut bearish signal so many think it is.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/a-lower-january-hasnt-been-as-bearish-lately.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Trifecta Spoiled by Coronavirus\n\n&gt; The market decline on the last day of January spoiled what would have been the fourth consecutive January Trifecta. S&amp;P 500 finished January down 0.2% and thus the January Barometer was negative.\n\n&gt; Devised by Yale Hirsch in 1972, the January Barometer has registered ten major errors since 1950 for an 85.7% accuracy ratio. This indicator adheres to propensity that as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year. Of the ten major errors Vietnam affected 1966 and 1968. 1982 saw the start of a major bull market in August. Two January rate cuts and 9/11 affected 2001.The market in January 2003 was held down by the anticipation of military action in Iraq. The second worst bear market since 1900 ended in March of 2009 and Federal Reserve intervention influenced 2010 and 2014. In 2016, DJIA slipped into an official Ned Davis bear market in January. Including the eight flat years yields a .743 batting average.\n\n&gt; This year\u2019s combination of a positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days with a full-month January loss has only occurred eleven times (including this year) since 1950.

The major averages all had their best weekly gains in months despite that Friday drop, but the trend is clearly negative as we head into the new week. The Nasdaq\u2019s weekly gain last week was its largest since November 2018, even after a 0.5% fall on Friday. Tech has been February\u2019s strongest sector so far, and the Consumer Staples sector finished last week at a record high. (CNBC)\n* The Trump administration will release its fiscal 2021 budget today, which will show the economy growing at an average rate of 3% for the next 15 years. It\u2019s also proposing to continue tax cuts for individuals through 2035 at a cost of $1.4 trillion, a figure that serves as a rough placeholder for President Donald Trump\u2019s promised \u201cTax Cuts 2.0.\u201d (CNBC)\n* Treasury yields move higher ahead of Trump\u2019s 2021 budget (CNBC)\n* No economic releases are on today\u2019s calendar.

(CNBC)\n* Allergan (AGN), Edgewell Personal Care (EPC), and Restaurant Brands International (QSR) are among the companies set to release quarterly earnings this morning. Callaway Golf (ELY) and XPO Logistics (XPO) issue numbers after the closing bell.\n* Tesla (TSLA) shares were up 9% in the premarket this morning after a tumultuous week, which saw the stock move more than $100 per share in either direction in three of five sessions. Tesla posted 10 consecutive weekly gains and have risen 127% over that span. (CNBC)\n* China\u2019s National Health Commission said it confirmed 3,062 new coronavirus cases and 97 additional deaths, mostly in Hubei province. The government said a total of 40,171 cases have been confirmed and 908 people have died in the country. The U.K. has confirmed four further cases of the coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the country to eight.

Bernie Sanders remains at the top of the Democratic field in a new NBC News/Marist poll of tomorrow\u2019s New Hampshire primary. Sanders gets 25% of likely Democratic primary voters in the poll, while former Mayor Pete Buttigieg receives support from 21%. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who had a dismal showing in the Iowa caucuses, comes in at 13%.

Sanders\u2019 campaign plans to ask for a \u201cpartial recanvass\u201d of the results of last week\u2019s Iowa caucuses. (NBC News &amp; AP)\n* Sen. Josh Hawley is proposing putting the Federal Trade Commission, an independent agency, within the Department of Justice, which is part of the executive branch. The proposal is likely to raise alarms about removing the independence of a key regulatory body, especially as Democrats have speculated about Attorney General William Barr\u2019s closeness to Trump. (CNBC)\n* Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the leader of Germany\u2019s Christian Democratic Union and the expected successor of Angela Merkel, will not run for chancellor. She will also give up the leadership of the CDU in the summer, according to an unnamed source cited by Reuters, setting in motion a party leadership contest. (CNBC)\n* L Brands (LB) is nearing a deal to sell its Victoria\u2019s Secret brand to private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal that could be announced as soon this week. It\u2019s not clear what role L Brands CEO Les Wexner would have in such a deal, as he\u2019s under mounting pressure due to his ties to the late sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein. (CNBC)\n* The federally appointed oversight board in charge of Puerto Rico\u2019s ongoing record debt restructuring saga announced they have come to terms with bondholders of around $35 billion, which accounts for nearly 50% of the bankrupt island\u2019s total debt load.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 10th, 2020.\n\n# **Markets could see a turbulent week as investors watch coronavirus, economy and Fed testimony  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/07/markets-could-see-a-turbulent-week-as-investors-watch-coronavirus-economy-and-election.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The uncertainty around the coronavirus could continue to carry more weight in markets than corporate earnings or the consumer inflation and spending data expected in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testifies Tuesday and Wednesday in his bi-annual appearance before Congress, and investors are watching to see if Powell looks ready to move away from the Fed\u2019s neutral stand on interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; Trading was volatile in the past week, with stocks sharply higher four of the five days as investors viewed the virus\u2019 progress to be less rapid than feared. But by Friday, the death of the doctor who discovered the illness and the addition of restrictions in Shenzen, a key manufacturing hub, were among the headlines that renewed investor fears. By Friday, 31,000 people were reported to be infected, mostly in China, but the amount of new cases slowed for a second day, according to the World Health Organization.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were lower Friday even after a much stronger-than-expected January employment report showed 225,000 jobs were created \u2014 65,000 more than expected. Treasury yields, higher much of the week, edged lower Friday, and the 10-year yield dipped below 1.60% once more.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe data has been very positive, but it\u2019s looking in the rear view mirror. It doesn\u2019t take into account any concerns about the coronavirus yet,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts have said volatility will now be a common theme in the stock market, regardless of which way it trades. That may have been apparent in the story of one stock in the past week \u2014 Tesla.\n*****\n&gt; The electric car maker\u2019s stock shot up in parabolic fashion to a high of $968.99 on Tuesday, and was trading more than $200 below that on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI do believe what happened in Tesla just does show some of the euphoria that got into the marketplace,\u201d said Matt Maley, Miller Tabak chief market strategist. Maley said some investors were comparing the surge higher to 1999, when the tech bubble was building. \u201cI really laugh when people justify the rally by saying, it\u2019s not as crazy as it was in 1999.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Maley said now that the stock has \u201cwashed out\u201d on the upside, there\u2019s likely more downside ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSome of these comments in the last couple of days ... talking about how the retail investors piled into the stock. Of course, that\u2019s usually a sign of a top as well,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Brakes on growth\n&gt; UBS Global Wealth Management\u2019s Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele said next week could provide an important look at how the virus is impacting China\u2019s economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext week, Chinese factories are set to reopen after the extended Lunar New Year holiday, and important indicators to note will be to what extent the virus spreads as people resume travel back to work, and how long it takes for production to return to full capacity,\u201d he wrote, adding he still likes emerging markets despite the potential hit on their economies.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect the impact on the U.S. economy to be minimal, and say it should bounce back quickly.\n*****\n&gt; Thursday\u2019s consumer price index and Friday\u2019s retail sales, industrial production and consumer sentiment will be watched closely by economists. ISM manufacturing data was stronger than expected in the past week, ending a period of contraction that started during the trade war.\n*****\n&gt; The first quarter data has been providing a mixed picture of the economy, ahead of any impacts of the virus. Economists had been expecting manufacturing to get a boost after the trade deal, but Boeing\u2019s production shut down and now the virus could muddy that picture.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s been a little bit of chicken little about the economy for awhile. It ebbs and flows,\u201d said Arone, noting the Fed is the backstop if growth is choked. \u201cMost of the indicators indicate the economy is going to chug along.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell testifies for two days before House and Senate committees on the state of the economy. Markets will be watching his comments closely to see what he has to say on the potential impact of the coronavirus. The markets have begun to price in more than one rate cut for this year, even though the Fed is not forecasting any.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWith the strong jobs, I think it\u2019s going to be more of the same. They raised the bar pretty high for them to signal any policy changes,\u201d said John Roberts, U.S. rate strategist at NatWest Markets. \u201cThey mentioned the coronavirus already. We could get more insight into what they\u2019re thinking about that. That\u2019s the main thing we\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s central bank has been adding stimulus, and that was seen as a booster for global stock markets in the past week.\n*****\n&gt; Capital Economics on Friday said it expects the coronavirus to cost the world economy $280 billion in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf we\u2019re right, then this will mean that global GDP will not grow in [quarter over quarter] terms for the first time since 2009,\u201d the economists wrote in a note. \u201cWe assume the virus will be contained soon, and that lost output is made up in subsequent quarters, so that world GDP reaches the level it would have done had there been no outbreak by the middle of 2021.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings Bonanza\n&gt; Better-than-expected earnings have helped stoke the market\u2019s recent gains. There are dozens of earnings expected in the week ahead, including CVS Health Wednesday and Pepsi, Nvidia and Kraft Heinz Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; So far, more than 70% of companies are beating forecasts and profits are growing by 2.3%, when including both companies that have reported and those expected to report, according to Refinitiv. At the start of the earnings reporting period, earnings growth was expected to decline.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts will also look to companies to continue disclosing how the virus is impacting their operations. VF Corp, for instance, said 60% of its stores in China are now closed, and those that remain open have serous declines.\n*****\n&gt; # Playing Politics\n&gt; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders sent a shudder through markets when he began to rise in the polls ahead of Iowa\u2019s caucuses. But the chaos in declaring a winner in Iowa this past week, leaves the Democratic field wide open. So New Hampshire\u2019s primary Tuesday will also be important.\n*****\n&gt; The left-leaning Sanders is viewed as negative for the stock market, but his main rivals, Joseph Biden and now Pete Buttigieg, who seems to have led in Iowa, are both moderates. Sanders leads in the New Hampshire polls and is expected to win his neighboring state.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s going to continue to matter for quite some time, until we get clarity at least on who the Democratic candidate is going to be,\u201d said Jon Hill, rates strategist at BMO. \u201d[Buttigieg] would be much more business friendly than some of the other candidates. Does that make him more or less electable? If he\u2019s more that could be a market negative development.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has gained 55% since Donald Trump became president, and analysts say he is viewed by investors as having the best policies for the stock market. Some Democrats, particularly Sanders, would raise taxes sharply.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qOqI74J.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/n8uJhuY.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/qSPsa54.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yKvMhID.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qFnHyJw.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Zwtq6za.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Crf7CiP.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wSa5dB3.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8e4snrC.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/O4BbZMh.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4df33Zh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/YwquWUG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/nJe64uF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Week Before Presidents\u2019 Day Bullish since 1990\n\n&gt; Page 100 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 points out Presidents\u2019 Day as the poorest performing holiday of the eight holidays that are tracked. Unlike the others, the trading day before and the trading day after this three-day holiday weekend are both down on average over the past 40 years. However, the full week before the long holiday weekend has a bullish record. Since 1990 DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced 20 times with average weekly gains of 0.66% and 0.48% respectively. NASDAQ has one additional weekly decline while Russell 2000 has been the strongest, up 23 times with an average gain of 0.79%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/87d4499ef13ff59956f4c6343e3c411e/5b2bbadb398d5a54-f0/s500x750/24f2f57a33d656e400f05e96ccd367ce42aa6af8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Strong Jobs Report to Begin 2020\n\n&gt; U.S. hiring came in stronger than expected in January, rebounding from a disappointing December print.\n\n&gt; Nonfarm payrolls rose by 225,000 in January, far surpassing Bloomberg\u2019s consensus estimates for a 165,000 gain, according to the jobs report released today by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This number may help alleviate some investor unease over December\u2019s somewhat weak reading. We argued at the time that December\u2019s reading likely was due in large part to calendar effects and the volatility of month-to-month changes. We prefer to base our views of the labor market\u2019s vitality on the larger trend, which, has been undeniably strong, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kciking-off-2020-with-a-strong-rebound.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Some investors have questioned how long hiring can remain elevated before we experience a worker shortage or a sharp rise in wages. The answer, according to this report, is not yet.\n\n&gt; In addition to the strong hiring numbers, workers also have enjoyed healthy wage gains. January saw average hourly earnings rise 3.1% year over year, a slight pickup from December, while average hours worked remained unchanged. \u201cToday\u2019s wage number exceeds inflation, meaning workers are growing their purchasing power in real terms and should be able to continue increasing their consumption of goods and services,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cBut the number is also lower than the 4% threshold that has historically signaled an overheating job market and potential for subsequent economic and market volatility. This is a very encouraging report.\u201d\n\n&gt; The one slight blip in today\u2019s release showed the unemployment rate inching 0.1% higher to 3.6%. This was mainly due to changes to the size of the labor force, which affected revisions. Still, given the extremely low unemployment level, the volatility of month-to-month numbers, and the overwhelmingly positive tone of the other data points released today, we feel confident about the prospects for the U.S. consumer to continue powering this economic expansion through 2020 and beyond.\n\n*****\n\n# New Highs Tilt Scales to Bulls\n\n&gt; China is cutting tariffs; the impeachment process has come to an end and the market is at new all-time highs. The coronavirus is still a concern, but apparently not as much as it was less than one week ago. Progress has been made. Official emergency declarations have mobilized a stronger response. China has quickly built additional hospitals and work is underway on a treatment. Gilead (GILD) appears to be the first to offer a potential cure although its drug remdesivir has not been approved to cure any disease yet. These recent developments along with solid earnings, have been the fuel to reverse the market\u2019s late January retreat in just a few trading sessions this month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/eb99cd5eedf67e83954c998976da3a81/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-49/s500x750/705cf31363591f72784f14fed6029effc84a4228.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/07db71096c88ddf9778d29d0bdb69e60/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-86/s500x750/e6f5479d3cea9759bc52d0c99fff7704947ff575.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdb9b967be268f1fcb154d09dfa8553b/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-2c/s500x750/4f3021be20791991f739de9273300f798a7cbf31.jpg))**\n\n&gt; In the above charts, the market\u2019s strength since October can be seen along with second half of January weakness. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have remained comfortably above their respective 200-day moving averages since October. In January only DJIA actually (and briefly) closed below its even higher 50-day moving average. The market\u2019s rebound surge in February has also reversed negative readings from Stochastic, relative strength and MACD indicators.\n\n&gt; Momentum clearly favors the bulls and January\u2019s negative finish remains unconfirmed as of today. As long as economic data and corporate earnings remain positive then the market is likely to continue the trend that has been in place since last October, higher. There are likely to be some dips along the way with the next possible soft patch arriving when earnings season nears its end later this month and/or in the first half of March.\n\n*****\n\n# Typical February Trading: Tepid Month with Solid Mid-Month Rally\n\n&gt; February has historically been a rather bland month. Since 1950, S&amp;P 500 has averaged a measly 0.1%. Over the last 21-year period S&amp;P 500 average performance has declined to a loss of 0.4% in February. February\u2019s first trading day has historically been good, like today, and trading days eight, nine, ten and eleven have offered repeatable long opportunities. Outside of these five days, the balance of February has been rather lacking.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/10b0e0be07d6824e6a082e13a26bc1d9/e1ddcea381248255-b9/s500x750/a2b1e806df3ec07b5e77c69efd297e5802fa1208.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Does A Lower January Have Bears Smiling?\n\n&gt; Stocks got off to a nice start in 2020, until the late January selloff due to the coronavirus outbreak fears. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell only 0.2% for the month, but it did mark the end to a 4-month win streak. Should bulls worry about what a down January might mean for the rest of 2020?\n\n&gt; There\u2019s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests, \u201cAs goes January, so goes the year.\u201d This was first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac, and it has an impressive track record. Simply put, when the first month of the year was green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa). Given stocks closed red in January, how worried should investors be?\n\n&gt; As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&amp;P 500 has been green in January, the index has been up 11.9% on average over the rest of the year (final 11 months) and higher 86% of the time. However, when that first month was red, stocks rose only 1.2% on average over the final 11 months and were higher less than 60% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/so-goes-january-so-goes-the-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another way to look at this data shows the average full year return based on if stocks are higher in January or not. As you can clearly see, stocks have tended to have trouble gaining any traction over the rest of the year after a January loss, while a green January has been quite strong.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-january-barometer.png?ssl=1)**\n\n&gt; It isn\u2019t all bad news though. Remember the S&amp;P 500 was down only 0.2% in January, so one could argue that it was really flat. \u201cYes, a lower January is a potential worry for the bulls,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut it is worth noting the previous 5 times (and 7 of 8) when stocks were lower in January, those final 11 months rallied. So this might not be the clear cut bearish signal so many think it is.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/a-lower-january-hasnt-been-as-bearish-lately.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Trifecta Spoiled by Coronavirus\n\n&gt; The market decline on the last day of January spoiled what would have been the fourth consecutive January Trifecta. S&amp;P 500 finished January down 0.2% and thus the January Barometer was negative.\n\n&gt; Devised by Yale Hirsch in 1972, the January Barometer has registered ten major errors since 1950 for an 85.7% accuracy ratio. This indicator adheres to propensity that as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year. Of the ten major errors Vietnam affected 1966 and 1968. 1982 saw the start of a major bull market in August. Two January rate cuts and 9/11 affected 2001.The market in January 2003 was held down by the anticipation of military action in Iraq. The second worst bear market since 1900 ended in March of 2009 and Federal Reserve intervention influenced 2010 and 2014. In 2016, DJIA slipped into an official Ned Davis bear market in January. Including the eight flat years yields a .743 batting average.\n\n&gt; This year\u2019s combination of a positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days with a full-month January loss has only occurred eleven times (including this year) since 1950. In the previous ten occurrences S&amp;P 500 was down six times in February with an average loss of 1.5%. However, over the remaining 11 months of the year, S&amp;P 500 advanced 80% of the time with an average gain of 7.4%. Full-year performance was positive 70% of the time, but with an average gain of 2.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6df473ecb7e9c5b9c107222c65f3131a/7be8cdb3803e5a29-77/s500x750/284bbb2175287530e6f02fc233a1772dce7a4852.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 7th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gdnoSkR_Hk))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.9.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kQxYZ5sv6E))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BABA** \n&gt; * **$ROKU** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$NVDA** \n&gt; * **$CVS** \n&gt; * **$CGC** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$UAA** \n&gt; * **$QSR** \n&gt; * **$L** \n&gt; * **$AGN** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$LYFT** \n&gt; * **$TEVA** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$MCY** \n&gt; * **$SAFE** \n&gt; * **$GBDC** \n&gt; * **$GOLD** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$DO** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$D** \n&gt; * **$CYBR**\n&gt; * **$MELI** \n&gt; * **$CHGG** \n&gt; * **$CNA** \n&gt; * **$EXAS** \n&gt; * **$GT** \n&gt; * **$HLT** \n&gt; * **$AYX** \n&gt; * **$AN** \n&gt; * **$APPS** \n&gt; * **$WM** \n&gt; * **$GPN** \n&gt; * **$CRNT** \n&gt; * **$BIP** \n&gt; * **$YETI** \n&gt; * **$MPAA** \n&gt; * **$LSCC** \n&gt; * **$RNG** \n&gt; * **$NMM** \n&gt; * **$JE**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Tvfxbnh.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DYTRi0w.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.11.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sWB49z5.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hiUR1ec.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/w9FUjTz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cPnIcpa.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/BBaSJcZ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tjUpFdY.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/D7eo9EG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Y4rdLiL.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/feUqB85.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TGxgQ96.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.14.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tC78cWW.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. $216.53\n&gt; **Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.
