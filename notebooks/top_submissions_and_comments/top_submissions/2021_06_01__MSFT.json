        "selftext": "People underestimate Blackberry's QNX operating system as a secure RTOS (Real Time Operating System) based off of microkernel architecture. \ud83d\ude80\n\nFor those who don't know how a RTOS microkernel operates let's explain with minor detail. QNX is one of the most adopted embedded OS's in the world installed in defense systems, power plants and municipal grids, robotics, rockets, rail and 120 million vehicles and rising.\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe reason for it's adoption is because of the way a QNX Neutrino RTOS operates compared to what we consider typical everyday operating systems. Most operating systems including IOS, Windows, Linux(Android) and MacOS to name the most apparent run on monolithic designs or hybrid kernels.\ud83d\ude80 \n\nA true microkernel architecture like QNX Neutrino RTOS has full memory protection which is built in meaning that any component can fail and be restarted without corrupting the microkernel or other components in the system. If failure does occur, QNX has the ability to rectify the problem without affecting any other part of the system through process monitoring and recovery components. This feature and ability equals extreme reliability and security and being a microkernel the OS is also modular.\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo what is the big deal your probably asking, Apple, ABC, and Microsoft might enter the space? Not exactly, in fact there has been work in this space from all three companies. Apple opened a facility across from QNX in Kanata and hired the ex creator of the OS Dan Dodge in 2016 to work with Mansfield on the autonomous car project called project Titan. The need for a secure and stable software is where Dodge and his decades of experience from QNX come into play.\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe need for a software system as reliable and secure as QNX should be a big flag to the shear potential of QNX. It is clearly a threat and tough competition for even the biggest software companies. Not only this but project Titan continues to be illusive revealing possible setbacks and interference in trying to compete but also Apple lost several top managers from it's Apple Car project causing a potential setback to the launch revealing some attrition in the project.\ud83d\ude80\n\nQNX version (7.1) is years ahead and analysts predict the next competitor is still 5 years away from anything even remotely close.  QNX hypervisor 2.0 is 61508 SIL 3 certified and\u00a0has been recognized as ISO 26262 ASIL D compliant making it the world's first ASIL D safety-certified commercial hypervisor. \ud83d\ude80\n\nAs other's race to catch up BlackBerry has been filing patents on it's system.\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe QNX Hypervisor utilizes patented and patent-pending technologies that simplifies how elements are shared on the system. Multiple OS's can use 1 display controller to render content onto multiple displays, aka digital instrument cluster and infotainment.\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Value investing, at its core, is essentially buying great businesses at prices lower than their intrinsic value. Combine good analysis of intangibles, and you can make some really good finds. I feel, however, people have chosen to ignore the potential of lower priced, lesser known companies for companies trading well over their intrinsic values. Apple was trading at around 100$ in the early 2000\u2019s, and the fundamentals made sense for a buy back then, but people didn\u2019t buy it until it became mainstream. There are still many companies TILL THIS DAY that have amazing fundamentals, are in up and coming industries, and also have competitors doing decently well. If you can find these companies and hold on to them, then how is value investing dead? Is it easy to find the next Microsoft or Johnson and Johnson? No. It wasn\u2019t easy in 1995, it wasn\u2019t easy in 1965, and it\u2019s not gonna be easy in 2021. But the notion that value investing is some how less effective would mean that fundamentals don\u2019t matter long term. I think that\u2019s a very dangerous narrative to push. If you\u2019re not betting on a companies fundamentals for the long term, then what are you betting on exactly? Somebody to come along pay more for the stock you just bought?",

        "selftext": "Microsoft is developing dedicated streaming hardware that people will be able to hook up to their TVs to use its Netflix\\-like cloud gaming service.\n\nThe company is betting the future of video games will be a subscription-based model where people pay a certain amount of money each month to get access to a plethora of titles.\n\nIts Xbox Game Pass service does exactly that, offering access to a library of games developed both in-house and by third-party studios.\n\nThat\u2019s mostly digital downloads, but last year streaming was added with Microsoft publicly releasing Xbox Cloud Gaming. The feature is sort of like a \u201cNetflix for games,\u201d allowing gamers to play games that are hosted on remote servers and then streamed to users over the internet.\n\nA number of other companies have launched similar game-streaming services, including Google with Stadia and Amazon with Luna.\n\nNow, Microsoft is aiming to push its cloud gaming product to other platforms. It started rolling out Xbox Cloud Gaming to some users via a web browser on iPhones, iPads and PCs in April (Microsoft couldn\u2019t launch a proper mobile app for cloud gaming on Apple devices due to a dispute over App Store policies). And on Thursday, the company announced it wants to expand the service to TVs as well.\n\nOne way it plans to do that is by partnering with manufacturers to add cloud gaming to smart TVs. But Microsoft is also developing streaming devices which users can plug into their TV or computer monitor to stream games from the cloud. The company didn\u2019t elaborate on what those devices could look like, though it\u2019s reminiscent of Amazon\u2019s Fire TV and Google\u2019s Chromecast dongles, both of which now support cloud gaming.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft says it is working with mobile carriers like Telstra in Australia to offer new Xbox subscription models. It\u2019s also expanding cloud gaming to four new countries \u2014 Australia, Brazil, Mexico and Japan \u2014\u00a0 later this year, and aims to publicly launch the browser-based version of the software to all members of its $15-a-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription in the coming weeks.\n\nMicrosoft said it plans to add cloud gaming to its new Xbox Series X console, which launched last November to compete with Sony\u2019s PlayStation 5. In the next few weeks, the company will also upgrade the servers that power its cloud gaming service from its old Xbox One hardware to the Xbox Series X.\n\nMicrosoft competes aggressively with Sony when it comes to gaming. But it\u2019s taking a different strategy to its Japanese counterpart. While Sony is known for blockbuster exclusives that can only be played on a PlayStation console, Microsoft is focusing on embedding its Xbox services onto multiple platforms, including mobile and PC.\n\nMicrosoft has been stepping up its investments in gaming, buying the iconic studio Bethesda for $7.5 billion in its biggest video game-related acquisition yet.\n\nThe company is holding a joint event with Bethesda on Sunday as part of the E3 gaming conference to show off new games, with fans speculating they will reveal some details about a hotly-anticipated sci-fi game called Starfield.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/10/e3-microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-tv.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/10/e3-microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-tv.html)",

        "selftext": " Welcome back to another episode of \"Can Virtual-Pin1025 Predict the Future?\"  \nAfter Friday's action, the conclusion is no, but let's look at the chart and see what's going on.\n\nWhat happened on Friday:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2wmukqxbp371.png?width=1916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01459ffc0e98d47ef446f563fcf853f0fff36af1\n\nThe first real red day in 2 weeks lost support at the $14.50 USD mark but also had reduced volume. Can't win them all. We should consider this pullback extremely healthy and does not interfere with the overall bull trend as we were exceeding the Bollinger bands for 5 straight trading days. Exceeding the Bollinger bands is considered to be a strong indicator of volatility, and I strongly believe we have more volatility to come. I would also assume traders were taking their anywhere from 60%-100% profits off the table.\n\nWe did not bounce back up to the $24-$33 range as I expected on Friday, but again opinions are like assholes. Everyone has one. I believe that range is easily accessible still through this coming trading week.\n\nSigns that make me bearish:  \n\\-1D chart RSI is still quite high but is reaching back into a healthy range.  \n\\-Lower volume Friday. But the overall market was low and red so I'm not too concerned.  \n\\-Gap to be filled on the chart. \\~$11.56-12.30. Usually, gaps do get filled on charts but not always in the short term.  \n\\-Loss of the 14.50 support. On the hourly chart we had a small bounce in that range on Thursday after the massive opening and slightly recovered, a bounce again just after open on Friday but ultimately failed for the rest of the day. This is a volume issue and many taking profits/losses trying to swing trade.  \n\\-Possibility of reaching $12.10, if that fails next stop is probably \\~$11.30\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nvjhe4fybp371.png?width=1811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=817de62d8aedc2eacb1a9bcbbb5e3ac73bf1a80e\n\nThese are the bearish signals that I can find and are important to note but again the overall bull trend still exists on a daily, and when in doubt zoom out is the motto. One bad day does not mean you have a bad life.\n\nSigns that make me bullish:  \n\\-We ended the day inside the top end of the Bollinger bands and they appear to not be contracting yet on the daily chart.  \n\\-20 DMA and 50DMA have just crossed. This is called a golden cross and the 200DMA is now beginning to slope upwards.  \n\\-Large amount of strength in the $13.00 range. If you look back at the hourly chart above where we ended Friday you can see where it is flat in comparison to on Wednesday. This shows strong support in this range and will be a powerful foundation to build a cup and handle formation. This range was also significant in the previous run in January\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qj063yzybp371.png?width=1868&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=703841beac1005b97a1849c19ddc18187fee799f\n\n\\-Still a large following and people interested in $BB this weekend across forums, subreddits, and media. #1 ticker on WSB Thursday and Friday.  \n\\-Largest open interest of stock options is $20 USD.  \n\\-Put/call ratio still relatively low  \n\\-Small short shares available (Squeeze is in the realm of possibilities again)  \n\\-RSI looks healthy on the hourly for a dead cat bounce at open  \n\\-Currently, one of the best plays technically speaking but also fundamentally for the long term (1-2 years+).  \n\\-I have confirmation bias because cybersecurity is a massive growth market. If you didn't hear, JBS is the world's largest supplier of beef, and got hacked might actually cause a shortage of beef in the supermarkets or a large squeeze in beef prices. Go long on beef and cybersecurity.  \n\\-Institutions are still accumulating. Remember, around 48% of BB is owned by institutions and insiders. This is massive. One of the largest companies with large institutional ownership is Microsoft at \\~70% or Facebook with an %80. We aren't that far off with a much much lower share count.\n\nIf the share price goes down significantly tomorrow I'll post another update, only because if the share price goes down with such a small amount of short shares available I believe this will only be tightening the slingshot further that would rocket $BB's share price to the $30s.\n\nThings that we need to continue to look for:  \n\\-High volume  \n\\-Amount of posts and articles about $BB on Reddit, commercial websites, and other forums  \n\\-News or statements from $BB. One piece of news that's significant could be the catalyst to a moonshot.\n\nThis week's price target remains the same as what I wanted on Friday. Anywhere $24-$33USD.\n\nTake care, and stay healthy. Go drink some water, please.",

        "selftext": " France\u2019s competition watchdog has fined Google 220 million euros ($267 million) for abusing its market power in the online advertising industry.\n\nThe French Competition Authority said Monday Google had unfairly sent business to its own services, and discriminated against the competition. Google has agreed to pay the fine and end some of its self-preferencing practices, the watchdog said.\n\nThe investigation found that Google gave preferential treatment to its DFP advertising server, which allows publishers of sites and applications to sell their advertising space, and its SSP AdX listing platform, which organizes auction processes and allows publishers to sell their \u201cimpressions\u201d or advertising inventory to advertisers. Google\u2019s rivals and publishers suffered as a result, the regulator said.\n\nIsabelle de Silva, president of the French Competition Authority, said in a statement that the decision is the first in the world \u201cto look at the complex algorithmic auction processes by which online advertising \u2018display\u2019 operates.\u201d\n\nShe added that the investigation revealed processes by which Google favored itself over its competitors on both advertising servers and supply-side platforms, which are pieces of software used by publishers to manage, sell and optimize ad space\u00a0on their websites and mobile apps.\n\n\u201cThese very serious practices have penalized competition in the emerging online advertising market, and have enabled Google not only to preserve but also to increase its dominant position,\u201d said de Silva.\n\n\u201cThis sanction and these commitments will make it possible to re-establish a level playing field for all actors, and the ability of publishers to make the most of their advertising spaces.\u201d\n\nGoogle announced in a blog on Monday that it will be making a series of changes to its advertising technology.\n\n\u201cWe recognize the role that ad tech plays in supporting access to content and information and we\u2019re committed to working collaboratively with regulators and investing in new products and technologies that give publishers more choice and better results when using our platforms,\u201d wrote Maria Gomri, legal director of Google France.\n\nThe investigation comes after U.S.-based News Corp, French newspaper Le Figaro and the Belgian press group Rossel filed a complaint against Google.\n\nRegulators across Europe are clamping down on the major U.S. tech giants amid concerns that they wield too much power on the bloc\u2019s 700 million plus citizens.\n\nLast week, Facebook was hit by two antitrust probes from regulators in the U.K. and Europe.\n\nThe European Commission has launched probes into\u00a0Amazon, Google and\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0over the last few years, while the U.K.\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority has also launched probes into\u00a0Google\u00a0and\u00a0Apple\u00a0since it\u00a0became an independent regulator in its own right in January\u00a0following Britain\u2019s exit from the EU.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/07/google-fined-by-france-for-abusing-online-advertising-position.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/07/google-fined-by-france-for-abusing-online-advertising-position.html)",

        "selftext": "AMD's latest financial reports blew all estimates out of the water... and their latest guidance for 50% growth (up from 37%) is conservative. Here is why:\n\nFUNDAMENTALS: IT'S ALL ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT\n\nIn a post COVID-19 world, people will continue to flock towards entertainment.\n\nAs  confirmed by both TESLA and AMD recently, the latest Model X and S will  bring AMD silicon (GPU &amp; APU). This is HUGE, because this feature  will eventually trickle down as an optional to the Model 3 and rest of  the Tesla fleet. Why is this important? Just listen to Elon Musk drool  over PS5 performance on road trips with autonomous driving. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl\\_-bFNRJaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_-bFNRJaw)\n\nBut that IS NOT ALL, as Valve will be launching a new portable handheld. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA)\n\nIn essence PS4, PS5, XBOX X &amp; S and Valve are all going FULL AMD.\n\nWho do you think Ford, GM, Chrysler, Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Volkswagen, Renault/Nissan will go with?\n\nENTERTAINMENT IS KEY and AMD is all over it.\n\nThis  is also HUGE as entertainment software will be tailored to AMD's  processing pipeline. Unreal Engine 5 is the perfect example, which  ALREADY performs better on a 6800XT than it does on a RTX3080 (up to 12%  better, as per Digital Foundry's performance benchmark - see screenshot  and video link below).\n\n[AMD 6800XT on left with 61fps - Nvidia RTX3080 on right with 56fps](https://preview.redd.it/eruzko9mwy471.jpg?width=1289&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fcbb478a1bcc940bd8c564b5d6b6ace551aa401)\n\n(digital foundry's benchmarks) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0)\n\nUnreal  Engine 5 (with Lumen) will make Nvidia Ray Tracing a thing of the past.  This software solution is much more efficient at managing illumination,  making it available for non-RTX hardware.\n\nIn  addition, enthusiasts are really pumped with AMD's latest presentation  at Computex, where they presented Fidelity FX SuperResolution. It aims  to provide up to 2x performance while super sampling images up to 4K.  And the kicker is that this solution will be available to ALL.\n\nIntel's  Raja Koduri (Head of Intel GPU, formerly an AMD employee) has already  confirmed they are looking into AMD's Fidelity FX SR (as per his twitter  post days ago): [https://twitter.com/Rajaontheedge/status/1399964541291622407?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Etfw](https://twitter.com/Rajaontheedge/status/1399964541291622407?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nSo yeah, AMD is the future of GAMING.\n\nBut on the stock analysis front, AMD has also begun its climb towards previous highs.\n\nIt has made a huge recovery since my latest post, when it was trading in the low $70's.\n\nJust imagine that AMD is trading at a Price/Earnings multiple of 34, with a market cap of $98.7B\n\nNvidia is trading at a P/E of 84 (over twice as much), with a market cap of $444B (over 4 times more).\n\nBut when you look at the financials, the differences shrink.\n\nOn Revenue, AMD has sales of $9.7B and net profits of $2.5B. Nvidia sold $16.6B for a net $4.3B.\n\nHow does that support Nvidia being over 4 times more expensive than AMD? It just doesn't.\n\nIf AMD were to trade at the same multiples: EPS of 2.38 \\* NVIDIA's P/E of 84.28 = $200 per share.\n\nAt $200 per share, AMD's market cap would be $243B... STLL HALF OF NVIDIA!!!! (WTF?!?!).\n\nThink about it, it is bound to close the distance towards $200 per share in the next 12 months.\n\nThe reasons are simple: Tesla, Valve, Unreal Engine 5, Ryzen 3D stacking and 50% growth for 2021.\n\nThe Xilinx deal WILL CLOSE in the next 6 months. THE BREAKOUT is IMMINENT!!!\n\nTo summarize, the product pipeline is AMAZING, not to mention the leaks on RDNA3 and Ryzen 4.\n\nThe new clientele is incredible: TESLA and Valve, added to Microsoft and Sony.\n\nJust imagine Xilinx FPGA accelerators integrated to AMD's Intellectual Property. Fuel the rockets!!!\n\nREMEMBER: In a matter of months you will be kicking yourself for ignoring this post!\n\nThe MOON is for amateurs.... WE'RE GOING TO MARS BABY!!!... with TESLA AND AMD!!!\n\nMARS - THE RED PLANET... WITH LISA AND ELON. PRIMATES AND APES TO COLONIZE IT IN 2022!!!\n\n..... ALL ABOARD!!!!",

        "selftext": "\n**Basics**\n\nAs long as you haven't been living under a fucking rock for the last decade, you know that AMD is a major player in electronic devices. While it has a minority hold in its markets, it still has a considerable market share AND has a hand in both GPUs and CPUs. It's versatile.\n\nWhile the silicon shortage is still big and doesn't show any signs of slowing, AMD is still most likely making a shitload of profit from the continuous buyouts of graphics cards for mining and the continuous selling of CPUs.\n\n**EPS/Financial history**\n\nAMD has been continuously crushing quarterly earnings targets for at least the past year, and shows no signs of slowing. It has consistently maintained a steady and rising profit.\n\n[Constantly winning](https://preview.redd.it/qz0qs58rh9571.png?width=332&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d615f35e833c3563f23d4de50afe3956f490d61b)\n\nOn top of this, the company has a total cash balance of 3.12 billion and a total debt of only 551 million, which is fucking great.\n\n[It's doing great with managing its debt and total cash to say the least](https://preview.redd.it/vh2sh5xai9571.png?width=422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61451edd2ef36120f80b83aefbfbce123fe2813e)\n\nNot made up your mind yet? If not, I have even more great news for you! The company has been constantly underestimated/undervalued despite all these great numbers. The past 6 months have been shit which isn't to say it's been terrible in the long run which it definitely has not, but for a company that holds so much market in two major component categories at both the business and consumer level it's ridiculous for the stock to be consistently falling.\n\n[Constantly going down](https://preview.redd.it/j2pavto0j9571.png?width=434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26816d6c905488484879bc98f527d8ac15accef9)\n\n**Shorts and shares**\n\nThe company is decently shorted with around 7% of the shares being shorted for a company with a solid background, which could be a disaster waiting to happen. Again, it's not heavily shorted by any means but I don't think 7% is something to scoff at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zk34ou1sl9571.png?width=427&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6215e701d1970588345fb0c063ae217516419a0c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Memeablility**\n\nNow that we've gone over all the boring numbers, let's talk about the memability of the company. It's a fucking computer parts company. Computers=gaming, gaming=memes. It's simple logic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**More general points**\n\nAMD has a solid community reputation, and while the performance its components put out is not on par with that of nvidia and intel, the products are generally more user/consumer friendly and cheaper, plus not everyone is looking to buy an RTX 6090 with liquid shit cooling built in for the unaffordable price of a kidney. AMD is geared more towards the average consumer which makes up a large portion of the computer market. Not only this but AMD chips are appearing more and more in laptops and pre-built computers. Another small point is that Microsoft is using AMD chips in their new generation of Xbox.\n\nAgain, all of this is speculation and I'm not telling anyone what decision to make, this is just my take on it.",

Back then, all it really had was an aeromagnetic survey showing what the company interpreted to be extremely deep sedimentary basin in the countries of Namibia and Botswana. On the basis of this survey, they had the foresight to purchase drilling rights to over 8 million acres of land for very cheap. Last year Recon purchased a drilling rig and shipped it to Namibia to get more detailed stratigraphic data. The company commended drilling the first well in January/February and are currently midway through the second well.\n\nThe preliminary results have been very bullish. I am not a geologist but as I understand it, an active petroleum system needs to have a source rock, a seal, and reservoir, and traps in order to be viable. With the data released in the past two months being even better than expected, it looks like all of those components are present and there is potential for huge amounts of extractable oil. A full suite of results from the core samples in the first two wells is expected to be released soon. In future wells, they plan to target an actual oil trap using the seismic data. By the end of 2021, they hope to be entering discussion with Joint Venture partners.\n\nGeologically speaking, the Kavango basin is similar to the Permian Basin in Texas (which has over 50 billion barrels of oil and is currently producing 5 million barrels of oil per day). However, the Permian acreage is Texas is divided among dozens of companies. The largest of them Diamondback (FANG), Pioneer (PXD), Concho (CXO), and EOG all have market caps in the tens of billions of dollars. In contrast, ReconAfrica has the rights to the entire basin all to themselves. That is what makes it an incredible opportunity in my opinion.\n\nI think the company (currently trading in the $9-$10 range) could be a $100-$200 stock by next year once the exploratory drilling and seismic program is completed and the company enters Joint Venture (JV discussions). Long term, I can see the company being a next oil supermajor. Again, for one company to own the drilling rights to an entire basin like is extremely unique.\n\nAnother bullish tailwind for Reconnaissance is that Western supermajors have been cutting oil exploration expenditure due to environmental pressure from environmentalists and the EIA. However, demand isn\u2019t going to significantly decline for decades and we could be in for a [major oil supply crunch](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Saudi-Arabia-And-Russia-Warn-Of-Major-Oil-Supply-Crunch.html). The company is in the perfect position to capitalize on a good macroeconomic environment for oil and gas\n\n**The bear case:** Some of the biggest risks are\n\n* Extreme opposition from foreign activist groups who want to stop ReconAfrica and Namibia from developing in the Kavango. They\u2019ve spread rumors and misinformation on social media, published hit pieces in newspapers, organized marches, etc. If they are successful at slowing down or stopping ReconAfrica that would obviously be bad for the company. But I don\u2019t believe their criticism is justified. If ReconAfrica is successful, you can bet that it will hugely benefit Namibia and Botswana which in turn will be massively beneficial for the people and wildlife. There will be more money to raise people out of poverty, increase access to healthcare and education, support conservation areas, etc. So far, ReconAfrica and the governments have been committed to protecting wildlife, the livelihoods of local people, following international best standards, and promoting economic development.\n* ReconAfrica has no *proven* reserves yet. We are waiting on more data from additional stratigraphic wells and seismic activities before the company can formally declare it has oil and gas reserves, meaning we still aren\u2019t 100% derisked yet. However, given that we now have two exploration wells with thick marine source rock, carbonates, and a rift basin full of convention traps the play has been significantly derisked.\n* Governmental risk. Of course it is ultimately up to the government and people of Namibia and Botswana to decide how they want to develop their natural resources. However, [Mines and Energy Minister Tom Alweendo](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/03/africa/namibia-oil-exploration-intl-cmd/index.html) and [Kavango East Government Bonifasius Wakudumo](https://www.namibian.com.na/102332/read/Oil-driller-announces-petroleum-system-at-second-well) are both excited and supportive of ReconAfrica\u2019s activities in the Kavango Basin. And just last week, ReconAfrica and NAMCOR (Namibia\u2019s national oil company) [signed a partnership to work together on exploring and developing the Kavango basin](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Press-Release-061421.pdf).\n\n**Disclosure:** I am long RECO with shares I bought in January. Oil exploration is a high risk/high reward game, so don\u2019t take this as financial advise to buy shares.

        "selftext": "I am halfway through an 18 hour shift, currently stationed in Turkey, its hot as fuck, idk why I\u2019m here, I\u2019m 2,000mg deep in caffeine, getting drunk as soon as I get off, getting off as soon as I get off, my wife is back home cheating, my daughter calls another man dad, *cracks knuckles* lets do this. \n\nOverview\n\n\tAMD is a global semiconductor company offering x86 microprocessors as standalone or integrated (CPU\u2019s, GPU\u2019s, server systems, Etc\u2026) and intellectual property/ services.\n\nProducts\n\n\tAMD\u2019s primary products consist of CPU\u2019s and GPU\u2019s which are on par or out performing NVIDIA GPU\u2019s and Intel\u2019s CPU\u2019s. While these other two giants have dominated the market for sometime, AMD\u2019s recent move has evolved from a slow creep to a brisk jog. \n\nCompetition \n\n\tAMD\u2019s largest competitors are Intel (CPU\u2019s) and NVIDIA (GPU\u2019s). With the release of AMD\u2019s Ryzen processors in 2017, AMD has been steadily over taking Intel\u2019s dominance over market share. AMD\u2019s current market share (over all CPU\u2019s) currently sits at 44%, levels it has not seen since 2005. AMD took 20% of the market share in past 2 years with a significant jump in 2019. Since the release of Ryzen, AMD is now on par or out performing Intel chips and has gained a significant amount of sentiment over the soy boys at intel. AMD is on track to overtake the majority of CPU market share within the next year based on current projections.\n\n\tNow NVIDIA is a whole other beast who currently has a significant advantage over the dGPU market. Nvidia at the end of Q4 2020, held roughly 82% of the market share which was a increase of 9% from the previous year. AMD\u2019s high end GPU\u2019s do not come close to Nvidia\u2019s high end models, UNTIL AMD\u2019s Radeon 6000 series, which are now on par with Nvidia\u2019s cards, either outperforming or underperforming in various tests. AMD catching up to Nvidia is the same move that AMD made against Intel in 2017, 4 years later they are on the verge of overtaking market share. While Nvidia is a monster of a company, I believe that AMD will begin taking more market share from Nvidia and establish a decent foothold over the next few years. AMD has already taken the game console market, console plebs.\n\n\tAMD has already proved they are able to take back significant market share with there current and future products, Lisa Su is a genius and I believe she\u2019ll lead the company to Valhalla. What does AMD have that Nvidia does not? Aside from many differences, I think the fact that AMD has an ecosystem will play a significant role in catching up. Now that AMD can evenly compete with both of their rivals, AMD plans on leveraging the fact that they produce CPU\u2019s and GPU\u2019s. There are already incentives to using AMD\u2019s CPU with their GPU rather than an AMD CPU with a Nvidia GPU. With AMD taking the CPU market, retail users will be more likely to stick with the ecosystem, and I\u2019m a big fan of companies producing an ecosystem (laughs in apple). \n\n\tA new player enters the battle. Intel has been working on their own dGPU and will surely be releasing in the next few years, but I believe this will be comparable to Sony vs Microsoft with Nintendo enjoying their best life staring at butterfly\u2019s, covered in drool in the corner lol.\n\nThe Merger\n\n\tNvidia set to acquire ARM, AMD set to acquire Xilinx. What are they and how are they expected to impact the company?\n\nARM - Create and dominate the mobile processor market, covering TV\u2019s, phones, tablets, and other similar products as well as some software applications. I will not be covering much more of ARM in this DD.\n\nXilinx - Designs and develops programmable logic products. As far as I can tell this is some big brain shit that I\u2019m sure some booger nosed, mothers basement living, neck beard having, nerd will easily explain in the comments cuz Wikipedia ain\u2019t cutting it.  \n\n\tIf AMD completes the purchase, which is likely and expected to happen by the end of 2021, Xilinx shares will become worth 1.723 shares of AMD. AMD is currently trading at 86.10$, meaning that shares of Xilinx will be worth 148.35$ if the deal were to go through right now. Xilinx is currently worth 133.71$, I\u2019m betting heavily that AMD will continue to pump prior to this deal as well.\n\n\tARM will be huge for Nvidia, but this is running into some major road blocks and is likely some ways off or will fall through.\n\nFinancials and projections (I had pictures but I\u2019m reddit dumb)\n\nNet Revenue\n$9.8B(2020), $6.7B(2019), $6.5B(2018), $5.2B(2017)\nNet Incum \n$2.5B(2020), $341M(2019), $337M(2018), $(33)M(2017)\n\t\n\tI like your growth G\n\n\tAMD decreased their debt to 338 million from 568 million.\n\t\n\t$1.6 billion in cash ($9 billion in total assets, I find cash on hand more important)\n\n\tGPU/CPU sales accounted for $6.5 billion while enterprise accounted for $3.3 billion, GPU/CPU sales saw a 37% increase over 2019 while enterprise saw a 65% increase in 2020. 2021 is set to continue this trend of growth.\n\n\tAMD has a high price target of $169.70, median $107.00, and an average of $103.92. I just read 100\u2019s of pages of 8k\u2019s and 10\u2019ks, plus I\u2019m super attracted to the ole doc Su Bae so I\u2019m betting that it will get a target price upgrade, regardless $103 will make me rich. There is a lot more we could dive into on financials but idk what the fuck I\u2019m doing so nah.\n\nRisks\n\n\tI like to plan for more than 1 risk occurring at a time so keep that in mind. Ive highlighted the risks that I find most impactful/ probable. Also keep in mind of global shortages for damn near every company, especially with chips.\n\n\t- Intel/ Nvidia\u2019s market share dominance (mostly Nvidia)\n\t- Seasonal sales can make for shit earnings in Q1/Q2\n\t- Reliance on third parties for manufacturing/ distributors\n\t- Xilinx deal falls through\n\t- Jim Cramer also likes this stock\n\n\tThat\u2019s enough risks, what am I, a gay bear?\n\nTLDR\n\nAMD will moon, Lisa Su is my mommy and is cooking up some tendies, AMD GPU\u2019s are now in Teslas,  obligatory rockets (insert rocket emojis here), lots of words just buy it.\n\nPOS\n150 shares @ 78.50\nJan22 $100/$105C\nLooking for entry into Xilinx cuz I dumb",

        "selftext": "Okie dokie. So here goes. This past year has been insanity, and I think it has caused quite a bit of disillusionment and will also be detrimental to many bank accounts as we move increasingly closer to higher inflation and a rising rate environment. Hear me out.\n\nSo, some context, following my trading style, I was all over GME in late August when Cohen released his 13D; GME was already on my radar because of Burry, who's investing/trading style I try to mimic. DFV/Raging Kitty, Rod, and others were also a big inspiration in spreading good, solid DD. It was a true deep value play. When GME released its Q2 2020 results on September 8th, it was terrifying, because we dropped almost back below $6; however, one thing shined through, and that was the almost $1 billion in free cash flow (fcf). The big push after that ER drop of course was the Microsoft partnership. That showed exactly how committed the console vendors were to keeping GME in business - making a console is actually not profitable, its the sales after the console, and GME is a huge part in reducing Customer Acquisition Costs for console vendors. Of course the SI was always the big thing - 140%, but it wasn't what made many of us have \"diamond hands\", it was the business, and its crucial role in the gaming industry - hell, what made Burry go deep in GME? When he got confirmation that the new console cycle would include disc drives. Anyways, my whole point is this - what made GME, GME, was its deep value, that it was, in the infamous words of Burry - \"A long term franchise trading at a significant discount from growing intrinsic value.\" Which, always, is the preference when you are looking for the best possible trade to execute.\n\nSo what does this have to do with ViacomCBS - VIAC? Well, it is precisely that, it is a long term franchise trading at a significant discount from growing intrinsic value. How so? Ok, first, the basic test is this: what is its margin of safety based on discounted cash flow analysis (dcf); what is its enterprise value divided by earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization (ev/ebitda); and what is its price/free cash flow. This basic first pass test shows VIAC has: 49% margin of safety, 8.0 ev/ebitda, and 7.8 price to free cash flow. These are all really, really good for what is a long term franchise; and they have over $3 billion in fcf, a big fat number. Yes, debt is $19 billion, but they have total assets of $54 billion. Oh yeah, p/e is 9.8, which is not, in my opinion, the best metric for value, but its pretty damn good.\n\nOk, so they pass the basic deep value screener. But the real clincher is this. They aren't just \"value\" but are also showing GROWTH. Burry pounds this home, and he learned it from Graham &amp; Dodd and Buffet. You don't look for just \"value\" or \"growth\", you find BOTH. So how is VIAC doing this? Well, look at how aggressive management is with their streaming strategy, which they are being extremely aggressive. First, we know they released Paramount+ in March, rebranding CBS All Access. Was it good, no. It was shit. However, they made it clear they are, and did, improve it. They recently dropped 1,000 movies, will drop a new movie every week starting in 2022, and, importantly, they will CEASE to license their content to third party streamers. No more movies/shows going to Netflix/Amazon. Besides CBS and Paramount Studios, VIAC owns Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, MTV, CMT, VH1, and several other networks that have hugely popular series. When they get all of that content exclusive to Paramount+, woah. For instance, look at Disney+, it took them about a year to get all the Marvel and Star Wars movies all centralized on Disney+, and when they did, subs went through the roof. Better believe ViacomCBS will get ALL their HUGE number of big movies and shows streaming exclusively to Paramount+. This is a big deal. Of course VIAC owns Showtime (doesn't hurt to mention they had the huge Mayweather PPV event this quarter) and between Paramount+, Showtime and BET+, they have 36 million monthly active users (MAUs). I think we will also see a bundle of Paramount+ and Showtime, and they just released an extremely cheap and competitive limited ad service for Paramount+ for $4.99. They are also being extremely aggressive with international markets - you know, the other billions and billions outside the United States.\n\nThen there is Pluto TV, their AVOD (ad video on demand, Paramount+ is an SVOD, subscription on demand) free TV streaming service, literally free, and excellent, check it out if you haven't. They paid $300 million for it back in 2019; it now has over 55 million global monthly active users (MAUs) and rising. AVODs are the future, and it is projected Pluto will bring in ONE BILLION in ad rev by 2022. That is huge. Also, over the top (OTT) advertising is the future, and ViacomCBS owns the best OTT technology. OTT is basically this, based on your browsing history, connected devices, they will target you with ads that might be of interest to you, not simply the ads that everyone sees. This is the way all advertising will go, and VIAC is leading the way with one of the biggest free AVOD services, Pluto TV. Finally, Pluto TV is a \"super funnel\" to Paramount+. Everyone in the streaming business will tell you, the gold standard is to have a strong AVOD and SVOD, and that is what VIAC has.\n\nThen of course there is Paramount Studios. They just had the highest grossing movie of the pandemic, A Quiet Place II. But even more important, the studio is fully reopened and in full production. Huge. Then of course CBS. Sure, older viewing audience, but don't balk at that. They have 6 of the top 10 shows in primetime TV. That is HUGE ad revenue. Also this quarter they had March Madness Finals, Masters, and the PGA Tour Finals that Mickelson won. Then they have the NFL, Champions League, and so much more in terms of sports, as well as the number one news network. All that can be streamed live on Paramount+. That is just more growth, more revenue, and advantages other streaming services don't have.\n\nThe real important point is this however: VIAC is the second largest content creator in the world, second only behind Disney. That is right, the second largest producer of shows, movies, and sports. In fact, that is all they do. They aren't a cable or phone company, they don't run an amusement park. They just make content, and content is KING in the streaming business, which is where we are all moving towards. They are the only major content producer that is vertically integrated that is left standing - i am not going to talk about merger and acquisition rumors, but Shari Redstone is more amenable to selling than we all think - and it makes VIAC incredibly valuable, incredibly valuable: VERTICALLY INTEGRATED. That means they don't just produce content, but they can distribute it via their own networks. MGM, bought by Amazon recently, was not vertically integrated. Now, when you look at their market cap, $26 billion, relative to all the content they own and their networks to distribute that content, they are INSANELY undervalued. Bottom line, this is a rare event, like GME was.\n\nIf you're getting concerned about what is happening in this market, what has happened over the last year, and get a feeling the \"party\" is about to end. Look even more into VIAC. I'm not going to pander and say I am a retarded autistic ape who eats crayons. However I do eat a shitload of chicken tenders.",

        "selftext": "AMD is up 3% this morning because of this deal. Does this allow the stock to retrace all time highs or are chip shortages and a high multiple still a concern?  I own $90 LEAPS for next year and while they are currently in the red, I'm still bullish on the company.\n\n&gt;June 17 (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Cloud on Thursday said Google will offer cloud computing services based on AMD's newest data center chip, a move likely to intensify AMD's push to grab market share from rival Intel Corp (INTC.O).\n\n&gt;Cloud computing providers such as Google, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) are some of the biggest buyers of data center chips. They build services on top of the chips to rent the computing power out to millions of customers.\n\n&gt;Google said on Thursday it will start offering services based on AMD's \"Milan\" server chip, which AMD released in March. Google said customers such as Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) are testing the new AMD-based services.\n\n&gt;AMD has been gaining market share against Intel, which was long the dominant player in data center chips but whose offerings have inferior performance on some measures because of years of stumbles in Intel's manufacturing operations.\n\n&gt;Intel in April announced its \"Ice Lake\" chip competitor to AMD's \"Milan\" chip and said all major cloud providers would support it, but Intel has not said when Google will start offering services based on its latest chip.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/googles-cloud-taps-amd-new-service-chip-wars-heat-up-2021-06-17/",

        "selftext": "I got my dividend from MSFT yesterday!  Time for a night on the town!  1 share of MSFT yielded 56 whole cents.  So for $257 invested you get 56 cents every 3 months...  What is the point?  Id rather then keep it and invest it back into the company.  It's such a negligible amount.  \n\nYet I continually hear Cramer say \"and it's a dividend stock\" like it's a plus.  MSFT moves .56 in 5 min most days.  So many \"investor\" gurus talk about dividend reinvestment.  Even if I held say 500 shares, it's still only $280 on an investment of $125,000?  \n\nI know it's a growth company.  That's why people invest in it, but my question remains... Why does the company even bother?  And why do people act like it's a great thing?  (3% +, I totally get it)",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m 25, and recently I\u2019ve been giving a lot of thought to just how many amazing opportunities on the stock market I\u2019ve missed over the years. The once-in-a-lifetime bull run of mid to late 2020 and early 2021, much earlier thoughts of investing in Apple back in 2010/2011, the fact I\u2019ve been interested in Tesla and SpaceX and basically anything Elon Musk does since its inception yet somehow never gave any thought to buying TSLA stock early. All missed, and I have to admit it\u2019s grating on me a little bit.\n\nI\u2019ve also heard a lot of talk that the stock market is probably going to be pretty stagnant overall over the next decade, so even if I decided it was a wise idea to park most of my money in a couple of relatively S&amp;P500 ETFs and leave it it probably won\u2019t make anything. Not that I\u2019m satisfied with 5% annual return anyway, because I\u2019m not. Not that I want to be a complete gambler either, but I\u2019d rather take moderate risks for moderately higher returns than end up being too old to get the good of any small fortune I make from low-risk long-term investing. Say what you like about the folks at WSB but there\u2019s no doubt a significant amount of folks there have made a lot of money, at times very quickly, albeit with a lot of risk.\n\nThe more I think about it the more I think what I\u2019m really looking for is not the next Apple or Tesla, but the next Steve Jobs or Elon Musk. Even back in 2012 it was obvious to me that SpaceX and Tesla were going to do well, and it was obvious to everyone that Apple was already doing well, and that it would continue to do so. Today however I see no such companies. I see smaller stocks that I like the look of, being in industries I think MIGHT be big in the future and that I think are very important (nuclear thorium, battery recycling etc.), but without a powerful CEO like Musk or Branson or Gates I can\u2019t see them getting the name recognition or making the 10x, 50x, 100x or 500x returns that early investors in companies like Apple or Tesla or Microsoft have so far realised. The companies I can see doing well in the future seem to be the ones that are already too big to make any sort of meaningful return in the short to medium term (i.e the next 10-15 years). There\u2019s also the crypto market I suppose but that seems to be a place where if you didn\u2019t get in before you hear the news then you are too late.\n\nAnyone else like this? If so, how did you get over it?\n\nEDIT: oh my, my first award on Reddit. Thanks! \ud83d\ude00",

        "selftext": "Cost per contract:\n$23.40\n\nStock price at time of purchase:\n$127.15\n\nWhy:\nApple has remained flat for most of the past year. It first reached its current price in August 2020. Since then, much new hardware and software has been released, and the stock market has not yet responded favorably. \n\nBased on the latest swaths of advances unveiled at WWDC, I believe that this trend will end soon. Companies that take advantage of users\u2019 trust will look less appealing to investors. I expect that people who sold AAPL last year and earned profits elsewhere in tech like GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, and FB will begin investing back into Apple. The outcomes of anti-trust trials and other lawsuits are unlikely to affect Apple severely in the next two years. However, investors might fear that competitors will become less profitable. All of this, along with the consumer privacy awakening, stable quarterly revenue, growth of services like fitness+ and tv+, rumors of revolutionary products (and their anticipated future announcements), plus philanthropic investments in property (Bay Area housing), will make Apple look like a smart investing opportunity for the next 5 years.\n\nWhile some people may be bearish on this stock, it\u2019s important to remember we are only months away from an iOS 15 release, macOS Monterrey release, and the traditional September hardware release.\n\nExit strategy:\n- Sell or exercise 10 contracts at $53.45. Then exercise the remainder in two years.\n- Sell all immediately if at any point the value of contract decreases to $17.55.\n\nProof: https://imgur.com/gallery/CqarM1R",

        "selftext": "Alright, I am going to show you guys a company that is deeply undervalued by the metrics of Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffet to make you a gangbuster return. I know right, that is SO DIFFERENT than like 97% of the companies that get hawked here. You see, unlike the money losing companies that get hawked here with the expectation that they will lose slightly LESS money next year (or, even better, the ones that just lose even more money as the years go on), this one not only makes a shit ton of cash but will make a METRIC fuck ton of cash next year and EVEN MORE the year after. Golly, that would be a sight, am I right?\n\nSo, what is this magical stock called? Well, say it with me, it is Century Communities Stock (CCS). What does it do? It is a homebuilder (The 9th largest one across 17 states). One that was (gasp) profitable in 2008 (18 years of consecutive profit)!\n\nThey operate through two home building segments. The first is called **Century Communities** which is their \u201cflagship brand, offering everything from single-family floor plans to condos and townhomes. Enjoy the freedom to build and personalize your new home from the ground up or find the perfect quick move-in listing.\u201d These homes are 1) To-be-built and quick move in homes, have2) full smart home packaging, and 3) can be reserved online. The second offering is **Century Complete** which are affordable and streamlined homes that Century makes that offer built in savings through a groundbreaking online purchase process and a versatile selection of quick move-in homes. This segment offers quick move-in homes, starter smart home packaging, and the ability to buy them online. They also do home loan, title insurance, and home insurance.\n\nLet us do a highlight reel before we get into the nitty gritty. They have delivered 10,386 new homes for the last twelve months through quarter 1 of 2021, and 80 percent of their deliveries are to entry level buyers (the largest segment of purchasers). Those home deliveries helped them notch 3.6B in total revenues for LTM 1Q 2021.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Valuation Metrics for CCS for Q1 2021**\n\nCentury Communities reached a net homebuilding debt to net capital of 19.9% from 52% in 2018. Their homebuilding debt to LTM EBITDA is 2.0X.\n\nTheir Book Value per share is 40.74, and tangible book value per share is 39.83. Yes, you see how they do not have much of that squishy \u201cgoodwill\u201d or \u201cintangibles.\u201d This stock is a straight shooter. That entails a 1.52 Price to Book Ratio, and a 1.55 Tangible Price to Book ratio.\n\nThe trailing P/E ratio for this company is a stunning 7.54 P/E ratio with a dividend yield of .95% (60 cents a year). Fully year EPS for 2021 on an average basis is 11.64, and 12.72 for 2022. **That means a Forward P/E ratio of 5.32 for 2021, and 4.875 for 2022.**\n\nTheir price to sales ratio is .47.\n\nAnalysts have an average price target of 92.\n\nIt is a steal, and I am going to explain further down why I believe analysts are wrong, and it is even more of a steal than they say. But before I do that, I am going to compare this stock to its peers.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Comparison to Other Homebuilder Stocks**\n\nLennar has a P/E Ratio of 9.10 (After recently reporting its Q2 Earnings on Wednesday), a 2022 Forward P/E ratio of 7.41, and a 2023 forward P/E ratio of 7.23.\n\nToll Brothers has a P/E Ratio of 13.38, a 2022 Forward P/E Ratio of 6.70, and a 2023 Forward P/E ratio of 6.91.\n\nBut Hani, the market cap of these companies is much bigger! Fine, fine, let\u2019s look at home builders with a market cap similar to CCS then!\n\nMeritage Homes has a P/E ratio of 7.54, a 2022 forward p/e of 5.46, and a forward 2023 p/e ratio of 6.62.\n\nThe only home builder that comes close is M/I homes but it has a future P/E that lower than that of CCS, and it is in slightly less markets. Still, it is a strong buy as well.\n\nI cannot be bothered to compare every homebuilder stock but suffice to say it is better than KB homes, NVR, D.R. Horton, Tri Pointe Homes, and PulteGroup. In short, it\u2019s undervalued in a sector that is being undervalued by the markets. The only stock that comes close, or slightly edges it out is M/I Homes (which doesn\u2019t offer a dividend).\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Lennar\u2019s Earnings to shed light on the earnings of CCS.**\n\nOn Wednesday Lennar destroyed earnings with adjusted quarterly earnings of 2.95 per share. Stripping out items, it reported earnings of 2.65, which handily surpassed analyst estimates of 2.38 per share.\n\nThey also beat on revenues and issued an update to its homebuilding outlook for the third quarter and is now anticipating new orders in the rage of 16,000-16,300 units and \u201cdeliveries between 15,800 and 16,100 units for the new quarter.\u201d\n\nThe Macro Commodity Outlook &amp; Home Price Appreciation FY 2022\n\nTimber prices have made homes about 30,000-35,000 more expensive to build, but ever since they peaked on May 7th, at 1670 a unit they have gone down, and they have gone down fast. It closed on Friday at 904, and analysts believe it will continue to go down to roughly around 600. There are some analysts, however, that believe it could go as low as 500 to 550 and I share that sentiment. That is because DIY builders have largely stopped buying timber with the great opening, home builders are not going balls to the walls with their home building, and because sawmill operators are increasing capacity.\n\nBuilding construction accounts for nearly half of all copper use (and residential is roughly 2/3rds of building construction), and with China having announced it is releasing its metals reserve and trying to tamp it down copper has been coming off its highs faster than usual. Interestingly Copper also peaked on May 7th at 4.75, and it is most recent close was at 4.14.\n\nAluminum is used as an insulation layer of building roods, for windowpanes, etcetera. It peaked on May 7th as well and is now sitting roughly at 2384. I believe it will continue to decrease, due to China\u2019s attempts to moderate the prices by releasing its reserves, as well as due to eventual balking by customers at the prices.\n\nMeanwhile, home prices will increase in 2022. Freddie Mac predicts that home prices will rise by 4.4% in 2022. In 2021, \u201cHigher building costs, longer delivery times, and general unpredictability in the construction supply chain are now having measurable impacts on new home prices. The median sales price of new houses sold in April 2021 was $372,400, 20% higher than a year ago. The average sales price was $435,400. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of April was 316,000. This represents a supply of 4.4 months at the current sales rate.\u201d What am I getting at here? Well, there are currently bidding wars, and Lennar\u2019s earnings calls will reinforce that. Homebuilders are passing off the cost, and the consumers are taking the increased cost. What is more, homebuilders are INCREASING their margin.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**HUGE undersupply of homes, and a huge ongoing need for new homes**\n\nFreddie/Fannie have predicted that there is a 3.8 MILLION undersupply of homes, and home builders will need to build 1.2M homes a year just to keep up with year-on-year demand. When I say 1.2M homes, that does not actually chip at the backlog. To cut into the inventory shortage of 3.8M they will need to build more than 1.2M homes a year.\n\nBut homebuilders are being cautious, and so it will take 8 to ten years to fill demand unless they ramp up significantly. Currently Housing Starts are only 1.572M units on a seasonally adjusted basis. Furthermore, permits for future homebuilding fell 3.0% to a rate of 1.681M units in May.\n\nLet me be clear then, that this is not a cyclical play, but a circumstance of over a decade of concentrated underbuilding by home builders that is now leading to a golden age for them in the coming years.\n\nWhat does this all mean for when CCS reports earnings in Q2 and for Q3 and Beyond (August)\n\nI am going to throw some quotes from Lennar\u2019s earnings, and you can spot the goodies. READ IT ALL, but I will bold some things:\n\n**Jon Jaffe Co-Chief Executive Officer:** \u201cQ4 of 2020 is when we saw the first significant increase in lumber costs, which impacted primarily our Q2 deliveries. **The lumber increases, which occurred in Q1 and Q2, will mostly flow through our deliveries in the second half of the year. But as we noted and Diane will cover more detail, we believe that Lennar's pricing power will more than offset this and we expect to deliver stronger gross margins. Looking forward, we expect to see some limited relief on our lumber costs for our July starts as more expensive lumber works its way through the system. And if the current downward trend holds, we'll see a more significant benefit for August starts.\u201d**\n\n**Diane Bessette CFO:**  And now, let me provide some high-level guidance for the fiscal year. We still expect, as we mentioned, our deliveries to be between 62,000 and 64,000 homes\\*\\*, but with a now higher gross margin guidance of 26.5% to 27% for the year and an even more efficient operating platform with SG&amp;A guidance of 7.3% to 7.5% for the year.\\*\\*\n\nSo, as you can see, this is fantastic news. The reporting period for Q2 for CCS ends on June 30th, which means I expect them to revise guidance upward for Q3-EOY in terms of margin because that is when the housing starts will start to fully benefit from decreased lumber prices (As well as other commodity prices). Furthermore, consumers are taking the price increases on the chin and allowing margin to expand as you can see in Lennar earning call as well as government data, and this is going to be seen as soon as this upcoming quarter as you can see by Lennar's earnings beat. I expect earnings to be at least 3 EPS, and maybe even more, beating the analyst consensus of 2.73. I expect FY EPS in 2021 of at least 12 dollars in earnings per share which beats the analyst consensus.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**The Anti-Inflation Play**\n\nThe rise in housing prices accounted for over a quarter of the overall increase in inflation in May ([An inflation storm is coming for the U.S. housing market | Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20210619290/an-inflation-storm-is-coming-for-the-us-housing-market)). Guess, who that benefits. That is right, this stock.\n\nFurthermore, purchasing a home is the quintessential anti-inflation play because the mortgage stays the same over 30 years while rents increase to match inflation. Furthermore, your home appreciates roughly at the same rate as inflation when you are a home buyer. So, to beat inflation\u2026 People buy homes.\n\nFinally, building costs are decreasing with commodity prices going lower, but margins are expanding. HMMM!!!!!\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Debt**\n\nCCS was upgraded to B1 by Moody\u2019s on Feb 22, 2021, and put their outlook at positive. This is one step below investment grade.\n\nThey have no debt on their revolving line of credits, but they have two senior notes. 495M worth of notes due May 2027 u/6.,75%, and 397M worth of Senior Notes due July 2025 u/5.875%.\n\nThe 6.75% Notes means annual interest payments of 33.412M, while the 5.875% senior notes give an annual interest payment of 23.324M. This equates to roughly 56.74M in interest expenses. If they got rid of the debt, they would add an additional 1.68 to their EPS in the full year by removing that interest expense.\n\nAlternatively, they can get upgraded to investment grade by EOY and then choose to refinance for better rates and save on interest expense. After all, their set to almost reduce their net homebuilding debt to net capital to 0 by the end of this year (and that is if they only meet and do not surpass analyst expectations. I believe it\u2019s only a matter of time before they are upgraded to investment grade debt due to the strong financials here.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Russel Inclusion**\n\nOn May 8 of 2020 was the Russel Ranking Day for reconstitution. The stock was 23.87$ at that time (clawing its way back from the doldrums of the pandemic lows). The Russel Ranking Day for 2021 was May 7th. The price then was 79.84. That is a 334.4% increase in the share price. The market cap, therefore, would have been 3.46B on ranking day. It will remain in the Russel 2000, with a much larger weighting as the higher on the list you are the higher your weighting is.\n\nSince then, however, it\u2019s decreased roughly 28 percent to 62.01, which means that the weighting will have an outsize impact on the share price on the reconstitution date.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInstitutional Ownership and Insider Ownership\n\nInstitutional ownership is 89.54%. Insiders own 11.9% of the company as well. This is pretty fucking bullish.\n\n[CCS 62.90 0.19 0.30% : Century Communities, Inc. - Yahoo Finance and 34 more pages - Personal - Microsoft\u200b Edge (gyazo.com)](https://gyazo.com/aab400b34e4e2ae0b20989105905915d)\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**In conclusion**\n\nI have 220.57 Shares worth of CCS and 7 September 17 Calls for 65 dollars that I averaged down to 7.66 a pop. I intend to open a further, significant, amount on Monday provided there is not an explosion in the stock price as this is severely undervalued. Additionally, I think I\u2019m going to open a smaller parallel position in M/I Homes. Price target by analysts is 92 dollars for CCS. The great homebuildergeddon of June 8-11 (Save for Lennar which boomed the day of earnings and the day after when JPMorgan initiated a price target with 50% upside), happened for literally no reason. It was just a sector bloodbath and CCS was hit the hardest of them all by far. Be aware that the bid asks for options is quite different, though not as illiquid as CNNE (My poor CNNE calls are getting slaughtered, but I have till August). This company is super undervalued and doesn\u2019t deserve to be where it is.\n\nThis isn't a fucking pump and dump, don't make it one, because it doesn't deserve to be tarred by that association. This is a deep value play. I would have mentioned the 10% buyback authorization they have, but i don't care to because their focused on increasing earnings and making money hand over fist. Also, they should probably focus on removing all their debt notes, before doing share buybacks because it gives a better ROI.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n/u/fannypackphantom between my UWMC DD in March: [Enough with the techno mumbo jumbo A Fundamentalist Analysis of UWMC - Why I'm doubling Down : wallstreetbets (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9frpz/enough_with_the_techno_mumbo_jumbo_a/), and this one I expect a nice flair if this pans out please and thank you.

        "selftext": "#$ASTS \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Listen up dipshits and sell the lumber from your grandmas porch to get some free cash.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#ASTS is a satellite company which allows 5G internet/cell phone connectivity anywhere in the world **through your existing cell phone**. In short, ASTS represents an attractive asymmetric bet in the following ways:\n\n* [**Space Launch Market Competition:** It seems every week there is a new article about how cheap launches are becoming due to increased competition. SpaceX, Blue Origin, \\(among others\\) have brought space into the mainstream and are allowing for repeatable launches. Billionaires are throwing away cash just to win some twitter space race. The question here is; who actually stands to gain from cheaper launches? The International Space Stations 10 Astronauts trying to satisfy their coke addiction and a satellite company like ASTS.](https://i.imgur.com/8QqoIDQ.jpeg) \n\n\n* **Customer Acquisition:** ASTS works with existing telecom providers and does not need to acquire customers, pay for marketing, or gain approval for spectrum usage. By signing with existing telcos, all ASTS needs to do is launch a (patent protected) satellite and collect a check.\n\n* **5G Fund:** $9 Billion in government funds are in play for rural 5G expansion. AT&amp;T is working with ASTS to gain access to this money. Microsoft believes ~157m Americans do not have access to broadband internet. ASTS solves this.\n\n* **Sold off:** ASTS has been wrapped up in a space market correction without participants understanding the value this company adds. At current levels \u201cyou\u201d are buying in below investors like Vodafone and Rakuten who have all vetted this company and have a vested interest in the company's success. American Tower is invested and is essentially hedging their business against the success of ASTS removing the need for Cell Phone towers. *Take a second to look at their chart (and thereby the proliferation of cell towers) and think of Satellites replacing their entire business structure.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**What makes ASTS Different:**\n\n[A comparison chart.](https://i.imgur.com/3jzbOoB.png)\n\n[Something with less words for the High Schoolers who forgot their Ritalin today.](https://i.imgur.com/01RnI87.png)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIridium currently sits at a $5B market cap and allows for cell phone calls to be completed via satellite. This company serves maritime and oversees applications, charges customers by the minute (think cell phones circa 1999 or Roblucks(?) if you're the same high schooler) and requires a separate bulky headset. This is the difference maker for $ASTS, anyones existing smart phone can connect to their satellite as they rely on a larger high powered satellite vs IRDM which has a smaller satellite and relies on the headset to make up the difference. This same principle can be transferred to Starlink which has smaller satellite arrays and relies on a dish to connect.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe average AST SpaceMobile satellite signal is powerful enough to penetrate two walls inside a building, the fuselage of an airplane, or the interior of a car or train. No direct line of sight is needed and the service is similar to that provided by a tower two to five kilometers away from a handset. The satellite architecture is completely different from that used in other systems. With each satellite providing coverage to a large area approximately 2,800km in diameter, a much smaller number of satellites are required to achieve global coverage compared to other systems and the constellation will be capable of supporting 5G speeds as defined by the FCC.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAST SpaceMobile recently participated in the public comment period regarding the 5G Fund for Rural America. In October, the FCC formally moved to allow mobile-satellite providers that meet specified performance standards and other requirements to apply to participate with its partners in the 5G Fund auction as a 5G broadband provider. The 5G Fund will distribute up to $9 billion for 5G wireless broadband connectivity in rural America to close the digital divide.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe first phase deployment of 20 satellites is expected in the second half of 2022 with coverage to 49 equatorial countries in 2023. ASTS plans to achieve full global mobile coverage with 110 satellites by the end of 2023 or early in 2024 with a total of 168 satellites by the end of 2024. Commercial service expected to be offered beginning in 2023 across 49 equatorial countries.\nIf ASTS proves to be successful IRDM would be an easy short ala long GOOG short YHOO.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**What moat exists:**\n\n\n\n[With 836 patent claims and growing](https://i.imgur.com/iTXb4VW.png), the company believes it has a five to seven-year first-mover advantage over competitors. A steep barrier to entry exists in the satellite space which these patents protect. ASTS CEO Abel Avellan has proven another satellite company Emerging Markets Communications which sold to Global Eagle for $550m. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nCustomers have already been established with ASTS. SpaceMobile service will be initially offered to 1.3 billion users. Vodafone has a 50/50 revenue share agreement covering its markets. Millicom, LiLAC, TEF, AT&amp;T (including Mexico) and TEO, among others, already have a memorandum of understanding with ASTS. All of these companies have done their own DD on the technology and have signed off on it. This isn\u2019t a question of if it will work, but when. AT&amp;T has signed on for the exclusive rights in the US. They think of this as a potential difference maker in carrier choice going forward *(think iPhone exclusivity that existed previously).*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n**What need is there:**\n\nManagement estimates that 90% of the planet's surface isn't reached by wireless networks. About 5.2 billion people move in and out of coverage as terrestrial towers frequently fail to reach distant areas. There are 3.3 billion people without wireless data connectivity and another 0.7 billion with no cellular coverage whatsoever.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn middle America broadband speeds are lacking as is cellular connectivity. This is why the government is looking to make advances in 5G quickly. Microsoft believes ~157m Americans do not have access to broadband internet.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Addressable Market and Costs:**\n\nCost of the service estimates for final users living in emerging markets could be as low as $2.06/month. Currently, carriers spend 80% of their capex serving 20% of their traffic in remote areas. ASTS could significantly reduce the amount of capex needed to serve unconnected areas.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe development efforts to date and the equatorial project should cost $510M and the global constellation a further $1.3B of additional capex. ASTS projects to generate revenues in 2023 and become cash flow positive by 2024.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith as little as 9 million users in emerging markets SpaceMobile expects to generate $181M in revenues and $130M in EBITDA by 2023E. Once phases 2 and 3 are completed, revenues and EBITDA would shoot up to $1.07B and $1.0B in 2024. At this point the company would generate enough cash flow to pay for its future expansion.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**This doesn't fit anywhere:**\n\nThe Barclays Managing Director who did the due diligence for ASTS merge, Scott Wisniewski, left his job to joins ASTS as their Chief Strategy Officer. This mans job was doing DD on space companies and he left for $ASTS options.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Potential Catalysts:**\n\nResearch Coverage Initiated: As of now no price targets have been set for ASTS. Research coverage being initiated could result in a positive reaction for the stock. This was what set SPCE on a run (which this sub participated in) in January 2020.\n\n\nBlue Walker 3: As of now the proof of concept launch used a satellite on the ground connecting to a phone in space. Q4 of this year will be the launch of their test satellite. A successful launch and test would mean the business will be able to go through Phase 1 and become cash flow positive. Someone much smarter than me will tell you what that is worth in terms of stock price. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL:DR** Max Bid ASTS Walk Away. Space internet on a toilet anywhere in the world.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[POSITIONS DISCLOSURE](https://i.imgur.com/2kLto8V.png)",

I have come across this quote \"diversification is for idiots\" from Mark Cuban, and I know Warren Buffett has said in the past that intelligent investors don't need a diversified portfolio. Now I've also come across advice advocating for diversification, and in the past have found myself investing in companies for the sake of diversification and not necessarily my belief in the company.

As said before, mainly financial and tech stocks fit my standard for this, and I see it as unwise to invest in other companies purely for the sake of diversification. I'd rather invest in a few companies that I truly believe in. It's riskier, I know, but such risk is mitigated by my standard for the stock. Obviously I do not have much experience investing, so I cannot for sure know that this method is better (at the end of the year I plan to benchmark my returns against a total market etf like VTI to evaluate the method).

        "selftext": "Where tf are all my NOK bag holders now?\nWhere are the ones that doubted it would break $5? Sitting somewhere kicking themselves if they had paper hands, and in the green if they averaged down like bull sharks while diamond handing my baby!\n\nThere is a lot of quiet news circulating about NOK. The type you have to read. But after gaining some more wrinkles, from holding and accumulating thru the gauntlet of pain, and a lot of homework (which I implore each of you to do) I believe it have a lot more volume coming in than exiting. We have to k ow that some people are expecting the Same Old Story out of NOK but this time the story is different. \n\n5G, lawsuits won, Blockchain, NFT, medical wearables, ESG, PC/Laptop, EV, IoT, innovation and growth in business plan, no longer in debt, possible dividend, stock buybacks approved and initiated, big investors piling in soon and some already. Not to mention behind the scene sole supplier deals with emerging markets around the world, partnered deals with Microsoft, Amazon, BB, and PLTR on 5G IoT, partnered deals with Lenovo by lawsuit victory (NOK hands all in Lenovo bag). Sued Daimler and won in Germany over patents. I see an earnings surprise in their future and a \"Come to God\" moment for many industries.\n  \n  Even Samsung pursued a deal with NOK to provide video technology for their devices. Now ask yourself, why ate these heavyweights NOKing down NOK's door for anything? After all, aren't they a failing company with no fundamentals? I beg to differ. Highly undervalued is what they are. The company trades at 1.2 P/S ratio, and a nonexistent P/E. The only thing that has lacked fundamentals is the greedy shorts that didn't know when to quit! But this isn't only about a squeeze, it's a turnaround story from a misunderstood Tech powerhouse.\n\nNot to mention it looks to be seeing up another breakout in a bullish way looking at the weekly and monthly charts.\n\nThe purpose of this post is to give the fuel/motivation to do your own DD/TA. Don't take my word for shit. I'm only the \ud83e\udd34of All Bag Holders.\n\nI currently hold 1207 shares @ and averaged pps of $4.66 and accumulating. I know the stock is worth more than she ever was when everyone thought it was a telecom play. That ATH is @59. This Stock is like owning Amazon when they thought it was a book store. Not saying it will go that high or that it won't just comparing the level of understanding of what either of them ever really were.\n\nMake your own choices tho, as for me, I LOVE THE STOCK!",

        "selftext": "Yesterday's action on WWE scared the living shit out of me. I mean, how the fuck does one DD on WSB cause a $4.4b stock to move up 11% (~$450m in market cap)? Clearly something must be wrong with the market, right?!\n\nHere's some fun [math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msDuNZyYAIQ#t=41) for you: WWE's IV was 35%. The standard deviation for a daily move (using the rule of 16) is 35/16 = 2.1875%. It moved 11%/2.1875% -- about *five* standard deviations. The odds of that? Roughly 1 in 1.74 million. (Let me know if this is miscalculated).\n\nSo how does a 1 in 1.74 million event occur? And, more practically: Why didn't it close at a lower, more statistically reasonable price?\n\n# The SMELL - high bang for the buck\n\nIf you remember my [first post yesterday](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/nvibpi/wwe_can_you_smell_what_the_stock_is_cooking/), I chose this ticker due to it passing the SMELL test:\n\n* **S**hort Interest is high\n* **M**arket cap is high\n* **E**xtremely Memeable\n* **L**ow IV  &lt;-- (implies low volume, as well)\n* **L**ow Float\n\nWhat differentiates WWE from other new meme stocks (CLOV, CLNE, etc) are the Low IV and Low Volume. I'll touch on that in a sec.\n\nFirst, let's get one thing straight. The bump from yesterday was **definitely** from my original post. To me that's incredible... because I don't even consider that post a wild success:\n\n* It didn't hit the frontpage.\n* It was buried a few pages deep for awhile (it got a late start).\n* In the end, it garnered 1k upvotes and 230 comments.\n* WWE reached something like #25 in mentions on WSB. Meh.\n* **Yet, still, caused a *five sigma* move in the stock.** That's pretty good leverage.\n\nI think that's the SMELL at work -- particularly the low IV and low volume. There's just not much liquidity in this stock. Not much of the market cares about it. If they did, then after settling down at $65.00, with volume tapering off.. where were the profit takers? Where were the shorts? **A 10% day with *zero* news, and momentum seemingly fading... and it stays at +10% five sigma levels?**  With a single 1k upvote WSB post?\n\nI'm bullish.\n\n# Show me the memes\n\nNow do me a favor and find some second-generation meme stocks with DD-post numbers that low that have done *anything*. Seriously, I'd be grateful if you find one. I don't think any stock has moved 11%, much less five sigma of its IV, from a single DD before. (Well, maybe CLNE. But it wasn't five sigma, and it was already widely discussed recently before the run-up. I could be wrong here.)\n\nA more typical example: CLF, a new star, a had *several* DD posts yesterday, all raking in *multiple times* the amount of upvotes and comments. And what did CLF do yesterday? Up 14%. With an IV of 60%, a 14% move is 3.2 standard deviations away, or 1 in 1000 odds. All of that attention and it breaks out by an amount 1000x more likely than what happened to WWE.\n\n**WWE got far less attention, but moved a much more significant amount.** See what I'm saying?\n\nAlso yesterday, the other second-generation meme tickers were fetching in tens of thousands of upvotes across several posts. They seemed to just hang out. Some dumped. Meanwhile, WWE just hangs out even while the WSB \"trend\" ranking is like [#26](https://www.quiverquant.com/wallstreetbets/) on the rankings. (Scroll down to \"Trend Map\" or Ctrl+F for WWE).  It's mentions count is *way down there* .. below CRSR, BARK, SI, SDC, TWNK, and a bunch of other shit I had no idea anybody still cared about or just started fawning over.\n\n**And, yet, WWE pumped and did not dump.**\n\n&gt; Why didn't it close at a lower, more statistically reasonable price?\n\nI believe there is simply not much real inflows or outflows in WWE.\n\nRemember, the daily volume on this was generally very low, the IV was very low, and it's 120% insitutionally owned. Nobody trades this, it's not expected to move much, and the shareholders are boomer funds. How many of those institutional owners actually reposition their holdings regularly? I don't think many. At least, not many did yesterday.\n\nThe WSB post started reaching obscurity, but WWE held steady at 11% gains -- with literally *no fundamentals* changing from day before. The shorts are being cautious, and the longs are just chilling.\n\n**If you believe that my one shitty little post was enough for what happened yesterday, then you should see that it doesn't take much to move this stock.** With WWEs meme potential, and it being short squeeze season, there's a lot of upside, and not a whole lot of downside (maybe -11%, back down to where it was).\n\n# News Porn\n\nThis type of coverage can't hurt:\n\n- Bloomberg: [Newest Meme Stocks Extend Gains With No Sign of Craze Fading](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-09/newest-meme-stocks-extend-gains-as-craze-shows-no-sign-of-fading)\n- Motley Fool: [Why WWE Sotck Jumped 21.5% today](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/09/why-wwe-stock-jumped-215-today/)\n- SBNation: [WWE stock could be getting the Gamestop treatment](https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2021/6/9/22526765/wwe-memestock-reddit-share-prices-surge) - I got mentioned by name lol\n- Investor's Business Daily: [Meme-mania Sends WWE Stock Flying As AMC Is Slammed](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-slips-meme-mania-sends-wwe-stock-flying-amc-stock-slammed-microsoft-gains/)\n\nAdmittedly surreal to see these.\n\n# tHe sQuEeZE iS nOt sQuOZe\n\nIn case any of you are into this for the squeeze potential - 22% of available float - let's discuss. If you don't care about sqeeziness, great, you can skip this.\n\nI don't believe we saw any squeeze yesterday:\n\n* Post market and pre market shows extremely bullish activity.\n* MMs and quant algos see an uptick in WWE mentions on \"the bane of our existance\"\n* Asks for options go up defensively\n* Market opens, and plethora of options orders come in. (Not a crazy amount, just 1k upvotes worth). They continually hit the ask and ramp up the volatility.\n* MMs are forced to gobble up shares to deltahedge from both the new options, and also the *huge* gap at open, and also the *huge* increase in IV. Remember, based on the prices they've sold the existing OI, this is a *five sigma* event.\n* On a stock with hardly any volume to support that.\n* Stock wobbles around as the feeding frenzy ensues\n* Volumes tapers down, stock holds at +10%\n\nNo hockey stick squeeze. No high volume spikes mid day. Thus, I think no margin calls and no covering.\n\n**Furthermore, I'm told Ortex did not show a decrease in shares on loan.** I'll update this tomorrow when that data becomes available.\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIt is my opinion that non-retail longs and shorts are just sitting on the sidelines. Not much profit taking, not much shorting, and not much covering. They're all being cautious. Look at institutional ownership of this thing. **120%.** How many of these fund managers are going to reposition their WWE holdings mid-day? Probably not many.\n\nI feel like yesterday's movement was all us, MMs, and HFTs shuffling. Just from one itty bitty 1k upvote post. That's a lot of leverage. The SMELL in real. What happens if this post hits 2k? Or this thing gets memed by others? What happens if shorts actually start to cover? What happens if there's an acquisition?\n\n*But don't kid yourself... this is still speculative.*\n\nI'm now *less* bullish, but not bearish, about:\n\n* A fundamentals based justification of current share price.\n\nI'm now *more* bullish about:\n\n* The impact that visibility here could have on the share price.\n* The probability of shorts covering, probably slowly for now, but possibly biting the bullet if we get into the $70s.\n* The IV getting more jacked (90% IV is high for this ticker, but low for a meme-stock)\n\nAnd, lastly, when this thing peaked just after open and you all complained about not getting in: Well, [I felt ugly. I felt stupid. I felt gay.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_do8VgY4bqI&amp;t=50s) Sorry about that. My next DD, if I find another SMELLy stock, will be during market hours.\n\n# TLDR\n\n* I'm bullish that a single 1k-upvoted DD on WSB, reaching only #25 most mentioned, was able to move this stock 11% up (+$440m to market cap)... which @ 35% IV is a five sigma event. About 1 in 1.7 million.\n* By comparison, CLF had several posts each with ~3k upvotes, 3x the comments, etc, and it saw a 14% move. That's 3.2 sigma move, about 1 in 1000.\n* To me that indicates there is not much liquidity in WWE, and the volume yesterday was MMs, HFTs, quant funds, and retail buying options and shares.\n* 120% institutional ownership must have a lot of float locked up as well, and they're not in the business of repositioning randomly on a bump with no news.\n* Price **held** at +11% -- five sigma above what the market thought this was valued at a day ago, despite no news. Why no sell-off?\n* Again -- all this from a single *moderately successful* post.\n* To me this reads as bullish: the small visibility on WSBs has a massive impact on the share price. More massive than any other tickers I've seen catch on here lately.\n* I saw no signs of covering or margin calls. Neither did Ortex.\n\n\n# Positions\n\nAfter yesterday's action, the risk/reward for options is significantly higher. I don't think the IVs are too crazy, yet, but the odds of a 20-bagger are slim unless we see CLF levels of hype. Regardless, I trimmed most of my options, and have left in the $-amount I started with.\n\nSame positions as before, but now evenly spread:\n\n* Jun 18 $65, $70\n* Jul 16 $60, $65, $70\n* Jan '22 $60\n* If this post picks up traction I'll be adding onto the 70s at open.\n* I will likely buy many shares at open, as I think the worst case with them is they go down 11% to $58. No biggie.",

        "selftext": "**My Background:**\n\nYou might remember me from my posts on r/SPACs such as my [DD on SKLZ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/k3ygol/feac_2021s_draftkings/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), my post [highlighting the use of margin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/kbgtd6/why_this_is_a_onceinadecade_or_more_spac_bonanza/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to take advantage of the asymmetric risk/reward profile in NAV SPACs, or my [extensive DD on SFTW/BlackSky](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/lpxih4/extensive_dd_on_blacksky_sftw_bsky/) that I managed to time almost exactly with the market top :(. I may also be resented by some on the sub for my obnoxious ranting against Canoo (HCAC/GOEV), which turned out to be accurate. \n\n**The Rumor**\n\nThe most recent [rumored target](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/traveloka-said-in-talks-to-list-via-richard-li-s-bridgetown-spac) for BTWN is Traveloka, the leading SEA online travel company.  Until we get a definitive agreement between the SPAC and target, we must glean company details from various interviews. \n\n**What Is Traveloka?**\n\nTraveloka is the #1 travel site in SEA. The app has 10M+ downloads on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.traveloka.android&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US) with almost 1 million reviews and an average rating of almost 5 stars (on the App Store as well). [SensorTower data](https://sensortower.com/ios/publisher/pt-traveloka-indonesia/898244860) shows more than 200,000 downloads in the last month alone. The [company claimed](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-traveloka-funding/se-asias-biggest-travel-app-traveloka-raises-250-million-as-lockdowns-ease-idUSKCN24T0OG) more than 60 million downloads over all devices by July 2020. Although the company began as just a travel aggregator, it quickly expanded into offering its own products and service throughout Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, [and now Australia](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/329188). The company provides transportation, hotel, and experience bookings across SEA, a region that has historically been too complex for companies like Expedia (large investor in Traveloka, see below) to operate in effectively due to the fractured nature of the travel industry, multitude of languages, and local customs. \n\nTraveloka was disproportionately affected by COVID restrictions relative to other tech unicorns, seeing transaction reductions of **up to 95%** during the lockdown peak in April-May, 2020. They raised $250m in additional capital that summer to bolster the company balance sheet and expand into other sectors. But, this black swan event showed us the flexibility of the company and innovation of the leadership. They introduced live tour streaming and interactive social media auctions, as well as the Online Xperience platform where users can learn new skills and interact with other participants (noted an 8x increase in users in July, 2020). Case in point: transactions have reached 100% and 75% of pre-COVID levels in Vietnam and Thailand, respectively. They offered a huge promotion event in Indonesia called the Traveloka Epic Sale that generated a 1300% transaction increase with steep price discounts ([source for paragraph](https://kr-asia.com/traveloka-will-expand-fintech-offerings-and-geographical-coverage-in-2021-co-founder-says)).\n\nOver the past few years, Traveloka has expanded beyond just offering travel services and into fintech. [They partnered](https://kr-asia.com/indonesias-traveloka-partners-with-state-lender-bni-for-paylater-service) with Indonesian state bank BRI in Oct 2019 to launch the PayLater VISA card and partnered with the BNI state bank in Jan 2020 to support a PayLater platform service. This is essentially building a new branch for the Traveloka brand, providing Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), credit card, and insurance (auto, travel, health) services. \n\nWhat\u2019s so special about yet another fintech operation? Traveloka is focusing not on the **un**banked, but on the **under**banked. To quote from [a great interview](https://kr-asia.com/traveloka-will-expand-fintech-offerings-and-geographical-coverage-in-2021-co-founder-says) with the co-founder in Dec 2020: \u201cIn Indonesia, bank penetration is close to 50%, while credit card penetration is around 3%. Indonesians tend to have bank accounts, yet they do not have access to financing services. Here, we aim to bridge the gap by partnering with prominent banks and leveraging our robust technology and a large customer base.\u201d\n\nThey have also recently begun expanding fintech services outside their home country of Indonesia by [partnering with Thai bank SCB](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Finance/Indonesia-s-Traveloka-to-expand-fintech-business-into-Thailand), and are [in discussions](https://skift.com/2021/02/25/traveloka-targets-vietnam-thailand-for-launching-financial-services-ahead-of-possible-ipo/) with similar partners in Vietnam.\n\nI am especially interested in the BNPL offering, which is one of the fastest growing fintech sectors. For example, Afterpay (AFTPY) recently beat expectations with 167% YOY sales growth and Affirm (AFRM) had revenue growth of 81% and 64% in 2019 and 2020, respectively. To wit, Traveloka has already facilitated [more than 6 million loans](https://skift.com/2021/02/25/traveloka-targets-vietnam-thailand-for-launching-financial-services-ahead-of-possible-ipo/) in their home country of Indonesia after just two years of BNPL operation.\n\nWith the combination of their streaming tours, online experience options, and fintech operations, Traveloka not only managed to survive the COVID pandemic, they even managed to [turn profitable](https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/traveloka-profitable-2020-229947/) in 2020. What also helped was the company\u2019s ability to run at high efficiency. In the same article linked above, a company investor stated that Traveloka was able to burn only \u201clow single-digit million USD quarterly\u201d during the crisis.\n\nIf we use COVID revenue drop numbers [from Expedia](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/expedias-2020-revenue-sinks-57-pandemic-continues-roil-travel-industry/), we can assume a revenue reduction ranging from 40-60%. [Reportedly](https://kr-asia.com/traveloka-will-expand-fintech-offerings-and-geographical-coverage-in-2021-co-founder-says), Traveloka issued \\~$100m in refunds in 2020. So, expected annual revenue for Traveloka in 2020 could have ranged from $166m-$250m, but still maintained profitability. Highly uncertain estimates, but it\u2019s the best I can do for now.\n\n**Company Founders and Funding:**\n\n* **Founded** in 2012 by Ferry Unardi (CEO), Derianto Kusuma (ex-CTO, left co.), and Albert Zhang.\n* **Ferry Unardi background**: B.S.

I expect **very** favorably because Traveloka is a combination of growth, value, and re-opening. **GROWTH** because the company is expanding rapidly across SEA and likely yields high percent revenue growth, **VALUE** because the company is profitable in a large and growing TAM, and **RE-OPENING** because travel was clobbered by COVID and everyone is scrambling to move around again. Traveloka is NOT one of the (seemingly endless) unknown companies taking advantage of market liquidity for the founders/investors to cash out or prop up some dev-stage tech shop. Traveloka has [long been recognized](https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/how-many-unicorns-are-there-in-southeast-asia%EF%BC%9F/) as one of the best unicorns in SEA, operational for almost a decade, and backed by some of the best known VC names.\n\nSEA is a very exciting market right now, but *especially* in terms of SPACs. There are approximately [500 unicorns](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Startups/Unicorns-surge-to-500-in-number-as-US-and-China-account-for-70) (private companies valued &gt; $1b) in the world as of Nov 2020. Almost half of those (242) are in the US, followed by China (119), India (24), UK (24), and South Korea (11). Just 5 are based in Indonesia, and SEA as a whole boasts [just 9 private unicorns](https://i0.wp.com/thelowdown.momentum.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%87_20200529023712.png?resize=696%2C365&amp;ssl=1) (link is a bit out of date). Examples are Grab (AGC), GoTo (Gojek/Tokopedia merged privately), Lazada (struggling, overtaken in GMV by SE\u2019s Shopee), Traveloka ([that\u2019s us!](https://media2.giphy.com/media/KDVswimTNahWzcd7sV/giphy.gif)), Bukalapek, and Zilingo. The point of this is that the SPAC market is WAY oversaturated with many obscure companies going public at steep valuations despite meager revenue and growth. SEA, conversely, is extremely undersaturated.\n\nHere is the list of SEA SPAC mergers: \n\n* Grab is [merging](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Biggest+SPAC+Deal+Ever%3A+Grab+To+Go+Public+in+a+%2440+Billion+Merger+With+Altimeter+%28AGC%29%2C+Backed+by+Fidelity+and+BlackRock/18252682.html) with AGC.\n* Tiket (smaller competitor to Traveloka) is [rumored](https://investor.id/market-and-corporate/cova-acquisition-negosiasi-dengan-unicorn-di-indonesia) to be in talks with COVA.\n* Tokopedia was [originally rumored](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-15/thiel-backed-spac-said-to-weigh-up-to-10-billion-tokopedia-deal) to be merging with BTWN, but has since [merged privately](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/gojek-and-tokopedia-merge-to-form-goto-group/) with Gojek and is now [weighing public listing options](https://www.techinasia.com/gojek-tokopedias-merged-entity-goto-plans-preipo-fundraise). *Could* still go with BTWN, but I think direct listing is possible now.\n* MNC Play is [merging](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001807594/000121390021016795/ea138123ex99-1_malacca.htm) with MLAC (btw, quick shill: MLAC is way, way overlooked - I hold a bunch of warrants).\n\nThat\u2019s it. Despite the region having 360 million internet users (see below), there are few unicorn targets and SPACs relative to the United States. SEA is ripe for the SPACening. Here are some highlights regarding the region, taken from the [BTWN S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001815086/000121390020044067/fs12020_bridgetown.htm%5d:):\n\n* \u201cWhile we may pursue an acquisition or a business combination target in any business or industry, we focus our search on a target with operations or prospective operations in the technology, financial services, or media sectors, which we refer to as the \u201cnew economy sectors\u201d, in Southeast Asia.\u201d\n* \u201c\\[SEA\\] is fast becoming a major regional economic force and a driver of global growth.\u201d\n* \u201c\\[SEA\\] remains one of the fastest growing regions in the world with economic growth averaging 5.4% per annum\u201d\n* \u201c\\[SEA\\] is estimated to become the fourth-largest economy in the world by 2030 after the US, China, and the EU.\u201d\n* \u201cCollective findings by Google, Temasek, and Bain &amp; Company indicate that the region\u2019s internet economy has crossed the $100 billion mark in 2019 and is poised to triple to an estimated $300 billion by 2025.\u201d\n* \u201cWith approximately 360 million Internet users in the region, 90% of which connect to the Internet primarily through their mobile phones, Southeast Asia boasts one of the most engaged mobile internet audience in the world.\u201d\n\nIn a word:  **BULLISH**.\n\n**The SPAC: Bridgetown I (BTWN)**\n\nFounded as a co-venture between Thiel Capital (Peter Thiel) and Pacific Century (Richard Li), focused on tech, fintech, or media in Southeast Asia (SEA). [The sponsor team](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001815086/000121390020044067/fs12020_bridgetown.htm%5d:):\n\n* The primary name in BTWN is **Peter Thiel**, one of the most renowned tech investors of the 21st century. Peter Thiels first big win was cofounding Paypal with Elon Musk, then later being the first outside investor in Facebook by providing $500k in return for a 10% stake in the company in 2004. He sold most of his shares between 2012-2017 for  \\~$1.1 billion, representing a return of 220,000%. Side note: if he had never sold any of his \\~37.76m shares, his equity in FB today would be \\~$12.4b, an eye-popping return of 2,480,000%... if he had held. Other *other* side note, these are rookie numbers in comparison to Jeff Bezos and his family. Their initial investment of \\~$300k into AMZN back in 1994-1995 (later supplemented by a few dozen angel investors), would provide a return of \\~55,500,000% over 27 years. But, I digress. Other early investments by Peter Thiel (just listing off his [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel)): ABNB, LinkedIn, Yelp, SPOT, SpaceX, PLTR, ASAN, and Stripe, among others. To put it mildly: The guy\u2019s a legend.\n* Another primary name here is **Richard Li**, billionaire founder of Pacific Century, founder of Star TV (Asia\u2019s first satellite-delivered cable-TV, later sold to Murdoch\u2019s News Corp). Li\u2019s Pacific Century invests heavily in media and telecom, including companies such as Viu (video streaming), HKT (telecom), and Legendary Pictures. Other investments range from Tensar (soil solutions) to Sodecia North America (engineered materials) to FWD (insurance). One of Li\u2019s most notable investments is being among the earliest investors in the Chinese conglomerate Tencent (now $600b market cap). Various other names include Sohu (media/gaming), Chegg (ed-tech), and Tokopedia (e-commerce). \n* CEO/CFO/Director: **Daniel Wong**, senior VP of Pacific Century Group. Representing PCG and Richard Li.\n* Chairman of the board: **Matt Danzeisen**, Head of Private Investments at Thiel Capital. Representing Thiel Capital and Peter Thiel.\n* Member of the board: **Samuel Altman**, the CEO of OpenAI and former President of Y Combinator. Altman has invested in many behemoth tech companies, including AirBnb, Stripe, Reddit, Asana, and Pinterest. He [joined the board of Expedia](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/sam-altman-joins-expedia-group-board-bringing-expertise-openai-ceo-former-y-combinator-president/), one of the primary investors in Traveloka, in 2019.\n* Other board members: **John R. \u201cJay\u201d Hass**, **Joon Hwang**.\n* Senior advisor: **Kenneth Ng**.\n\n**What Is the Investment Move?**\n\nThere are three choices for investing in this SPAC: (1) BTWN shares, (2) BTWN warrants (BTWNW), or (3) BTWN options.\n\nOf the three, I think that warrants are the least desirable choice. As of this writing, they are trading at $1.95, which is a somewhat steep premium to pay in the current SPAC market environment.\n\nThe second-best option is BTWN shares - they are trading just 10 cents over NAV at $10.10, so they offer good downside protection at the cost of more limited upside. I have a sizable position in BTWN shares.\n\nThe best choice, in my opinion, is BTWN call options. Each options contract gives you leverage over 100 shares. Because the implied volatility (IV) on SPACs is so low right now, premiums are cheap. With BTWN July $10c trading at $0.30 ($30/contract), the break-even price on each contract is just 1.98% above the current share price. This means that you are getting leverage of 33:1 (depending on the contract price). As with all options trades, liquidity is incredibly important. In the case of the July calls, open interest (the number of active contracts) is **26,281** as of this writing.\n\nIn my opinion, these **July options offer one of the greatest reward/risk ratios in the market right now**. For every $1 move up in share price above $10, each contract gains an intrinsic value of $100. That means the percent return at expiration on each contract is:\n\n* 100% at price of $10.60\n* 233% at price of $11.00\n* 567% at price of $12.00\n* 900% at price of $13.00\n* 1233% at price of $14.00\n\nSo to provide an example from [optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/), purchasing 50 July $10c options contracts for $30 each ($0.30/share) at a total of $1,500 could generate the following $ returns: [http://opcalc.com/vql](http://opcalc.com/vql). Pretty astounding!\n\nNot to mention that option contract prices are also dictated by volatility. If the underlying stock were to become more volatile, options contract premiums will (up to a certain share price, that is, bc we\u2019re buying ITM options).\n\n**Why Are Options Premiums So Low?**\n\nWell, because pops on SPAC DA announcements are, to say the least, muted right now. The growth market has gotten hammered since March, with many stocks down 30-60% from ATHs. SPACs were disproportionately affected because they are among the most speculative investment in the growth market and investors have been reluctant to jump back in. At its low, the SPAK ETF was down **37% from ATH**. But over the last couple weeks, the market has begun to rebound. For example, 5 days ago SPAK [broke out](https://share.trendspider.com/chart/SPAK/28503eb61b8) of its month\u2019s long downtrend with the RSI surpassing 50. Many pre-merger and deSPAC names have begun to trend upward with 5d and 7d EMAs crossing over the 20d EMA, including [SKLZ](https://share.trendspider.com/chart/SKLZ/28503ebgcma) (my baby), [BFLY](https://share.trendspider.com/chart/BFLY/28503ebhyy6), [SOFI](https://share.trendspider.com/chart/SOFI/28503ebjbl5), and [ACTC](https://share.trendspider.com/chart/ACTC/28503ebl7td).\n\nThe low premiums on these options are why I think this is a great play right now. As Warren Buffet said, \u201cBe greedy when others are fearful\u201d (though I\u2019m **sure** he wasn\u2019t referring to options). My position in shares is just a cash reserve right now with potential upside (I discussed that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/kbgtd6/why_this_is_a_onceinadecade_or_more_spac_bonanza/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) a bit), but the options appear to have incredibly high upside by providing leverage. With my 200 ITM options, I am gaining leverage over 20,000 shares, equivalent to a $200,000 position, for a price of just $6,000 (albeit with a strict time constraint).\n\n**Why This SPAC?**\n\nThere are [hundreds of active SPACs](https://spactrack.net/activespacs/) right now actively searching or rumored to be in talks with a target. Buying contracts on any of the optionable ones that don\u2019t have credible rumors is a big risk. Case in point: I did just that with XPOA options as a cheap gamble and am now down 40% on them because they\u2019re merging with a relatively boring mobile gaming company. *Note: I think the company is good, but not exactly exciting for the rest of the market, unfortunately*.\n\nBTWN is a unique case, however. The management team is composed of some of the best investors in the world (Thiel, Li) and they have a credible rumor (Bloomberg) targeting a long-established unicorn (Traveloka) in one of the hottest marketplaces in the world (SEA). As a comparison, the SPAC AGC (planning to merge with SEA\u2019s Grab) is trading at 19% over NAV. **At that price, the intrinsic value of BTWN July calls would represent a return of 533%** (assuming a purchase price of $30/contract). The AGC merger values Grab at around $40b, approximately 8-9x that of the rumored BTWN/Traveloka merger. Because the valuation of Traveloka is so much smaller, it can have much higher volatility during price discovery.\n\nYou could always try the October calls, but the premium is 100% higher and open interest is just 28% of the July calls. If we haven\u2019t gotten a DA announcement in the next couple weeks, you could just roll the contracts to the October strike for a minimal loss.\n\nSide note: I recently DMed the author of the Bloomberg article, Yoolim Lee, on Twitter to check in on the rumor itself. She confirmed that (1) no, there haven\u2019t been recent rumor updates, and (1) yes, the rumor is for BTWN, not BTNB.\n\n**How To Size Your Options Position**\n\n**DO NOT YOLO** these options. In fact, never YOLO on anything, let alone options (well, SPAC shares are safe pre-merger). We invest in SPACs because of the floor price built into pre-merger commons. Options on these shares are inherently high risk, but in the current market environment this is even more so the case. My call options represent just a small percentage of my portfolio because they can absolutely go to zero if the share price is under $10 by July 16 or can easily lose 50% of their value. The person or MM writing/selling these options is, in fact, betting on that scenario. Personally, **I keep options purchases at or under 1% of my portfolio**. Let me reiterate: DO. NOT. YOLO. If you get the urge to, just buy a small percentage in options, then put the rest into BTWN shares since they are protected by the NAV.\n\n**Disclosure:**\n\nThis is not financial advice. I\u2019m just a random guy on the internet. Assume the worst about me and do your own research!\n\n**My Positions:**\n\n* 9,000 BTWN shares - subject to change, probably moving into PACX because it is *wayyyy* overlooked and undervalued.\n* 200 July 16 $10c options",

I\u2019ve had AMZN on my watchlist for a while and I\u2019ve been trying to find a decent entry point for some time.\n\nSo, I had a look at AMZN\u2019s valuation and I saw a P/S ratio of 4.03 and a P/E ratio of 63.7, both of which would _usually_ indicate that a stock is very overvalued.\n\nI\u2019m still of the opinion that AMZN might actually still be overvalued, and that we\u2019re still going to have to wait sometime until we see some growth there.\n\nThe situation with AAPL is quite bad too; P/S is 6.49 and P/E is 28.43. GOOGL, V, MA, MSFT and pretty much any kind of large cap tech stock has ridiculously high valuation figures.\n\nSo my question is, why do people continue to think that tech stocks are a great buy with these kinds of figures?

        "selftext": "As a sequel to \"10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM\", I'm back with 10 more ETFs that have less than $1b AUM but that I think are interesting and possibly useful and some comments on each.  Too often only the biggest ETFs, or most popular, get people's attention. I think it's worth looking further to see what's out there.\n\nStarting with a Peter Lynch inspired strategy (Lynch popularized the price/earnings-to-growth ratio),\n\n1. SPGP: Invesco S&amp;P 500 GARP ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP) . \"Growth at a Reasonable Price\" (GARP).  This ETF is an interesting combination factor screener.  It only selects from S&amp;P 500 stocks, and screens them first for 3-year earnings and sales growth, and second for financial leverage (debt), return on equity, and earnings yield (trailing-twelve-month or \"TTM\" net income / market cap).  Holdings are weighted by growth score, not market cap.  GARP's historical performance is surprisingly good; it beat the S&amp;P 500 since January 2020 and beats both the S&amp;P and traditional CRSP growth/value factors YTD.  It also outperforms the S&amp;P on some longer timeframes.  Index rebalanced semiannually (3rd Friday June/Dec), and it costs a moderate 0.34% ER.  It's designed to hold 75 stocks.  Check SPGP out when it rebalances later in the month!\n\nMoving on to Factor ETFs,\n\n2.  FVAL: Fidelity Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL) .  This ETF tracks and index that calculates scores for: free cash flow yield, EBITDA to enterprise value, book value to price, and forward earnings to price. The first two factors result in it having some tech giants such as FB, GOOGL, AMZN, and AAPL in the index. But not some others, such as TSLA, which scores very poorly on... well, every factor. Banks are just scored on book to price and forward earnings to price, as their business model is not comparable to most other stocks. FVAL provides an interesting way to get exposure to possibly-not-overpriced intellectual property-heavy companies, as well as traditional value stocks.  Currently holds about 130 stocks.\n\n3.  FIVA: Fidelity International Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA) .  The international (mostly developed markets) counterpart to FVAL, this ETF fills a great niche since forward-looking international value ETFs are few and far between.  Most value ETFs are heavy on book value, and rely on backward looking metrics or ignore free cash flow.  FIVA (and FVAL) take a different approach.  Currently holds about 120 stocks.  FIVA is perhaps the single most overlooked ETF in this entire list -- it provides a unique type of international exposure, and at only 0.39% ER. International factor funds often have slightly higher ERs than total market funds, but may provide much greater total return given desirable macro-economic conditions.  For example, since the first vaccine was proven effective (which kicked off the value rally), FIVA has outperformed VEA by about 6 percent.\n\n4.  JVAL: JPMorgan U.S. Value Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753) .  JVAL's index is also a value screen. It scores via four metrics: earnings yield, book to price, free cash flow yield, and TTM dividend yield. Pretty well-rounded in that it includes earnings, book, and yield measures. It does not include forward earnings metrics. Due to the cash flow and earnings metrics, it ends up including some big tech companies like FB, GOOGL, and MSFT. While it includes a dividend metric, the JVAL ETF has a lower 30-day SEC yield than VTV or dividend-focused ETFs such as SCHD, so I would not consider it as a dividend fund.  Holds about 350 stocks.  \n\n5. FQAL: Fidelity Quality Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal) .  Quality ETFs depart from value ETFs in that they're less concerned about price/earnings metrics.   Fidelity's offering in the space weights stocks on free cash flow margin, return on invested capital (one of Charlie Munger's favorite metrics), and free cash flow stability.  For banks, it looks at return on equity and debt to assets.  This ends up having a lot of overlap with the S&amp;P 500, but it ends up filtering out companies like TSLA and as per its goal, only has about 130 companies overall.  Like FVAL, this costs 0.29% ER.  Fairly common for US factor funds.\n\n6. JQUA: JPMorgan U.S. Quality Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761) .  JPMorgan handles \"quality\" a bit differently.  They have 10, yes ten, different metrics that go into measuring quality.  They're grouped into categories for \"profitability\", \"solvency and financial risk\", and \"earnings quality\".  Loosely stated, they're looking for companies making reliable cold hard cash hand over fist that are not too indebted.  Like the Fidelity offering, it ends up looking a lot like the S&amp;P 500 but with slightly different weights.  GOOGL currently sits at the top of its holdings.\n\nLet us not forget commodities,\n\n7. COM: Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf](https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf) .  A fascinating ETF, it covers 12 different commodity futures in categories for metals, agriculture, and energy.  Different from most other commodity ETFs, it's almost like a commodity trend advisor (CTA) fund because it can take both long and \"flat\" (neutral/no) position in each commodity.  This helped COM wonderfully during the commodity crash in 2Q20 because they were able to go flat and preserve value, avoiding the oil crash.  If inflation comes back big time, commodities will benefit.  And if a commodity bubble bursts, this fund may be able to avoid some of the downside.  No K-1 form.  Might be my go-to outside of GUNR (equity ETF) for commodity exposure.\n\n8. CMDY: iShares Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund) .  A somewhat newer offering from Blackrock, this broad commodity fund systematically positions itself to best handle carry cost in the futures curve (and thus adjusts for contango / backwardation curves).  It has generally outperformed other popular long-only commodity funds, and avoid being overweight on oil/energy futures.\n\nSeeking dividends?\n\n9. SCHY: Schwab International Dividend Equity ETF, [https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy) . A new offering from Schwab, it's the international counterpart to SCHD.  Its index filters for companies that have made 10 consecutive years of dividend payments, and ranks them by cash flow to total debt, return on equity, dividend yield, and 5-year dividend growth rate.  After a volatility screen, the results are weighted by a capped market capitalization approach.  A wonderful mirror to SCHD for those seeking reliable income, but who also want to diversify outside of US markets.  I predict its AUM will go up by 10x in less than 2 years.  Also quite inexpensive at 0.14% ER -- Schwab is likely subsidizing this, in order to help it grow.\n\nFinally, like it or not, blockchain is here to stay,\n\n10. BLOK: Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html) .  The AUM of this ETF is right around the $1b mark, but I'm including it anyway.  It seems to be the best-of-breed actively managed ETF for exposure to stocks benefiting from bitcoin mania and blockchain tech.  Clearly, it's volatile.  And it's not a pure bitcoin/ethereum play -- some small amounts of Samsung, IBM, and so on sneak in due to them having a connection to the space.  But it does hit all the big names, including recently listed Coinbase ($COIN).  If you can't be bothered to follow or deal with crypto in general but want something that will remain correlated to it, this is the ETF.  Pricey at 0.71% ER, but, it's actively managed and still has a lower ER than ARK's funds.\n\nDisclaimers: this is not financial advice. I currently have a position in FVAL, but no position in any of the other ETFs at time of posting.  That may change at any point in the future.  I am not predicting future performance for any of these funds.  Do your own due diligence (and please post in reply with what you find!).\n\nWhat do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?",

        "selftext": "I originally posted a DD ON $NNDM back on April 30th. If you had bought Nano Dimension on that day, you'd be up 23% right now. If you would have caught the bottom in Mid-may, you'd be up over 58%.\n\nHere's the same DD, with updated information.\n\nThink you missed it? No. I think this stock has room to run further. Here's why:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNano Dimension $NNDM\n\nCompany Description (From their website)\n\nNano Dimension Ltd. engages in the provision of intelligent machines for the fabrication of additively manufactured electronics. Its products and services include DragonFly Pro System, conductive and insulating inks for printed electronics, and optimized multi-material design of complex electronics.\n\n**Where They Can Sell**\n\nIn several investor phone calls the past few months by CEO Yoav Stern, he has stated SEVERAL times that the companies deals with companies in the Defense sector. What they produce with these machines (3d printed ELECTRONIC devices) can be used in many various sectors, like defense, medical, aerospace, etc. \n\nIn March, a RF circuit board printed by them was sent to the International Space Station. \n\nIn May, the company sold one of their machines to the University of Quebec.\n\n**Customers**\n\nNano Dimension recently posted their June 2021 Investors Presentation.\n\nLink: [https://www.nano-di.com/hubfs/2021-06-09-NNDM%20Corporate%20Presentation-final.pdf](https://www.nano-di.com/hubfs/2021-06-09-NNDM%20Corporate%20Presentation-final.pdf)\n\nSamsung, Nvidia, Elon Musk's Neuralink to name a few of their customers.\n\n[Nano Dimension $NNDM Customers](https://preview.redd.it/0l93gi20ov771.png?width=2822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f10c9f024fcad7cfd643e197c628d045899bb317)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cathie Wood**\n\nShe is obsessed with Nano Dimension. Nano Dimension is in FOUR Ark ETFS. (\\* as of 6/27/21) Over 16 million shares she owns.\n\nARKQ (7,644,621 Shares)\n\nARKW (7,630,616 Shares)\n\nIZRL (733,585 Shares)\n\nPRNT (198,291 Shares)\n\n**Revenue**\n\nIt's a speculative stock as of now, so the numbers are not very pleasing.\n\nIn 2020, their total revenue was just $3.4 million, with $48.49 million in losses.\n\nIn pre-covid times, 2019, their revenue was $7 million. Flash forward two years, with a bunch of cash on hand (explained below) and hopefully as COVID subsides, I'm expecting to see higher revenues and hopefully in a few years positive earnings.\n\nMost recently, they released Q1 2021 Earnings. They reported revenue of $811,000 in the first quarter and a net loss of $9,314,000. \n\n*\"Wow they are losing a lot of money!\"*\n\n***--&gt;  The Company ended the quarter with a cash and deposits balance of $1,471,014,000 (including short and long-term unrestricted bank deposits) &lt;--***\n\n\\*As stated on their most recent earnings call, no guidance was given\\*\n\n**Cash on hand**\n\nEvery time the stock spiked, they did an offering. Their most recent offering, on February 16th was for $12.80. And it raised $500 MILLION. As of two weeks ago, they had just about $1.5 BILLION cash on hand. After two acquisitions already (explained below), they have just under $1.4 BILLION\n\n(Yes, that means a bunch of people bought shares at high prices and you can buy it now cheaper then they did)\n\nYes, stock offerings are not good but Yoav Stern (CEO) made it very clear on the investors phone call they hosted last week that they have enough cash on hand to do what they envision, and no more share offerings will happen.\n\nTo put this into perspective, they have $1.4 billion in cash. their market cap as of today is just under 2 billion. Roughly, their current cash values them alone at around $6 a share. This doesn't include patents they own, the newly acquired companies, their technology, and just the valuation itself.\n\n**Acquisitions**\n\nThe company plans to use its money on acquiring companies (No, $NNDM is NOT a SPAC)\n\nSo far, they've acquired two companies this year (and these are very tiny acquisitions, bigger ones are expected)\n\nDeepCube (AI Company - their technology will be used in the currently DragonFly Machine) ($70 Million TOTAL - 40 Million Cash / 30 Million Shares)\n\nNanoFabrica (3D Printing - \\*the company had a investment lead by Microsoft) (\\~$59 Million TOTAL - \\~$27 Million Cash / 32 Million Shares) \\*The final numbers are not confirmed\\*\n\nSo they've only burned through roughly $70 million. They still have around $1.4 Billion.\n\nTheir plan is to acquire companies listed as Type A, Type B, and Type C.\n\nType A - Existing companies in PCB business. Companies with revenue between 40-150 million!\n\nType B - Technologies they think their machines need\n\nType C - Companies that have machines that cater to the same customers that Nano Dimension does. Literally buying their competition and expanding their customer base.\n\n**Unusual Option Activity**\n\nSpecifically, for short term options, there is high open interest on 3 strike call prices.\n\nJuly 16th Options (\\*As of 6/27/21) \\*This stock has had HEAVY volume on $10 July 16th calls almost the entire week of June 21st-25th trading week.\n\n$7.50 - 11,820 Open Interest\n\n$10.00 - 39,978 Open Interest\n\n$12.50 - 18,114 Open Interest\n\nShould also be mentioned the activity on the Puts.\n\n$7.50 PUT - 6,732 Open Interest\n\n**Stock Activity**\n\nThis stock, as well as other growth stocks, seem to be gaining steam again, and momentum looks to be back. Do with that as you please.\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts**\n\n* News related to new customers/partnerships/sales, including with their 2 new recently acquired companies, NanoFabrica &amp; DeepCube\n* According to the CEO, they have a NEW DragonFly they are expecting to release in the near-future\n* Any further acquisitions (Already had 2 this year - The CEO on their May earnings call said starting in June they can tour facilities - they couldn't before because of COVID)\n\n**Video With More Information**\n\nQuick 15 minute video with the CEO, Yoav Stern.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdE6DoqmeqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdE6DoqmeqY)\n\n**The Negatives**\n\n* The company has a rather high short interest (many websites are giving different numbers, but according to FinViz it is around 38%)\n* The company isn't producing high revenues, and its burning cash\n\nTL;DR - This company has a bunch of cash (1.4 billion), has some futuristic technology, and can literally buy out their competition or buy companies that'll help them (which they are doing)\n\nPosition:\n\n820 Shares\n\n*Not a financial advisor*",

        "selftext": "My background; worked in a small hedge fund.  We had real estate loan, some PE, and stock market plays.\n\nI see ALOT of posts in here about diversification as I have been lurking for quite a while.\n\nHere is the way I would think about the downsides of index funds or other etfs to \u201cdiversify\u201d.  You are allowing someone else to limit your risk by picking stocks, in a market that is generally closely correlated.  Index funds at least are diverse, but in a true bear market (let\u2019s say another Great Depression) it could take you 20 years just to break even.  \n\nIf you hold, sure you will get a great return over decades.  But the question is will you fit the \u201ccycle\u201d of return. This means, what if disaster hits when you are 65 and wanted to retire ?  Can\u2019t touch that money until 85 for example.\n\nThis is why Non-correlated assets are the best to diversify with.  Real estate ownership, private funds with real estate in areas you trust and like (make sure they undergo yearly audits and it\u2019s easy to check their assets just check state registrations of properties and compare to their fund size).  I\u2019ve heard gold funds are good but meh, I\u2019m very negative on them.  And I\u2019ve met Peter Schiff in person at an industry event, still didn\u2019t like his pitch on gold.  Gold doesn\u2019t work for you while you sleep; real estate does.\n\nAs for stocks, if you want to pick stocks, at all, there is no short cut.  You will fail on a long enough timeline without significant time and energy invested to find good companies.  If you want growth, price discovery will be best in small-mid cap stocks.  Big companies aren\u2019t a safe bet.  Intel was insanely big in the dot com bubble, it wasn\u2019t a \u201cwebsite\u201d it had great revenue, and it dropped 90%+.  I think even Microsoft took 15-20 years to break even.  Tesla, etc could all do the same.  \n\nWhy do I say there isn\u2019t a shortcut?  You have to have an edge on companies others don\u2019t.\n\nWhen I was young I played some blizzard games.  I saw the way they monetized monthly subscriptions and how Activision announced they would copy that model of micro transactions with games like call of duty.  This has been extremely profitable and was a multibager.  I made this investment because I was a gaming nerd and I just knew what was going to happen better than a suit on wallstreet in this case.\n\nConclusion: put your money in an index fund and decide you don\u2019t care about the cycle of returns.  You aren\u2019t limiting risk by picking a bunch of blue chips by tossing a dart at a board, just get an index fund.\n\nOr\n\nPick your stocks by learning about things you love and having an edge and diversify in a non correlated asset.  Maybe own some income producing real estate.  There are a ton of other non correlated assets.  Ex.  Used Rolex submariners. Old air cooled Porsche 911s. I believe 911s outperformed the stock market from 08-2014 or something crazy like that.",

        "selftext": "This is not financial advice, I am retarded. I tried to time the bottom on the tech correction with calls and got bogged. I own shares of KNBE.\n\nKNBE - Everyone is sleeping on this stock and this sector.\n\nSector DD:\n\nAs in industry insider (systems engineer) I am finding that cybersecurity insurance companies are cracking down on practices and minimum prevention standards. I've seen multiple customers of ours edged into security testing + training by the insurance company telling them its mandatory. The insurers seem to get more strict with every major breach - and we just had a nuclear weapons company breached this week.\n\nMy investing theory for 2021 is that insurance companies are going to compel massive amounts of cybersecurity spending and produce huge earnings reports.\n\nIf you're on LinkedIn, you might have noticed job alerts for cybersecurity jobs have gone up triple or quadruple since January as companies scramble to not be the next one on cable news for getting bogged by eastern european glow in the dark boys.\n\nKNBE DD:\n\n\\- Barely recognized, almost zero results searching WSB or Reddit as a whole.\n\n\\- Good market cap but almost no volume.\n\n\\- Recent IPO - only two quarters. Price discovery still taking place.\n\n\\- Doesn't even have options yet.\n\n\\- Widely considered the industry leader for email phishing test campaigns.\n\n\\- HQ'd in Florida. Most employees are Florida Man / Florida Woman.\n\n\\- 45% rev growth YoY\n\n\\- Turned profitable this year - positive EPS\n\n\\- Financials: [https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KNBE/financials](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KNBE/financials)\n\nThe product: The main product is email phish testing. Fake scam emails sent out by IT meant to get Karen in HR to click on free Apple giftcards / etc. Some more advanced and believable templates as well and the ability to customize them to internal company branding / terminology.\n\nThey also have awareness training to remediate staff and departments that are falling for the scam emails, or to proactively introduce employees to email security concepts.\n\nI did a short trial run with them for a few clients a year ago and was impressed with the platform. I also tried Microsoft's 365 equivalent.\n\nRisks:\n\n\\- Not a monopoly. Already other companies in the same security awareness / testing space.\n\n\\- Competitors includes Microsoft - premium Exchange 365 licensing grants a similar but much less developed product amongst other security tools - but minus the remediation training.\n\n\\- The greatest risk from MSFT is that companies may \"already be paying for\" their phish testing tool as part of existing security licenses - similar to business onedrive / sharepoint vs dropbox.\n\n\\- First DD I ever posted so it's probably shit.\n\n\\- Stock already up 60% this week, might correct.  \n\n\ntl;dr: Insurance companies are making small/midsize businesses spend money on cybersecurity and getting more strict about payouts. KnowBe4 has a good product and a first mover advantage. They're profitable already. Almost zero social media sentiment or press around KNBE and no options - this feels to me like an early bird special.\n\nPositions: http://imgur.com/a/buVpf7x",

        "selftext": "# DEAR APES,\n\nA few weeks ago I began posting on AMD. At the time, the stock was trading in the mid-70's.\n\nToday, as expected, we crossed $90 price... but our trip is just getting **STARTED**!\n\nThe deal with TESLA was announced, as well as the next AMAZING technologies in Computex, including the stacked cache for Zen3, Fidelity FX Super Resolution, the 6900 XTX Liquid Cooled, etc.\n\nThere's a very simple reason why AMD will go past the MOON and MARS: **ENTERTAINMENT**\n\nThe world revolves around entertainment and in this new era, this activity is mandatory to deal with Covid-19, the lack of international travel, work from home, etc.\n\nTESLA adopting AMD for its new Model X and S is HUGE. It will take a Navi23 and an APU (two chips) per car, likely becoming an optional for all other vehicles in the future. More automobile brands will follow, as TESLA is leading the way in the industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TESLA selected AMD chips for its upcoming vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/aekg7gm3u8871.jpg?width=2243&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c178f47df42b4159f92d1248ac9618a3f8440643)\n\nWith autonomous driving, gaming in a long trip will be mandatory. But even without it, the rest of the passengers can game, either with their fellow companions or online, from their car.\n\nSo, yes, the current automotive revolution will have AMD as a main supplier.\n\nThen you have consumer processing, which includes CPU's and GPU's, where AMD is dominating (mostly on the former). The Zen3 architecture is a MONSTER. Intel just cannot compete. And with the stacked cache providing up to 15% more gaming performance, that lead will continue on AMD's side.\n\nOn GPU's, AMD's Navi31 is expected to be MCM (multi-chip module), aiming to repeat AMD's success with Intel, but now against NVIDIA. \"Chiplets\" allow for economies of scale to thrive. More silicon, will less defects, better binning, cheaper... it is an AMAZING IDEA. Just add cache and the latency problem can be mitigated.\n\nOn the console gaming, AMD is the undisputed KING. They're in the PS4, PS4 Pro, PS5, Xbox model and series X/S. Also in the Aya Neo and expected in Valve's next handheld, which will be a MONSTER.\n\nOn Datacenter, AMD is groundbreaking. Epyc and the new offerings from **GOOGLE** for virtual machines is an INCREDIBLE deal. **AMAZON, TENCENT, ALIBABA, AZURE** (Microsoft), they are all buying chips from AMD. More CORES means MORE power processing, lower energy, lower licensing costs and certainly better SECURITY (as INTEL has been plagued by Spectre &amp; Meltdown issues). AMD is now expected to go from 64 cores in EPYC to 96... and also 128. That's just ludicrous, 128 CORES and 256 threads. And X86 clients are THRILLED to buy more power in a more efficient chip.\n\n[Google wants AMD Milan Epyc Chips for its Datacenter](https://preview.redd.it/36x8ygt6u8871.jpg?width=2284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d96e3eab884218203d9fbe906b9ba3474902e13)\n\nDeals with the US Department of Energy (El Capitan), Singapore and Germany, all for public datacenters worth millions of dollars. That's just the tip of the iceberg, as private players are taking note of EPYC.\n\nLast, **but certainly NOT least: MOBILE**\n\nAMD will power Samsung's S22 flagship phone. It's GPU is expected to break records, as engineering samples already have it beating MALI and Apple's options, by **double digits**.\n\n**Samsung** is delighted and **Google** also wants AMD chips for its phones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Samsung wants AMD's chips for its flagship GALAXY S22](https://preview.redd.it/xu07hgobu8871.jpg?width=1919&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfea79ba818835fb83a9cb5f51d5189cf2d034e0)\n\nBut enough on the PRODUCTS. What about the fundamentals?\n\nRevenue growth is expected at 50% by the end of 2021. How many companies are growing by 50%?\n\nAnd that guidance was provided with the Q1 results in April, which were exceeding expectations. The raised the guidance from 37% to 50%... and will certainly BEAT IT.\n\nAMD is NOW a profitable company... and it literally CANNOT keep its products on shelves, as its clients are buying ALL THEIR CHIPS.\n\nAMD's valuation is $110 billion, while NVIDIA (w/slightly more revenue &amp; profit) is $500 billion.\n\nHow is NVIDIA 5 times the value of AMD???... Just because of a stock split?\n\nIt is currently trading at 38 times earnings, which if they grow by 50% in 6 months, will certainly drop.\n\nSo yeah, the stock is currently above $90 and aiming to reach its all-time high of $99 which was reached a few months ago, in January.\n\nAnalyst consensus of the stock is currently $106.54 ([https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast)) which slightly better than an 18% upside, which would take it to a mere $ 132 billion market cap.\n\nIf you ask me, AMD should be **at least HALF** of NVIDIA's $500 billion market cap.\n\nLastly, the Xilinx acquisition, which will aim to create synergies among functions (e.g. HR, Procurement, Engineering, etc.). It will also increase AMD's share of the silicon purchasing world, as TSMC will have AMD as its #2 client, only second to Apple.\n\nXilinx cancelled its dividends as its shareholders approved the merger with AMD.\n\nAMD may choose to bring dividends back after the merger... yet in the meantime, they announced a $4 Billion share buyback program. They know their stock is trading **CHEAP**.\n\n# On the positions (full disclosure): YES, I hold AMD stock.\n\nI bought $25K back in 2013, when the stock was at $2.46 (on January 18th, 2013), a bit over 10150 stocks. I saw the stock go up to $20 and sold half of it in 2018. Later, I bought back a bit (crazy ape mentality).\n\nToday, I stand with 7500 stocks. Certainly worth a couple of Lambo's, yet I drive a Nissan.\n\nIf you ask me, my next car should be a TESLA... with AMD chips (yet I'm not selling AMD).\n\nWE ALREADY PASSED THE MOON, we will pass **MARS** (Tesla) and also our **Galaxy** (Samsung).\n\n# Join me, together we will conquer the Universe!!!\n\nPack your bananas.... we're in for a journey!",

First of all, I'm not qualified to give any financial advices, I'm just here to share a few facts, that makes me believe AMD could start to rise before July. It reached this week more than 85$ (after Google announced it was working with AMD for Google's Cloud computing which was huge news), and went back to 82,6$ after a dip that hit both AMD and NVDA. \n\nHere is different articles I found that seem to show that this dip could be an opportunity before a rise : \n\nhttps://www.notebookcheck.net/Exynos-with-AMD-mRDNA-2-to-be-unveiled-in-July-peak-performance-better-than-next-gen-Mali-GPU-while-beating-latest-Mali-even-with-30-throttling-Google-signing-up-for-mRDNA-2-as-well.546822.0.html --&gt; it has been public knowledge for sometime now that Samsung and AMD are working on a mobile GPU, but official announcement should be next month, AND, as mentionned in the article, Google could also use AMD's RDN2 tech for something in short term (Google Pixel?). Concerning Google, this is the third time that I see this rumor. \n\nhttps://www.thestreet.com/investing/amd-no-ec-objection-to-xilinx-merger --&gt; for the moment the acquisition of Xilinx seems to go well \n\nhttps://www.neowin.net/news/amds-next-gen-rdna-3-performance-jump-rumored-to-be-absolutely-insane/ --&gt; some good news about 2022's GPU \n\nI think next earning release is on 07/27/2021 ; we should see good things there. \n\nThere are also the Xbox/PS5 that are a huge success and based on AMD's GPU ; Microsoft and Sony will keep buying tons of AMD's GPU (maybe more than expected originally).\n\nIt's my point of view but, to invest in mid-term, it looks good. \n\nHave fun today!",

        "selftext": "C3.ai(NYSE:AI)\n\nSector: Technology\n\nIndustry: Information Technology Services\n\nMarket cap: [6B](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AI?p=AI)\n\nC3.ai, Inc is an enterprise artificial intelligence company. The company provides software-as-a-service applications that enable customers to rapidly develop, deploy, and operate large-scale Enterprise AI applications across any infrastructure. It provides solutions under three divisions namely:\n\n* The C3 AI Suite: proprietary model-driven architecture, addresses the requirements for the digital transformation software stack, providing a low-code/no-code AI and Internet of Things, or IoT, platform that accelerates software development, reduces cost and risk, and delivers applications that are flexible enough to meet evolving needs.\n* C3 AI Applications: a large and growing family of industry-specific and application-specific turnkey AI solutions that can be immediately installed and deployed such as:\n   * Inventory Optimization: a solution to optimize raw material, in-process, and finished goods inventory levels\n   * Supply Network Risk: provides visibility into risks of disruption throughout the supply chain operations for enterprise supply chain managers\n   * Customer Churn Management: enables account executives and relationship managers to monitor customer satisfaction using transactional, behavioral, and contextual information, as well as to take action to prevent customer churn with AI-based and human-interpretable predictions and warning\n   * Production Schedule Optimization: a solution for scheduling production \n   * Predictive Maintenance: provides insight into asset risk to maintenance planners and equipment operators\n   * Fraud Detection solution\n   * Energy Management solution \n* C3.ai Ex Machina: analytics for applying data science to every-day business decisions\n\n**FINANCIALS**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/zudwz718ew471.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12d05673719c96e4bce13e8389d0f2c8a63f3006)\n\nC3 is growing rapidly with a total revenue of $156.7M in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020 compared to $91.6M in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019 representing a year-over-year growth of 71%. Over the same period, the subscription revenue grew to $135.4M from $77.5M representing a 75% increase.\n\nC3 has high total contract values for software subscriptions. The average total subscription contract values were:\n\n* 2016: $1.2M\n* 2017: $11.7M\n* 2018: $10.8M\n* 2019: $16.2M\n* 2020: $12.1M\n\n**BULL ARGUMENT**\n\nC3 has a first-mover advantage in Enterprise AI due to investment into their products and technology over the last decade. They have \u201cLighthouse Customers\u201d, or large global early adopters, in Europe, Asia, and the United States across a range of industries that serve as proof points for other potential customers. Some customers include:\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6v6m5kedew471.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e44125b37976abacc041856b3b4fda5e7608a95)\n\nThere is an extensive partner ecosystem that includes strategic relationships with established technology leaders like:\n\n* [Amazon Web Services](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181010005314/en/C3-and-Amazon-Web-Services-Expand-Collaboration-to-Drive-Enterprise-Artificial-Intelligence-Adoption)\n* Fidelity National Information Services\n* [Google](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180821005202/en/C3-IoT-and-Google-Cloud-Announce-Partnership)\n* [IBM](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-02-27/correcting-and-replacing-ibm-services-and-c3-ai-announce-strategic-alliance-for-digital-transformation-with-ai)\n* [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/09/microsoft-sees-gain-on-c3ai-investment-concurrent-with-ipo.html)\n\nAlthough the average total subscription value is decreasing and may continue to decrease, C3 has restructured the sales organization and expanded the market-partner ecosystem to address small, medium, and large sales opportunities. The progress is promising as the average total subscription contract value for six months ended October 31, 2020 was $7.7M.\n\nOn February 1, 2021, the [launch of the Open AI Energy Initiative](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-c3-ai-baker-hughes-220000073.html) was announced by Shell, C3, Baker Hughes, and Microsoft. The initiative provides a framework for energy operators, service providers, equipment providers, and independent software vendors for energy services to offer interoperable solutions powered by the [BHC3 AI Suite](https://bakerhughesc3.ai/bhc3-ai-suite/model-driven-architecture/) and Microsoft Azure.\n\n**BEAR ARGUMENT**\n\nC3 faces intense competition and which could be an \u201cearly bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese\u201d type of situation as second movers could develop technology to improve upon any shortfalls. The main sources of potential competition include:\n\n* Greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and larger customer bases\n* Larger sales and marketing budgets and resources, and the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing across a broader portfolio\n* Wider geographic presence\n* Lower labor and research and development costs\n* Larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios\n* Greater financial, technical, and other resources to provide support, make acquisitions, hire talent, and to develop and introduce new products\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Tom Siebel has received many [honors and awards](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181112005818/en/EY-Honors-Thomas-M.-Siebel-as-2018-Entrepreneur-Of-The-Year%C2%AE), but if he, or other senior management team members, were to leave the company C3 may not be able to execute their business strategy. Siebel is critical to the overall management and continued development of the AI suite and AI Applications. All of the executive officers are at-will employees and they do not maintain any key person life insurance policies.\n\nC3 has a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future. The sales cycles can be long and unpredictable and the sales efforts require considerable time and expense. This is due to investing into sales to large organizations that typically undertake a significant evaluation and negotiation process due to their leverage, size, organization structure, and approval requirements. A limited number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of C3\u2019s revenue. The top three entities together accounted for 34% and 44% of the revenue for years ended April 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The same entities have been with C3 for an average of 3.3 years.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nGiven the success of C3\u2019s customers, I feel it will increase penetration of their existing customer base. They are primed to expand the major account sales organization to focus on large enterprise software agreements. Additionally, C3 will continue to develop high volume distribution channels to address the needs of small and medium businesses. I think they will continue to bring new product families to market that will develop into substantial recurring revenue streams. The total addressable market is rapidly growing and estimated to grow to $271B in 2024, a 12% CAGR from 2020's estimate of $174B.  This is a big opportunity for C3.  The lock up period [ended on June 7, 2021](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/ipos/overview?dealId=907559-94759), and earnings happened on June 2, 2021. I believe everyone who wanted to sell has sold at this point. I am bullish and think C3 has great potential for a swing trade, but more so a long-term investment. \n\n*I am not a financial advisor.

        "selftext": "According to Reuters, the price to sales ratio of AMC is now 47.8.\n\nThe book \"What Works on Wallstreet\" analyzed 40 years of stock market data.  It determined that a price to sales of 1.5 is considered a good deal.  It also determined this was the most important ratio to use in valuing a stock.\n\nI disclose I am short 120 shares of AMC, starting two days ago.\n\n2019 their sales were 5.47 billion.  Now they are 1.24 billion\n\n(1.24/5.47) x 47.8 = 10.84\n\nSo when things return to normal and their sales go back to normal, the price to sales would be 10.84  assuming the stock stayed flat.\n\nThis 10.84 is a high level.  This level of high price to sales is where Microsoft lives; at 12.1 currently.\n\nAs fascinating as it is that this movie theater company has been able to raise a great amount of cash through the Reddit craze, AMC is no Microsoft.",

        "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone!\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nJust a little background information about myself. I\u2019ve been investing in the stock market for a little over a year now and have been fortunate enough to build my portfolio into a sizable amount. I\u2019m currently 22 years old and an L5 Area Manager at Amazon, where I\u2019ve been employed for close to 4 years now.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nUpon accepting my Manager position I was informed I\u2019d be given 15 Shares of Amazon. That equates to roughly $45,000 from the initial offer on top of yearly performance reviews that are conducted in April, depending on tenure, valuableness to the team and a few other factors you may be eligible for more shares.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe shares become available after a certain time period or better known as the vest dates. So at this rate I will have all 15 shares released to me by November of 2023. However as stated earlier I will most likely receive more due to promotions and performance reviews so I will always have some shares waiting for me.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nMy question for you, the Reddit Community, what exactly would you all do if these were your shares. I\u2019ve developed a few idea scenarios that I will list below, but I\u2019d love to hear what everyone\u2019s take would be if they were in the same situation as I am in.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pull out all AMZN shares and re-invest them into Dividend Stocks?\n\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My portfolio is based around dividend paying companies because I want to be able to retire early and enjoy my life and in my opinion the best form of passive income.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pull out all AMZN shares and re-invest them into growth companies?\n\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I own a hefty amount of value in TSLA, AAPL &amp; MSFT so I really wouldn\u2019t have a problem with re-investing these stocks or something in similar value. Considering each share of Amazon can purchase a lot of value in each company.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pull out all AMZN shares and throw them into real estate?\n\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve recently taken a liking into the real estate market, aside from the real estate market being at all-time high, I wouldn\u2019t plan on owning real estate until a couple of years down the road when I\u2019m able to pull out more Amazon shares.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hold all shares of Amazon for life?\n\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I often here my friends tell me that Amazon is and will continue to be the most dominate company in history and to a degree I understand. After working here for 4 years, 3 years in management, I can confidentially say Amazon is just beginning to grow and will continue to dominate the e-commerce industry for decades to come despite all anti-trust lawsuits.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAgain, I\u2019d love to hear what you all think of this situation and maybe if anyone has ever been in a similar predicament. I appreciate all feedback and hope you all have a great day!",

        "selftext": "At a minimum, NOK should be at par with ERIC on Price/Sales which ERIC maintains 1.56X vs. NOK at 1.16 at today's close. At 1.56X, NOK would be trading at $7.20.\n\nAdditionally, Q2 earnings will be another eye opener for investors and a big reason firms like GS came out pre-earnings with a price target increase. From a revenue perspective, I expect NOK will perform at the high end of guidance at 5.3B to 5.5B EUR compared to 5.1B EUR reported in Q2 2020. But the big news will be in profit, EPS, and Free Cash Flow due to better than expected performance in their Mobile Networks division (increased margins) and Nokia Technologies (License revenue at almost 80% margins). Remember that Nokia signed a licensing agreement with Lenovo that was backdated to 2018 so that backlog of revenue will be recorded in Q2. (Not to mention the Samsung agreement &amp; the Ericsson settlement)\n\nIn the end, NOK should earn a valuation of 2X to 3X annual revenue which would value the share price in a range of $9.50 to $14.50 based on $27B in annual revenue &amp; 5.6B shares outstanding. CSCO trades at 4.6X and MSFT trades at 12.81X annual revenue so 2X to 3X for NOK is still conservative and will grow as margins and EPS continue to expand.",

With a catalyst, In one shot we could easily go up 40-100%+!!**\n\nLet's jump into it:\n\nWhat happened today reminds of what happened in Mid-May when Ark exited their $SPCE position. The short interest of shares outstanding was \\~16%. After Ark completely exited their position, the **stock went up 6.36% the next day and the second market day it was 35.74% up!** The second jump was mainly due to the catalyst news of an upcoming test flight and it jumped. After the success of the flight, **the stock is now 150% up from Mid-May.**\n\n[ARK SPCE position and their final holding date was MAY 20](https://preview.redd.it/edu3cfp6y3471.png?width=1703&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89dbb99659e446b2c5088829155b4e24c64790c1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[How SPCE is doing after the ARK Exit illustrated with Crayons](https://preview.redd.it/nz4ezpmny3471.jpg?width=676&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b27a5c3ccc16d5c06516bcd93f5aec8d9d4e0718)\n\nNow for Huya, Ark is almost completely done of their sell off. Yesterday, 877,347 shares were sold and **what's left in their portfolio is \\~151K shares from a peak of 6.8 million shares!!** \n\n[ARK HUYA position with 151K shares left...](https://preview.redd.it/n54eltowy3471.png?width=1664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47faba3532ce87dc3e48b601cd02179d290435e1)\n\nAs I mentioned in Part 1, $HUYA is criminally undervalued and it's primed for a moon launch with the upcoming catalyst news of the Merger. If the CCP doesn't fuck us and the merger goes through, there would virtually be no competitors to $HUYA in the streaming world!!

You will find that playing AMC options is not a great way to make money. The way you go around this is by playing correlated stocks. If you trade spy, you know that as an index, it moves with the market, especially tech, as it comprises 30% or higher of the index. What you might not know is that stocks are also correlated to other similar stocks. For example, if you trade tech, you will find that FB leads the way for alot of the tech stock. The highestcorrelation is FB to MSFT. MSFT will literally mirror FB by a nano second. Stocks such as SNAP and TWTR will also follow FB, but its not as strongly correlated to FB, but is more informed by the moves of FB. I tried out a theory that meme stocks can also be correlated. I took the most recent hype train stocks for my play over AMC. I traded MVIS, SPCE to prove out my theory and also checked other meme stocks such as expr, nok, bb, etc. They all played out similar to amc, however with much lower gains. If your wondering why i choose mvis and spce over the others. Its due to how much air space they had over the others and also the amount of price movement in dollar amounts and not % amounts.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, June 28, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed today, with the Dow Jones (DIA) underperforming while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and the Nasdaq (QQQ) kept pushing higher, with each recording new intraday highs, encouraged by the Fed\u2019s outlook that interest rates won\u2019t be raised until 2023. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell, hovering near 1.48%, an encouraging sign for equities. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for the June Jobs Report, set to be released this Friday. Consensus economists are looking for payroll gains to accelerate to 700,000 in June with an unemployment rate down slightly to 5.7%, with these metrics improving against May's payroll gains of 559,000 and jobless rate of 5.8%. \n\nLast week, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. \n\nGabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, \u201cThe way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme.\" \n\nMoreover, the Federal Reserve released the results of its \u201cstress test\u201d on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical \u201cseverely adverse\u201d scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.\n\nThe results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs.\n\nLooking ahead, market participants are gearing up for Q2 earnings season, which is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data \u2013 an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be \"need to be revised higher.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Facebook (FB) stock surged after a judge dismissed federal antitrust lawsuits and most of the ones filed by individual states. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington granted the social-media giant's requests to dismiss lawsuits filed by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general in December.\n* Walt Disney Co's cruise division said on Monday it is postponing its first test cruise from a U.S. port after a few volunteers showed \"inconsistent\" test results for COVID-19.\n* JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. said it has taken a 40% ownership stake in C6 Bank, a full-service Brazilian digital bank. Terms of the transaction were not publicly disclosed, as far as I can see. \n* \\- United Airlines was putting the finishing touches on Monday to an airplane order potentially worth $30 billion at list values for up to 270 narrowbody jets in a bid to secure a pandemic recovery at favorable prices, industry sources said. The order could include up to 200 Boeing 737 MAX and some 70 Airbus A321neo.\n* LegalZoom, a legal services software compan, has filed with US authorities with the intent to IPO\n* Popular donut-maker, Krispy Kreme has also filed with US authorities with the intent to IPO soon.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written pre-market and does not reflect intraday changes\\*\\***\n* Accenture (ACN) target raised by Barclays from $310 to $335 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, June 22, 2021**\n\nThe stock market rose again today, driven by a continued rally in tech stocks and tempered inflationary fears. The Nasdaq (QQQ) reached a fresh record high for the second time this week and the Dow Jones (DIA) continues to recover following its worst week since October 2020. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.54% higher and is two points away from its record high. With earnings for Q2 fast approaching, market participants are gearing up for what is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data \u2013 an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be \"need to be revised higher.\" \n\nToday, in a meeting with the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell once again reiterated that interest rates will not be raised on inflation fears alone and sees current pressures as transitory. Powell said, \u201cWe will not raise interest rates preemptively because we fear the possible onset of inflation. We will wait for evidence of actual inflation or other imbalances.\u201d He went on to further say recent price increases \u201cdon\u2019t speak to a broadly tight economy that would require higher interest rates\u201d but come from factors \u201cdirectly affected by the reopening\u201d. Powell then went on to further reiterate the Central Bank is keeping a close eye on a \u201cbroad set of labor market statistics\u201d before any adjustment to the current policy is considered. He said \u201cWe will not just look at the headline numbers for unemployment. We will look at all kinds of measures\u2026. That is the most important thing we can do to ensure the benefits of the recovery are more fully shared\u201d. \n\nAs expected, response by lawmakers to Powell\u2019s testimony, no surprise, split squarely down partisan lines, with Democrats focusing on labor market imbalances and unemployment and Republicans focusing on concerns surrounding inflation. I do not place much, if any, weight on what was said by lawmakers, just interested in what Powell had to say. \n\nOn Thursday, the Fed is set to release the results of its \u201cstress test\u201d on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge.\n\nLater this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting \"base effects\" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the boar\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Twitter (TWTR) is moving forward with plans to increase monetization opportunities. The company said it is opening applications for users who want to test new features - Super Follows and Ticketed Space. \"Super Follows,\" which will let them sell exclusive content to paying subscribers, and \"Ticketed Spaces,\" to charge for entry into audio chat rooms they host on the platform. Users must have at least 10,000 followers on Twitter to be eligible to apply for Super Follows, and at least 1,000 followers to apply for first access to Ticketed Spaces. \n* Facebook (FB) is expanding its 'Shops' feature to messaging app WhatsApp and to Facebook Marketplace.\n* Fortnite\" creator Epic Games, which is entrenched in a legal battle with Apple Inc, said on Tuesday it now has more than 500 million accounts. The company is private but is expected to be worth roughly $30 billion. \n* Microsoft (MSFT) is about to hit a huge milestone to become the second company, after Apple (AAPL) to reach the $2 trillion market cap milestone. The company's market cap has risen by about $960 billion from a March 2020 low, a figure greater than Facebook's market value, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n* Volkswagen AG's ID series - the backbone of its electric vehicle ambitions - is off to what even company sources call a worryingly slow start in China.\n* **\\*\\*Please note current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* DoorDash (DASH) price target raised by Needham &amp; Co from $175 to $195 at Buy.

Oscar adds a fun twist to this winning formula by using technology to deny insurance requests faster and more frequently than traditional companies, which require actual human representatives to decide whether deaf children are allowed to have hearing aids.\n\nFounded in 2012 by current CEO Mario Schlosser, Kevin Nazemi, and Josh Kushner (brother of sentient wax doll Jared Kushner), Oscar Health provides health insurance with a particular technological emphasis. Unlike other providers in the space, OSCR cuts costs by emphasizing telemedicine, automated referrals, and remote prescriptions \\[1,2\\].\n\nOSCR IPO\u2019d at $39 in March, and almost immediately plummeted to the mid-20\u2019s, where it\u2019s been fluctuating ever since. OSCR\u2019s IPO went so poorly that at least one law firm is considering a class-action suit for securities fraud on behalf of investors \\[3\\].\n\n## Signs of life\n\nLike many early-stage companies entering an entrenched industry, Oscar initially burned money faster than a secret service agent at a luxury golf course: in 2016 the company lost $204.9\u00a0million, while in 2017 the company lost $83 million. However, as the company has expanded its subscriber base and adjusted its risk calculations, it has begun to turn around: in 2018, OSCR posted profits of $1 billion from 400,000 subscribers, and in 2021 it is expected to bring in $2 billion \\[4\\].\n\nMoreover, OSCR has relatively little competition in its space. Similar startups like Collective Health and WSB\u2019s sweaty dakimakura Clover Health have substantially fewer subscribers and have struggled to turn a profit \\[5\\]. Meanwhile, larger players in the insurance industry like Anthem are full of polo-shirt thumb-typers, leading to mishaps when they have tried to integrate new technology into their existing offerings \\[6\\].\n\nMoreover, OSCR has a reputation for poaching top tech talent from companies like Microsoft and Amazon, and Google has even invested in the company.\n\nI am bullish because OSCR has several unique advantages over comparable companies:\n\n## The Bone Saw Gambit\n\nIn 2021, companies throughout the world are reckoning with the ethical implications of taking on unscrupulous investment partners. From severing ties to the Chinese government, to removing board members with histories of harassment, corporations worldwide are defining a new approach to vetting investors that will likely restructure the nature of the venture capital space for years to come.\n\nBut not Oscar Health. These chads and chadtoinettes will take money from anyone who offers them a nickel and half-kilo of Paradise White. Just last year, OSCR closed a $165 million financing round shortly after co-founder Josh Kushner and Jared Kushner visited Saudi Arabia and met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, everyone\u2019s favorite journalist-murdering oligarch \\[7\\].\n\n## Daddy\u2019s Money\n\nThe renowned Chicago school of economics is a neoclassical school of economic thought based on post-Keynesian monetary theory. Over the decades, one guiding axiomatic principle has emerged from this storied institution:\n\nRICH. KIDS. CAN\u2019T. FAIL.\n\nDue to co-founder Josh Kushner\u2019s involvement, OSCR has its own insurance policy I the form of being intimately intertwined with the Kushner family. Patriarch Charles Kushner alone has an estimated net worth of \\~$2 billion, giving him plenty of runway to bail out his son as needed:\n\n* Earnings underwater because we blew all our VC money on coke and legal settlements?Emergency cash injection from Papa.\n* Our machine learning algorithm stopped running because our Office 365 free trial expired?Bailout from El Padre.\n* Service outages due to buildup of a strange powder in our server\u2019s ventilation ports?Thanks for your credit card info, Mr. K.\n\nDaddy Kush will stake anything and everything to make sure that little Josh\u2019s lemonade stand makes it. Ten years from now when OSCR hits $1600, we can all watch Josh\u2019s TedX Talk on becoming a self-made billionaire.\n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/100215/how-does-oscar-work-and-make-money.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/100215/how-does-oscar-work-and-make-money.asp) \\[2\\] [https://www.hioscar.com/about](https://www.hioscar.com/about) \\[3\\] [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oscar-health-inc-investors-company-165300828.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oscar-health-inc-investors-company-165300828.html) \\[4\\] [https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/oscar-health-now-has-400000-members-and-expects-to-bring-in-2-billion-by-the-end-of-2020/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/oscar-health-now-has-400000-members-and-expects-to-bring-in-2-billion-by-the-end-of-2020/) \\[5\\] [https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/03/01/2184695/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/03/01/2184695/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results.html) \\[6\\] [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/health/covid-telemedicine-congress.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/health/covid-telemedicine-congress.html) \\[7\\] [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/world/middleeast/kushner-saudi-arabia.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/world/middleeast/kushner-saudi-arabia.html)\n\n**Note:**\u00a0The above theory represents my own personal opinion and does not constitute financial advice in any way.\n\n**Price Target:** $300\n\n**Positions:** 2000 shares at $25.24",

        "selftext": "Back to Basics - New Apes &amp; Old - Why the hedgefunds didn't actually spend $500MM in cash yesterday, and how to connect the dots.\n\nLook apes. Honestly, the \"DD\" getting shoved around this sub is getting worse.\n\nA week or two ago, everyone here was up in arms about naked shorts. Rightfully so. It's an illegal practice (to add to the laundry list of actual illegal shit being done by hedgies with AMC, GME, and without a doubt many other stocks).\n\nBut clearly those crayons you apes ate last week and the week before didn't put even a single wrinkle on the brains of many of you, because now I see \"tHeY sPeNt FiVe HuNdReD MiLLiOn yEsTeRdAY\" running through this sub. To say nothing of all the \"It's cost them XX BILLION DOLLARS ALREADY. QUIT WHILE YOU'RE BEHIND.\"\n\nNo. No they didn't. They cannot simultaneously naked short *and* have shares being bought in the same transaction. The two are inconsistent with each other. They also have ***unrealized losses***. They only have cash out of pocket when they cover.\n\nClearly, we need to get back to fundamentals in this sub. Whether it's new apes arriving, or old apes that never really got a handle on some of the more technical pieces of the situation, it's clear that people on this subreddit are failing to connect some critical dots.\n\n**Short Ladder Attacks (aka \"ladder attacks\")** Short ladder attacks are a method of high frequency trading between complicit parties at successively lower prices to rapidly lower the price of a stock. It is a form of market manipulation, and can land people in jail. Ladder attacks require precise timing, and essentially work like a game of ping pong where the ball is a few hundred shares of stock being bounced back and forth at incrementally lower prices.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nBy continually lowering the price by small amounts, in rapid succession, it creates the appearance of downward price pressure. It creates a sentiment that the value of the stock is declining based on market movement when it is, in fact, based on manipulation. This is why you'll see large run ups in price followed by sharp downturns in the price on very low volume.\n\nFor example, here's a chunk of AMC trading prices and volumes:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Upward volume to lower volume - night and day difference](https://preview.redd.it/gsxpp6d6dt671.jpg?width=665&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45a458ef65ca7a81bdf4bedebb0c06034b35dd6f)\n\nThe curves are very rough MS Paint curves, and someone that knows calculus far better than I do could actually do an area calculation for the area beneath them that would be the total volume.\n\nNote that the volume to get price *up* is drastically larger than the volume to force price *down*. That looks like a hallmark ladder attack to me.\n\n**Naked Shorting and synthetic shares**\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp)\n\n&gt;Naked shorting is the illegal practice of short selling shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist. Ordinarily, traders must borrow a stock or determine that it can be borrowed before they sell it short. So naked shorting refers to short pressure on a stock that may be larger than the tradable shares in the market.\n\nNaked short *does not require them to spend any money.* It does not require shares to exist. It does not cost them anything. They're literally selling something they didn't buy in the first place. *This is where the concept of* ***synthetic shares*** *comes from.* It is illegal post-2008, and amounts to securities fraud, *as it should.*\n\n**Dark Pools**\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp)\n\n&gt;Dark pools are private exchanges for trading securities that are not accessible by the investing public. Also known as \u201cdark pools of liquidity,\u201d the name of these exchanges\u00a0is a reference to their complete lack of transparency. Dark pools came about primarily to facilitate block trading by institutional investors who did not wish to impact the markets with their large orders and obtain adverse prices for their trades.\n\nDark pools aren't illegal, though they facilitate it occurring with lower likelihood of getting caught/reprimanded/fined. They've been around since the 1980s, and were theorized to be something that reduced volatility for stocks where large purchases or selloffs were going to occur from institutional investors. So, say, a mutual fund was going change their mix of stocks/bonds in a given fund, they may be changing that mix for tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of individuals that aggregated up to millions of shares. A lot of 401k plans, for instance, are heavily into an array of different mutual funds, and the last thing many of those funds want to do is cause massive upward or downward movement on what are intended to be relatively stable, low volatility products. People really don't like seeing big swings in their retirement funds. They like to see them grow, they don't like to see them dip.\n\nSo, dark pools aren't--in and of themselves--nefarious places for predatory behavior. They make a certain amount of sense situationally, and could, in fact, be utilized to keep little old ladies' retirement funds from seeing huge downward swings just because the fund wants to rebalance its mix.\n\n*However*, dark pools can be used to muddy the waters in high volume or high volatility situations to present pressure for only one side of a transaction. Want the price to go up, but a lot of people want to sell? *Route the sell traffic through the dark pool but the buy pressure through the normal exchange.* Want the price to go down, but a lot of people are wanting to buy? *Route the buy pressure through the dark pool, and the sell pressure through the normal exchanges.*\n\n**Mark to market financial reporting (unrealized gains/losses versus realized gains/losses)**\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marktomarket.asp#:\\~:text=Mark%20to%20market%20(MTM)%20is,based%20on%20current%20market%20conditions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marktomarket.asp#:~:text=Mark%20to%20market%20(MTM)%20is,based%20on%20current%20market%20conditions)\n\n&gt;Mark to market is an accounting practice that involves adjusting the value of an asset to reflect its value as determined by current market conditions. The market value is determined based on what a company would get for the asset if it was sold at that point in time. At the end of the fiscal year, a company's balance sheet must reflect the current market value of certain accounts. Other accounts will maintain their historical cost, which is the original purchase price of an asset.\n\nThese rules were implemented in late 2007 (wonder if that timeline rings any bells). As an accountant, I have dealt with these issues directly for clients and employers, and it presents serious challenges to communicate what is going on to the uninitiated seeing the wild swings to income and the balance sheet for the first time.\n\nNormally, anything on a company's balance sheet (assets, liabilities, equity and retained earnings) are always listed at historical cost. That is, what did you pay at the point in time you bought it. When a company, like say I don't know a hedge fund, owns stocks and bonds, those were generally listed for what was paid at time of purchase. Bought 200 shares of Microsoft in the 1994 for $2.50 a share? Well, you have $500 as an asset on your balance sheet for as long as you hold them.\n\nThose are worth $262 a share today. If we sold those, we'd have massive **realized** **gains**! That is, gains realized at the time of sale.\n\nBut what if we think the price will keep going up, and we want to hodl? We don't have any gains, but those shares are worth *way more* than they were when we bought them! How do we convince a bank to lend us money, or shareholders to invest in our enterprise, if we can't show what are assets are *really worth today*?\n\nWell, say hello to **mark-to-market accounting**. Every month, quarter, and year, you get a statement from your broker. And that statement tells you what those stocks are worth. So after 2007, those have to be shown at \"market value\" as of that period end date. And because accounting has two sides to every transaction, when you increase the value of an asset, there's an offset.\n\nEnter the idea of **unrealized gains/losses**. So, if we bought at $2.50 and the price is $262, then we have an unrealized gain of \\~$260 per share. Over two hundred shares, we have almost $52k of unrealized gains. This is shown on the income statement under a category with the nice, nebulous and opaque title of \"Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\". What they should really name this section of the income statement is \"bullshit our business doesn't actively do to generate profit, but it happened along the way.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So let's start connecting some dots in the context of this week and the last couple.**\n\n1. Naked shorting creates \"synthetic shares\" by selling something that doesn't exist in the first place.\n2. If they're constantly and habitually naked shorting AMC and other stocks, *they're not buying the shares they're selling*.\n3. Understanding #2, then *they are not spending anything out of pocket*. There is no $500MM spent. There is no massive cash outlay. Just massive fraud.\n4. Trade volumes being used in ladder attacks don't require many shares to accomplish relative to the volume required to increase the stock organically.\n5. Dark pools can be used to manipulate stock in conjunction with ladder attacks by keeping buying pressure out of the normal exchanges.\n6. The combination of 1-5 is keeping the price on AMC artificially low\n7. Shorts have not begun to cover\n8. Squeeze hasn't even begun, and we're up several hundred percent in the last six weeks\n\n**Conclusion: the hedge funds, having not begun to cover, and continuing to issue naked shorts are not actually bleeding cash. Naked shorting requires no outlay of cash to purchase something. They are selling something that does not exist in the first place.**\n\n**EDIT:** Because everybody wants to be the \"ackhually &lt;edge case scenario&gt;\" guy in the comments, yes they can issue legitimate shorts as well as naked shorts. Yes they can actually buy and sell stocks. That's not the point of this post.\n\nThe point of this post is to point out that the prevailing sentiment of \"apes own the float\" coupled with the massive belief in unmitigated naked shorting \"Naked shorts yeah\", and the constant pushing of \"They've already lost billions \\[despite not covering\\]\" are all rationally and logically inconsistent with each other to the point they cannot occur simultaneously.\n\n**Apes either own sufficient percentage of the float to prevent significant covering OR there is not a massive amount of naked shorting of synthetic shares OR the hedge funds have actually covered, costing them XX billions of dollars to date. Having all three situations occur simultaneously isn't objectively possible.**  \n\n\n**EDIT 2: QUITE A FEW APES HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THE HEDGIES ARE PAYING INCREMENTAL INTEREST ON THE BORROWED SHARES, AND THAT THERE ARE COSTS FOR FTDs.**   \nThank you for pointing that out. You're correct. There absolutely are borrowing costs associated with this. Personal opinion is that they're nowhere near $500MM in a single day, and this post was targeted at that number and statements made around it.   \n\n\n&lt;Note that all of the above is my personal interpretation of events, and opinion supported by my understanding of fundamental accounting, financial reporting, and minimal skill in stock analysis. None of it should be construed as financial advice, and is intended for educational purposes only.&gt;",

        "selftext": "GUANGZHOU, China \u2014 Alibaba has launched a slew of new cloud computing products as the Chinese e-commerce giant looks to expand across Asia.\n\nCloud computing is seen as a key profit driver for Alibaba over the long term and in the past few years, it has been boosting its presence aggressively outside of China.\n\nOn Tuesday, Alibaba announced plans to open a new data center in the Philippines by the end of the year and launched a third data center in Indonesia. Expanding data centers allows cloud providers to boost their capacity in certain countries or regions.\n\nAlibaba also launched a cloud-based livestreaming product designed for online shopping. It will allow e-commerce players to launch a live stream shopping feature on their websites or apps that are hosted on Alibaba\u2019s cloud.\n\nLivestream shopping usually involves a host talking about products that customers can buy directly via the live broadcast. It has become very popular in China and is growing in other parts of Asia.\n\nThe Chinese e-commerce firm hopes that such a product can help it stand out from U.S. rivals including Microsoft and Amazon in the cloud market.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, Alibaba was the biggest public cloud market vendor at the end of 2020 with a 19.2% share, according to IDC, boosted by success in China. Amazon was second with a 10.5% share.\n\nHowever, in the global market, Alibaba still trails Microsoft, Amazon and Google.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s cloud announcements come after it reported its first net loss as a public company in the January to March quarter. The company was hit with a massive $2.8 billion fine\u00a0as a result of an anti-monopoly investigation by Chinese authorities.\n\nMaggie Wu, Alibaba\u2019s CFO, said the company would invest \u201cincremental profits and additional capital\u201d in \u201cnew businesses and key strategic areas\u201d in its current fiscal year.\n\nIn China, Alibaba faces growing competition from other technology giants including Huawei and Tencent which more recently have stepped up their cloud computing investments.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/08/alibaba-cloud-expands-products-with-livestream-shopping-data-centers.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/08/alibaba-cloud-expands-products-with-livestream-shopping-data-centers.html)",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, June 24, 2021**\n\nThe market edged higher once again, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) driven higher by an incredible rally in technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA), which suffered its worst performance since October 2020 last week continued to recover, pushed higher by a rally in bank and industrial stocks. \u201cReopening stocks\u201d like cruise lines, hotels, and airlines continue to underperform the market, pressured by the rotation back to growth and concerns that inflation will drive prices in this sector higher. \n\nAfter driving the market higher in the beginning of the year, the last two or so months have seen the market firmly rotate from value and cyclical stocks back to growth and technology stocks due to recent inflationary numbers and labor market disruption that threaten to drive prices for services in this sector higher. However, as I have said previously, while I acknowledge the risk, I am not yet concerned that current inflation will become a persistent threat, at least in the near-term. While that may change and I advise people to be ready in case the Fed is forced to tighten rates sooner-than-expected, I expect value and cyclicals to continue recovering as the US economy continues to reopen. With the stock market\u2019s great performance in the last 12-14 months and government coronavirus stimulus, I expect savings-laden consumers to spend big this summer after being cooped up indoors for so long. \n\nKeith Lerner, Portfolio and Market Strategist at Truist Securities said, \u201cThe value trade is still intact. It got overcrowded, it got over-loved ... but when we look at the fundamental drivers behind that trade, they're still intact. So the first thing is, context. Yes, they had a big run this year, but they've trailed for about 14 years, so we've had a long underperformance cycle,\" he added. \"And the second part is, why did they underperform for so long is because we had really slow economic growth. And this year and next we expect above-trend economic growth. And the earnings momentum and the earnings leverage for these areas is still positive.\" \n\nLater today, the Fed is set to release the results of its \u201cstress test\u201d on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. **If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge if it happens.** \n\nOn Friday, Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting \"base effects\" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* **As I was finishing the recap the news is out, the Fed is ending pandemic-era restriction on banks in stock buybacks and dividend increases. This is great news for banks.** More information here [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html)\n* After being under pressure in recent months, shares of Tesla (TSLA) have begun rallying again, with the stock up more than 10% this week alone. \n* Today, Microsoft will unveil the long-awaited sequel to Windows 10. Windows 11, the product's first new version in almost six years, includes only limited changes to its visual design, but it seeks to reposition the operating system as a hub in a computing universe incorporating rival companies' platforms, including Android mobile software developed by Google and a digital storefront developed by Amazon (AMZN).[ Read more here ](https://www.cnet.com/news/microsofts-windows-11-reveal-event-every-upgrade-announced/)\n* The House Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday to approve the final piece of its six-part package, the \"Ending Platform Monopolies Act,\" which restricts big tech companies' ability to leverage their platform dominance to promote other lines of business and disadvantage competitors. The vote on the bill was 21-20. The bill will now move on to the House floor and, if passed there, the Senate. The bill is newsworthy but pretty much doomed to fail.\n* Snapchat (SNAP) users globally will get access to Universal Music Group's library of recorded music and content for their own content-making on the social media platform, the companies said Thursday. This move comes as US social media companies across the board continue to implement more \u201cTikTok-like\u201d features. To show just how much TikTok has grown, parent company ByteDancehas a market cap of roughly $250 billion, almost $100 billion more than Snap and Twitter (TWTR) combined. \n* **Cathie Wood** and Twitter and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey have been named as co-hosts of \u201cThe \u20bf Word,\u201d a new initiative designed to bring business and technology leaders together to discuss how institutions can use digital currencies. \n* **\\*\\*Please note current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $161 to $162 at Overweight.

In hours, Biden Admins have already removed the FHFA director.\n\n**Quick history:**\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been in government conservatorship since the 2008 housing crash.

In 2019, Fannie and Freddie were finally allowed to retain their capital to the tune of billions.

        "selftext": "First off this is not financial advice; just my personal opinion on a recent IPO that has a lot of room to run. ZIPRecruiter (ZIP) is undervalued and in the sweet spot of a massive secular trend; my DD has me convinced that this stock could break out.\n \nFirst off, it\u2019s important to realize that pretty much every employed person in America is considering a job change now that the pandemic is easing up. For the past year and a half, people have stuck it out in terrible jobs mostly because they were happy to have stable employment at the time, and also nobody was hiring. Now that the economy is taking off and companies are trying to hire again, most workers are going to test the waters. Recent estimates from Microsoft are that 40% of US employees will switch companies this year, and other surveys found that at least 26% of workers leave their companies will find new work. Experts are calling it the \u201cGreat Resignation of 2021\u201d. The numbers are impossible to predict, but just think about all the people in your own friend groups that have been complaining about their jobs for months and are trying to make a change.\nhttps://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-great-resignation-of-2021-are-30-of-workers-really-going-to-quit/ \n \nSo if you agree that the labor markets are unfrozen and people will be taking advantage of it, how can you make money off it? Look at the software companies that will power/enable this big trend. Staffing / recruiting companies that offer this as a service will benefit, but they don\u2019t scale well. If Manpower Group or Kelley Services has an extra 10 job applicants, they may need to hire an extra recruiter (costs go up as revenues go up). With software platforms, the new job applicants add volume with no incremental costs. \n\nThe biggest recruiting tool of all is LinkedIn, but that\u2019s owned by MSFT and is just a sideshow to their main business. Other large software players in the HR Tech space have recruiting tools, such as GOOG, SAP, WDAY, ADP, CDAY, etc \u2013 but again the recruiting platform is on the periphery of what they do... so not a core competency of any big players. Besides these guys, the market is fragmented. There are thousands of job boards, recruiting firms, talent agencies and staffing companies that will help match applicants to companies, but there is only one standalone software company that focuses on recruiting that is publicly traded: ZIP.\nhttps://ideal.com/top-recruiting-software/\n \nHow does ZIP make money and why do they stand out? The platform is free for individual people to look for jobs, but companies will sign up for recurring accounts where they create jobs and post them into the platform. ZIP is a job aggregator, meaning it takes the job posting and replicates this on thousands of job boards across the world, and then brings back quality candidates to the companies. For employees, it will match you with dozens of roles based on what you are looking for. And because most jobs are virtual/remote now, this software opens up new roles and opportunities that previously a person wouldn\u2019t have considered.\n \nNow here\u2019s where it really gets interesting. ZIP went public a few weeks through a direct listing, with no fanfare or hype. Unless you really follow the HR software IPO market, you wouldn\u2019t even know that this happened. Shares currently trade around $24 and the company has a market cap of $2.5B.\n\nZIP has an EV/Rev ratio of ~9x, which is under the big players above: MSFT = 10x, CDAY = 14x, WDAY = 11x, etc\u2026 meaning it\u2019s cheaper to buy a share of ZIP than a fully diversified software company that has products in multiple categories. If recruiting is going to grow gangbusters this year as the economy rebounds, how come ZIP is trading at a discount to larger companies that have smaller expected growth rates?\n \nI\u2019m not a professional stock picker, so this is just my speculation, but I think there are 4 reasons why ZIP isn\u2019t getting any love (yet)\n\n1. They are too small. $2.5B market cap is a rounding error to a company like MSFT, GOOG, or WDAY.\n2. In 2020, ZIP had a negative growth year (2019 revenues of $430M went down (3%) in 2020 to $418M). Professional investors don\u2019t like that, especially when every other software company went gangbusters in 2020. Well let\u2019s dig into that\u2026 why did ZIP\u2019s revenue decrease in 2020? BECAUSE NOBODY WAS LOOKING FOR JOBS AND COMPANIES WEREN\u2019T HIRING NEW PEOPLE. It was a pandemic and nobody was doing anything except watching netflix. \n3. The company had a Q1 earnings call in between filing the IPO paperwork but before the stock was trading. Management had a lot of great things to say (they basically argued that this is an unprecedented time in the recruiting market and they are well poised to capture it), but I honestly don\u2019t think anyone was paying attention\n4. On the earnings call, the management said that Q2 is going to be huge (80% growth when compared to Q2 2020) but then the second half of the year could ramp down if people stop switching jobs. Perhaps analysts didn\u2019t like that, but isn\u2019t that obvious? As long as the economy keeps picking up steam, ZIP is going to do well.\n \nTL/DR \u2013 ZIP is a stock worth taking a look at; I feel they will fly under the radar until Q2 earnings when they will explode. I\u2019m not a financial advisor, so do you your own research too. I LIKE THE STOCK!! I picked up 1200 shares last week.",

        "selftext": "Reviewing the Bear Case on Paysafe (PSFE)\n\nJP Morgan CEO, Jamie Dimon, recently noted that fintechs pose \"enormous competitive threats\" to banks and SF Federal Reserve board member, Jackie Reses, sees them \u201ctaking over and revolutionizing banking\u201d with \u201ca wholesale transition\u201d of \u201ca $16 trillion market cap\u201d.\n\nIn this context, fintech Paysafe (PSFE) is newly listed on the NYSE and introduced to the US market. Already well known in Europe, Paysafe reports a substantial $362 million in free cash flow, projects $100 billion in transactional volume, $1.5 billion in revenue, healthy double-digit growth and expanding $30%+ EBITDA margins, but, despite absolutely no negative news, the stock has taken a pounding which, in turn, has brought the bears out in force with some dubious arguments. Sorry for the long post, but I thought I'd address all of these arguments in one post:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCommon bear arguments:\n\n\\#1 Old business\n\n\\#2 Complex regulatory landscape / no moat\n\n\\#3 Growth by acquisition is risky and difficult\n\n\\#4 No growth\n\n\\#5 Slow growth\n\n\\#6 Not profitable\n\n\\#7 Too I much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more.\n\n\\#8 Blackstone made 3X and will sell\n\n\\#9 Founder share and warrant dilution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#1) Old business. \n\nPaysafe\u2019s extensive experience in risk management and its time-tested regulatory expertise over many regions globally is one of its greatest strengths. This is the reason that Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a rapidly moving space that is anticipated to grow 10X. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nMuch of Paysafe\u2019s business is in back-end payment processing so most don\u2019t even know they are using it, but Paysafe is considered to be at the forefront in its field: Winner \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d and they are rapidly expanding in the US with new partnerships (just last 3 months: Coinbase, Microsoft, Luckbox, Amelco, Pointsbet, Virginia Lotto)\n\nIn Europe, where Paysafe is more known and used, Trustpilot (1) rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) with over 25,000 reviews, and Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews.\n\nPaysafe has the No. 2 global digital wallet with presence in 120 countries. They\u2019ve just integrated their digital wallet platforms, Neteller and Skrill, recently voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nAside from Coinbase, Luckbox and Microsoft, they are partnered with Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, BetMGM, among many others. They are currently moving quickly to integrate their services to offer easier migration of eCash, integration of payment methods, cross-border payments and expansion into global banking as a service.\u00a0\n\nIn preparation for their plans, Paysafe's newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO, a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International, a legal and regulatory expert in the multi-jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries, two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone, two from CVC, the CEO of Dun &amp; Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight, and the Chairman of the Board of Fidelity.\n\nAs Chairman Bill Foley says, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab\u2026I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet\u2026 It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\" This doesn't sound like an old company resting on its laurels. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#2) Complex regulatory landscape / no moat. \n\nBill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now also Paysafe\u2019s Chairman of the Board, calls Paysafe,\u201ca fortress. It\u2019s got a moat\u2026 We have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise.\" Their regulatory acumen is the reason they currently dominate globally in sports betting/iGaming and are integrating their global platforms to expand into banking as a service. There are 1.7 billion \"unbanked\" because so many in the world who have mobile devices, still don't have access to the essential ID metrics that most banks and credit cards require to open accounts. Paysafe's risk management and cross boarder regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant to go. Leaning into this strength, they've brought on PayPal's former CRO and added a multi-jurisdictional regulatory expert to their Board of Directors\n\nFrom SEC filed transcript (2) - Paysafe CEO, Philip McHugh: \u201cTo be a true global player in the iGaming space, the level of payments regulation, of gaming regulation and certification is very, very complex. When we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be a winner in this space, you\u2019re catering to some incredibly demanding clients. They want to be global, they want multiple APMs, but they want you to understand payment regulation in hundreds of countries in gaming and gambling regulation in hundreds of countries. That\u2019s something that Paysafe has developed very, very successfully in every market we\u2019ve entered.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#3) Growth by acquisition is hard. \n\nSynergistic inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a key pillar of Paysafe\u2019s forward growth strategy. Bill Foley's proven track record in quickly generating this kind of growth speaks for itself. Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). Foley says, \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d (2, 4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#4) No growth. \n\nIt\u2019s true that Paysafe\u2019s revenue stagnated in 2020 resulting from business closures during Covid, but prior to that they reported a strong 27% CAGR (4,5), which is on par with high profile competitors:\n\n2017: $864 million rev\n\n2018 : $1.14 billion rev (+32%)\n\n2019 : $1.418 billion rev (+24%).\n\n2020 : $1.426 billion. (+0.5%)\n\nUnlike many fintechs, Paysafe has heavy exposure in brick-and-mortar retail and live sporting events, both of which were absolutely crushed in 2020 due to Covid. During this market dislocation, they pivoted, \u201cexited low value referral channels\u201d and made up revenue by expanding in the digital wallets and e-commmerce spaces, positioning themselves better going forward.\n\nLooking at other brick-and-mortar payment processors hard-hit during the same period, like Visa and Mastercard, Paysafe performed very well by comparison:\n\n\u2014Visa: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%)\n\n\u2014 Mastercard: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%)\n\nNot claiming that Paysafe should be valued according to these two traditional payment processors but, given their commensurate slow down during Covid, it is interesting to note that their their averaged EV/Revenue multiples would put Paysafe at $46, which is very much in line with the valuation comps cited below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#5) Slow growth. \n\nGoing forward, Paysafe conservatively projects $10-13% annual growth over the next two years but they are careful so say that those growth projections exclude M&amp;A plans and expansion in iGaming which is expected to grow at 55% CAGR over the next several years. iGaming accounts for over a third of Paysafe\u2019s revenue so this growth is a significant exclusion.\n\nAnalyst Michael Del Grosso, who recently initiated coverage with a $19 price target (6) said, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d\n\nIn the short time since he wrote that, here are some of the headlines signaling a price target upgrade:\n\n1 \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n\n2 \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n\n3 New Hampshire: \"Sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n\n4 \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n\n5 \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n\n6 \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n\n7 \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n\n8 \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n\n9 \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n\n10 \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n\n11 \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n\n12 \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n\n13 \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n\n14 \"Single-sports betting in Canada wins House vote, nears legalization\"\n\n15 \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n\n16 \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \\~12.5% (not far from Paysafe\u2019s minimum 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign among others:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter eliminating outliers with highest multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotes:\n\n1 Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.\n\n2 Used low end of Paysafe's projections and factored in debt and high-end of potential dilution.\n\n3 As noted Paysafe\u2019s 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&amp;A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth, which constitutes a third of their revenue.\n\n4 The above comps were taken during a sector-wide pull-back and do not reflect recent fintech gains since Jamie Dimon\u2019s \"enormous competitive threats\" comment.\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers projects roughly 20% more growth than Paysafe yet trades at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#6) Not profitable. \n\nPaysafe expects $900 million in gross profit with healthy 30-32% EBITDA margin. As one recent article pointed out, \u201cPaysafe has shown some intriguing projections in terms of its profitability. The company\u2019s projected gross margin is 63%, an impressive number compared to competitors like Square with a gross margin under 30%.\u201d\nThese fintech competitors are trading at much higher multiples but have worse EPS than Paysafe:\n\nRepay: -0.67,\n\nAffirm : -2.18,\n\nNuvei : -1.08,\n\nPaysign : -0.19.\n\nBill : -0.62,\n\nShift4 : -0.43\n\nAverage EV/EBITDA multiples of the above companies would put Paysafe's SP at $69\nIf you read their transcripts and presentations, you\u2019ll see that profit is being utilized to grow the business and integrate their global platforms into what they call Paysafe Unity. They\u2019ve recently completed the integration of Skrill and Neteller digital wallets into a single code. Foley has indicated further elimination of redundancies to create new efficiencies and increase margins to enhance M&amp;A activities. From what I can tell, Foley is all about the long game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#7) Too I much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more.   \nPaysafe just paid down $1.1 billion in debt. Why would they turn around and borrow again? As Fidelity\u2019s Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley says: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.\u201d\n\nTheir 3.6X Debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintech peers. Investopedia: \u201cDebt/EBITDA measures a company's ability to pay off its incurred debt. A high ratio result could indicate a company has a too-heavy debt load.\u201d \n\nOf the 11 fintech competitors I looked at, all but three (PYPL, ADYEY, NUVCF), have worse Debt/EBITDA ratios than Paysafe and many have negative EBITDA, making debt service that much more difficult:\n\nSquare: 77.8X\n\nRepay : 8.7X\n\nFiserv : $21.2B / $4.7B : 4.5X\n\nGPN : $10.27B / $2.8B : 3.67X\n\nShift4 : $1.8B / -$8M : negative EBITDA\n\nAffirm : $1.67B / -77.6M negative EBITDA\n\nPaysign : $4.3M / -$5.79M : negative EBITDA\n\nBill : $947M / -43.85M : negative EBITDA\n\nDepending on whether you include SQ and AFRM, the combined multiples of the above competitors (by EV/EBITDA, EV/free cash flow or EV/revenue) puts Paysafe\u2019s share price in the $45 to $90 range. Point being, their debt position is better than most and hardly a red flag. Further, management has said they\u2019ll be able to fund M&amp;A plans with expanding 32-35%+ EBITDA margins ($500 - 560 million, 21% CAGR) and $362 million in free cash flow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#8) Blackstone made 3X and will sell. \n\nThe common myth is that Blackstone/CVC made 300% by paying $3 billion to take Paysafe private and receiving $9 billion in the recent deal to bring it public. The reality, as reported by the Wall Street Journal (8), is that Blackstone/CVC took Paysafe private in 2017 for $3.9 Billion and they received about $5.6 billion in cash and shares on the recent deal. Adjusted for inflation, they paid $4.2 billion so it\u2019s more like a 33% return on a 4 year hold.\n\nImportantly, this came AFTER they grew revenue 65% ($864B to $1.426B), stewarded a billion in investments to grow the business, and the deal included paying down over $1.1 billion in debt. This suggests Foley cut a great deal for shareholders. It also explains why private equity has signaled that they'll stay on long term to reap much bigger gains through Foley\u2019s time-tested M&amp;A playbook.\n\nBlackstone itself says (9), \u201cThe term of private equity funds can be upwards of 7-10 years.\u201d With so much runway and comps pointing to a 3-4X valuation, why would Blackstone leave so much money on the table?\n\nBlackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler signals an ongoing interest in staying on: \u201cWe believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview Foley said, private equity\u2019s plan to stay on was part of what encouraged PIPE to invest $2 billion: \u201cThey rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn\u2019t take all their money off the table\u2026All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.\u201d\n\nThis trust was reiterated in the SEC filed FTAC\u2019s Board of Directors\u2019 Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination: \u201cCommitment of Paysafe\u2019s Owners. The FTAC Board believes that the CVC Investors, the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the post-combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such stockholders\u2019 belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects of Paysafe going forward.\u201d\n\nThe PIPE investors are even less of a concern because they are title and life insurance companies known for long-term investment strategies, they are closely aligned with Foley and understand both his M&amp;A track record and his ability to create mutually beneficial synergistic deals through what Bloomberg called the \u201cThe Foley Network\u201d (perhaps, for example, Paysafe will handle Fidelity\u2019s massive transactional volume). \nIn a recent Bloomberg interview, Bill Foley said, \u201cThe thing that was different about our transaction is that we brought capital to the table. The companies that I\u2019m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset besides the fact that it\u2019s a great asset.\u201d\n\nBesides, just as large funds will often drive price down to accumulate large positions, they also can drive price up to sell into strength and will do so via off-market trades to avoid price slippage. Therefore, we probably wouldn\u2019t even notice profit taking until after quarterly filings. Paysafe\u2019s fundamental value in context indicates such prospects present very little long term risk, especially from current price levels. Given Paysafe's $100B market share (similar to Square\u2019s), once audited numbers are available, many large funds focused on this space will necessarily seek a more balanced exposure through Paysafe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#9) Founder share and warrant dilution. \n\nAccording to the 20F recently filed, roughly 53 million warrants pose potential dilution at a maximum of 7.5% (movement we've seen in a day), but the cashless conversion option, generally exchanging 3 warrants for a single share, can reduce that dilution by 2/3 to around 2.5%. It is very likely that many will use this option since most warrant holders do not have the extra cash to pay an additional $11.50 for each warrant conversion. It will probably be somewhere in the middle of the two scenarios (\\~5%) but this is not a major concern in the scheme of things.\n\nImportantly, the 20F also shows that all founder shares are already included in the current outstanding share count so there is no risk of dilution there.\n\nTotal FTAC Founder shares 175,292,458 24.2 %\u00a0\n\nBlackstone Investors 123,734,571 17.1 %\u00a0\n\nCVC Investors 156,006,433 21.6 %\u00a0\n\nOther Pre-Business Combination Paysafe Shareholders 53,701,074 7.4 %\u00a0\n\nCannae (excluding amounts included in Founder) 50,000,000 6.9 %\u00a0\n\nPIPE Investors (excluding Cannae) 165,000,000 22.8 %\u00a0\n\n723,734,536 100.0 %\u00a0\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite a lack of negative news, short sellers and bashers have been able to exploit a perfect storm of doubt created by seemingly unrelated events ranging from forced selling pressure coming from widely reported changes in margin requirements (25% to 100% upon ticker change without any prior notice), to simultaneous limits on buying resulting from excessive delays (7+ trading days) in the new PSFE ticker being available on many platforms, to things in the media that this sub will not allow to be discussed.  In this context, it is hard not to see a month's worth of \u201cfake sell walls\u201d and HFS \u201cshort ladder attacks\u201d as anything other than opportunistic price manipulation but, speculation can only get you so far. \n\nI think Paysafe is currently undervalued and, as the developments in legalized sports betting come to fruition, it is very likely a 3X from here. M&amp;A plans already in the works will bring additional catalysts. Given Paysafe's healthy fundamentals, large market share in a fintech space known for \u201csticky\u201d customers, and exposure to high growth verticals like iGaming, it seems inevitable that large funds will seek to benefit from these low prices, especially once the first audited quarterly numbers are available on May 11th.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: Per their analyst presentation, here is Paysafe\u2019s minimum Q1 guidance to meet or beat:\n\n$360 million revenue\n\n$220 million gross profit\n\n$105 million EBITDA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: I hold $600K in commons and warrants\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.

        "selftext": "Hi all i currently hold a position of 29200 warrants in APXT at 3.8, and have decided to share some valuation numbers\n\n1. total No. of shares outstanding after merger = 199,000,000\n2. total No. of Warrants = 17,900,000\n3. total No of Shares + Warrants = 216,900,000\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1777921/000121390020038639/0001213900-20-038639-index.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1777921/000121390020038639/0001213900-20-038639-index.htm)\n\nThis source is 100% cannot lie\n\nCurrent market cap based on this = 16.52 x 216,900,000= USD $3,583,188,000\n\nExpected revenue this year : 194,000,000\n\nAverage Price to sales of competitors (Avalara, Five9, Alteryx, Dynatrace, Hubspot, Ring Central) : 21.18\n\nExpected Minimium Share price = USD 18.85\n\nThis is Solely based on hard math\n\nNote to that in order for the warrants to be called, share price has to be maintained above 18 dollars for 30 days straight, hence if Avepoint wants to access that money they will need to push the stock price above 18 for quite a while\n\nRisk is on the average profit projection, which is based on Investor Prospectus, which could be wrong\n\nNote as well that there is currently USD 4-5 trillion sitting on the side-lines awaiting to enter the market hence a massive stock crash is unlikely, as there is too muck liquidity to prop the market up\n\nfinal price point for APXT\n\nAssume 50,000,000 users as per their plan and profitability stay the same and no Dilution but rather reinvestment to produce this\n\nRevenue : 1,057,142,857\n\nGross Profit based on same margin of 74%: 782,285,714\n\naverage GP ratio of competitors: 37.82\n\nShare Price: 136.42\n\nProbability of this reaching in 5 years: 75%\n\nReasoning: APXT is already working in an established industry and tapping into a very simple Requirement considering the shift caused by the pandemic. 2020 numbers could very well exceed the numbers on the prospectus due to the huge increase in demand for cloud services and migrations due to the work from home Phenomena\n\nMicrosoft Works is still an integral part of the working environment hence there will be demand for the migrations and security services\n\nSome have asked why will Microsoft not just take over the job of Avepoint. My assessment is this is impossible, as with the Democratic win of the senate and Congress, Microsoft will be facing pressure from Antitrust and Monopolistic investigations. Hence it would not be wise for Microsoft to risk breakup just to absorb another area of business\n\nTake note this are my opinions and do not constitute financial advice",
