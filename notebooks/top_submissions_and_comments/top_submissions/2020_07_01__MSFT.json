        "selftext": "Hello fellow investors\n\nI recently put together the following portfolio, with the intention of not touching it for at least 10 years. Discuss your opinions in the comments, I'd be glad to hear your feedback!\n\n1) Amazon: 25%\n\nI feel like Amazon can't be stopped in the 2020s, it will completely obliberate every company who can't innovate and put their customers first. I've recently read the book \"bezonomics\" and I suggest everyone who doesn't fully understand this company to read it aswell. Amazon is number 1 by far in e-commerce and cloud computing, industries that are still very young and have a lot of potential. However, the thing I like most about Amazon is its ability to innovate and how they are able to \"spread their wings\" in every segment where there is money to be made.\n\n2) Microsoft: 15%\n\nThis one is pretty obvious and boring. Microsoft has always been a solid company, they have been through many freefalls of the tech market so that is a factor to keep in mind. Their new cloud computing platform \"Azure\" looks very promising, being the second biggest in the world (behind Amazon.) Microsoft has a very diversed business model and a good management team so they are not going anywhere.\n\n3) Apple: 10%\n\nApple is a very high quality company, with a fairly low PE ratio compared to other tech. I also feel like the rise of 5G is only going to make Apple stronger. \n\n4) Alibaba: 10%\n\nI can't forget about this Chinese tech giant! The growth in chinese consumer spending makes this stock really attractive to me. Alibaba pretty much has a monopoly in China concerning e-commerce and cloud computing services ( comparable to Amazon in the US.)\n\n5) Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: 10%\n\nThis company has many rather defensive stocks that will help the firm through recessions and economic downfalls, but this company will also keep riding the upward market trends. Berkshire is a great stabilizer that will round out your portfolio beautifully. One of the best long-term stocks in my opinion.\n\n5) Disney: 5%\n\nThis entertainment giant is still trading at a discount price and is set for a comeback rally any time soon, with the parks reopening etc. The company also pays a respectable amount of dividend, currently yielding at 1.62%.\n\n6) Walmart: 5%\n\nWalmart is often overlooked by investors, because of Amazon, but I strongly believe Walmart isn't going anywhere and is one of the few companies that won't get eaten by Amazon. Walmart also recently launched an e-commerce platform, trying to compete with Amazon. The company also pays a good dividend of 1.64%.\n\n7) Coca-Cola: 5%\n\nA personal favorite of mine, Coca-Cola! One of the strongest and most reliable brands in the world and my favorite dividend king. I love the current discount on this one, trading at 75% of its ATH. The dividend yield 3,5% is beautiful.\n\n8)  PepsiCo: 5%\n\nI feel like if I'm going to be adding Coca-Cola to my portfolio, I can't forget about PepsiCo. These 2 beverage giants are not going anywhere. The dividend yield of 3% is nice aswell.\n\n9)  Johnson &amp; Johnson: 5%\n\nEven though I don't know much about pharmaceutical stocks, I still love JNJ, mostly because of their growing dividend payout (for over 50+ years!)\n\n10)  McDonald's: 5%\n\nMy favorite fast food chain can't lack this portfolio.  When it comes to fast-casual dining, McDonald's is still the kingpin, and it's likely going to stay that way for a long time to come. The growing dividend payout (for 43 consecutive years) also looks really appealing to me.\n\nThanks and stay safe folks",

        "selftext": "Watch out for $PASO tomorrow. Please read my DD.\n\nI\u2019ve made a couple posts on this stock recently, and I haven\u2019t actually posted any real DD on it, but after countless comments questioning the hype behind it, I have decided to construct my own DD.\n\nLet\u2019s begin by discussing the hype behind this stock. **The merger is set to close July 15th (tomorrow)**. \n\n**How do I know this?**\n\nThe LOI was signed on 5/29 stating that the private company will merge to become a publicly traded company. From the LOI, it quotes: \u201cThe Closing shall be on July 15, 2020 or sooner, unless the parties hereto agree to another time.\u201d\n\n**Details about the LOI:**\n\nIn the Letter of Intent, it hereby quotes: \u201cThis letter of intent (\u201cLetter of Intent\u201d) is made and entered into as of the date above, by and between, CLX Health, LLC a Delaware Limited Liability Company (hereinafter \u201cCLX\u201d), and Patient Access Solutions, Inc. (hereinafter \u201cPASO\u201d), a Nevada corporation, and sets forth the basic terms and conditions by which CLX will acquire 10 Million Preferred Series subject to a dividend rate determined by the closing of the merger and appoint the Board of Directors in its entirety of PASO subject to shareholder approval if necessary. Preferred shares rights to be determined and memorialized with Board of Director approval, and the consummation of a Definitive Agreement, on terms as follows: \n\n1. PASO is a publicly held Nevada corporation whose securities are quoted on the over the counter bulletin board under the trading symbol (OTCBB: PASO) and classified as Pink Sheet Current. Patient Access Solutions has approximately seven hundred fifty million (750,000,000) Common Shares authorized, issued and outstanding. \n2. CLX Health, LLC is a Joint Venture of Healthcare IT companies that have come together to identify, develop, and deploy solutions for the purpose of processing clinical information related to lab testing, results analysis, and public health engagement to deliver a safety net of technology to benefit the general public. CLX utilizes human assisted AI to monitor laboratory order and results data to create an operational database from which to deploy \u201cdigital health passes\u201d to mobile devices identifying those individuals who are at the lowest risk to transmit communicable diseases and allowing them to re-enter the workforce immediately.\n3. CLX shall acquire, subject to the completion of due diligence, the execution of a Definitive Agreement and Board and Shareholder (if necessary) approval, 10 million shares of preferred Series Stock of PASO. It is understood by the parties with joint financial interest in CLX acquiring control of PASO is to effectuate a reverse merger between PASO and CLX Healthcare Joint Venture partnership \u201cCLX\u201d (\u201cAcquisition\u201d).\n4. The Closing shall be on July 15, 2020 or sooner, unless the parties hereto agree to another time. Prior to the Closing, PASO shall furnish their financial statements to CLX as they should be reflected in the most recent submitted disclosure to OTC MARKETS. The due diligence period shall be that period of time between the signing of this Letter of Intent and the signing of the Definitive Agreement. Any information received by or on behalf of any investigating party shall be deemed confidential information, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 6.\n5. After the parties have completed their due diligence investigation, or at the end of the expiration of the due diligence period, whichever comes first, the parties will sign a Definitive Agreement, formalizing the terms of this Letter of Intent. \n6. Each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause their agents and representatives, to keep confidential as proprietary and privileged information the negotiations of the parties respecting the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby, and any other item which may be expressly identified or noticed as confidential hereby (\u201cConfidential Information\u201d). The parties agree not to negotiate with any other reverse merger or financing candidates during the pendency of this Letter of Intent.\n7. This Letter of Intent sets forth the basic terms and conditions of the proposed transaction between the parties as currently contemplated. Consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby may require further negotiation, and is subject to the completion of due diligence as hereinabove described, and requires the drafting of a Definitive Agreement setting forth the terms and conditions not inconsistent with the foregoing and other terms and conditions which are customary and usual under the circumstances. The parties will cooperate and use their best efforts to negotiate such a Definitive Agreement. This Letter of Intent does not constitute or create, and shall not be deemed to constitute or create, any obligation on the part of either party to this Letter of Intent, except for as expressly provided for herein. No such obligation shall be created, except by the execution and delivery of the Definitive Agreement contemplated hereby, containing such terms and conditions of the proposed transaction as shall be agreed upon by the parties, and then only in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Definitive Agreement.\n8. This Letter of Intent may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed as an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This is the only agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and shall be construed under the laws of the State of Nevada.\n9. The signatories below agree to accept signatures transmitted by facsimile as a true and legally binding original document. This Letter of Intent will not be effective unless signed by both parties on the date first above mentioned. Representing CLX Health, LLC Joint Venture \n\n**Here is the link to the ENTIRE LOI:**\n\n[https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/financial-report/248195/content](https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/financial-report/248195/content)\n\n**Details about the merger and the companies involved:**\n\nCLXHealth also included in their bio, and I quote, \u201cthis account to be updated on or before July 15, 2020.\u201d This is the same exact date the merger is supposed to close.\n\nFor ones that do not understand what is going on here, **Patient Access Solutions ($PASO) will become CLXHealth.** \n\n**CLXHealth will also be set to partner with TransUnion, Sirius IQ, and UST Global**.\n\nLink: [https://solutions.transunion.com/healthy-america/resources/file/healthy-america-project-plan-2020.pdf](https://solutions.transunion.com/healthy-america/resources/file/healthy-america-project-plan-2020.pdf)\n\nCLXHealth on twitter also just followed **TransUnion, Sirius IQ, and UST Global.** Coincidence? I think not.\n\n**What is Sirius IQ?**\n\nIn a statement made by them, quote: \u201cSiriusIQ is focused on next-gen Master Orchestration and Automation of data to streamline business processes, conversations, analytics and more. SiriusIQ based solutions are faster, better and smarter and integrate Native Cloud Services, Human-Assisted AI, Continuous Integration Continuous Delivery of Data and Subject Matter Expert Collaboration. A graduate of Microsoft BizSpark Plus incubator, SiriusIQ has been named a 'Cool Vendor' by Gartner and a 'Hot Vendor' by HfS Research. For more information, visit us at [https://www.siriusiq.com](https://www.siriusiq.com/).\u201d\n\n**What is UST Global?**\n\nIn a statement made by them, quote: \u201cUST Global: is a multinational provider of Digital technology and transformation, IT services and solutions, headquartered in Aliso Viejo, California, United States. The Company has 23,000 employees and offices in over 25 countries including USA, India, Mexico, UK, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Spain and Poland. UST Global has oriented its services around the following major platforms to offer our services in a Business Platform-as-a-Service (BPaaS) model while continuing to support enterprise-class customers with more traditional IT and BPO services. [https://www.ust-global.com](https://www.ust-global.com/).\u201d\n\n**What is TransUnion?**\n\nTo start off, **TransUnions stock is currently trading at $84.13** as of market close on July 14th. They have a 16 billion market cap, and 700 million in Q1 with a PE ratio of 46.\n\nThis is a description straight from their company: \u201cTransUnion is an American consumer credit reporting agency. TransUnion collects and aggregates information on over one billion individual consumers in over thirty countries including \"200 million files profiling nearly every credit-active consumer in the United States\". Its customers include over 65,000 businesses. Based in Chicago, Illinois, TransUnion's 2014 revenue was US$1.3 billion. It is the smallest of the three largest credit agencies, along with Experian and Equifax.\u201d\n\nMoving on\u2026\n\nThey have also recently followed **Chile MFA, Itamaraty Brazil, Digital India, and Saudi Arabia**. You can interpret this any way you want.\n\nTo add on to the merger, all CLX Health social media sites were updated with the new logo today. After the twitter followers and their activity on social media, it is clear to see what is happening here.\n\nCLXHealth also just tweeted out at exactly 7:36 PST today, and I quote, \u201c**HealthyAmericaTM is COMING**.\u201d \n\nLink to the tweet: [https://twitter.com/CLXHealth/status/1283047772913106948](https://twitter.com/CLXHealth/status/1283047772913106948)\n\n**Why is this important?**\n\nYou can see for yourself: [https://solutions.transunion.com/healthy-america/resources/file/healthy-america-project-plan-2020.pdf](https://solutions.transunion.com/healthy-america/resources/file/healthy-america-project-plan-2020.pdf)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWith $PASO reverse merging with CLX Health and being backed up by 3 HUGE companies that boast great revenue will be HUGE. Listen to the DD. Do your own DD. Figure out for yourself. Read the LOI. Read ALL OF THE DD. This will be huge. This will be an opportunity that one should not miss. Decide for yourself. Will you take the risk? The leap of faith? It is up to you...",

        "selftext": "These past few days/weeks, we've seen some truly absurd moves in tech. Today alone, Tesla was up 10 percent, Netflix was up 8 percent, and Amazon is up about 20% the past few weeks on basically no news. Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Nvidia, etc. are all at or above their mid-February valuations. What spooks me is not that these equities are moving upward, but it's that they are moving upward quickly and impulsively, with few pullbacks, and leaving the rest of the market in the dust. These are not the signs of a healthy new bull market; they are the signs of rampant speculation, euphoria, and greed. These mega-cap corporations are propping up the indices and are almost acting as safe havens for investors pulling out of travel, financials, consumer staples, energy, etc. We saw this rotation in full force yesterday when the Dow ended over -1% while the Nasdaq was around +0.5%. This is not to say that I think we are on the brink of collapse--bubbles can last a lot longer than any of us think they might.\n\nFor those of you who have exposure to big tech, how are you managing it? Are you planning to ride out what seems to be a massive, unstoppable wave upward or are you slowly taking profits along the way? How will upcoming earnings impact your strategy?",

        "selftext": "So, as the title says, I\u2019m a 22-year-old looking for advice about how to handle a roughly $25,000-$30,000 inheritance that I\u2019m receiving. The money is in a Roth IRA at Fidelity. I have no idea what the money is currently invested in, how much is in buying power, and so on. I have a basic idea of how I want to manage the money, but I\u2019m looking for some insight on if I\u2019m in the right ballpark here and if so, how I could better execute my strategy. \n\nFor starters, I\u2019m probably going to sell everything, unless any of it overlaps with the ideas I\u2019m going to lay out in this post.\n\nFrom there, I want to invest half of the funds in dividend and value stocks, and index funds. \n\nI\u2019m thinking at least a quarter of that half, so an eighth of my entire portfolio spread across the three main US indexes, specifically invested in SPY, DOW, and QQQ. I\u2019m interested in investing either the QQQ or SPY portion in a 3x daily bull fund that traces that fund, specifically either TQQQ or SPXL, let me know what you think about that.\n\nThe next eighth I\u2019m wanting to invest into banks. Companies like JPM and C are underperforming the market so heavily right now, and they\u2019ve already confirmed that they\u2019re not cutting dividends. Yes, share buybacks are suspended pending future earnings requirements but I believe that JPM and C are well positioned enough to resume buybacks at the latest by the end of Q1 2021. I genuinely believe that banks are discounted right now and have potential for a great return if they return to their ATH\u2019s. I also like the prospect of their dividend income over time. \n\nThe next eighth I\u2019m wanting to put into funds specifically for their dividends. I don\u2019t really care about the YoY return on these tickers; I\u2019m just interested in the dividend. I\u2019d want to spread it across SPHD, MO, KO, ABBV, SPG, and VYM. \n\nAny suggestions for the last eighth of the long-term / low-risk portion of the fund would be appreciated. I\u2019m sure I couldn\u2019t go wrong with just going heavy on the dividend funds, but yeah, any suggestions would be cool.\n\nNow for the second half of the fund. I\u2019m wanting to approach this half with a more high-risk, high-reward strategy. \n\nFor the first half of this high-risk high-reward portion (quarter of my total portfolio), I\u2019m just going to invest in growth stocks/ETFs. A couple of tickers I have in mind are ARKK, SOCL, SMH, AMD, FSLY, TSLA, APPL, MSFT, FB, and AMZN.\n\nFor last quarter, I\u2019m not thinking YOLO on an FD type high risk high reward, but I\u2019d definitely like to dabble in options. And this is the portion of my investment that I\u2019m most open to suggestions and ideas. I have some basic ideas though. \n\nMy 1st idea is to keep a quarter of the portfolio in cash and sell cash secured puts on companies that I actually wouldn\u2019t mind buying 100 shares of at the strike. I\u2019d want to continually do this up until the day I inevitably get assigned and then actually purchase those shares. A couple of tickers that I have in mind for playing like this are SNAP and NCLH, (yeah cruise line RH meme stock I know). At which point I\u2019d acquire the shares and then sell covered calls on the shares on the way up, just to reap in additional benefits, again, not minding if I get assigned and have to sell them for that strike. I kind of like this idea the best out of any that I\u2019ve had, just because it seems like the lowest risk, I\u2019d be able to acquire 100 shares of a company that I see growth in, which would probably be the smartest long term play anyways. \n\nMy 2nd idea is to buy LEAPS on banks, specifically JPM or C. I\u2019d just buy calls within +5% of the strike and buy the furthest dated out possible. Simple yeah but I think getting a play with that much time and that much potential delta is a good idea, and its relatively low risk compared to my last idea.\n\nMy last idea is definitely the riskiest and basically, it\u2019s just buying calls for cruises and airlines for June of next year. A potential vaccine announcement, stimulus in the form of travel expense related tax write-offs, as well as the incoming wave of cabin-fever induced travel frenzy are all factors that could honestly cause them to pop-off at any time within the next year. \n\nTLDR;\n\nI\u2019m a 22-year-old inheriting somewhere between $25,000-$30,000 this week and I want to manage the money myself. I\u2019m pretending that each 8\u2019th is about $3,000 to be conservative. My general idea is this:\n\nLong-term, low risk: \n\n1/8 \u2013 US indices, specifically SPY, DOW, and QQQ. Let me know what you think about putting either the SPY or QQQ portion into SPXL or TQQQ.\n\n1/8 \u2013 Banks, probably literally just JPM and C, maybe a little bit of WFC but they suck. \n\n1/8 \u2013 Dividend stocks, specifically SPHD, MO, KO, ABBV, SPG, and VYM. \n\n1/8 \u2013 Want to allocate to a low-risk, long-term strategy and would like suggestions on what to allocate this to. \n\nHigher risk, higher reward:\n\n1/4 \u2013 High growth stocks and ETF\u2019s, specifically ARKK, SOCL, SMH, AMD, FSLY, TSLA, APPL, MSFT, FB, and AMZN. \n\n1/4 \u2013 Three different ideas. 1. Sell cash secured puts on SNAP and NCLH until I get assigned, at which point hold the shares and sell covered calls. 2. LEAPS on banks. 3. LEAPS on travel. \n\nOpen to suggestions, advice, criticism, anything. Any input at all is appreciated. Thanks everyone!",

        "selftext": "Hey fucktards. Listen up, because I probably don't have much time left on this planet. I am legit looking behind me every 5 seconds as I type this, cause shit is about to get pretty feisty for me.\n\nSome of you may have already seen my comment on the daily thread, and everything I said was true. So get some popcorn, get snug with your wife's boyfriend, and enjoy the story.\n\nFor some context, I'm pretty well off. Yes, we exist. Sorry my parents aren't strippers like yours. Tell me....what happens when you have 2 well-educated (Masters degrees) computer engineers in Director positions at well-renowned companies who have been working for around 30 years now, and these people live a pretty humble life??\n\nDing ding ding, correct. They have a hell of a nest egg. So yes, I received a \"small loan\" of $100,000. My parents' intention was for me to invest this money in solid blue-chip stocks, and possibly use the money to pay for a future graduate degree or use it as a down-payment for a house. \n\nWhat did I do instead? I found this fucking sub, the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy first stupid play: Put $10,000 into GNUS cause I read some dumbass article about how its going to be the \"next Netflix for kids\". What do you think happened the minute I bought the STOCK (not even options)......yup, correct!!!!111!!!!!1! It dropped down from 11 to fucking 3 bucks. Haven't checked that shit in a while but its probably like 1 dollar at this point. Stupid ass company\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy second stupid play: OK so I thought, why not just go for the ACTUAL Netflix?? Literally can't fo tits up, right? Right?? Wrong. I played NFLX earnings. Put $10,000 into it, had +$10,000 gain, wanted even more money. What do you think happened in the next 2 days as I bagheld?? Lost every single penny of it. Well not every single penny, I was able to take back a respectable 40 bucks from my initial $10,000 investment. So -10,000 there.\n\nMy third and final stupid play: Put $17,000 into MSFT calls. OK I thought. Now this one DEFINITELY cant make me go Guh, its literaly fucking Microsoft. Solid company, they beat earnings, Satya Nadella is a chad, etc etc. Wrong once again. The MINUTE I buy these stupid retarded calls, the stock price shoots down to 199 from 211. I sit and watch The value of my 17k call go down to a mere 2k.\n\nToday I wake up and my dad randomly asks if he can \"check my account\", just to see how things are going. He says \"you probably have like a decent ten percent gain, right?\" and as I mutter something under my breath. My palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy, as he begins to type my password in. When the number flashes on the screen...\\*71k\\*, he spits out his water. \n\nGot around a 3 hour lecture, thats all I want to comment about that. So I hear I am sitting, typing up this bullshit for you autists, wondering whether I'm going to be able to eat dinner tonight. \n\nIf I could do it all over again, either I would actually stick to blue chip-stocks, and only play with \"house money\" if I was gonna do options, or just not play this stupid fucking rigged game at all, and check my account again in ten years when Apple is like $10,000 and Tesla is $100,000. Set it and forget it. Oh well, its to late now.\n\nSo buy up some cheap puts on my life, hope you guys enjoyed this story.",

Should I invest in tech companies such as MSFT, APPL, GOOGL etc.. now? or should I wait as things currently seem to be unstable while prices are high (looking at the current economic situation).\n\nIf I wait, prices may go higher, and I may end up buying at a high price, but if I buy now, a crah may come, and prices may drop, in that case I would have less money to put in the market to avrege down the cost.\n\nIn 5-10 years I see the stock of these companies up to atleast $100 - $200 a share, as these are solid companies, with great balance sheets.

        "selftext": "Hello, european oor here, just looking for some tips and strategies in case the market decides to shit itself again.  \nI have a couple of questions to start the discussion:  \n1. Is the march dip a good example to look at? I entered gambling right after the rally (yeah, i know, lucky me) but i feel like biotech is way bigger now than it was before it. Would that mean there is more to lose in that sector?  \n2. If and when the market crashes, what companies are you looking to short? In the same vein, when the rally afterwards comes, which companies are you looking to buy into?  More specifically, which companies do you think will suffer the hardest during the crash, and which will gain the most during the rally? For example wouldnt it be smarter to short a smaller company compared to AAPL? Even if their share value goes from 360 to 260, sure, they lose 100 dollars per share, but, say a company whose shares go from 50 to 1 is a way bigger win in terms of percentages.  \n3. Is there a way to play both sides in a wave strategy, say if theres some companies/ a sector thats gonna dip/rally faster than others, so that one could play on those first, and, after maximizing profits on it, move onto another play. In march for example i think microsoft took a day or two longer to start dipping compared to the majority.  \nAny ideas and tips are welcome, if not for me, then for other americans in here that might read the thread.  \nI currently reside in the UK, so my options are limited (ha, get it?), since we dont have RH here yet. I use the trading212 platform and i intend to use CFD for my plays if and when the time comes. Winnings might not be as big as on options, but they still beat plain old shares.",

        "selftext": "With AMD shares hitting a new all-time high today on the back of an earnings beat and raised guidance (as well as Intel's 7nm delay), I thought it would be an opportune time to look back on how amazing of a turnaround story this has really been given that only 7 years ago the company's future was very much in doubt.\n\nIn 2013, ArsTechnica ran a profile on how AMD took on Intel in the late 90s, experienced rousing success with its Athlon and Opteron chips, before over-spending and mis-executing its way into a free fall. Back then, AMD found itself completely out-maneuvered by Intel in the desktop, laptop, and sever markets and had largely been shut out of both smartphone and tablet production.\n\nThis fascinating story features some matchmaking by Bill Gates, a failed attempt by AMD to acquire Nvidia when it traded under $15 a share, and a botched integration with graphics maker ATI Technologies. Warning: the two-part article, while super interesting, is absolutely on the lengthy side. For those of you who like the quick-hitters, I've summarized the highlights below.\n\n[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/the-rise-and-fall-of-amd-how-an-underdog-stuck-it-to-intel/](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/the-rise-and-fall-of-amd-how-an-underdog-stuck-it-to-intel/)\n\n* During the 1980s, AMD was a second-source supplier for companies using Intel processors. Companies like IBM didn't want to rely solely on Intel for one of the primary components in their computers, so they licensed AMD to produce versions of Intel processors. However in 1985, Intel stopped giving AMD its designs which forced them to reverse-engineer versions of Intel parts. By 1990, Merrill Lynch had declared AMD \"dead\", as the smaller company couldn't keep up with Intel product releases. This would not be the last time, as its aggressive pricing throughout the first half of the 90s had left AMD in a poor financial position. \n* In 1994, a tiny Silicon Valley outfit named NexGen began shipping a chip that was comparable to Intel's flagship Pentium. Microsoft CEO Bill Gates had taken an interest in NexGen, in particular, its brilliant CEO, Atiq Raza. Gates suggested that Raza speak to AMD since the company owned a chip fab but needed a better product to build in it. Raza met with then-CEO Jerry Sanders, who threatened to run NexGen out of business. Upon hearing about the exchange, Gates picked up the phone, called Sanders, and convinced AMD to purchase NexGen for $615mn in 1995. Soon after, Raza, dubbed by Sanders as the \"Michael Jordan of microprocessor design\", helped AMD develop the K6 - a major turning point for the company.\n* The K6 rivaled Intel on speed and price, and its revisions led to one of AMD's most successful architectures: K7, marketed as the Athlon. Athlon received \"CPU of the Year\" in 1999 from ArsTechnica and helped AMD grow sales from $2.5bn in 1998 to $4.6bn by 2000. With the company having just pulled in nearly $1bn in profits, Sanders rented out San Jose's entire HP Pavilion (now the SAP Center) for a party in which he paid for Tim McGraw and Faith Hill to perform and proclaimed AMD's share price would soon hit $100.\n* Around this time the company started spending too much and spreading itself too thin. AMD was making most of its profit from memory, but was also dabbling in logic, microprocessors, and communication products. Sanders had also decided to build a massive fab in Germany with borrowed money. Despite this, AMD continued to find technical success. AMD utilized the Athlon to develop a similar architecture that was more useful for severs. The new product, Opteron, led to AMD capturing an estimated 25% of the server market by 2006 all the while Intel struggled to produce a chip that could compete with the performance advantages of Opteron.\n* While on the surface AMD seemed to be firing on all cylinders with its popular Athlon and Opteron chips, the company was a financial mess behind-the-scenes. The company announced net losses of $61mn in 2001, $1.3bn in 2002, and $274mn in 2003. The main culprit? Investments in fabs that grossly overshot initial cost estimates. Between its two locations in Germany, AMD invested roughly $4.6bn.\n* AMD's competitive edge with Opteron coincided with some low points for Intel that forced the company to re-imagine its architecture altogether. The result was the release of the Intel Core microarchitecture in 2006. Core enabled Intel to take back the performance crown in the PC market, and it proved more power-efficient than AMD's laptop chips right when laptops began to outsell desktops for the first time.  Intel compounded the pain by strategically releasing frequent upgrades and forcing AMD to play catch-up yet again. \n* Though AMD's CPUs consistently improved, over time they became shut out of the high-end market once more and were relegated to compete mainly on price, mirroring the company's early struggles. As Intel churned out its best product in years, AMD began trying to swallow another company whole. In 2006, AMD saw an opportunity for the future by integrating a memory controller into the CPU. However, the company needed the graphics and chipset experience to make it happen.\n* The solution was to purchase Canadian graphics company ATI Technologies for $5.4bn - or roughly half of AMD's market cap. This came after AMD had approached Nvidia as its first-choice takeover target. At that time, Nvidia was trading under $15 a share. But Jen-Hsun Huang, Nvidia's outspoken CEO, insisted on running the combined company \u2014 a non-starter for AMD leadership. While ATI's technology was considered superior to Intel's, the integration process proved disastrous from the start. Employees from the two companies divided into green (AMD and CPU) and red (ATI and GPU) sides, prioritizing needs of their individual products, and causing major delays time and time again. \n* With problems executing and stagnant sales, AMD ended 2007 with more than $5bn in debt and lost $3.3bn on the year after having taken a write-down charge for its acquisition of ATI. The company was having serious difficulty affording the costs of its fab facilities, when the entire industry endured a sharp downturn in 2008 that caused the stock to plummet from $20 to $4 a share. \n* AMD had no choice but to spin off its foundries in 2009 (AMD spun off GlobalFoundries in 2009), weakening its competitive positioning relative to Intel. Despite efforts to engineer higher quality products, its share of the PC and sever businesses kept declining and AMD was unable to achieve meaningful share in the ultrabook and tablet segments. The low-end CPU market sent margins tumbling and increased exposure to secular declines in PC sales. \n* By 2013, only one singular analyst on Wall Street was bullish on the stock \u2014 which had now fallen from $8 at the start of 2012 to just around $2. Yet after a major delay with the highly anticipated \"Fusion\" 32nm chip, the analyst noted that there were now liquidity concerns due to the declining PC market. Even former CFO Fran Barton thought AMD had next to no future in its battle with Intel: \"***...the game's been played.***\"\n\nFlash-forward to today and AMD just delivered its highest CPU revenue in over 12 years, has taken CPU market share for 11 straight quarters, and currently enjoys double-digit server processor market share. Whether you're an investor or not, bullish or bearish, that is one hell of a comeback. Hats off to Lisa Su and the entire AMD team.",

There is a clear divide between the \"new tech\" and the \"efficient tech\" type of companies though: the latter stocks expanded in valuations by a lot. The price to sales on some of them doubled. I'd approach these with caution - the market seems to be a little too exstatic about them, but on the other hand it seems like capital has nowhere else to go so I can't imagine the market abandoning the valuations anytime soon. \n\nOn the other hand the \"new tech\" stocks moved largerly side-ways with two outliers - HXL running into Covid19 trouble as an aerospace supplier and VRTX posting impressive earnings and continuing to execute well on their plan. All in all the valuations of these companies remained sensible in contrast to the \"efficient stocks\". While these should be the higher risk stocks, they seem now like a more reasonable investment.  \n\nLet's see what happens in one year!",

        "selftext": "My first option was 5 $BA calls which I sold with a little 30% profit last month. The 2nd one was a $TSLA 1500c for last week which expired worthless, auto exercised by my broker, triggered a $40K margin call, gave me 3 and half hour to meet the call on this Monday which forced me to sell all my $TSLA shares that inspired me to create a post here which you can check from my post history.\n\nYesterday I bought another $TSLA call (1600c 07/24) at 3:59 pm which I have been watching like a hawk the whole day. At some point it was up by $3.2K (33%) today but I needed more. So, I hold it to make a lot more money tomorrow or Friday. While as of now SP is about 60-70 points above my strike price and I have two more days left, I am a little concerned about IV crush.\n\nMy 1st option was free, 2nd one kind of fucked me but what about this one? Aren't the options follow a trend? like every odd number of my options will just go brrrrrrr? Also, profit for the 1st one was 33% does that indicate that the profit for this one would be 333%?\n\n**Edit:** Here is the detail of my purchase\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/AolpsQg](https://imgur.com/a/AolpsQg)\n\n**Edit 2**: Just did a little calculation. The value of  IV index for 7 days is 139%. The index is at 124%, 113%, 104%, 94%, 92%, 91%, and 87% for 14, 21, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 days. So, if the IV crush heavily tomorrow what would be a possible number? From these index values, you can see that the volatility is too high. For instance, 7 days IV index for MSFT is only 45% and 34% for 150 days. Now if the volatility of TSLA reduced heavily and goes back to it's 90 days value of 92% (note that this stock still has a lots of volatility due to upcoming S&amp;P 500 inclusion, battery day in september etc). So, IV index change from 139% to 92% is about 34% crush. A change like this would give me a profit of $1290, $10485 and $20376 for SP of $1700, $1800 and $1900. But, I do not think the IV index will crush from its 7 days value to 90 days value just after the earning which means my tendies might be even bigger.     \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "selftext": "*Ahoy!*\n\nThe NASDAQ high-fliers are extremely overbought and getting sloppy, but markets frequently rise much further than logic would dictate.\n\n[**Microsoft (MSFT) has just reported earnings and is still consolidating within a 15 point range**](https://i.imgur.com/FZsCvFg.png), building up energy for the next movement.\n\n**A break above $214/share would be a long signal**, with the stop being below $201/share. This gap of $13 between the entry price and the stop represents your \"risk,\" which needs to be sized to no more than 1-2% of your account value.\n\nFor example, if you traded a ten share position, then your aggregate risk would be $130. This represents a 2% risk position for an $6500 account.\n\nAlternatively, a more efficient way to trade this breakout in a limited-risk fashion is with **MSFT vertical spreads using the 28AUG series**, where you can limit the risk/contract to *no more than $125/contract.*\n\nBe aware of the 8/19 ex-dividend if playing call spreads.\n\nIf you are wary of the large drop off following yesterday's earnings report, it's likely due to Azure  expected growth under-performing (+47% vs +55% Est), but there's also a good chance that when cash markets open MSFT goes up anyway.  Even Microsoft subscriptions growth has dropped in half. LinkedIn also, which resulted in layoffs recently.\n\nThat said, they are in the right sector at the right time, so these fundamentals are less noteworthy than you might expect.\n\nIf you haven't done so already, be sure subscribe to the [**Trade Of The Day subreddit**](https://www.reddit.com/r/tradeoftheday/) to talk more about stocks / options / crypto / spacs / everything else trading!\n\nCheers and beers,\n\nReadySetTrade",

        "selftext": " Forget  the hype about Tesla, Amazon is undervalued and is the safest place to  park your money. I breakdown the reasons why below. Excuse the long  post, but I like helping people make $. TLDR at the end.\n\nThe  only way to look at Amazon's business is to separate it out into three  very large businesses, I will break down each and why I believe the  company as a whole is undervalued:\n\nA/  Retail &amp; Marketplace - this is the consumer facing portion of their  business where Amazon buys at wholesale and then sells to shoppers. The  latter (Marketplace), is the faster growing and more profitable  business unit, now accounting for over 55% of all orders. Sellers use  FBA and sell their products to shoppers directly where Amazon takes a  \\~7%-\\~15% fee depending on the category.\n\nB/  AWS \u2013 fast growing cloud business operating at 26% gross margins with a  $50B run-rate growing 30% YoY (do you know how crazy it was typing that  out?)\n\nC/ Amazon Media Group -  this includes their fast growing advertising business, Twitch, Amazon  Music, and Amazon Prime Video. This is the least-known portion of their  business, but is the fastest growing with highest margins.\n\n**Retail &amp; Marketplace**\n\nThere\u2019s  not much to say here, other than Amazon does roughly \\~$250B in sales  and growing 30% YoY on average here. For reference, Walmart does \\~$500B.  Even if you gave the retail/marketplace portion of Amazon\u2019s business a  conservative valuation of $500B (2x revenue), it\u2019s a very large  business. Now, take into consideration how much they are emphasizing 3P  sellers and private label products, Amazon\u2019s profitability metrics will  greatly improve in this business as it lowers its overhead so the  business in value will continue to grow. This also fails to mention  their breadth of their FBA business and how many sellers use the product  offering. If anyone has sold anything on Amazon or knows someone that  does, 99% of sellers use FBA because of how easy, convenient, and  cost-effective it is. With the tailwinds associated with COVID, this  business will likely surpass 30% YoY growth, which is just incredible  growth #s for a business this large. In comparison, Walmart is usually  &lt;10% YoY growth when it comes to their revenue metrics.\n\nMy valuation of the business = \\~$500B - $750B\n\n**AWS**\n\nAWS  is projected to do around $50B-$60B in sales for 2020. Latest public  analyst valuations peg it around \\~$500B, which I believe is unfair. For  reference, MongoDB is trading at 20x revenue, Crowdstrike, DOCU,  Datadog, all SAAS/cloud providers are trading at 20x or even more!\n\nValuing  AWS as a standalone business for anything less than $500B would be  under-representing just how large and fast-growing this business is.  Growing at 30% YoY at a $50B run-rate is just unfathomable. If we were  looking at this at a 20x revenue multiple (which I believe it would be  valued at a 20x multiple if it was a standalone company), AWS would be  at a $1 trillion market cap alone. It's the de-facto choice for  start-ups, even as Azure continues to take customers away, AWS is the  leader for all new tech/start-up companies and will continue to see  massive tailwinds as the entire economy shifts to cloud-based offerings.  COVID has also accelerated this business as usage is undoubtedly up for  their core segment of customers, while customers that are most affected  (restaurants) are not really AWS-like customers.\n\nMy valuation of this business unit = $650B\n\n**Amazon Media Group**\n\nAdvertising  \u2013 Many people don\u2019t know much about this business, but you know the  products you click on while you\u2019re shopping around on Amazon? It\u2019s safe  to say a bunch of those products are paying Amazon significant dollars  on a PPC basis (pay-per-click) to surface higher in the search results.  This business generated $14 billion in revenue in 2019. Google, the  leader in advertising, is valued at 10x revenue, so this business alone  is probably worth close to $16B after 2020 alone. $FB did $73B in  revenue trailing 12 months, this would mean FB is about 4.5x the size of  Amazon's Advertising business ALONE. I just compared FB as a whole to  Amazon's \"side-business\" in Advertising.\n\nTwitch  \u2013 this is a tough business to value, but Needham and others have pegged  it at \\~$15 billion alone. It\u2019s the clear leader in online streaming and  Microsoft recently shutdown Mixer (their Twitch competitor). The  possibilities here are endless, look for Amazon Advertising to plug in  their data capabilities to target viewers of live streaming events with  products soon. Twitch will soon be merged into the advertising ecosystem  to begin serving targeted ads to viewers. Think ad-supported streams  where there is some sort of revenue share back to the streamers. This  feeds into the ecosystem where content creators make more $ (won't  leave), advertisers get access to a valuable niche audience, and Amazon  reaps the benefits of high-value/profitable advertising at 65% gross  margins.\n\nPrime Video \u2013 the most  surprising stat for Prime Video is that 20% of Prime members sign up  primarily for Amazon Prime Video. With over 150M subscribers, analysts  peg the value of Prime Video alone at $200b. Amazon has also entered the  OTT ad-supported streaming market with IMDB TV (ad-supported free  television). This is exclusive inventory that Amazon can offer to brands  to advertise on, and compete directly with ROKU, which is valued at 15X  revenue.\n\nLastly, Amazon Music has  30M subscribers. Apple has 60M, and Spotify 100M. Amazon Music (Who the  fuck uses it, is already half the size of Apple Music and about a 3rd  of Spotify...)\n\nBecause all the  businesses aren\u2019t broken out, it\u2019s tough valuing the entire Media Group  business, but it honestly could be in the range of anywhere b/w  $300B-$600B off the synergies and potential for expansion. Again, as a  standalone business, this suite of products would have public market  investors salivating over the growth potential.\n\n**Hidden Value (Areas of Opportunity)**\n\nI  went this entire DD without mentioning the huge competitive MOATs  around voice (Echo = the leader), as well as their entire  logistics/ground fulfillment network, Amazon GO stores, and their  venture in the medical health space. Because it's nearly impossible to  value these things as a whole, you can basically pencil w/e you want  here from a valuation perspective.\n\n*Amazon Retail/Marketplace Business - $650B*\n\n*AWS - $650B*\n\n*Amazon Media Group - $400B*\n\n*Hidden  Value - Go stores, Fulfillment Network, Self-driving, Echo (voice),  Whole Foods, Medical Venture with JP Morgan &amp; Berkshire = $300B*\n\n**Total = $2B**\n\nTLDR:  Amazon is undervalued at a $1.6B market cap, and the stock will be up  to $3500 in the next year. Business units valued as stand-alone  companies would be valued way more, growth potential is endless, and  COVID has accelerated trends in favor of Amazon for the next 5 yrs.\n\n\\- Longterm bag holder",

        "selftext": "This has got to be free tendies and so I am YOLOing for the first time with the target to long VIX then close positions on July 31.\n\n**Few things to note:**\n\n* This week and next week will most likely be **tech week**. Expect tech stocks to rally hard (this week more than the next).\n* SPY ETF consists of  \n\n[SPY ETF Composition](https://preview.redd.it/rux5m5t7p1c51.png?width=401&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3994a19a7624df7bc3da5115c9330071562a5c8)\n\n[https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/portfolioComposition.jhtml?symbols=SPY](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/portfolioComposition.jhtml?symbols=SPY) \n\n**Summary:**\n\n* The S&amp;P 500 Index is constructed using a weighted average market capitalization, which means larger companies have a greater weighting in the index.\n   * You can see that the tech stocks represent \\~27% of SPY ETF. Even though AMZN, MSFT, FB, AAPL, beat earnings, I suspect there will be major sell offs; thus, SPY will plummet (and VIX will rise). Unlike the last ER, all of these are currently at ATH in anticipation for the upcoming ER release, and many will sell due to no pending tech news followed by a significant drop in buying power.\n   * We observed a near \\~3% (290 -&gt; 282) drop at the end of tech rally 3 months ago on April 30 (after AMZN released their ER)\n* VIX just hit a 5-month All-Time-Low @ $24.50\\~\n\n[VIX Index](https://preview.redd.it/pizgacgpr1c51.png?width=1519&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb25f162ed87299b668134b39eb8e9ed78aaedfd)\n\n**Predictions:**\n\n* IT (expect this industry to rise until July 30 with slight fluctuations here and there. Then fall on July 31)\n* Health Care (expect this industry to rise slightly until July 31 unless there's promising vaccine news)\n* Communication Services (Remain static until July 31)\n* Consumer Discretionary (Remain static until July 31)\n* Financials (Drop or remain static until July 31)\n* Industrial (Drop or remain static until July 31)\n* Consumer Staples (No comment)\n* Utilities (Drop or remain static until July 31)\n* Real Estate (No comment)\n* Materials (No comment)\n* Energy (Drop or remain static until July 31)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Due to the nature of SPY ETF composition coupled with the speculation above, SPY will fall hard on July 31.\n* As with timings, target to close your VIX calls July 31 early morning unless there is major slide before this date.\n\n**Caveats:**\n\n* Good vaccine news before July 31 and tech stocks remain static or still increase.\n* No tech selloffs post ER.\n* I'm retarded.\n\nVIX 27c 08/05",

        "selftext": "Hi, this was a comment of mine on another thread here and I just thought I wanted to share it as a post and maybe if some people from another country that's not the US and want to be able to trade US stock/options, feel free to dm me and I'll give you some tips on how I got my TD account running. If this is wrong, please feel free to delete my post but don't ban me :(((\n\n\nI'm 21 from Vietnam and our money has little value, 500usd is like average monthly salary here. It's pretty hard to access US stock trading from where I'm from. I got a TDA account, they allow foreign account, then ask a friend of mine in the US to fund it and I send him money over Paypal or Transferwise. My countries doesn't even allow bank wire to fund international investing. \n\n\nI started in Feb with the SPCE crazed, missed TSLA, MSFT due to TDA handling my account creation a bit too long (was my fault at first but their handling was the main problem). Proceed to make big with SPCE in a week, I turn 2k into 6k and it was amazing, that's like a year of salary for an average person here and still being in uni that was a dream for me. I work pretty hard to make money here, part time and trying to open my own company and making 6k in such a short amount of time was crazy. \n\n\nI did spent a few years learning before I was 18 (to be allowed to create an account). Wanted to get in heavy on AMD when they were sub 2 (I study Computer Engineer and love PC so I kinda felt how big Ryzen was) but didn't have the chance. \n\n\nSo after SPCE was around Feb 20 and the market started crashing, lost a lot to sub 1k then I moved to SPY put and made back to 3k.\n\n\nThen lost a bunch on The Witching. Down to 300 and proceed to lose them with put when market shoot back up. Finally some friend decided they wanna give it a go and invest some money with me trading and he'll just watch.\n\nHaving learnt a bunch from my past experience, I managed to turn his 500 into 4000 with pennystock and I get to keep 2000 which was back to even. Took a lot of good risk management and making multiple small smart play.\n\n\nThat was a month ago, now I'm down to 800 but I'm feeling like I'm getting a lot better compares to when I start.\n\n\nMost of the lost was due to lack of day trading with penny stock and some momentum options play gone wrong.\n\n\nMy biggest mistake and biggest gainer was both due to going too big on a position. I'm learning to control that.\n\n\nAnw, that was a long rant, I never really share these things since there's no one around me that I can talk about this. All I hear people say is that I'm gambling, which might seems like it looking at my history but I kinda think it's justified right now due to never before seen volatility.\n\n\nI learnt a lot and feel excited for my trading future but man the losses take their tolls. Probably gonna finish uni next year and try to get my company of the ground while doing small investing. Learning about the market, news and general financial, business helped me a lot with my career I feel.\n\n\nHope this somehow answer your question and good luck to us all. At the end of the day I just want everyone to live more comfortably with their side income and seeing the loss porn might be hilarious but there's always a person behind those loss as well as their family. It's fine if you lose 100k while sitting on millions but man some adults just scares me and I'm grateful to learn from their mistakes.\n\n\nI want to make 25k before the end of next year so I can day trade. Just making 100 usd a day would allow me to fund my company and let my parents retire soon especially during this harsh Covid time. \n\n\nVietnam was free of covid for a month or two but just yesterday we have emergency news that a case popped up and spread.\n\n\nSorry for my long rant, hope you all enjoy your weekend and get those tendies next week. Sorry for my bad English :)",

        "selftext": "I am new to options and made a huge beginner mistake. After MSFT earnings came out they went down 2.5% AH, and when the market opened Thursday morning they were down 2% @ $207.50. I felt like this was a huge over reaction so I went all in and bought 5 8/28 $210 calls. By market close that same day I was already down $780 since MSFT dipped from -2% to -4.4%. Today it hit $197 shortly after market open which caused my calls to dip a ton. Even though MSFT ended up mostly recovering and ending up only 0.6% negative, since the IV decreased significantly I still lost a shit ton of money. Now after 2 days I am down $1,400, which is a lot for me since I only had $3,000 in my portfolio prior to going all in on MSFT. \n\nI honestly am not sure what to do now. I still have over a month until it expires but I do not know whether or not I should pull out at a loss or to hold and wait for it to go back up. I should of done more research about how IV worked before buying these calls and should of known not to go all in but I can\u2019t go back in time and change what I did. I learned my lesson and I\u2019m not going to make these same mistakes again. \n\nWill MSFT IV go back up? I am not sure what to do, if IV keeps dropping even if MSFT goes up or trades sideways I\u2019ll never break even.

        "selftext": "TLDR - I've made about 5 wrong bets in a row, so I'm a certified smooth brained options trader/investor. Inverse everything I say below, I'll get to the points with bullets cause I know you guys have an attention span on a squirrel.\n\nTESLA - $1350 PT\n\n* Price movement catalyzed by hype of SP500 inclusion. Ramp up is too quick and $1800 price did not build support. Drop from $1800 to $1400's was not a consolidation as the sell volume was too high and too quick. Profit take happens after ER. Buy your FD puts for Jul 24th/Jul 31st. \n* Also, Tesla \"price cut\" is a sham. Try looking on their website and build out the standard package. MSRP starts $32k, basic package for everything + delivery + taxes + destination fees = 44k OTD. This was around the same price as pre-discount, only difference is that they included the tax incentives and gas savings into the price structure to create the illusion of a cheaper vehicle. Model Y price cut is also the same, except they are not doing a lease option much quicker (within 1 month of release) than they did for the Tesla 3 (2 years later). Could be good/could be bad, idk.\n\nSNAP - $18 PT\n\n* Staddling is the play. Go relatively ITM or 5% out both sides. Options implied move is 14%, with 17% ER average move. Assuming these standard movements, one side will out-lever the other for a small profit. \n* If you're retarded and want to roll a nice, puts. Snapchat is shit. Their technology is shit. No one has time for Snapchat these days. \n\nMicrosoft - $220 PT\n\n* Not much needs to be said. Stay at home structure works, cloud tech gaining marketshare, Teams integration more frequent. Just don't kill yourself with puts, that's all. \n\nNIO - $15\n\n* Sounds retarded, but this can be your hedge for tesla. A cheap hedge. NIO will move in the same direction as TSLA. If you want to be retarded and buy calls on tesla, buy your puts as a hedge. \n\nAZN/Moderns - FD puts\n\n* Moderna is ass. Directors, CEO, CMO sold off shares like blue meth on the streets. \n* AZN riding on that vaccine band wagon. Both companies are turd. \n\nNKLA - PUTS\n\n* Trevor is gay.",

        "selftext": "Ok so a few days ago, NASDAQ was going down with tech heavy hitters dropping a little bit. Within a few days, they\u2019ve all recovered and are on pace to reach ATH or beyond (Amazon, Tesla, Sea, Microsoft). All the dips in the last few days were cancelled out with one short trading session. Honest question, are you guys still cash? Or putting in money in such hefty valuations? It seems like it\u2019s only gonna go up. The only possible inhibiting factors would be end July- end of July stimulus package and it may not be finalized until after the August recess. And next we would have second wave of covid in fall and finally elections in November... which will be able to stop the hefty valuations???",

        "selftext": "**Recap**\n\nLast week, I posted Bullish Option Plays \\[2-4 Month Horizon\\], found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hrbexa/bullish\\_options\\_plays\\_24\\_month\\_horizon/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hrbexa/bullish_options_plays_24_month_horizon/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)\n\n**TL, DR:**\n\n*WFC $27.50c Oct 16 2020, $1.30 DOWN to $1.12 today*\n\n*WFC $30c Oct 16 2020, $0.79 DOWN to $0.63 today*\n\n*TWTR $40c Dec 18 2020, $3.25 UP to $4.25 today*\n\n*TWTR $40c Jan 15 2020, $3.45 UP to $4.50 today*\n\n*LUV $40c Dec 18 2020, $3.05 DOWN to $2.77 today*\n\n*LUV $40c Jan 15 2020, $3.40 DOWN to $3.20 today*\n\n*ERIC $11 Nov 20 2020, $0.50 UP to $1.50 today*\n\nTWTR and ERIC contracts netted +$305 on a $720 investment. WFC and LUV netted -$79 on a $854 investment. *These figures are based on buying one of each contract last week and selling them today*.\n\n**This post covers 3 Bullish or Bearish Option Plays across various industries.**\n\nCriteria for selecting Option Plays:\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM +\n* Uptrend or Downtrend detected\n\nUsing these criteria, I have curated a basket of plays. The time frame of these options are 3-6 months out, to avoid Theta burn and maximize ITM potential. The beauty of long plays is that the stock only needs to move a few % to be profitable, with a long time horizon as a hedge. Close the position within 2-4 months to minimize theta and maximize delta opportunity. I have also included a shorter time frame with higher risk/reward and lower premiums. Short plays are laid out, but not recommended.\n\n**1) Twitter $TWTR \\[Technology\\] - BULLISH**\n\nI recommended Twitter last week, and will do it again. Earnings, shaking off the security breach, and upcoming features all make $TWTR a very strong bullish pick.\n\nTwitter is poised to dominate with its huge reach and rumored subscription platform for content creators. Source:\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing)\n\nThis is a buy the rumor, sell the news play. I anticipate Twitter announcing this platform in the next 3 months. Twitter is up 3.5% today with earnings on Thursday, 3 days away.\n\nBullish Twitter Case:\n\nInvestments in product enhancements and video content could return the monthly active user growth rate to the double digits.\n\nThe deal with the NFL to live-stream Thursday night games and provide a platform for interaction and conversation about the games may attract more premium content providers to use the Twitter platform.\n\nGrowth in ad revenue per user remains strong at Twitter, more than offsetting the deceleration in user growth.\n\n[$TWTR Profile, from FindMarketPlays early access platform](https://preview.redd.it/bo8rzhhw83c51.png?width=3256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24a9bb3bc17df5398c5b485d4594f39d7918a14d)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap \\[29B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[30M\\]\n* Uptrend detected \\[Strong upward trend since March\\]\n\n[$TWTR overlay with $SNAP and $FB - the three social media giants posting huge gains](https://preview.redd.it/v52p8ht793c51.png?width=1082&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51c3f1edbc2536059e6e50a3db71f854245097a1)\n\nThe value that $TWTR and $FB lost due to lack of advertiser revenue has been recouped. The arrival of a subscription service is very bullish, because more and more people are looking to make money online since being laid off by COVID - Twitter's reach makes it incredibly well positioned to solve this problem. Subscriptions made $MSFT and $AAPL cash cows, expect the same for $TWTR.\n\nThe security fears involving accounts of Elon Musk, Bill Gates and the like have been squashed. By taking the breach as a positive, Twitter will beef up security for their accounts and prevent such attacks from occurring again.\n\nLets take a look at the options scanner:\n\n[Big money on a upwards $TWTR move, from FindMarketPlays early access platform](https://preview.redd.it/fcwcfeuya3c51.png?width=1946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a69a702620df59648ab047e9beb964d89372fa8a)\n\nDespite recommending this play last week, $TWTR surprised even me these past few days, completely powering through the security breach and meeting my % target 2 months early. Today, taking a Strike of $40, that is 8% OTM of the current price. If they announce the platform within the next 6 months (I predict they will), the stock will explode.\n\nWith this information, I propose:\n\n**Short Term Play \\[HIGH RISK\\]:**\n\n*TWTR $40c Aug 21 2020, trading at $1.81 at time of writing. 31% Probability ITM.*\n\n**Long Term Play:**\n\n*TWTR $40c Jan 15 2020, trading $4.50 at time of writing. 35% Probability ITM*\n\n**2) Moderna $MRNA \\[Biotechnology\\] - BEARISH**\n\n$MRNA has been riding the wave of COVID-19, and mercilessly profiteering off vaccine news. It popped on my radar because it made it on my most active movers watchlist, down 12% today.\n\n[Moderna Profile, from FindMarketPlays early access platform](https://preview.redd.it/3qi2d44fe3c51.png?width=3244&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fce5c1c7700bc516502f662ee67ef42e6844ffe)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap \\[32B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[43M\\]\n* Downtrend detected \\[Strong downtrend, crashing off ATH\\]\n\n[$MRNA has a history of big dumps.

A staggering 15,685,052 shares sold vs 55,568 bought in the **last 3 months**. Has executives selling a stock ever been a bullish sign?\n\n[Out of 15,740,620 shares traded in 3 months, only 55,568 were bought. From NASDAQ](https://preview.redd.it/7qx22f53d3c51.png?width=782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef9c35c4d5da6f8a46f48bfe2a96c79310c8d46a)\n\nProfiteering off vaccine news, insider selling, a history of large drops, and meets all the criteria; $MRNA is a prime candidate for a bearish play.\n\nLet's take a look at the options scanner:\n\n[Someone selling a huge amount of $105 calls last week](https://preview.redd.it/61hge25pf3c51.png?width=1982&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68260ba42121a31e067dc2a41b9e6b3dc2aac6c3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Someone selling a huge amount of $95 calls last week](https://preview.redd.it/caypu9fuf3c51.png?width=1982&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e433fba6a32890d674620a998bfbfbabd04eee4f)\n\nThe expiration and sheer quantity of premium collected on these theta plays tell me that someone with at least $25,000,000 in buying power is betting against $MRNA.\n\nWith this information, I propose:\n\n**Short Term Play \\[HIGH RISK\\]:**\n\n*MRNA $60p Aug 21 2020, trading at $1.83 at time of writing. 20% Probability ITM.*\n\n**Long Term Play:**\n\n*MRNA $55p Oct 16 2020, trading $5.25 at time of writing. 34% Probability ITM.*\n\n**3) Beyond Meat $BYND \\[Food, Major Diversified\\] - BULLISH**\n\nEveryone remembers the run up of BYND, and the spectacular crash. Unsurprisingly, it is hardly talked about across finance communities anymore, because it is finally consolidating around a range that I can feel comfortable with, especially with the quiet adoption of plant-based food sweeping the country and fast food chains.\n\nBullish Beyond Meat case:\n\nPlant-based meats (PBM) should continue to grow rapidly as the products gain additional share from the traditional ground meat category.\n\nBeyond Meat should be a major beneficiary of PBM growth, given its first-mover advantage, and the brand\u2019s strong performance in taste tests (consistently second only to privately held Impossible Foods).\n\nWe think Beyond Meat is the most likely PBM supplier to secure a U.S. deal with McDonald's, as Impossible Foods has backed out of the race, stating it does not have sufficient capacity to supply the chain.\n\n[Beyond Meat Profile, from FindMarketPlays early access platform](https://preview.redd.it/x9hk3tewh3c51.png?width=3320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35905e85c4db29eddeaee79d6a57fd40d8cb4b89)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap \\[8B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[5M\\]\n* Uptrend detected \\[Consolidating near support, KFC news\\]\n\n[$120-$130 has served as a key support\\/resistance for $BYND in 2020](https://preview.redd.it/9d45mw4ai3c51.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=289c0441e2f8099179fc4320add1676a4fdce397)\n\nKFC is testing Beyond Meat fried chicken.

We have a lot of those employees who basically now come to a WeWork facility to use it one day, a week, two days a week, three days a week,\u201d Mr Claure added.\n\nCompany says revenue was flat during the crisis. After SoftBank bailed the company out they added Marcelo Claure as chairman, who is credited with turning around Sprint and negotiating their merger with T-Mobile. The new CEO is Sandeep Mathrani who previously took over GGP when it was coming out of bankruptcy and led it to acquisition by Brookfield.\n\nI said this back in [May](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/gq7red/credit_suisse_is_preparing_for_layoffs_as_ceo/frs10kk/?context=3) and I'm really glad to see WeWork pivoting in this direction.

        "selftext": "I'm going to leave out the obligatory background bit about why my two cents might be helpful.  Just dig it up in my history.\n\nThere's profit-taking and sector rotation and then there is collapse. The first is a very healthy trim of the froth that built up over the past few months. Investors are simply reallocating the profitable portions of their book to previously avoided sectors to participate in their anticipated rise.  Collapse is when everybody, and I mean everybody, sell absolutely everything, even at deep losses just to get out.\n\nRight now, we are seeing a measured and controlled trimming.  Short-term cash might move over to tradeable opportunities in the non-tech space for a few weeks, maybe even just days but the US economy is an absolute mess right now. There are truly only two smart positions, well-establish tech equity and cash. It will flow back into tech at a discount.  The same people selling are the same people buying back at a 20% discount.\n\nI've got no advice for you if you're rolling dice with P&amp;Ds, buying bankrupt companies or flipping ridiculously short-term options but if you're like most people here, buying companies because they make sense over a longer time horizon and especially in a post Covid world (if that's even possible), the next few days or weeks will not matter after a few months.\n\nSo what do I currently own?\n\n30% cash, PFE, WMT, MSFT, AMZN, AMD, NVDA, GOOG, AAPL and TSLA.  All are still substantially in the green. I've trimmed about 25% of all positions last week and move over the cash. VIX is currently at 28.  In March, it was 80.   \n\nSo folks, it's cool.

My economic research and model largely revolves around increasing Mexican-American trade after USMCA changes and I write around organizations that will be affected by Mexican development and American innovation.

Institutions and financieers are investing in logistics and data center real estate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# DBX 24-26c 8/21\n\n# DBX 24c 9/18\n\n[https://assets-global.website-files.com/580ea75512564ed05c3a8455/5bfc62c5aca97fa17998085e\\_dropbox-blog-image-1434x590.jpg](https://assets-global.website-files.com/580ea75512564ed05c3a8455/5bfc62c5aca97fa17998085e_dropbox-blog-image-1434x590.jpg)\n\n# # My Belief\n\n**Dropbox is in the right place at the right time, much like a recycled cardboard boxing company is in logistics.** Cloud computing is complex and Big Tech will antitrust and decoupling pressures as time goes on. These companies are not stupid and are able to survive the change by decentralizing and consolidating over time. Telecom, oil, and other industries have done this in the past. However, this is probably the weakest factor in Dropbox's position.\n\nThe simple truth is that the marketshare of files and file processing is fucking huge and it's possible to grow at a respectable rate despite the fact that iCloud, Google Drive, and AWS S3 exists.  There are banking, manufacturing, and other data processors that require this shit and it's the same reason you're seeing organizations like ZScaler grow.\n\n* Adobe has a strong grasp on video, animated, and drawn files\n* Dropbox blessed legions of academics with window-mac file problems\n* Microsoft has made an enormous change by acquiring software engineering files via Github and NPM, which leverages them further into software automation with Softomotive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*We focus particularly on the use cases that are complementary. And we see ourselves as playing an important role in terms of taking a couple steps back and making sure the overall experience is coherent. More than we're trying to engage in a dogfight with any particular tool or facet of the experience.* \\- Dropbox CEO\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oodnkwv4q5c51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd6c45b7abd0d7db7b89d6540896cb40e218abd0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6aqbxas5q5c51.jpg?width=2716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da9655de09d81bba1c11d14a6b71a7b94b05c591\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pinsndv6q5c51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1d162b2f7b72a356b86a8ed6be5365c21a0de83\n\nI actually view Dropbox closer to Adobe and DocuSign, but much more of a longterm cloud infrastructure layer rather than a sexy app that enhances the experience of using devices like iPad Pros and such.\n\nYou can do a lot of cool shit with files and I'm sure that the leadership behind DropBox is highly cognizant of the possibilities behind legal software, contract security, signature software, transactions, and other critical supply chain elements like academic management, IT support, and a financially robust competitor that institutions are happy to purchase stake in. This is file tooling and it's a big fucking industry that will be empowered by AI, computer vision, data processing, and the real estate of large data centers.\n\nIm making this over simplified, but the IT world is structured in layers. This extends from your router to your internet provider's telecommunication. You can imagine that organizations like Cloudflare &amp; Dropbox exist in separate layers under the same idea.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8np7stlg5c51.png?width=3518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc38df1402a4220c8beccdeb3d467bf27847b3e9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8tso1caia5c51.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98513757632de2d7900842a2ace2951be58c7360\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2401iz3oa5c51.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a697cbc38f89c84c7150c7fc8102778a6f3bb14\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p47zwp8os5c51.png?width=1047&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=486885d26d0b1122738df569e2accae89bc5ce22\n\n# # Why Dropbox?\n\nIn short, DropBox is wildly popular among\n\n\\- Academics\n\n\\- Accountants\n\n\\- HR teams\n\n\\- Deep Technology relationships over the past decade (early Spotify, startups, app integrations)\n\n\\- Anyone that has to deal with a fuck ton of files all of the time.\n\nDropbox is very similar to Cloudflare.

        "selftext": "Okay so this post is not for any quick moves.. this is advice for 6 months to a year. AMD is having success on both it's major fronts. It's CPU wins should be well known and are the reason it has good cash flow: \n\n* Today it just announced two new OEM partnerships with laptop makers. \n* They are dominating Intel currently in the custom market\n* They are at least competitive in the mobile market somewhere Intel is not yet. \n* They are progressively chipping away at the server market share from Intel with cheaper hardware that outperforms much more expensive Intel hardware. \n* The Intel product line has repeatedly gotten criticism for being stale, unexciting and expensive and that was before their star engineer quit months ago\n* CPU partnerships lead to GPU partnerships\n* The fact that they are fabless means they have really good relationships with semiconductor makers. They are able to produce really good custom chips for consoles in ways Intel and NVIDIA simply cannot. They also are advancing their chip architecture much faster than the other two because of these partnerships, offsetting deficiencies in R&amp;D funding. \n\nThe reason AMD is about to really be undervalued is its GPU market. NVIDIA has dominated this segment for years and they are about to hit a wall. \n\n* The rumors and leaks continue to back very significant performance increases to their next gen GPU. The are applying the same methodology to the GPU as they are have with the CPU that has had so much success. They will finally have a top tier card to compete with NVIDIA, or if they don't with the new release they will in a year because:\n* AMD GPUs are going into both next gen consoles from Sony and Msft. This has helped AMD with cash flow in the past but it's much more significant now. Vulkan is a close to the metal API that outperforms directX. The issue here is most game developers have not made games using this API. This is about to change with the next gen consoles. As AMD hardware lines the inside of these devices game devs will start to rapidly switch over to this API. This api is also supported on all systems (linux, windows, consoles) so devs can make much better use of it porting games that will perform well on all systems. This will edge out custom nivida contracts for games and put AMD's api at the forefront of game development. \n* Their good relationship with their fabs means they will continue to dominate the lower tier GPU market\n* Their CPU knowledge makes their integrated graphics basically the best in the business which puts them way ahead in the high-end mobile and low-end OEM markets\n\nI got no calls for you guys other than don't go buying FDs but Intel and probably NVIDIA are going to lose bigly here over the 6 months. You can see the way the market is moving that it knows the market share from failing Intel is just going right into AMD's pocket. AMD has their CPU game on lock and their R&amp;D is finally funding their GPU. Just watch what happens if you want but I'm telling you how to make some trendies here.... just fucking be patient and don't buy calls for next week and go long.",

The time frame of these options are 3-6 months out, to avoid Theta burn and maximize ITM potential. The beauty of these plays is that the stock only needs to move up a few % to be profitable, with a long time horizon as a hedge. Close the position within 2-4 months to minimize theta and maximize delta opportunity. \n\n**1) Wells Fargo $WFC \\[BANKING\\]**\n\nWells just got hammered after an expected poor earnings. This makes it a prime candidate for upward movement.\n\nBullish Wells Fargo Case: \n\nWells has a history of prudent underwriting, and we are probably closer than not to a turn in the credit cycle.\n\nWells Fargo's retail branch structure, advisory network, product offerings, and share in small and medium-size enterprises is difficult to duplicate, ensuring that the company's competitive advantage is maintained.\n\nWells offers the scale advantages of a money center bank without the risks and volatility associated with extensive capital markets operations.\n\n[Wells Fargo Profile, from my personal research platform](https://preview.redd.it/ln8hjd3hkva51.png?width=3338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34c36c2a9d23b21b2a82b7ba6d19bdaeab4d0811)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap  \\[99B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[46M\\]\n* Uptrend detected \\[Bounced off 52Wk Low as support\\]\n* \\*\\*Within 10% of 52 Week Low \\[52 Week Low was $22, WFC is trading at $24.14\\]\n\n[$WFC Overlay with $JPM - The charts are nearly identical](https://preview.redd.it/hleymqo1mva51.png?width=1110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=871a3aa9795b6f39e0b3b3ce1f54e3c1af34e556)\n\nAs a big 4 bank, it is impossible for the Fed to allow WFC to go down. They have a good balance sheet, with a P/E ratio of 8.9, down from 11. The lower P/E ratio alone will bring in more long-term investors. If that isn't enough to make you comfortable, WFC offers a whopping 8% dividend yield, making it even more attractive. \n\nThis is an attractive investment for both options and stocks.\n\nLet's take a look at options on $WFC, which I found using my unusual options scanner:\n\n[Big Bullish bets for October 16 2020, 2 days after their next earnings. ](https://preview.redd.it/0ohji0l2ova51.png?width=3354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d7bb6293c1d8fb4d3e79b54d9f0274eec8de2f0)\n\n[More Bullish Bets on WFC for October 16 2020](https://preview.redd.it/hf683xmlova51.png?width=3354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96e327f7aeca2a2dd8a5aad2a36c17184d07e7bb)\n\nThese huge bets range from $25 to $30, 3 months down the line. This averages to a $2.5, or 11% increase over the next 3 months. With this information, I propose:\n\n*WFC $27.50c Oct 16 2020, trading at $1.30 at time of writing. 24% Probability ITM.*\n\n*WFC $30c Oct 16 2020, trading $0.79 at time of writing. 16% Probability ITM.*\n\nI am currently invested in $WFC stock, and hold the $30 Oct 16 Calls.\n\n**2) Twitter $TWTR \\[Technology\\]**\n\nTwitter is poised to dominate with its huge reach and rumored subscription platform for content creators. Source:\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing)\n\nThis is a buy the rumor, sell the news play. I anticipate Twitter announcing this platform in the next 3 months.\n\nBullish Twitter Case:\n\nInvestments in product enhancements and video content could return the monthly active user growth rate to the double digits.\n\nThe deal with the NFL to live-stream Thursday night games and provide a platform for interaction and conversation about the games may attract more premium content providers to use the Twitter platform. \n\nGrowth in ad revenue per user remains strong at Twitter, more than offsetting the deceleration in user growth.\n\n[Twitter Profile, from my personal research platform](https://preview.redd.it/4rsgs7vprva51.png?width=3354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d169d63baad270497c11271a9e34907e642050e)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap  \\[27B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[30M\\]\n* Uptrend detected \\[Strong upward trend since March\\]\n\n[$TWTR Overlay  with $FB - the charts are nearly identical](https://preview.redd.it/e10qmi7csva51.png?width=1124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cd525f27ecab551640be77d81cb4324ba9c7465)\n\nThe value that $TWTR and $FB lost due to lack of advertiser revenue has been recouped. The arrival of a subscription service is very bullish, because more and more people are looking to make money online since being laid off by COVID - Twitter's reach makes it incredibly well positioned to solve this problem. Subscriptions made $MSFT and $AAPL cash cows, expect the same for $TWTR. \n\nThis is an attractive investment for both options and stocks.\n\nLet's take a look at options on $TWTR, which I found using my unusual options scanner:\n\n[Huge Bullish $TWTR bets for Jan 15, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/3b7tab2ntva51.png?width=2988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02e6cf57ae8b131a386a575319a25a14060c893d)\n\n[Huge Bullish $TWTR bets for Jan 15, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/hilyf24ptva51.png?width=2988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a21184af85f93f1ad7c6ab164d3f2c20f0262e8)\n\n[Huge Bullish $TWTR bets for Jan 15, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/4qj7816stva51.png?width=2988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d50b9844aa56cfa978370c9c02ed9c10d9c9ffdd)\n\nThese bets were placed BEFORE COVID, and $TWTR is trading at the same price as when these were placed. The strikes range from $40 to $60, 6 months down the line. Taking a Strike of $40, that is 15% OTM of the current price. If they announce the platform within the next 6 months (I predict they will), the stock will explode.\n\nWith this information, I propose:\n\n*TWTR $40c Dec 18 2020, trading at $3.25 at time of writing. 28% Probability ITM.*\n\n*TWTR $40c Jan 15 2020, trading $3.45 at time of writing. 29% Probability ITM.*\n\nBuying $40 Jan 15 2020 Calls are only $20 more for an extra month. Look to close these after their earnings next quarter, when they will likely announce the subscription platform.\n\nI am currently invested in $TWTR stock, and hold the $40 Dec 18 Calls.\n\n**3) Southwest Airlines $LUV \\[AIRLINES\\]**\n\nWarren Buffet and COVID have caused investors to turn a nose up at airline stocks. I don't blame them - the uncertainty will affect airlines more than most other industries. That said, don't miss this opportunity to profit off Southwest Airlines, as they have the best balance sheet in the industry.\n\nBullish Southwest Airlines Case:\n\nSouthwest enjoys the strongest brand in the industry thanks to its simple fare prices, free checked bags, and solid customer service.

        "selftext": "  \n\nSo, as the title says, I\u2019m a 22-year-old looking for advice about how to handle a roughly $25,000-$30,000 inheritance that I\u2019m receiving. The money is in a Roth IRA at Fidelity. I have no idea what the money is currently invested in, how much is in buying power, and so on. I have a basic idea of how I want to manage the money, but I\u2019m looking for some insight on if I\u2019m in the right ballpark here and if so, how I could better execute my strategy. \n\nFor starters, I\u2019m probably going to sell everything, unless any of it overlaps with the ideas I\u2019m going to lay out in this post.\n\nFrom there, I want to invest half of the funds in dividend and value stocks, and index funds. \n\nI\u2019m thinking at least a quarter of my entire portfolio spread across the three main US indexes, specifically invested in SPY, DOW, and QQQ. I\u2019m interested in investing either the QQQ or SPY portion in a 3x daily bull fund that traces that fund, specifically either TQQQ or SPXL, let me know what you think about that.\n\nThe next eighth I\u2019m wanting to invest into banks. Companies like JPM and C are underperforming the market so heavily right now, and they\u2019ve already confirmed that they\u2019re not cutting dividends. Yes, share buybacks are suspended pending future earnings requirements but I believe that JPM and C are well positioned enough to resume buybacks at the latest by the end of Q1 2021. I genuinely believe that banks are discounted right now and have potential for a great return if they return to their ATH\u2019s. I also like the prospect of their dividend income over time. \n\nThe next eighth I\u2019m wanting to put into funds specifically for their dividends. I don\u2019t really care about the YoY return on these tickers; I\u2019m just interested in the dividend. I\u2019d want to spread it across SPHD, MO, KO, ABBV, SPG, and VYM. \n\nNow for the second half of the fund. I\u2019m wanting to approach this half with a more high-risk, high-reward strategy. \n\nFor the first half of this high-risk high-reward portion (quarter of my total portfolio), I\u2019m just going to invest in growth stocks/ETFs. A couple of tickers I have in mind are ARKK, SOCL, SMH, AMD, FSLY, TSLA, APPL, MSFT, FB, and AMZN.\n\nFor last quarter, I\u2019m not thinking YOLO on an FD type high risk high reward, but I\u2019d definitely like to dabble in options. And this is the portion of my investment that I\u2019m most open to suggestions and ideas. I have some basic ideas though. \n\nMy 1st idea is to keep a quarter of the portfolio in cash and sell cash secured puts on companies that I actually wouldn\u2019t mind buying 100 shares of at the strike. I\u2019d want to continually do this up until the day I inevitably get assigned and then actually purchase those shares. A couple of tickers that I have in mind for playing like this are SNAP and NCLH, (yeah cruise line Robinhood meme stock I know). At which point I\u2019d acquire the shares and then sell covered calls on the shares on the way up, just to reap in additional benefits, again, not minding if I get assigned and have to sell them for that strike. I kind of like this idea the best out of any that I\u2019ve had, just because it seems like the lowest risk, I\u2019d be able to acquire 100 shares of a company that I see growth in, which would probably be the smartest long term play anyways. \n\nMy 2nd idea is to buy LEAPS on banks, specifically JPM or C. I\u2019d just buy calls within +5% of the strike and buy the furthest dated out possible. Simple yeah but I think getting a play with that much time and that much potential delta is a good idea, and its relatively low risk compared to my last idea.\n\nMy last idea is definitely the riskiest and basically, it\u2019s just buying calls for cruises and airlines for June of next year. A potential vaccine announcement, stimulus in the form of travel expense related tax write-offs, as well as the incoming wave of cabin-fever induced travel frenzy are all factors that could honestly cause them to pop-off at any time within the next year. \n\nTLDR;\n\nI\u2019m a 22-year-old inheriting somewhere between $25,000-$30,000 this week and I want to manage the money myself. I\u2019m pretending that each 8\u2019th is about $3,000 to be conservative. My general idea is this:\n\nLong-term, low risk: \n\n1/4 \u2013 US indices, specifically SPY, DOW, and QQQ. Let me know what you think about putting either the SPY or QQQ portion into SPXL or TQQQ.\n\n1/8 \u2013 Banks, probably literally just JPM and C, maybe a little bit of WFC but they suck. \n\n1/8 \u2013 Dividend stocks, specifically SPHD, MO, KO, ABBV, SPG, and VYM. \n\nHigher risk, higher reward:\n\n1/4 \u2013 High growth stocks and ETF\u2019s, specifically ARKK, SOCL, SMH, AMD, FSLY, TSLA, APPL, MSFT, FB, and AMZN. \n\n1/4 \u2013 Three different ideas. 1. Sell cash secured puts on SNAP and NCLH until I get assigned, at which point hold the shares and sell covered calls. 2. LEAPS on banks. 3. LEAPS on travel. \n\nOpen to suggestions, advice, criticism, anything. Any input at all is appreciated. Thanks everyone!",

I am extremely bearish overall but also recognize situations that always pound my ass with green dildos!

June 9-11 -6.8%, may 11-13 -4%, March 5-6,9th -12.3%. 3rd red days Opened 3 points down, opened 13 points down, opened 48 points down.\n\n-Though, this is what happens before a significant pull back after a run! Big boys make choppy waters as they sell off profits and retail holds their bags. Example for retards- you own 10% of $100 stock now at $200. You want to take all profits at top vs $190-$200 area so you unload slowly while it bounces back through highs. This also crushes theta and Vix to make cheaper premiums for your put options plays. This is currently happening no matter whatever side you are pulling for and will result in a transition to a bear market!\n\n-So as a bear now I recognize the boring stuff like I hate that we bounced off 3193 support again Friday with what I felt was never significant pressure. As long as we stay above there then no significant fall will happen. We didn\u2019t have a covering pump Friday which opens up a short squeeze opportunity. Economy is screwed and free money is drying up. Even if republican stimulus proposed Monday is decent it won\u2019t become active for at least a couple weeks but the hype will be there for retailers and pumping will occur for more bags to be transferred. \n\nGreen cases\n-Monday\u2019s are green\n-Following 2 red days\n-Strong support 3193\n-Stimulus proposal \n-Fang run ups into earnings \n-no short covering spike Friday \n-run up into FOMC \n\nRed Cases\n-corona,unemployment, blah blah\n-strong resistance on double top\n-another republican stimulus delay\n-China retaliation \n-Bad Fang earnings\n-FOMC mid week\n\nI think republicans will propose a decent plan Monday with another stimulus check, $200/$400 unemployment additions or 70% pay with cap. You could have filed another 3 months extension for mortgages already and too soon for more PPP. Don\u2019t see a surprise negative happening so just a green dildo Monday/Tuesday followed by a depressing FOMC, stimulus/unemployment finalization concerns, disappointing earnings, weak dollar, and a toppy market.\n\nPositions \n\nSpy 8/21 315 puts (bought near top)\nTqqq 8/21 105 puts (bought near top)\n\n(Bought at low of day)\nSpy 7/29 320 calls\nMsft 7/31 207.5 calls\nINTC 7/31 52 calls\nBaba 7/31 257.5 calls\nAAPL 7/31 380 calls",

And over 64million computers sold this quarter with MSFT 10 on all of them.  And with new statistics saying 1/3 of jobs can be done from home, I think a shit ton of companies will stay that way since it decreases their overhead when they won't have to lease as much space for offices.

Up until the middle of the last decade it was pretty low cost and then you have apple who is knocking on the door to 400. What is there to legitimately expect for MSFT both by the end of the year and years in the future?",

        "selftext": "**This post covers 4 Bullish Option Plays across various industries.**\n\nCriteria for selecting Bullish Options Plays:\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM +\n* Uptrend detected\n\nUsing these criteria, I have curated a basket of plays. The time frame of these options are 3-6 months out, to avoid Theta burn and maximize ITM potential. The beauty of these plays is that the stock only needs to move up a few % to be profitable, with a long time horizon as a hedge. Close the position within 2-4 months to minimize theta and maximize delta opportunity.\n\n**1) Wells Fargo $WFC \\[BANKING\\]**\n\nWells just got hammered after an expected poor earnings. This makes it a prime candidate for upward movement.\n\nBullish Wells Fargo Case:\n\nWells has a history of prudent underwriting, and we are probably closer than not to a turn in the credit cycle.\n\nWells Fargo's retail branch structure, advisory network, product offerings, and share in small and medium-size enterprises is difficult to duplicate, ensuring that the company's competitive advantage is maintained.\n\nWells offers the scale advantages of a money center bank without the risks and volatility associated with extensive capital markets operations.\n\n[Wells Fargo Profile, from my personal research platform](https://preview.redd.it/3f8ujvv2ewa51.png?width=3338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b461e92145d6899d7687ad57875c88594d0ac975)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap \\[99B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[46M\\]\n* Uptrend detected \\[Bounced off 52Wk Low as support\\]\n* \\*\\*Within 10% of 52 Week Low \\[52 Week Low was $22, WFC is trading at $24.14\\]\n\n[$WFC Overlay with $JPM - The charts are nearly identical](https://preview.redd.it/ig0t44y4ewa51.png?width=1110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=689f9828b64c20c7be6b9bd072450fedac1e5668)\n\nAs a big 4 bank, it is impossible for the Fed to allow WFC to go down. They have a good balance sheet, with a P/E ratio of 8.9, down from 11. The lower P/E ratio alone will bring in more long-term investors. If that isn't enough to make you comfortable, WFC offers a whopping 8% dividend yield, making it even more attractive.\n\nThis is an attractive investment for both options and stocks.\n\nLet's take a look at options on $WFC, which I found using my unusual options scanner:\n\n[Big Bullish bets for October 16 2020, 2 days after their next earnings.](https://preview.redd.it/9mcjifp6ewa51.png?width=3354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9e2026e3e5ed0104617eed11e8da53811e6b35b)\n\n[More Bullish Bets on WFC for October 16 2020](https://preview.redd.it/x2xktlc8ewa51.png?width=3354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85d8b91c0ec3fa064cfe526245d3cfc2b8167d79)\n\nThese huge bets range from $25 to $30, 3 months down the line. This averages to a $2.5, or 11% increase over the next 3 months. With this information, I propose:\n\n*WFC $27.50c Oct 16 2020, trading at $1.30 at time of writing. 24% Probability ITM.*\n\n*WFC $30c Oct 16 2020, trading $0.79 at time of writing. 16% Probability ITM.*\n\nI am currently invested in $WFC stock, and hold the $30 Oct 16 Calls.\n\n**2) Twitter $TWTR \\[Technology\\]**\n\nTwitter is poised to dominate with its huge reach and rumored subscription platform for content creators. Source:\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing)\n\nThis is a buy the rumor, sell the news play. I anticipate Twitter announcing this platform in the next 3 months.\n\nBullish Twitter Case:\n\nInvestments in product enhancements and video content could return the monthly active user growth rate to the double digits.\n\nThe deal with the NFL to live-stream Thursday night games and provide a platform for interaction and conversation about the games may attract more premium content providers to use the Twitter platform.\n\nGrowth in ad revenue per user remains strong at Twitter, more than offsetting the deceleration in user growth.\n\n[Twitter Profile, from my personal research platform](https://preview.redd.it/h0s26zv9ewa51.png?width=3354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1918faa353fcf0a92faa3f80688487534c10e73)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap \\[27B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[30M\\]\n* Uptrend detected \\[Strong upward trend since March\\]\n\n[$TWTR Overlay with $FB - the charts are nearly identical](https://preview.redd.it/h1dw581dewa51.png?width=1124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6768d69d773bcacb3889bfdc8e8aba142bbebb88)\n\nThe value that $TWTR and $FB lost due to lack of advertiser revenue has been recouped. The arrival of a subscription service is very bullish, because more and more people are looking to make money online since being laid off by COVID - Twitter's reach makes it incredibly well positioned to solve this problem. Subscriptions made $MSFT and $AAPL cash cows, expect the same for $TWTR.\n\nThis is an attractive investment for both options and stocks.\n\nLet's take a look at options on $TWTR, which I found using my unusual options scanner:\n\n[Huge Bullish $TWTR bets for Jan 15, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/59zizipeewa51.png?width=2988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dddcc03302fc0afebb346ad1c8f43a956f9e72e)\n\n[Huge Bullish $TWTR bets for Jan 15, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/tsn493rfewa51.png?width=2988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2691d1610be9118c14bbb88231c45d42f8fd82a)\n\n[Huge Bullish $TWTR bets for Jan 15, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/xr249owgewa51.png?width=2988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b831b18eb55a5753384dbcd300700d2410f1bf8)\n\nThese bets were placed BEFORE COVID, and $TWTR is trading at the same price as when these were placed. The strikes range from $40 to $60, 6 months down the line. Taking a Strike of $40, that is 15% OTM of the current price. If they announce the platform within the next 6 months (I predict they will), the stock will explode.\n\nWith this information, I propose:\n\n*TWTR $40c Dec 18 2020, trading at $3.25 at time of writing. 28% Probability ITM.*\n\n*TWTR $40c Jan 15 2020, trading $3.45 at time of writing. 29% Probability ITM.*\n\nBuying $40 Jan 15 2020 Calls are only $20 more for an extra month. Look to close these after their earnings next quarter, when they will likely announce the subscription platform.\n\nI am currently invested in $TWTR stock, and hold the $40 Dec 18 Calls.\n\n**3) Southwest Airlines $LUV \\[AIRLINES\\]**\n\nWarren Buffet and COVID have caused investors to turn a nose up at airline stocks. I don't blame them - the uncertainty will affect airlines more than most other industries. That said, don't miss this opportunity to profit off Southwest Airlines, as they have the best balance sheet in the industry.\n\nBullish Southwest Airlines Case:\n\nSouthwest enjoys the strongest brand in the industry thanks to its simple fare prices, free checked bags, and solid customer service. This brand equity will enable it to continue growing faster than peers and support unit revenue.\n\nMergers among Southwest's competitors will engender pricing power for the airlines, and oil prices will remain low for longer, boosting Southwest's top and bottom lines.\n\nSouthwest's aggressive expansion will continue, driving growth at the carrier.\n\n[Southwest Airlines Profile, from my personal research platform](https://preview.redd.it/infcvuqiewa51.png?width=3246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2991f099086973e667d6da4803aefb6dcd8fa64d)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap \\[20B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[15M\\]\n* Uptrend detected \\[Strong upward trend since June\\]\n\n[$LUV Overlay with $AAL and $DAL - Delta and American have been hit worse than Southwest for a reason.](https://preview.redd.it/xfy42kdkewa51.png?width=1116&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66499e33390418d218c222b558cd13424b9a3209)\n\n$LUV is performing better than its competitors, with higher lows and higher highs when comparing the charts. With the best balance sheet, its exposure to oil has been proven to be overcome since the whole oil futures fiasco. They have been prepped for the second wave and are most likely to weather the storm out of all the airlines.\n\nMy options scanner did not find any significant options data for $LUV.\n\nI propose:\n\n*LUV $40c Dec 18 2020, trading at $3.05 at time of writing. 25% Probability ITM.*\n\n*LUV $40c Jan 15 2020, trading $3.40 at time of writing. 26% Probability ITM.*\n\nI am currently invested in $LUV stock.\n\n**4) Ericsson $ERIC \\[Telecommunications Equipment\\]**\n\nWith growing tensions between the US and China, it is unlikely Huawei will be allowed to provide 5G infrastructure. The UK just announced that Huawei will NOT be providing 5G infrastructure, so Ericsson is poised to seize a huge market share.\n\nBullish Ericsson case:\n\nIncome sources could diversify as licensing revenue from 5G patents may grow through applications outside of Ericsson's handset manufacturer agreements.\n\n5G may afford Ericsson a longer spending cycle and higher equipment demand than previous wireless generations. Additionally, 5G should create more use cases for Ericsson's software and services within Internet of Things device networks.\n\nEricsson's turnaround measures are happening at an opportune time. Management's focused strategy should expand operating margins while 5G infrastructure spending increases top-line results.\n\n[Ericsson Profile, from my personal research platform](https://preview.redd.it/utcfp62mewa51.png?width=3236&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b62bffb1ec2fb915dbc8d11aa3b2b501f188b1f)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap \\[29B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[13M\\]\n* Uptrend detected \\[Strong upward trend since March, even stronger after UK Huawei announcement\\]\n\n[$ERIC Overlay with $NOK - Both stocks are strongly trending upward, with almost 100&amp;#37; gains since march.](https://preview.redd.it/bv5ozwmnewa51.png?width=1104&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=805b65f5b4f2a452677147a2f6f118d7cfd00d59)\n\n$ERIC is poised to bank on 5G since Huawei is being punished in retaliation to Chinese handling of Hong Kong. Expect more growth as infrastructure expands and Apple announces their 5G line this fall. Source: [https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-12-rumors-5g-release-camera-specs-2019-6](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-12-rumors-5g-release-camera-specs-2019-6)\n\nMy options scanner did not find any significant options data for $ERIC.\n\nI propose:\n\n*ERIC $11 Nov 20 2020, trading at $0.50 at time of writing. 25% Probability ITM.*\n\nI am no longer invested in $ERIC stock - truly kicking myself for selling, because I had a great cost basis a year ago. Regardless, I am picking up these calls.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on my research, $WFC, $TWTR, $LUV, and $ERIC are poised for big gains over the next 2 quarters. All the plays have a 25% chance of being ITM, but do not need to be ITM to be extremely profitable.\n\n**TL,DR:**\n\n*WFC $27.50c Oct 16 2020, trading at $1.30 at time of writing. 24% Probability ITM.*\n\n*WFC $30c Oct 16 2020, trading $0.79 at time of writing. 16% Probability ITM.*\n\n*TWTR $40c Dec 18 2020, trading at $3.25 at time of writing. 28% Probability ITM.*\n\n*TWTR $40c Jan 15 2020, trading $3.45 at time of writing. 29% Probability ITM.*\n\n*LUV $40c Dec 18 2020, trading at $3.05 at time of writing. 25% Probability ITM.*\n\n*LUV $40c Jan 15 2020, trading $3.40 at time of writing. 26% Probability ITM.*\n\n*ERIC $11 Nov 20 2020, trading at $0.50 at time of writing. 25% Probability ITM.*",

I cashed out my original investment at 140 a share, then a bit more at 270, then again at 360 and finally sold the remaining 12 shares I had today at 400 a share.\n\nThe valuation right now is too insane for me to continue to hold. While I love the company, there is no way that they should be ranked in the top 16 companies in the S&amp;P in terms of market cap. They did 3.1B in revenue last quarter compared to intel who did 33B. I wish all my fellow NVDA holders good luck in the future, but personally believe they are priced to perfection in this market.",

        "selftext": "These past few days/weeks, we've seen some truly absurd moves in tech. Today alone, Tesla was up 10 percent, Netflix was up 8 percent, and Amazon is up about 20% the past few weeks on basically no news. Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Nvidia, etc. are all at or above their mid-February valuations. What spooks me is not that these equities are moving upward, but it's that they are moving upward quickly and impulsively, with few pullbacks, and leaving the rest of the market in the dust. These are not the signs of a healthy new bull market; they are the signs of rampant speculation, euphoria, and greed. These mega-cap corporations are propping up the indices and are almost acting as safe havens for investors pulling out of travel, financials, consumer staples, energy, etc. We saw this rotation in full force yesterday when the Dow ended over -1% while the Nasdaq was around +0.5%. This is not to say that I think we are on the brink of collapse--bubbles can last a lot longer than any of us think they might.\n\nFor those of you who have exposure to big tech, how are you managing it? Are you planning to ride out what seems to be a massive, unstoppable wave upward or are you slowly taking profits along the way? How will upcoming earnings impact your strategy?",

How is this valued so low?\n\nWell my coworkers and I have been trading for a long time, and this is very likely one of them. *(Computer geeks are going to love this especially).*\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n$OSS, One Stop Systems, since its IPO in 2018, has been silently building a tech empire behind our backs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(*You're gonna lose your literal mind when you read the next part:*)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**They are officially partnered with:** Apple, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Boeing, IBM, Lenovo, HP, Lyft, Puma, Toshiba, Thunderbolt, Universal Audio, Focusrite, and Cisco etc... These are only 15 of their 50+ major international partnerships.\n\n*(yes, this is a pennystock.)*\n\n**U.S. Military:** On top of this, OSS also has multiple million-dollar contracts with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Military, as they provide the pre-constructed systems and power required for AI intelligence, DLSS, and large scale data transfer.\n\n*(This sub goes batshit crazy when a pennystock lands even ONE of the above partnerships. They have more than 50 already in motion.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What do they do? What makes them so special?**\n\nOSS in layman\u2019s terms is a company that takes top-end processors and GPUs, and uses their PCIe gen 4.0 expansion technology to merge them into a military-grade/data center supercomputer.\n\nBut aren\u2019t there many companies that can do this? No. They are the only company in the world with a PCIe 4.0 expansion system that can support NVIDIA\u2019s top end GPU\u2019s. (*Nvidia A-100*)\n\nThis means that they own nearly 100% of the market share in Nvidia's latest PCIe GPU technology.\n\n*(PCIe gen 3.0 is the only other option, but is 50% slower than PCIe 4.0.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What else makes them so special?** Their Financials.\n\nCompare their financials to the pennystocks we always talk about on this subreddit. It\u2019s absurd. They ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY.\n\nOSS's latest 10-K showed a record $ 60 MILLION in revenue, a 57% increase YoY.\n\nSome of the biggest companies in the world like Amazon, took over 10 years to make their first dollar. \n\nOSS is only on YEAR 2 and they are only $1 MILLION away from becoming a profitable operation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How is this possible?** Three reasons:\n\n1. They completely dominate the high-end PCIe sector of the tech industry. I challenge you to find a single other PCIe 4.0 expansion system on the market.\n2. Their CEO David Raun has led two companies to record revenues in the PCIe and NVMe industry, and one was bought out by Broadcom.\n3. They are at the forefront of far too many industries that require this level of technology. (see below for a few examples)\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThey are the preferred OEM for Nvidia:\n\n[OSS Introduces the World's First and only PCIe 4.0 Expansion System for Nvidia.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oss-introduces-world-first-pcie-150010777.html)\n\n[OSS and Nvidia](https://www.onestopsystems.com/nvidia-gpus)\n\n[Official PR from NVIDIA](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/worlds-top-system-makers-unveil-nvidia-a100-powered-servers-to-accelerate-ai-data-science-and-scientific-computing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nU.S. Military Defense:\n\n[OSS Military Defense, Navy, Air, and Ground forces.](https://www.onestopsystems.com/defense)\n\n[Latest Order from U.S. Navy](https://ir.onestopsystems.com/press-releases/detail/163/oss-orders-for-new-u-s-navy-ai-threat-detection-system-top)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAI Learning, DLSS, and Self-driving vehicles:\n\n[OSS Reveals World's First Solution for AI Learning that incorporates NVIDIA GPUs and ARM-based servers.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/19/1949447/0/en/OSS-Introduces-Industry-s-First-Solution-Incorporating-NVIDIA-GPUs-with-NVLink-and-Marvell-ThunderX2-Arm-based-Servers.html)\n\n[OSS AI on the Fly](https://www.onestopsystems.com/ai-on-the-fly)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMachine Learning:[ OSS Machine Learning Systems](https://www.onestopsystems.com/machine-learning)\n\nMedical:[ OSS Medical Pre-built Systems](https://www.onestopsystems.com/medical)\n\nOil Industry:[ OSS Oil and Gas Industry Systems](https://www.onestopsystems.com/oil-and-gas)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are about a hundred more links, presentations, and conference calls that could be added to this post, but it would simply make it too long. *(We will be releasing follow up posts throughout the week to break up the information.)*\n\n$2 for a pennystock generating $60 million of revenue in its second year?\n\n$2 for a company that literally dominates an entire section of its industry?\n\n$2 for a company that is partnered with over 50+ major companies?\n\n$2 for a company that literally makes DOUBLE its ENTIRE MARKET CAP?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Vanguard increases their holdings by 103%, something's up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*(Further in-depth analysis will be posted tomorrow and throughout the week.)*\n\nA few of the topics to be covered are: product and competitor assessment, corporate presentations/conference calls, and financial breakdown.

I feel it is a responsibility to give back to the WSB community as I believe I have learned from others sharing their experience.\n\n\\#1: Pick only a few stocks to trade that you strongly believe they have a competitive edge over peers.\n\nFor me it was NVDA and COSTCO that paid off big for me. \n\n\\#2: You have to be disciplined. \n\nI bought COSTCO calls beginning of June and I actually lost about $40,000 as you can see from the dip in June. Thank God I stayed true and didn't sell. I had over 200 calls with different strike prices expiring all on 7/17/20 and I told myself I was going to hold until the June sales report.\n\n\\#3. Options trading is more luck and less analysis or acumen than stock investing. You have to time it right even if you picked winners. In the long run, I think it will be hard to continue winning. Get out while you're up.\n\n\\#4. Something I read from other posting on WSB: Don't fight the trend. The current trend is stonks only go up, brrrr. \n\nHappy gambling, poland out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n346lmy55v951.png?width=632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d389fa7f62e945762ded15b1832de0ead57afd8c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zd8yu0s25v951.png?width=982&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66015f699411cdff8656b54701d252e6e17af189",

Earnings SZN is upon us and the time is now to bring forth our genius into the markets. I\u2019ll go through some of the volume I caught as well as unusual activity.\n\nIf you want to check out the option tool for yourself, go to [SwaggyStocks Option Flow](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMD \u2013 Advanced Micro Devices**\n\nAMD caught some momentum Thursday as the stock surged nearly 8%. Big-time call flow came through expecting the stock to be trading at about $60 by mid August. There\u2019s been an uptick in the semi\u2019s as whole (NVDA, MU, INTC) as they are forecasting solid earnings throughout the pandemic as the world goes deeper into the digital rabbit-hole.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/waa6l9l0eia51.png?width=2954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c91c65e472b0cbedb5ea16ec1364461f0253788\n\n**DKNG \u2013 DraftKings**\n\nDraftkings stock price has taken a beating over the last couple weeks after reaching all-time-highs earlier in the month. I caught some call buying in August expiration as well as some leaps 2021 leaps. The stock is at short-term lows, looks like the players are expecting a bounce and the DraftKings brand to develop into one of the strongest in the SportsGambling sector.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p6lfh0a4eia51.png?width=2820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f7fa4b5fd9ceba04c86e6058347745f80fb3f8e\n\n**KO \u2013 Coca Cola**\n\nBig call buying in Coca Cola (KO) on Friday. 3,700 (900 OI) call contracts for July expiration and a premium paid of $550k. Another trade was in September contracts at the $47 strike price, 7.5k contract for a premium of just under $1 million. Pretty high volume for KO which typically doesn\u2019t have a lot of option flow. Pepsi Co is reporting earnings tomorrow, looks like this could be a proxy play on Pepsi where KO tries to ride some of the momentum.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gbbuv0c6eia51.png?width=2600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=060882c26d52ab5fa1299180734ee53eaf836135\n\n**INTC \u2013 Intel Corporation**\n\nI caught some interesting activity in INTC on Friday. This play is expecting INTC to report strong and have a good showing into the fall. Here are the two plays I caught. A player purchased a long CALL option at $60 strike and sold the CALL at the $65 strike price, essentially opening a bull debit spread. They then sold PUTS at the $52.5 strike (currently 10% OTM) for a credit of $1.3 million. The exact same play was recognized with another 10k contracts at the same strikes and expiration (October 2020). It\u2019s possible this was all one player, or possible two firms mimicking the first play as the strikes/expiration/volume are all very similar. The players are betting that the stock will stay ABOVE $62 by October, but if the stock price stays anywhere above $52.50-$60 range their losses are limited.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hoylbk3heia51.png?width=2736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f226af023a53ddf266b16f5dcc3ab3c3d7a38f0\n\n**The Banks (JPM, BAC, C)**\n\nDidn\u2019t spot anything quite unusual with the banks, other than heavy volume going to earnings (I believe all are reporting Tues-Thurs this week). Looks like most of the volume was predominately bullish sentiment, however, in reality it is quite balanced on both sides. The banks have been getting absolutely hammered throughout the Pandemic and haven\u2019t seen much recovery. This is mainly due to new fiscal policies being introduced that look like they are here to stay. Have the banks bottomed? We\u2019ll find out this week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ykbro4jeia51.jpg?width=3264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69dca10f7af71ff807544c27f16675fbf4311ea2",

        "selftext": "I'm going to leave out the obligatory background bit about why my two cents might be helpful.  Just dig it up in my history.\n\nThere's profit-taking and sector rotation and then there is collapse. The first is a very healthy trim of the froth that built up over the past few months. Investors are simply reallocating the profitable portions of their book to previously avoided sectors to participate in their anticipated rise.  Collapse is when everybody, and I mean everybody, sell absolutely everything, even at deep losses just to get out.\n\nRight now, we are seeing a measured and controlled trimming.  Short-term cash might move over to tradeable opportunities in the non-tech space for a few weeks, maybe even just days but the US economy is an absolute mess right now. There are truly only two smart positions, well-establish tech equity and cash. It will flow back into tech at a discount.  The same people selling are the same people buying back at a 20% discount.\n\nI've got no advice for you if you're rolling dice with P&amp;Ds, buying bankrupt companies or flipping ridiculously short-term options but if you're like most people here, buying companies because they make sense over a longer time horizon and especially in a post Covid world (if that's even possible), the next few days or weeks will not matter after a few months.\n\nSo what do I currently own?\n\n30% cash, PFE, WMT, MSFT, AMZN, AMD, NVDA, GOOG, AAPL and TSLA.  All are still substantially in the green. I've trimmed about 25% of all positions last week and move over the cash. VIX is currently at 28.  In March, it was 80.   \n\nSo folks, it's cool.

        "selftext": "  \n\nMy fellow bulls, this is my first DD which gives this a 100% chance success rate. I\u2019ll keep this short and sweet. While you guys spent $85 watching grown men hug in an island for hours, I spent my time securing tendies for you. TSM is the play to make next week and here\u2019s why:\n\nTSM $64\n\nTSM is the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker and produces for Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, and Huawei. They do more than just this but I suggest doing your own research as I promised to keep this short and sweet. They are in a great position financially and have recently reported revenue in June of 40% increase over the last year and a 28% increase from the previous month. Obviously 5G stocks have been mooning, and although TSM will not be responsible for creating the technology, they will likely be the company producing those 5G chips. On top of this, Merica\u2019s government is paying TSM to build a $12 billion plant in Arizona. TSM produces chips for the U.S. F-35 jet. Setting up a plant in the U.S. will make it much easier for future productions of any military related needs, as they have less restrictions to worry about. \n\nAside from all of that, TSM has also recently agreed to the world\u2019s largest corporate green power purchase agreement. WTF does this mean? Well this purchase gives them ownership of some of the world\u2019s largest wind farms. Their goal is to be a 100% renewable energy operated company. Why the fuck does this matter? Besides it making this world a safer and healthier blah blah blah, it is a nice PR move. People love this kind of shit and it will definitely shed positive light into the company. More importantly, major companies such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook, are part of the RE100 (Renewable Energy 100). In the future TSM may be the supplier of this renewable energy to these major companies. \n\nAnd for those of you who care, the technicals on this are very bullish. It is not overbought nor is it oversold and the MACD crossover is signaling buy. I\u2019d say we hit at least $70 by EOW. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/wc0waMF](https://imgur.com/a/wc0waMF)\n\nAll the \u201cfinancial experts\u201d rate this as a great buy. Earnings will also be released 07/16 pre market. This is not an earnings play but regardless they are expected to beat their estimated earnings. I will be getting shares Monday and buying 08/28 $70c and 01/15/21 $80C. I will post proof of positions on Monday or as the kids say nowadays\u2026. BAN",

        "selftext": "Right now, there's a lot going on. We're at the start of a horrible earnings season. Tension between US and China. US Elections coming up between a crazy guy and a senile guy. So many companies are extremely overvalued. \n\nSo what do you think of the situation. Are you getting your money out? Are you spending it all and make decisions when something happens? Lowering your positions and hold a big cash position for a new crash / recession?\n\nIn my case, I was thinking about selling before elections and see how the consequences of the crisis would pay out. It's great that the Fed lends all that money, but it has to be paid off at some point as well. With lowered revenue and higher costs for adapting to the virus along with the stock market being this overvalued, I could see recession coming up.\n\nBut that would be timing the market, cause I would buy again at some point. That's why I decided to rearrange my portfolio a bit, focussing on small-mid cap companies with steady financials, active in growing sectors (web services, AI, digitalization of healthcare, fintech,...) and preferably IPO'd in the last 2 years. Those stocks wont fall that hard and would rebound pretty quick, so I'm pretty well set up  holding for the next decade.\n\nCompanies like TSLA and NVDA are very high on my watchlist, they are the future imo. But there's no way I could buy into them right now at this valuation. They would get hit way too hard if the bubble breaks. I'm kinda dividing my watchlist into two sides. The ones buying right now and the ones to buy during a crash or not buy at all cause I've missed the boat.",

It's a rapidly growing product that I believe will protect interests as Latin America develops. I believe that their development of privacy-focused serverless computing and video streaming infrastructure was what was necessary for it to experience enormous growth in the next few years.\n\n [https://blog.cloudflare.com/scaling-the-cloudflare-global/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/scaling-the-cloudflare-global/) \n\n\\- **Corteva - AGRICULTURE BIOTECH**\n\nCorteva is a powerfully focused agritech investment. They have deep investments in corn, which is an enormous product that will always persist in Mexico and US agriculture.\n\n [https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/fact-sheets/strengthening](https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/fact-sheets/strengthening) \n\n\\- **Facebook - E-COMMERCE**\n\nI believe Facebook will play a really interesting role with Canada's Shopify in Latin America. WhatsApp is enormously popular in Mexico due to Facebook's networking investments, making it cheap to use. WhatsApp is better suited for Mexico's barter style economy, while Instagram seems to serve America's ad-centric transactions better. I believe we will be seeing Facebook develop deep business support with Shopify that is easy to use for billions of people across different economies.  Some of the technology is actually faschinating, as you can purchase products and test products using filters and 1-swipe purchases.\n\n [https://www.facebook.com/business/shops](https://www.facebook.com/business/shops) \n\n**- Kansas City Southern - US-MEXICAN RAIL**\n\nKansas City Southern is an extremely important trade vector between Mexico and the US. In particular, Texas and Monterrey. It's well diversified to deliver at a cost effective rate between changes in agriculture, energy, automotive, machining, food, and more.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/54480/000005448016000143/wf\\_colorkcssystemmap2015a01.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/54480/000005448016000143/wf_colorkcssystemmap2015a01.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Adobe - GRAPHICS**\n\nI'm completely impressed by Adobe's growth and acquisitions across multiple sectors. I believe Adobe is a great longterm AR play as it maintains a close relationship with Apple, develops software for video games, movies, digital signatures, and e-commerce, architecture, design, and an endless array of other software solutions.\n\n [https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-acquires-allegorithmic-substance-3d-gaming/](https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-acquires-allegorithmic-substance-3d-gaming/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Paypal - FINANCIAL ACCESS**\n\nPaypal is interesting in regards to US-Mexico.Paypal has always demonstrated itself as a pioneer. It's very easy to send remittance money through Xoom. It's easy to send money to your friends via Venmo. Their credit system is awfully fair, which is helpful in a nation like Mexico that's critically underbanked. \n\nThey also had an excellent acquisition with Honey. I believe they'll be generating billions through their transactions on Amazon and other industries and will force fintech to rethink how far financial technology can go.\n\n [https://www.zdnet.com/article/paypal-acquires-honey-science-for-4-billion-adds-offers-deals-to-payment-network/#:\\~:text=Dan%20Schulman%2C%20CEO%20of%20PayPal,monthly%20active%20users%20in%20October.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/paypal-acquires-honey-science-for-4-billion-adds-offers-deals-to-payment-network/#:~:text=Dan%20Schulman%2C%20CEO%20of%20PayPal,monthly%20active%20users%20in%20October.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Texas Instruments  - EMBEDDED SYSTEMS**\n\nI've selected for TI over AMD and Nvidia  since TI has a greater distribution. You'll find TI in automobiles, space rockets, airplanes, CNCs, school calculators, concrete producers, and so on.  Either way, AMD is listed below as a supplement to an already cloud-heavy setup.\n\n [https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/24/texas-instruments-incorporated-stock-in-4-charts.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/24/texas-instruments-incorporated-stock-in-4-charts.aspx) \n\n\\- **Teradyne - SYSTEMS TESTING &amp; INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION**\n\nTeradyne is part of the COVID restructure. I believe networking hardware chips are only  going to be more needed as an economic driver. Teradyne has an excellent client base regarding that and also develops and impressive amount of industrial automation robots across warehouses, farms, and so on. The future is inevitably automation, and this is my participation in that.\n\n [https://www.universal-robots.com/about-universal-robots/news-centre/teradyne-inc-acquires-universal-robots/](https://www.universal-robots.com/about-universal-robots/news-centre/teradyne-inc-acquires-universal-robots/) \n\n\\- **Microsoft - SOFTWARE AUTOMATION**\n\nI'm really excited to see Microsoft's future in software automation and services. They have a really interesting position with regards to gaming, cloud computing, and wonderful acquisitions for Github &amp; NPM and an array of other tools that can perform intensive software automation.\n\n [https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-acquires-softomotive-to-expand-low-code-robotic-process-automation-capabilities-in-microsoft-power-automate/](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-acquires-softomotive-to-expand-low-code-robotic-process-automation-capabilities-in-microsoft-power-automate/) \n\n\\- **Costco - QUALITY CONSUMER GOODS**\n\nCostco has an excellent selection process that can be replicated across multiple cultures.

        "selftext": "Had another post today speculating on AMD.\n\nLet\u2019s do a DD.\n\nFundamentals \\*AMD &amp; INTC are essentially the only two players in the consumer CPU market globally \\*AMD is considered the \u201cconsumer friendly\u201d company as they often perform much less \u201cscummy\u201d tactics that company\u2019s such as INTC &amp; NVDA do (I don\u2019t blame them they are the market leaders in their specific sub-sector) \\*PC &amp; Console gaming on the rise - AMD DOMINATES the console gaming market. Every full-home console from 2013 (Xbox one, One S, One X, Ps4, PS4 slim, Ps4 pro) a PLUS THE ENTIRE \u201cnext-gen\u201d console market. AMD APUs have literally ZERO competition unless you consider the NVidia Tegra X1 (the custom APU in the Nintendo switch) \\*PC gaming specifically - AMD DOMINATES the multi core market. This would appeal to consumers who like to play games... but also productivity / and or streaming / and or video editing etc\n\n\\*FINAL fundamental note - You can\u2019t compare an AMD stock present against its speculative potential without mentioning both NVDA &amp; INTC\n\nLETS GET STARTED\n\n\\*Evidence - (Fine. If you insist - I\u2019ll back up my thoughts with some [Graphs](https://imgur.com/gallery/x0UiCyl))\n\nReferenced TICKERS AMD +69% on the year (lol) NVDA +145% on the year INTC +23% on the year (disappointing due to its previous trajectory)\n\nSPECULATION \\*AMDs poor relative performance to NVDA (GPU market) can directly be correlated to two things\n\n1. The lack of a high performance GPU. NONE of amds current line-up (remember we have a future generation coming but the current gen is lackluster for high performance.\n2. Lack of reach to new gaming customers (everyone who really really wanted a Ryzen cpu probably has one by now)\n3. Price to performance ratio is not great on their GPUs but is EXCEPTIONAL on the Ryzen platform I admit\n\nNVDA has the RTX 2000 series (we won\u2019t compare the GPUs that haven\u2019t been officially announced yet from these two companies) \u2014\u2014 \\*NVDA - how is it up so much?\n\n1. Market Leader\n2. Strong leadership under CEO Jensen Huan(probably spelled that wrong sorry I\u2019m a lazy shit sometimes)\n3. High performance and \u201cattempts\u201d at a budget GPU option.\n\nRTX 2060 super cards allow gamers to build a \u201cbeast\u201d of a PC these days for -under 1500$\n\n[Proof](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/mstbPn) \\^ under penalty of permanent BAN I swear to WS gods I put that list together in under 2 minutes. THATS how easy it is to build a pc in this modern era. \u2014\u2014 And finally INTC\n\n1. Dominated the entire sector as a market leader for 7 years. See Core i \u201cgen\u201d CPUS. From sandy bridge to Kaby lake - this company was at the top.\n2. Gained momentum because AMDs FX serious sucked bro\n3. Name recognition. Has your mom heard of intel before? It\u2019s quite possibly. AMD? Less likely. \u2014- Conspiracy level speculation? Okay here it is: NVDA could be a market leader in self driving cars. This could put them in direct competition with TSLA.\n\nTLDR: So what are the plays bitch?\n\nAMD has a LOT of room to Grow. But this is long term. I have a long position of at least 10 shares with them. I\u2019d have to check my other brokers to give an exact number.\n\nNVDA - Why aren\u2019t you buying this stock? Have you looked at the charts? I can go to war defending this company\u2019s stock price.\n\nINTC - Fuck! Before Covid this was a definite buy. If INTC continues to grow it\u2019s market share in the APU, CPU, and GPU markets this company could be fucked in 5+ years or so. Trade at your own caution - but I\u2019m BUYING.",

        "selftext": "\nFor Trading JULY 8th\n \n \nJOLTs 5.4 vs. 5 Million\n \nNVAX gets $1.6B from BARDA\n \n \n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a very soft start in the DJIA but not so much in the NASDAQ and S&amp;P-500, with the DJIA starting off -240 and managing a rally only as far as -125 before spending several hours going sideways until the last hour of trading when the NASDAQ and S&amp;P ran out of steam and fell below the close and the selloff resumed.  It\u2019s never a good thing when and overbought index makes a new all-time high and then closes down and on the lows.  The DJIA was -396.85 (1.51%), NASDAQ -89.76 (.86%), S&amp;P 500 -34.30 (1.08%), the Russell -26.89 (1.86%) and the DJ Transports -108 (1.1%).  The internals were 3:1 down on NYSE and 2.5:1 on NASDAQ with volume on the NYSE 2:1 down also.  The DJIA was 28 down and only 2 up with WMT the big gainer +55 DP\u2019s and on the downside, BA-62, GS -55, and UNH -43DP\u2019s.  Even with the good JOLTs number, this market is just over-extended and tired.  The stat I mentioned in tonight\u2019s video about the S&amp;P is very telling, I think, with the S&amp;P only 2% off its high, the median S&amp;P stock is down 11%.  This market has simply gotten too narrow and it will correct.\n \nWe sold half of the remaining NEM 7/17 $60\u2019s bought @ 1.55 and added to last Friday @ $1.30 for an average of $1.47 triggered a 100% Up Rule sale at $2.94, and today\u2019s sale was @ $3.20. They closed today $3.20.  We also own a position in SLV 8/21 17 calls @ $ .74, and they closed $ .75, and we also added a spread using the NEM 8/65 / 70 calls at a $1.30 debit.\n \n\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video https://youtu.be/5afUNy48sFI\n\nOur Discord Forum link is on the video description..\n\nSECTORS: The FAANG names all finished near the lows, several like MSFT coming off a new all-time high and closing down on the day.  Not a good sign if they follow-thru to the downside tomorrow.  Also having trouble was CCL, who has had to cancel several cruises for Q4 and Q1 2021.  It closed $14.57 -1.04 (6.7%).  Add to that, the UAL report that it is giving warnings that it will be laying off \u201c10\u20192 of thousands of employees.\u201d  UAL finished $32.55 -2.66 (7.55%).  These two companies do not operate in a vacuum, so both groups are in jeopardy, again.  Novavax (NVAX) got a $1.6billion grant from BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) to help it along in it\u2019s search for a workable vaccine.  The stock, up from $8 as late as the end of February had worked its way up to $85 last month and opened today $104 and traded as high as $111.77 and finished $104.56 +25.12 (31.63%).  Don\u2019t get too crazy with this one, this is not its first rodeo.  In 2015 it was trading $300 before it had a failure on a different vaccine and the stock fell to $80 before a rally and then in the week of 9/16/2016 it fell further from $169.80 to $23.20 and then on to the adjusted (1:20 reverse) low around $4.00.  We\u2019ll hope for a better outcome this time around.  Walmart was the big winner on a RECODE that said they are ready to launch Walmart +, to compete with Amazon Prime for same day grocery delivery and next day for other products.  Its move today added 55 DP\u2019s to the averages.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal since for the same money, with Prime you get streaming too.  And the margins on groceries are razor thin.\n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was MIXED with TSN -.67, BGS +.70, FLO -.03, CPB -.11, CAG +.54, MDLZ -.22, KHC +.22, CALM +.03, JJSF -1.43, SAFM +.54, HRL -.14, SJM +.18, PPC -.34, KR -.03, and PBJ $31.56 +.06 (.19%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA was MIXED with BIIB - -1.72, ABBV +.72, REGN +14.50, ISRG -9.30, GILD -.13, MYL -.43, TEVA -.29, VRTX +8.35, BHC -.59, INCY +.86, ICPT -.74, LABU +3.36, and IBB $140.15 +.71 (.51%).\n \nCANNABIS: was LOWER with TLRY -.13, CGC -.40, CRON -.19, GWPH +2.93, ACB +.17, CURLF -.07, KERN -.62 and MJ $13.08 -.01 (.08%).\n\nDEFENSE:  was LOWER with LMT -8.59, GD -3.29, TXT -1.73, NOC -7.89, BWXT -1.78, TDY \u2013 7.84, RTX -2.12 and ITA $160.32 -6.10 (3.67%).\n\n \nRETAIL: was LOWER with M +.03, JWN -.58, KSS -.72, DDS -.88, WMT +9.11 (7.66%), TGT -1.40, TJX -1.84, RL -2.49, UAA -.41, LULU -6.66, TPR -.51, CPRI -.18 and XRT $43.78 -.43 (.97%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were MIXED with GOOGL -7.40, AMZN -44.69, AAPL +1.06, FB -.91, NFLX +.69, NVDA +3.06, TSLA +9.42, BABA -2.60, BIDU -4.54, CMG -10.92, CAT -2.03, BA -8.57, DIS -.53 and XLK $106.34 -.77 (.72%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS \u2013 7.91, JPM2.52, BAC -.63, MS -1.32, C -1.53, PNC -3.15, AIG -1.36, TRV -2.45, AXP -3.48, V -3.13, and XLF $22.93 -.48 (2.05%).\n \nOIL, $40.62 -.01. Oil was lower in last night\u2019s trading before we rallied in the morning. I mentioned in last night\u2019s charts with comments section in the Weekly Strategies letter, prices are trying to work higher towards $45.00. We needed a close over the previous high close of $40.83 and while we were there, we sold off to close below that number.  The stocks were higher with XLE $36.26 -1.19 (3.18%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,809.80 +16.40. It was a continuation rally and a new recovery high OF $1807.70  Last night I said \u201cwe\u2019ve moved $50 since the low on Friday and while the trend and momentum are positive, we may have to test 1790 to consolidate our gains.\u201d  Unfortunately, we pulled back to 1,767 instead.  We rallied a bit and finished only slightly better. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 and half of what was left today @ $3.20, we closed $3.20 + .80 today.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,290 -65. After trading back to 8985 we rallied back to close \u2013 only $5.  Since last week we have closed between 9200 \u2013 92.85 every day with narrow ranges and today was a good start to move higher.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $9.76 - .19 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "I've been trading a strategy that I'd love to get feedback on. It has been very successful over the last 4 months but I'm afraid I may be missing something because it seems too easy so far which means it's very likely I'm doing something that is overly risky or misunderstood. I get that this is a great market but I'm trying to get honest feedback as to whether this is a dangerous or simplistic strategy in \"normal\" markets. What I'm doing:  \nSelling puts typically at only 1 or 2 week DTE at a delta of between 8 and 15 with an IV between 40 and 100. I only sell at a probability of profit +80% and a minimum of 20% annualized return- with the short duration it can be much higher. I also try to find good support levels to set my strike under and select stocks in a strong uptrend. My win rate has been over 95% as far as having to roll.  \nFor example today I sold a NVDA $380 put for this Friday for $1.00 at a -12 delta and a POP of 89%. So it seems like a solid likelihood I can make it three days without it dropping ITM.  \nWhat's wrong with this deep OOTM and very short DTE strategy? I understand many people go 20-45 days at a higher delta which just seems to a noob like me that it's a long time for something to go wrong but I might be thinking of that the wrong way. Experienced traders I respect seem to focus on 30-45 days DTE at a higher delta like 30- has that strategy been shown to have a higher expectancy? Is the use of such a short DTE overly risky?\n\n  \nThanks in advance for any guidance,",

Lack of reach to new gaming customers (everyone who really really wanted a Ryzen cpu probably has one by now)\n2. They already have the X series CPUs for those who want well binned chips / top silicon. \n3. The consumer CPU market for AMD is now showing long term potential as a profit puppy. \n\u2014\u2014\n[https://ir.amd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amd-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results](https://ir.amd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amd-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results)\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\nAMD has a strong potential to beat Q3 expected earnings. Why? Because their production has a solid chance of recovering by then. Why? Because they have a somewhat diversified access to memory, and the raw materials needed for production.\n\n[AMD](https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:AMD/explorer/interest_coverage)\n\nAMD - has had a rough go of it, but it\u2019s starting to recover. Yes In the consumers minds, and it\u2019s starting to show in the numbers as well.\n\nDirectly from the post linked above regarding AMD earnings\n\nQ4 2019 Results\n\n\"Revenue of $2.13 billion was up 50 percent year-over-year primarily driven by the Computing and Graphics segment. Revenue was up 18 percent compared to the prior quarter as a result of higher revenue in the Computing and Graphics segment partially offset by lower revenue in the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment.\"\n\n^ Clearly this is the direction the company is headed in my opinion.\n\n*What are my price targets?\n\nI fully expect AMD to hit ATH of 70$ per share by Q4 or Q1 2021. Why? Because there is demand. Look at what this stock was in feb 2019 and then look at its peak before Covid. Compare that to its current price. See what I\u2019m getting at here?\n\nHas anyone seen the MU surge? Memory is in high demand. Specially flash NVME and SSDs. \n\nWhat does this mean for AMD?\nAMD is heavily dependent on companies like micron (TSMC, Samsung, etc) GDDR6, flash memory, and VRAM are all dependent on this sector.\n\nThe amount of improvement in the memory sector -is staggering. Flash Memory is finally \u201caffordable\u201d to most mid-range computing customers. At the least - far more improvement here than simply PUMPING more GHz into the same cores and SMT that INTC always does. \n\n\n-----\nTLDR: Everyone already hopped on their **** why does this matter now... so what?\n\nAMD has a LOT of room to Grow. But this is long term. - I can\u2019t speak to how the current market trends will affect this stock in the very short term. \n\nThis is literally a power play - in my opinion - showing how they can adapt to a changing market and their literally competing with theirselves now (just like NVDA competes with itself on its own high end GPUs)",

I\u2019ve been doing a lot of reading the past few weeks and have come up with a few companies I\u2019d like to invest in. Feedback on my ideas (good idea/bad idea/etc.) and any advice in general is much appreciated. I haven\u2019t looked into anything but single companies thus far, and want to look into other ways to invest but don\u2019t know where to start, so recommendations on where to start would great. \n\nMy ideas thus far:\nVerizon \nClorox\nGeneral dynamics \nNvidia \nSquare \nAkamai\nScott\u2019s Miracle Gro\nAdvanced Micro Devices \nThermo Fisher Scientific\nLockheed Martin \nNorthrop Grumman \n\nI know these are all massive companies and represent value rather than growth investing. I do want to invest in some growth shares, but have no idea where to start. Tech, energy, and defense are my preferred industries because I have good insight into them but honestly any advice and recommendation can do nothing but help. Thanks!",

        "selftext": "Hi Folks!\n\nLong post but bear with me. I had a Motif Investing account which I opened in 2016. For those who don't know, Motif used to offer theme based investing (for instance Cloud Computing was a theme). I had a 4-5 themes and each theme had a bunch of stocks each.\n\nFast forward to this year, Motif sent me an email that they were being sold to Folio Investing and that they have a monthly fee of 19.99 per month. I used to pay a small fee on Motif for free stock advisories in different themes and free rebalancing. They also had free individual stock trading which I used instead of Robinhood. However, I decided the 20 dollar monthly fee was too much for my \\~40k portfolio in Motif. So I called Vanguard and had them initiate a rollover. I have most of the rest of my portfolio with them and very happy so far. It went well except, Vanguard doesn't do fractional shares that Motif did. So eventually Motif had to liquidate all the fractional shares before rolling over the account complete. I didn't mind that either coz I have a good chunk of Tax loss Harvesting done in March this year when shit hit the fan. \n\nNow my question is, what do I do with the individual stocks in my Vanguard account? Here are the companies I own - \n\nABB, ABBV, ABT, ADM, AFL, ALB. ALL, AMCR, AMD, AME, AMOT, AMZN, AOS, ATVI, BABA, BEN, BILI, BRKS, CGNX, CMCSA, CVX, DEO, DIS, EA, EMR, EVRI, EXPD, FTI, GLUU, GPC, HEI, HLX, IGT, IRBT, IRM, ISRG, JNJ, LEG, LMNX, MDT, MG, MITK, MSFT, NFLX, NICE, NTES, NUE, NVDA, OMCL, ON, PBCT, PH, PPG, RXN, SCPL, SE, SGMS, SNE, SOHU, T, TER, TJX, TM, TRV, TTWO, TXT, UBER, UL, V, VNE, WB, WBA, XOM, ZNGA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother piece of information - I am sitting on a gain on the total but there are certainly losers in there. I know it is a lot of information to parse through. But is there any advice on how to consolidate this? My investing philosophy has evolved and I have most of my money in low cost index funds now and would prefer to do that for this piece of my portfolio as well. Thanks for reading!\n\nTLDR: How do I consolidate a bunch of individual stocks into index funds?",

They closed today $2.81.  We also added a position in SLV 8/21 17 calls @ $ .74, and they closed $ .7\n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a decent start and rallied to a high of +210 by 9:45 but didn\u2019t hold it and was back down on the day by 11:00 but wouldn\u2019t give up, and spent all day between + / - 100 until the close when it sold off in the last 15 minutes and finished -77.91 (.30%).  The DJIA was the outcast with the NASDAQ +95.86 (.95%) at another new high, S&amp;P +15.57 (.50%), the Russell -14.05 (.97%), and the DJ Transports -19.71 (.21%) even though FDX and UPS had added 120 DJT points to the average.  Market internals were even on the NYSE while the NASDAQ was actually 9:7 Down, regardless of its new high close.  The DJIA was 20:9 down and WMT unchanged with no winners or losers moving over 20 DP\u2019s. Volume on NYSE was average but on the NAZ it was about 20% higher than yesterday.  Hong Kong and Covid-19 were the big negatives today and it was the ISM gains to 52.6, well over the 50 break-point, and the excitement of the PFE vaccine news were the big positives that helps us higher.\n \n \n \n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video https://youtu.be/dr95ohxzdjo\n\nOur Discord forum link is in the video description..\n\n\nSECTORS: The transports were the sector in the spotlight with FDX earnings (a loss) sending the stock higher by $16.44, although it closed just over its low of the day with a gain of 11.7% after being up over 14% for the biggest one-day gain since coming public in 1978.  UPS also gained 2.9% and between them they added 120 point to the average but still couldn\u2019t keep the average in positive territory.\n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was LOWER with TSN -.53, BGS -.08, FLO -.11, CPB -.32, CAG +.50, MDLZ -.05, KHC -.21, CALM -.54, JJSF -2.80, SAFM -3.21, HRL -.83, SJM -.59, PPC -.15, KR -.20, and PBJ $31.06 -.17 (.54%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA was MIXED with BIIB -3.44, ABBV +1.22, REGN -15.55, ISRG +5.71, GILD -.94, MYL -.23, TEVA -.82, VRTX -3.31, BHC +.13, INCY -1.32, ICPT -1.41, LABU +.59, and IBB $137.80 +1.11 (.81%).\n \nCANNABIS: was HIGHER with TLRY -.06, CGC +.25, CRON +.05, GWPH +3.53, ACB -.18, CURLF +.06, KERN -.16, and MJ $12.98 +.11 (.85%).\n\n \nDEFENSE:  was LOWER with LMT -3.92, GD -.86, TXT -.77, NOC +.70, BWXT -.18, TDY -6.76, RTX -.01, and ITA $163.19 -1.53 (.93%)\n \n \nRETAIL: was LOWER with M -.26, JWN -.29, KSS -.63, DDS -.94, WMT -.23, TGT -.93, TJX +.64, RL -1.85, UAA -.12, LULU -2.82, TPR -.33, CPRI -.37, and XRT $43.06 +.18 (.42%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +23.95, AMZN +122.28 (4.43%), AAPL -.69, FB +10.03, NFLX +31.96, NVDA +1.49, TSLA +58.18 (5.39%), BABA +.60, BIDU +.91, CMG +17.52, CAT +.07, BA -1.85, DIS +1.45, and XLK $104.66 +.17 (.16%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -.12, JPM -.64, BAC -.44, MS -.74, C -.70, PNC -2.38, AIG -1.55, TRV -1.65, AXP -.84, V +.50, and XLF $22.94 -.20 (.86%).\n \n \nOIL, $39.82 +.55. Oil was lower in last night\u2019s trading before we rallied midday. I mentioned in last night\u2019s charts with comments section in the Weekly Strategies letter, prices are trying to work higher towards $45.00. The stocks were higher with XLE $36.93 -.92 (2.43%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,779.30 -20.60. It was a continuation rally and a new recovery high OF $1807.70  Last night I said \u201cwe\u2019ve moved $50 since the low on Friday and while the trend and momentum are positive, we may have to test 1790 to consolidate our gains.\u201d  Unfortunately, we pulled back to 1,767 instead.  We rallied a bit and finished only slightly better. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 yesterday and we closed $2.81 - .49 today.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,325 + 140. After trading back to 8985 we rallied back to close \u2013 only $5.  Since last week we have closed between 9200 \u2013 92.85 every day with narrow ranges and today was a good start to move higher.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC last Wednesday @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $9.77 + .17 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

        "selftext": "Hello, new investor here, I just started back in February right before the hit when everything was at it's highs. I had about $3000 invested into individual stocks like TSLA, MSFT, NVDA, etc but I unfortunately had to sell most of those a few weeks ago to pay bills because I am currently furloughed and it took me 15 weeks to get unemployment from the state of Florida. I also have $1500 in a Fidelity Roth that is split between FZROX, FZILX, and FXNAX.. which is still down. I also bought into my ESPP this year with Hilton so I probably should of sold some of that instead of the other ones but I was hoping to hold it at least for the two years to get the tax break. Anyways, I finally got all the unemployment owed to me in lump sums so I'm going to be ok for awhile and would like to reinvest at least half of it. I'm not sure if I should just stick with my Roth right now until it's maxed out or if I would be better in individual stocks at the moment. The 1500 was in my 2019 Roth so I think I have to start fresh with my 2020 one now so not sure if that would still help to maybe dollar cost average FZROX down?\n\nAny advice/recommendations/suggestions will be greatly appreciated!",
