        "selftext": "Hello /r/investing friends,\n\nI'm an Australian, and just wanted to hear your perspectives on the difference between now and December 2018. The December 2018 correction was well overdue, but reversed quickly and failed to even enter a bear market, since the Bull sentiment was too strong.\n\nP/E for many companies are still sky high (and will be even higher once they start getting revised)\n\nDJIA - 2018 - 21712.53  Now - 21052.53\n\nDow Jones is nearly at same level as 2018 December and that's despite Boeing almost collapsing from it's former heights and was happening even without coronavirus (sad to see one of my past favourite companies in this state, but c'est la vie)\n\nS&amp;P500 - 2018 - 2346.58 Now - 2488.65\n\nS&amp;P 500 is signficantly higher now than then despite the material damage and reduction in earnings and increase in debt of most constituent companies. XOM, CVX, AAL, CCL, RCL are the well knowns but even HON, 3M, DXC and most other constituents are expecting heavy losses or revisions.\n\nNASDAQ - 2018 - 6190.17 Now - 7373.08\n\nNASDAQ is signficantly higher despite many of it's unicorns and stars like TESLA, UBER (which tbf didn't exist in 2018). But let's ignore that one, the tech bubble will keep going for a bit still.\n\nNYSE - 2018 - 10724.19 Now - 9880.63\n\nNYSE despite oil, airlines, retail, engineering, resources companies facing signficant losses/debt.\n\nDAX - 2018 - 10279.20 Now - 9882.68 (at time of post)\n\nDAX is barely down on it's DEC 2018 low, despite Lufthansa being brought to it's knees, Adidas with major sales and supply disruption, VW BMW and Daimler losing sales and money (for Daimler this is worse with F1) to name a few major impacts. Plus the already strained deutshce bank, post and reduction in business for siemens, eon, BASF.\n\nCAC40 - 2018 - 4555.99 Now - 4284.94\n\nCAC is headstrong despite many major REIT's, hotels airlines, fashion brands which will have material impact and be only servicing a debt till maybe Q4 this year.\n\nASX200 - 2018 - 5410.20 Now - 5286.80\n\nASX200 is barely worse off despite China's demand for resources materially impacted, Australian banks being asked to take the burden of the pandemic, REIT's &amp; travel agents just left servicing debt, one our two major airlines going bankrupt by June, Major Casino's and retailers servicing debt for 6 months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo if you read that, congrats, but if not, all good.... but my question is... \\*at these prices... how is the material impact, job losses, etc priced in as many here say? And how are we already going to be rebounding, when the situation right now is way worse than Dec 2018, and yet we see similar pricing?\\*\n\nSky High PE's, Mounting Debt, Poorer leverage, Lack of expansions/project? Is this some weird Bear bubble?\n\nIs some extra stimulus priced in? Because currently most stimulus is loans, which will still burden companies, heck, Australia has given practically nothing to businesses over 500 mil (which comprise most of our ASX), besides to one childcare provider.",

        "selftext": "What do you guys think?\n\nBrief history: Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), a \\~$16B IT company (2/3 commercial, 1/3 govt.) spun off their govt side a few years back into CS Gov Solutions, which then merged with SRA to form CSRA, who was subsequently bought by GDIT. Anyway...\n\nThe larger commercial side stayed as CSC and merged in 2017 with the Enterprise Services side of HPE to form DXC, doing \\~$25B in annual rev.\n\nInvestors where initially very bullish on this merger, and took DXC from a $25 stock in May '16 to a $95 stock in Sept '18. Since those highs, the stock has plummeted all the way to 8 bucks at its low a few weeks ago and is currently sitting just below 12 bucks. They recently announced they're selling off their healthcare business to a PE firm for $5B in cash to help pay down debt.\n\nSo what's the outlook here? With the low stock price, their 21 cent quarterly dividend yields 7% though it could certainly be in jeopardy. Dividend aside, I see this a huge potential growth opportunity. \n\nThere's risk involved, for sure, but I'd argue it's less risky than a cruise line or airline right now. Interested to see what you fine folks think. Cheers.",
