        "selftext": "Q2 Earnings: August 16 - premarket\n\nIn light of China\u2019s recent crackdown on payment processors, FinTech company Paysafe\u2019s strategic move last year to exit those high-risk revenue channels is looking pretty smart. This de-risking will temporarily dampen Q2 YoY revenue growth, as it did with Q1, however, their CC transcripts indicate that tactical exit will likely no longer affect YoY revenue going into Q3 and Q4.\n\nBut this upcoming earnings report is less about revenue growth than it is about forward guidance and updates on their ongoing restructuring, acquisition pipeline and how their recent deleveraging will affect margins and free cash flow.\n\nThey reported strong FCF growth last quarter and a recent CNNE quarterly report revealed that, along with recently paying down $1.2 billion in debt, upon a Moody's upgrade, Paysafe successfully refinanced their remaining debt. This, overall restructuring could translate to $150+ million in cost savings annually which can dramatically improve their profit, free cash flow and M&amp;A outlook: critical elements of their growth strategy.\n\n\n\nEPS\n\nEven if this ER is about forward guidance, there\u2019s a good chance for an EPS beat which will make Q2 Paysafe\u2019s first profitable quarter as a newly public company. Analysts\u2019 average EPS estimate is reported to be 0.01 or 0.02 (depending on the source). We know that in Q1, without the $90+ million in one-time, non-recurring expenses associated with going public and paying down $1.2B debt, they would have beat analysts estimates with a positive EPS. For Q2, they won\u2019t have those expenses so, unless they introduce new costs from refinancing or impairment expenses on intangible assets, there appears to be solid basis for an EPS beat. My loose guess is for 0.05 EPS or better. Not a big deal to me if it doesn\u2019t work out that way, but it\u2019s entirely plausible.\n\n\n\nRevenue\n\nRegarding revenue, even though Paysafe is already integrated as a payment processor with 75% of US iGaming operators, let\u2019s ignore the facts that\n\n* many new states have legalized sports betting during Q1/Q2 (see below),\n* Paysafe\u2019s Q2 revenue could be bolstered by the strong growth recently reported by its several partners like Wynn, Caesar\u2019s, DraftKings and Penn,\n* Paysafe has new revenue streams from recent deals with Coinbase, Microsoft/XBox, Luckbox, Wix, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, PointsBet, Virginia Lottery, Rent Moola, Provena, FoxBet, Golden Nugget etc.,\n* Paysafe said early Q2 was already showing signs of record growth: \u201cWe continue to be pleased with where the top-line trends are going. We've had some actual record days in e-commerce processing, historical records, not just recovery records, but historical records.\u201d\n* or that the American Gaming Association reports sports betting has generated $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2021, 20% more than all of 2020 combined ($1.5B).\n\nRather than speculate about how much of that new revenue will affect Paysafe\u2019s Q2 balance sheet, I prefer to keep my sights on analysts estimates and Paysafe\u2019s own guidance, which has conservatively excluded US iGaming growth projections (55% CAGR).\n\nPaysafe offers Q2 revenue guidance of $365 - $385 million. With $341 million in revenue for Q1\u201920, this represents 7% to 13% YoY quarterly growth. We\u2019ve seen very little reason for them to miss this guidance. Quite the contrary.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 average Q2 revenue estimate is reported to be between $371.5 million and $378 million (depending on the source). That's right in the middle of guidance. Last quarter, Paysafe came in at the upper range of their guidance which, given all the good news, suggests that there\u2019s a very good chance that they\u2019ll beat the analyst estimate. That would result in around 9% to 11% YoY quarterly growth, which would be a solid improvement from Q1.\n\nAs a long-term investor, I\u2019ll be happy with anything above 7%. From there, any upside surprise will be welcome.\n\nLast quarter, Paysafe confirmed their 2021 full year projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume. Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.\n\nThis confirmed guidance implies that Q3 and Q4 will likely represent stronger revenue growth to compensate for the sluggish Q1 growth due to the channel exits. By Q3, Paysafe's balance sheet should reflect their many new partnerships and new US state markets opening up to legalized sports betting.\n\n\n\nRecent Price Action\n\nAs Chairman of the Board Bill Foley recently noted, Paysafe \"has been unduly punished as the inevitable shareholder rotation plays out.\"\n\nOver the last few months many sources confirm regular and heavy intraday short volume (not short interest) which has successfully tanked the stock price on nothing but good news from the company. Meanwhile 13F filings continue to reveal institutions loading shares.\n\n\\[Side note: Some have a hard time wrapping their heads around this but the SEC allows this type of intraday price manipulation under the shield of making a market. It's a legal loophole that allows market makers to walk down (or up) the price to shake out weak hands in order to fill institutional orders by the end of each day. It doesn't help that many financial news outlets continue to misrepresent Paysafe\u2019s data, claiming they have only 4 employees and falsely reporting a massive Q1 EPS miss of -0.37 and -0.38 (Yahoo/CNBC). It was only 0.02. Such things can definitely deter investors who undertake proper due diligence so, hopefully, these outlets will get around to reporting accurate data.\\] But I digress.\n\nWhile the shenanigans have gone on, bringing the price near all time lows and pushing many retail shareholders to capitulation, Fintel reports institutions are accumulating 21 times more than they are selling. Very recent 13F\u2019s show Susquehanna increased their stake by 48% to over 3 million shares, Citigroup increased their position by 5000% to around 1.3 million shares, Bank of New York Mellon bought half a million shares and BlackRock just opened a new position of 8.3 million shares.\n\nBottom?\n\nWhoever has been pinning the stock down has always stopped near these current levels because its more or less the price paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares). In fact, the current price is likely below where Wells Fargo bought 13M shares, where BlackRock bought their 8.3M shares and where Blackstone took on another 37 million shares, according to their 13F's.\n\nThe current low price poses an interesting opportunity for value investors because, since those major fund managers decided to invest near this level, Paysafe has had zero bad news while steadily executing on their promised strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and as Bill Foley put it, \u201ccross-sell, cross-sell and cross-sell.\u201d\n\nSaid in another way, because Paysafe has excluded US iGaming growth from its projections, literally none of the following developments in value creation have yet been priced in:\n\n\n\n\t\u2022\tDec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments\n\n\t\u2022\tDec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n\n\t\u2022\tDec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers\n\n\t\u2022\tJan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform\n\n\t\u2022\tJan 13 \u2014 Paysafecard launches in Moldova\n\n\t\u2022\tFeb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform\n\n\t\u2022\tFeb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n\n\t\u2022\tFeb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n\n\t\u2022\tFeb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service\n\n\t\u2022\tFeb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n\n\t\u2022\tFeb 25 \u2014 Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models\n\n\t\u2022\tFeb 26 \u2014 Paysafe wins \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 4 \u2014 Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 18 \u2014 Paysafe announces new Board of Directors\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 19 \u2014 Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 25 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase\n\n\t\u2022\tApril 1 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program\n\n\t\u2022\tApril 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1;

This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe).\n\n\t\u2022\tJuly 26 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair &amp; Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe\u2019s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel.\n\n\t\u2022\tJuly 27 \u2014 Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe\u2019s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership\n\n\t\u2022\tAug 2 \u2014 Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe\u2019s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE\u2019s Q4 top line a solid boost.\n\n\t\u2022\tAug 4 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe\u2019s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. \"Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe\u2019s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks.\" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe\u2019s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.)\n\n\t\u2022\tAug 9 \u2014 Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor\n\n\t\u2022\tAug 10 \u2014 Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division\n\n\n\nM&amp;A / inorganic growth\n\nAlong the lines of value creation, Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, \u201can aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.\u201d\n\nInorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. Yeah, that's 3,600X. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).\n\nThrough his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d 6,9\n\nFoley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: \u201cFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\n\n\nRounding out the Picture:\n\n\\#1 global leader in iGaming, #2 digital wallet in the world, and #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It has a transactional volume approaching $100 billion in over 40 currencies.\n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n\\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). 11 -- By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). 12\n\n\n\niGaming Expansion\n\nIt's worth repeating that Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s expertise in multi-jurisdictional regulations is an important aspect of its competitive MOAT (as discussed below). Paysafe is also an integrated back-end payment processor so many users don\u2019t realize they are utlizing their gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.\n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n\nFund manager Dan Loeb agrees: \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n\nCompass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d\n\nDel Grosso, who gave Paysafe a $19 price target added, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d 5 Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n* \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n* \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n* \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n* \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n* \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n* \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n* \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n* \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n* \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n* \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n* \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n* \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n* \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n* \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n* \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n\n\nAnalysts universally rate Paysafe as a \"BUY\"\n\nSome quotes :\n\nRBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d 4\n\nRBC recently reiterated their Outperform rating saying: \u201cOur positive thesis is predicated on three key points including: (1) PSFE has a unique set of assets within the payments space, in that it\u2019s a digital wallet, an integrated payment platform (with \\\\\\~50% tethered to online transactions), and provides an on ramp for cash to be digitized via eCash, and it\u2019s the combination of the three that create a two-sided market (serving both merchants &amp; consumers), (2) new secular growth opportunity in US iGaming, which is in its early innings and could surprise investors to the upside, and (3) Bill Foley (Non-Executive Chairman) and his team have a long history of driving share holder value, which we expect to continue at PSFE.\n\nBMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" 3\n\nEvercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' 2\n\n\n\nMOAT: \u201crobust risk management operation\u201d\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and how is it able offer eCommerce services to the unbanked?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d 9\n\n\n\nValuation\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\nPaysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n\nBy comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\nPaysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth (recent new acquisition) nor their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated. This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth. In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. Incorporating US iGaming growth will of course reveal a whole new picture.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up. Veteran market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n\n\nThis is not investment advice. For those who do want to invest in Paysafe, my only advice is to stay away from options. I\u2019ve watched this stock for a long time and the market makers have a track record of ruthlessly blowing up those positions. Common shares is the way.\n\n\n\nSources:\n\n(1) see institutional ownership (WSB won\u2019t allow link)\n\n(2) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)\n\n(3) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(4) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(5) [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10) [https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi](https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi)\n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)",

        "selftext": "Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe\u2019s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.\n\nLast week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%.  But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20% to an astonishingly low 3.85X price to sales.\n\nWhy did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : \u201cPaysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion.  They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs \\~ $105 billion)\n\nSo why the miss?  Analysts\u2019 modeling assumed that 2021\u2019s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation.\n\nThe company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%.\n\nGaps like that typically get filled if there\u2019s no material negative news.  On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion\n* Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA\n* Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million\n* Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus.\n* 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter)\n* 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture)\n* 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV)\n* Revenue growth in all segments\n* eCash revenue +37% YoY  (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries)\n* North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY\n* Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits)\n* Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance\n* Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs\n* Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage.\n* Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring &amp; E-commerce\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurther, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, \u201cPaysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing online markets.\u201d  Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America\u2019s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.)\n\nWith their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America.\n\nImportantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe\u2019s current projections don\u2019t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost.  Management noted, \u201cThese transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units\u2026The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.\u201d\n\nThis quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV.  Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1.\n\nChairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, \u201cWe see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.\u201d\n\nThese new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley\u2019s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&amp;A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts\u2019 neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality.  In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance.  Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted.\n\nPaysafe vs PayPal\n\nSeemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a \"free cash flow machine.\"  The author apparently didn\u2019t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal.\n\nIn fact, if you applied PayPal\u2019s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe\u2019s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow,  Paysafe\u2019s share price would be $32.  A 4x gain from current levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider:\n\n1. PayPal\u2019s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.)  On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY.  With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe.  Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe\u2019s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news.\n2. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk \u201cbuy now/pay later\u201d business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces.\n3. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe\u2019s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth.\n4. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe\u2019s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR).\n5. PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 425%.\n6. Based on Paysafe\u2019s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60\n7. Based on Paysafe\u2019s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal\u2019s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe\u2019s share price at $28.40.\n8. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt).  During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR.\n\n* By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR.\n* Paysafe hasn\u2019t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe\u2019s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal\u2019s share value growth of 460%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are obviously many different factors to consider so I\u2019m not making any claims about fair value here. It\u2019s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe\u2019s share price between $28 and $32.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome Background:\n\nPaysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing.\n\nAs an integrated back-end payment processor, most don\u2019t realize they are using Paysafe\u2019s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.  Within the industry, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews).\n\nBy contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews).\n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMOAT:\n\nPaysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its \u201crobust risk management.\u201d Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter.\n\nCEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\niGaming Expansion\n\nPaysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape.\n\nImportantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n\nFund manager Dan Loeb agrees: \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n\nCompass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d\n\nSome headlines since Del Grasso wrote \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d:\n\n* \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n* \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n* \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n* \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n* \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n* \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n* \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n* \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n* \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n* \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n* \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n* \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n* \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n* \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d (Paysafe is market leader in Canada)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares).\n\nThe current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors.  In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.\n\nEssentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in:\n\n* Dec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments\n* Dec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n* Dec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers\n* Jan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform\n* Jan 13 \u2014 Paysafecard launches in Moldova\n* Feb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform\n* Feb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n* Feb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n* Feb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models\n* Feb 26 \u2014 Paysafe wins \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award\n* Mar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n* Mar 4 \u2014 Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n* Mar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\\\\\n* Mar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan\n* Mar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases\n* Mar 18 \u2014 Paysafe announces new Board of Directors\n* Mar 19 \u2014 Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta\n* Mar 25 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase\n* April 1 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program\n* April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook\n* April 15 \u2014 Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador\n* April 21 \u2014 Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022\n* April 27 \u2014 Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers\n* April 29 \u2014 Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring\n* May 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving\n* May 20 \u2014 Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US\n* May 26 \u2014 REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments\n* June 1 \u2014 Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth\n* June 2 \u2014 Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe\n* June 3 \u2014 Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market\n* June 7 \u2014 Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments\n* June 23\u2014Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash\n* June 29 \u2014 Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan\n* June 30 \u2014 Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best \u2018Affiliate Software Supplier\u2019\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.\n* July 13 \u2014 Paysafe adds 20 new digital currencies to its digital wallet and expands this service to 11 new US states, bringing US presence to 48 states.\n* July 14 \u2014 Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution\n* July 19 \u2014 Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants.\n* July 20 \u2014 Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe\u2019s Income Access\n* July 21 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable \u2018banking-as-a-service\u2019 solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services.

Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).\n\nThrough his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\nFoley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: \u201cFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins.

FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nValuation Metrics:\n\nAbove I compared Paysafe with PayPal.  A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n\\- Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow.\n\n\\- By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\n\\- Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels.  In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth  But even if you include 2020\u2019s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not investment advice.  Just a collections of observations.  If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\nPaysafe Q2: [https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\\_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf)\n\nReuters : Paysafe $4.7B - [https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP](https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP)\n\nPayPal Q2: [https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\\_financials/2021/q2/Q2-21-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2-21-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nPayPal 2012 : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal)\n\nPayPal 2020 : [https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\\_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nPaysafe 2012 : [https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908](https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908)\n\nPaysafe 2020 - [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/psfe](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/psfe)\n\n[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)",

        "selftext": "TLDR: trading near all time low on zero bad news. None of this long list has been priced in yet. Meanwhile institutions are buying 21x more than selling.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn light of China\u2019s recent crackdown on payment processors, FinTech company Paysafe\u2019s strategic move last year to exit those high-risk revenue channels is looking pretty smart. This de-risking will temporarily dampen Q2 YoY revenue growth, as it did with Q1, however, their CC transcripts indicate that tactical exit will likely no longer affect YoY revenue going into Q3 and Q4.\n\nBut this upcoming earnings report is less about revenue growth than it is about forward guidance and updates on their ongoing restructuring, acquisition pipeline and how their recent deleveraging will affect margins and free cash flow.\n\nThey reported strong FCF growth last quarter and a recent CNNE quarterly report revealed that, along with recently paying down $1.2 billion in debt, upon a Moody's upgrade, Paysafe successfully refinanced their remaining debt. This, overall restructuring could translate to $150+ million in cost savings annually which can dramatically improve their profit, free cash flow and M&amp;A outlook: critical elements of their growth strategy.\n\nEPS\n\nEven if this ER is about forward guidance, there\u2019s a good chance for an EPS beat which will make Q2 Paysafe\u2019s first profitable quarter as a newly public company. Analysts\u2019 average EPS estimate is reported to be 0.01 or 0.02 (depending on the source). We know that in Q1, without the $90+ million in one-time, non-recurring expenses associated with going public and paying down $1.2B debt, they would have beat analysts estimates with a positive EPS. For Q2, they won\u2019t have those expenses so, unless they introduce new costs from refinancing or impairment expenses on intangible assets, there appears to be solid basis for an EPS beat. My loose guess is for 0.05 EPS or better. Not a big deal to me if it doesn\u2019t work out that way, but it\u2019s entirely plausible.\n\nRevenue\n\nRegarding revenue, even though Paysafe is already integrated as a payment processor with 75% of US iGaming operators, let\u2019s ignore the facts that\n\n* many new states have legalized sports betting during Q1/Q2 (see below),\n* Paysafe\u2019s Q2 revenue could be bolstered by the strong growth recently reported by its several partners like Wynn, Caesar\u2019s, DraftKings and Penn,\n* Paysafe has new revenue streams from recent deals with Coinbase, Microsoft/XBox, Luckbox, Wix, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, PointsBet, Virginia Lottery, Rent Moola, Provena, FoxBet, Golden Nugget etc.,\n* Paysafe said early Q2 was already showing signs of record growth: \u201cWe continue to be pleased with where the top-line trends are going. We've had some actual record days in e-commerce processing, historical records, not just recovery records, but historical records.\u201d\n* or that the American Gaming Association reports sports betting has generated $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2021, 20% more than all of 2020 combined ($1.5B).\n\nRather than speculate about how much of that new revenue will affect Paysafe\u2019s Q2 balance sheet, I prefer to keep my sights on analysts estimates and Paysafe\u2019s own guidance, which has conservatively excluded US iGaming growth projections (55% CAGR).\n\nPaysafe offers Q2 revenue guidance of $365 - $385 million. With $341 million in revenue for Q1\u201920, this represents 7% to 13% YoY quarterly growth. We\u2019ve seen very little reason for them to miss this guidance. Quite the contrary.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 average Q2 revenue estimate is reported to be between $371.5 million and $378 million (depending on the source). That's right in the middle of guidance. Last quarter, Paysafe came in at the upper range of their guidance which, given all the good news, suggests that there\u2019s a very good chance that they\u2019ll beat the analyst estimate. That would result in around 9% to 11% YoY quarterly growth, which would be a solid improvement from Q1.\n\nAs a long-term investor, I\u2019ll be happy with anything above 7%. From there, any upside surprise will be welcome.\n\nLast quarter, Paysafe confirmed their 2021 full year projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume. Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.\n\nThis confirmed guidance implies that Q3 and Q4 will likely represent stronger revenue growth to compensate for the sluggish Q1 growth due to the channel exits. By Q3, Paysafe's balance sheet should reflect their many new partnerships and new US state markets opening up to legalized sports betting.\n\nRecent Price Action\n\nAs Chairman of the Board Bill Foley recently noted, Paysafe \"has been unduly punished as the inevitable shareholder rotation plays out.\"\n\nOver the last few months many sources confirm regular and heavy intraday short volume (not short interest) which has successfully tanked the stock price on nothing but good news from the company. Meanwhile 13F filings continue to reveal institutions loading shares.\n\n\\[Side note: Some have a hard time wrapping their heads around this but the SEC allows this type of intraday price manipulation under the shield of making a market. It's a legal loophole that allows market makers to walk down (or up) the price to shake out weak hands in order to fill institutional orders by the end of each day. It doesn't help that many financial news outlets continue to misrepresent Paysafe\u2019s data, claiming they have only 4 employees and falsely reporting a massive Q1 EPS miss of -0.37 and -0.38 (Yahoo/CNBC). It was only 0.02. Such things can definitely deter investors who undertake proper due diligence so, hopefully, these outlets will get around to reporting accurate data.\\] But I digress.\n\nWhile the shenanigans have gone on, bringing the price near all time lows and pushing many retail shareholders to capitulation, Fintel reports institutions are accumulating 21 times more than they are selling. Very recent 13F\u2019s show Susquehanna increased their stake by 48% to over 3 million shares, Citigroup increased their position by 5000% to around 1.3 million shares, Bank of New York Mellon bought half a million shares and BlackRock just opened a new position of 8.3 million shares.\n\nBottom?\n\nWhoever has been pinning the stock down has always stopped near these current levels because its more or less the price paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares). In fact, the current price is likely below where Wells Fargo bought 13M shares, where BlackRock bought their 8.3M shares and where Blackstone took on another 37 million shares, according to their 13F's.\n\nThe current low price poses an interesting opportunity for value investors because, since those major fund managers decided to invest near this level, Paysafe has had zero bad news while steadily executing on their promised strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and as Bill Foley put it, \u201ccross-sell, cross-sell and cross-sell.\u201d\n\nSaid in another way, because Paysafe has excluded US iGaming growth from its projections, literally none of the following developments in value creation have yet been priced in:\n\n* Dec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments\n* Dec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n* Dec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers\n* Jan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform\n* Jan 13 \u2014 Paysafecard launches in Moldova\n* Feb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform\n* Feb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n* Feb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n* Feb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models\n* Feb 26 \u2014 Paysafe wins \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award\n* Mar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n* Mar 4 \u2014 Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n* Mar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n* Mar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan\n* Mar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases\n* Mar 18 \u2014 Paysafe announces new Board of Directors\n* Mar 19 \u2014 Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta\n* Mar 25 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase\n* April 1 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program\n* April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook\n* April 15 \u2014 Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador\n* April 21 \u2014 Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022\n* April 27 \u2014 Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers\n* April 29 \u2014 Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring\n* May 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving\n* May 20 \u2014 Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US\n* May 26 \u2014 REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments\n* June 1 \u2014 Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth\n* June 2 \u2014 Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe\n* June 3 \u2014 Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market\n* June 7 \u2014 Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments\n* June 23\u2014Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash\n* June 29 \u2014 Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan\n* June 30 \u2014 Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best \u2018Affiliate Software Supplier\u2019\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.\n* July 13 \u2014 Paysafe adds 20 new digital currencies to its digital wallet and expands this service to 11 new US states, bringing US presence to 48 states.\n* July 14 \u2014 Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution\n* July 19 \u2014 Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants.\n* July 20 \u2014 Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe\u2019s Income Access\n* July 21 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable \u2018banking-as-a-service\u2019 solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services.

We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\nRounding out the Picture:\n\n\\#1 global leader in iGaming, #2 digital wallet in the world, and #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It has a transactional volume approaching $100 billion in over 40 currencies.\n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n\\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). 11 -- By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). 12\n\niGaming Expansion\n\nIt's worth repeating that Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s expertise in multi-jurisdictional regulations is an important aspect of its competitive MOAT (as discussed below). Paysafe is also an integrated back-end payment processor so many users don\u2019t realize they are utlizing their gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.\n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n\nFund manager Dan Loeb agrees: \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n\nCompass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d\n\nDel Grosso, who gave Paysafe a $19 price target added, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d 5 Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n\n\u200b\n\n* \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n* \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n* \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n* \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n* \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n* \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n* \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n* \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n* \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n* \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n* \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n* \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n* \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n* \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n* \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n* \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\nAnalysts universally rate Paysafe as a \"BUY\"\n\nSome quotes :\n\nRBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d 4\n\nRBC recently reiterated their Outperform rating saying: \u201cOur positive thesis is predicated on three key points including: (1) PSFE has a unique set of assets within the payments space, in that it\u2019s a digital wallet, an integrated payment platform (with \\\\\\~50% tethered to online transactions), and provides an on ramp for cash to be digitized via eCash, and it\u2019s the combination of the three that create a two-sided market (serving both merchants &amp; consumers), (2) new secular growth opportunity in US iGaming, which is in its early innings and could surprise investors to the upside, and (3) Bill Foley (Non-Executive Chairman) and his team have a long history of driving share holder value, which we expect to continue at PSFE.\n\nBMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" 3\n\nEvercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' 2\n\nMOAT: \u201crobust risk management operation\u201d\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and how is it able offer eCommerce services to the unbanked?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d 9\n\nValuation\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\nPaysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n\nBy comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\nPaysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth (recent new acquisition) nor their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated. This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth. In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. Incorporating US iGaming growth will of course reveal a whole new picture.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\n## Paysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n\u200b\n\n## More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\n\u200b\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up. Veteran market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\nThis is not investment advice. For those who do want to invest in Paysafe, my only advice is to stay away from options. I\u2019ve watched this stock for a long time and the market makers have a track record of ruthlessly blowing up those positions. Common shares is the way.\n\nSources:\n\n(1) see institutional ownership (WSB won\u2019t allow link)\n\n(2) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)\n\n(3) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(4) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(5) [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10) [https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi](https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi)\n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)",

Popular analyst Steve Grasso has been calling for it to triple.\n\nUsing the lower end of Paysafe\u2019s forecasted EBITDA ($500M), $1.5B revenue, an EV adjusted for $1.8B debt, and applying the post-merger pro forma 720M outstanding shares, here are Paysafe\u2019s potential share prices based solely on sector peer **EV/EBITDA ratios:**\n\n\u2043 PayPal : $269B EV/ $4.47B EBITDA\n\n    \t= 60.2x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $28.2B EV / SP: $39.28    \n\n\u2043 Repay : $2.2B EV/ $30M EBITDA\n\n    \t = 73.3x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $34.8B EV / SP: $48.43    \n\n\u2043 Shift 4 : $7.7B EV/ $90M EBITDA\n\n    \t= 85x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $41B EV / SP: $56.91    \n\n\u2043 Nuvei : $15B EV/ $171M EBITDA\n\n    \t= 87.7x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $42B EV / SP: $58.40    \n\n\u2043 Adyen : $56B EV/ $273M EBITDA\n\n    \t= 205x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $101B EV / SP: $139    \n\n\u2043 Square : $107B EV/ $357M EBITDA\n\n    \t= 299.7x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $148B EV / SP: $205.64    \n\n\u2043 [Bill.com](https://bill.com/) : $13.2B EV/ -$15.6M EBITDA\n\n    \t= 308x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $152B EV / SP: $211.39    \n\n\u2043 Affirm: $21.6B EV/ -$68M EBITDA\n\n    \t= 317x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $156.7B EV /SP: $217.64    \n\nEV/Revenue ratio , non-public company\u2019s with estimated revenue per recent funding rounds:\n\n\u2043 Stripe : $95B EV/ $1.8B est. rev\n\n    \t= 52.8x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $77.3B EV / SP: $107.44    \n\n\u2043 Chime : $30B EV/ $600M est. rev\n\n    \t= 50x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $73.2B EV /SP: $101.67    \n\n\u2043 Checkout : $15B EV/ $100M est. rev\n\n    \t= 150x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $223.2B EV / SP: $310    \n\nNote: Most of these companies have negative earnings and smaller margins than Paysafe.\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting it\u2019s worth this much, but for reference, averaging the above multiples would put BFT/Paysafe\u2019s share price at $135.98\n\nMore realistically, taking the average from the lowest four puts the share price at $50.75.\n\nPaysafe is the number 1 digital wallet in Igaming and is used by the top sports gambling company Draftkings. As all SPACs do now, it sold off big today with the ticker change so there has never been a better time to buy than now!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEssential DD on PSFE:\n\nPaysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPartnered with Coinbase, Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, and Pointsbet among many others.\n\nVoted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n\nPaysafe has the #2 digital wallet globally with a presence in 120 countries. They own Skrill, which is enabled for CTC trading.\n\nIn Europe, where Paysafe is more known, Trustpilot rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) with over 29,000 reviews, and Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews. They are currently laying the groundwork for their US expansion.\n\nUnlike any other payment processor, Paysafecard enables those without bank accounts or credit cards (the over 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d) to engage in online commerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.\n\nPaysafe\u2019s industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are slow to enter. CEO Philip McHugh: \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\nIn Q1 Paysafe had $90 million in one-time expenses associated with merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. This means without those expenses they would have beat analysts estimates and, going forward, they are well positioned to beat analysts EPS estimates for the rest of the year.\n\nRecent debt management, saving around $92 million annually, secures higher margins and higher profits which will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.\n\nPaysafe confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 growth projection which doesn\u2019t include planned inorganic M&amp;A growth pipeline and iGaming expansion (55% CAGR).\n\nFrom 2017 to 2019, under Blackstone/CVC stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion. (28% CAGR) 2020 saw revenue stagnate due to Covid-related business closures and high-risk channel exits but, even so, if you add 2020\u2019s performance, 2017-2020 still amounts to a respectable 18% CAGR, roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth.\n\nBuy rating from all seven analysts covering Paysafe, with 50-70% upside from current price but, with everything noted above, it\u2019s clear that Paysafe would still be significantly undervalued when compared to a basket of comps (PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign) with a collective growth rate of \\~12.5% (in Paysafe\u2019s 10-13% range):\n\nPaysafe's price based on sector peer multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\nValuation Notes:\n\n* Removed all high outliers in each category putting PSFE at $100+\n* Unlike Paysafe's reported $362 million in free cash flow (on track to increase 29%) and 30%+ EBITDA margin, half of peers report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.\n* Paysafe has better EPS than over half of the peer group\n* Paysafe has better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them\n\nChairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, Bill Foley, has a proven track record in generating value for his investors through rapid synergistic inorganic growth. This is a key strategic pillar for Paysafe. Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). He says, \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Buy the DIP",

        "selftext": "Q2 Earnings: August 16 - premarket\n\nTLDR: Institutions are currently buying 21x more than selling while it trades near all time low. None of the long list below has been priced in yet.\n\nIn light of China\u2019s recent crackdown on payment processors, FinTech company Paysafe\u2019s strategic move last year to exit those high-risk revenue channels is looking pretty smart. This de-risking will temporarily dampen Q2 YoY revenue growth, as it did with Q1, however, their CC transcripts indicate that tactical exit will likely no longer affect YoY revenue going into Q3 and Q4.\n\nBut this upcoming earnings report is less about revenue growth than it is about forward guidance and updates on their ongoing restructuring, acquisition pipeline and how their recent deleveraging will affect margins and free cash flow.\n\nThey reported strong FCF growth last quarter and a recent CNNE quarterly report revealed that, along with recently paying down $1.2 billion in debt, upon a Moody's upgrade, Paysafe successfully refinanced their remaining debt. This, overall restructuring could translate to $150+ million in cost savings annually which can dramatically improve their profit, free cash flow and M&amp;A outlook: critical elements of their growth strategy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEPS\n\nEven if this ER is about forward guidance, there\u2019s a good chance for an EPS beat which will make Q2 Paysafe\u2019s first profitable quarter as a newly public company. Analysts\u2019 average EPS estimate is reported to be 0.01 or 0.02 (depending on the source). We know that in Q1, without the $90+ million in one-time, non-recurring expenses associated with going public and paying down $1.2B debt, they would have beat analysts estimates with a positive EPS. For Q2, they won\u2019t have those expenses so, unless they introduce new costs from refinancing or impairment expenses on intangible assets, there appears to be solid basis for an EPS beat. My loose guess is for 0.05 EPS or better. Not a big deal to me if it doesn\u2019t work out that way, but it\u2019s entirely plausible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRevenue\n\nRegarding revenue, even though Paysafe is already integrated as a payment processor with 75% of US iGaming operators, let\u2019s ignore the facts that\n\n* many new states have legalized sports betting during Q1/Q2 (see below),\n* Paysafe\u2019s Q2 revenue could be bolstered by the strong growth recently reported by its several partners like Wynn, Caesar\u2019s, DraftKings and Penn,\n* Paysafe has new revenue streams from recent deals with Coinbase, Microsoft/XBox, Luckbox, Wix, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, PointsBet, Virginia Lottery, Rent Moola, Provena, FoxBet, Golden Nugget etc.,\n* Paysafe said early Q2 was already showing signs of record growth: \u201cWe continue to be pleased with where the top-line trends are going. We've had some actual record days in e-commerce processing, historical records, not just recovery records, but historical records.\u201d\n* or that the American Gaming Association reports sports betting has generated $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2021, 20% more than all of 2020 combined ($1.5B).\n\nRather than speculate about how much of that new revenue will affect Paysafe\u2019s Q2 balance sheet, I prefer to keep my sights on analysts estimates and Paysafe\u2019s own guidance, which has conservatively excluded US iGaming growth projections (55% CAGR).\n\nPaysafe offers Q2 revenue guidance of $365 - $385 million. With $341 million in revenue for Q1\u201920, this represents 7% to 13% YoY quarterly growth. We\u2019ve seen very little reason for them to miss this guidance. Quite the contrary.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 average Q2 revenue estimate is reported to be between $371.5 million and $378 million (depending on the source). That's right in the middle of guidance. Last quarter, Paysafe came in at the upper range of their guidance which, given all the good news, suggests that there\u2019s a very good chance that they\u2019ll beat the analyst estimate. That would result in around 9% to 11% YoY quarterly growth, which would be a solid improvement from Q1.\n\nAs a long-term investor, I\u2019ll be happy with anything above 7%. From there, any upside surprise will be welcome.\n\nLast quarter, Paysafe confirmed their 2021 full year projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume. Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.\n\nThis confirmed guidance implies that Q3 and Q4 will likely represent stronger revenue growth to compensate for the sluggish Q1 growth due to the channel exits. By Q3, Paysafe's balance sheet should reflect their many new partnerships and new US state markets opening up to legalized sports betting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecent Price Action\n\nAs Chairman of the Board Bill Foley recently noted, Paysafe \"has been unduly punished as the inevitable shareholder rotation plays out.\"\n\nOver the last few months many sources confirm regular and heavy intraday short volume (not short interest) which has successfully tanked the stock price on nothing but good news from the company. Meanwhile 13F filings continue to reveal institutions loading shares.\n\n\\[Side note: Some have a hard time wrapping their heads around this but the SEC allows this type of intraday price manipulation under the shield of making a market. It's a legal loophole that allows market makers to walk down (or up) the price to shake out weak hands in order to fill institutional orders by the end of each day. It doesn't help that many financial news outlets continue to misrepresent Paysafe\u2019s data, claiming they have only 4 employees and falsely reporting a massive Q1 EPS miss of -0.37 and -0.38 (Yahoo/CNBC). It was only 0.02. Such things can definitely deter investors who undertake proper due diligence so, hopefully, these outlets will get around to reporting accurate data.\\] But I digress.\n\nWhile the shenanigans have gone on, bringing the price near all time lows and pushing many retail shareholders to capitulation, Fintel reports institutions are accumulating 21 times more than they are selling. Very recent 13F\u2019s show Susquehanna increased their stake by 48% to over 3 million shares, Citigroup increased their position by 5000% to around 1.3 million shares, Bank of New York Mellon bought half a million shares and BlackRock just opened a new position of 8.3 million shares.\n\nBottom?\n\nWhoever has been pinning the stock down has always stopped near these current levels because its more or less the price paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares). In fact, the current price is likely below where Wells Fargo bought 13M shares, where BlackRock bought their 8.3M shares and where Blackstone took on another 37 million shares, according to their 13F's.\n\nThe current low price poses an interesting opportunity for value investors because, since those major fund managers decided to invest near this level, Paysafe has had zero bad news while steadily executing on their promised strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and as Bill Foley put it, \u201ccross-sell, cross-sell and cross-sell.\u201d\n\nSaid in another way, because Paysafe has excluded US iGaming growth from its projections, literally none of the following developments in value creation have yet been priced in:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Dec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments\n* Dec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n* Dec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers\n* Jan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform\n* Jan 13 \u2014 Paysafecard launches in Moldova\n* Feb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform\n* Feb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n* Feb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n* Feb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal serviceFeb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models\n* Feb 26 \u2014 Paysafe wins \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award\n* Mar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n* Mar 4 \u2014 Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n* Mar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n* Mar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan\n* Mar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases\n* Mar 18 \u2014 Paysafe announces new Board of Directors\n* Mar 19 \u2014 Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta\n* Mar 25 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands digital currency offering to US with Coinbase\n* April 1 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program\n* April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook\n* April 15 \u2014 Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador\n* April 21 \u2014 Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022\n* April 27 \u2014 Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers\n* April 29 \u2014 Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring\n* May 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving\n* May 20 \u2014 Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US\n* May 26 \u2014 REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments\n* June 1 \u2014 Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth\n* June 2 \u2014 Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe\n* June 3 \u2014 Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market\n* June 7 \u2014 Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments\n* June 23\u2014Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash\n* June 29 \u2014 Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan\n* June 30 \u2014 Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best \u2018Affiliate Software Supplier\u2019\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.\n* July 13 \u2014 Paysafe adds 20 new digital currencies to its digital wallet and expands this service to 11 new USstates, bringing US presence to 48 states.\n* July 14 \u2014 Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution\n* July 19 \u2014 Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants\n* .July 20 \u2014 Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe\u2019s Income Access\n* July 21 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable \u2018banking-as-a-service\u2019 solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services.

This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE\u2019s Q4 top line a solid boost.\n* Aug 4 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe\u2019s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. \"Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe\u2019s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks.\" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe\u2019s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, digital currencies and even PayPal.)\n* Aug 9 \u2014 Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor\n* Aug 10 \u2014 Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM&amp;A / inorganic growth\n\nAlong the lines of value creation, Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, \u201can aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.\u201d\n\nInorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. Yeah, that's 3,600X. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).\n\nThrough his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d 6,9\n\nFoley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: \u201cFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRounding out the Picture:\n\n\\#1 global leader in iGaming, #2 digital wallet in the world, and #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It has a transactional volume approaching $100 billion in over 40 currencies.\n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n\\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). 11 -- By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). 12\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\niGaming Expansion\n\nIt's worth repeating that Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s expertise in multi-jurisdictional regulations is an important aspect of its competitive MOAT (as discussed below). Paysafe is also an integrated back-end payment processor so many users don\u2019t realize they are utlizing their gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.\n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n\nFund manager Dan Loeb agrees: \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n\nCompass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d\n\nDel Grosso, who gave Paysafe a $19 price target added, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d 5 Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnalysts universally rate Paysafe as a \"BUY\"\n\nSome quotes :\n\nRBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d 4\n\nRBC recently reiterated their Outperform rating saying: \u201cOur positive thesis is predicated on three key points including: (1) PSFE has a unique set of assets within the payments space, in that it\u2019s a digital wallet, an integrated payment platform (with \\\\\\~50% tethered to online transactions), and provides an on ramp for cash to be digitized via eCash, and it\u2019s the combination of the three that create a two-sided market (serving both merchants &amp; consumers), (2) new secular growth opportunity in US iGaming, which is in its early innings and could surprise investors to the upside, and (3) Bill Foley (Non-Executive Chairman) and his team have a long history of driving share holder value, which we expect to continue at PSFE.\n\nBMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" 3\n\nEvercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' 2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMOAT: \u201crobust risk management operation\u201d\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and how is it able offer eCommerce services to the unbanked?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d 9\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nValuation\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\nPaysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n\nBy comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\nPaysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth (recent new acquisition) nor their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated. This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth. In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. Incorporating US iGaming growth will of course reveal a whole new picture.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up. Veteran market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not investment advice. For those who do want to invest in Paysafe, my only advice is to stay away from options. I\u2019ve watched this stock for a long time and the market makers have a track record of ruthlessly blowing up those positions. Common shares is the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n(1) [https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe](https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe).\n\n(2) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)\n\n(3) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(4) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(5) [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10) global capital\n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)",

This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe\u2019s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.\n\nLast week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%.  But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20% to an astonishingly low 3.85X price to sales.\n\nWhy did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : \u201cPaysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.\u201d \n\nTo be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion.  They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs \\~ $105 billion)  \n\nSo why the miss?  Analysts\u2019 modeling assumed that 2021\u2019s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. \n\nThe company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. \n\nGaps like that typically get filled if there\u2019s no material negative news.  On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion\n* Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA \n* Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million\n* Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. \n* 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter)\n* 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture)\n* 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV)\n* Revenue growth in all segments\n* eCash revenue +37% YoY  (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries)\n* North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY\n* Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits)\n* Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance\n* Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs\n* Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage.\n* Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring &amp; E-commerce\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurther, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, \u201cPaysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing online markets.\u201d  Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America\u2019s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.)\n\nWith their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America.\n\nImportantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe\u2019s current projections don\u2019t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost.  Management noted, \u201cThese transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units\u2026The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.\u201d  \n\nThis quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV.  Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1.\n\nChairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, \u201cWe see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.\u201d \n\nThese new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley\u2019s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&amp;A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts\u2019 neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality.  In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance.  Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. \n\n \n\nPaysafe vs PayPal\n\nSeemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a \"free cash flow machine.\"  The author apparently didn\u2019t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. \n\nIn fact, if you applied PayPal\u2019s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe\u2019s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow,  Paysafe\u2019s share price would be $32.  A 4x gain from current levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider:\n\n1. 1) PayPal\u2019s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.)  On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY.  With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe.  Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe\u2019s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. \n2. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk \u201cbuy now/pay later\u201d business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces.  \n3. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe\u2019s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth.  \n4. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe\u2019s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR).\n5. PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 425%.\n6. Based on Paysafe\u2019s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60\n7. Based on Paysafe\u2019s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal\u2019s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe\u2019s share price at $28.40.\n8. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt).  During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. \n\n* By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR.\n* Paysafe hasn\u2019t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe\u2019s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal\u2019s share value growth of 460%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are obviously many different factors to consider so I\u2019m not making any claims about fair value here. It\u2019s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe\u2019s share price between $28 and $32.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome Background:\n\nPaysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. \n\nAs an integrated back-end payment processor, most don\u2019t realize they are using Paysafe\u2019s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.  Within the industry, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews).  \n\nBy contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). \n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMOAT:\n\nPaysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its \u201crobust risk management.\u201d Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. \n\nCEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\niGaming Expansion\n\nPaysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape.\n\nImportantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d \n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n\nFund manager Dan Loeb agrees: \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n\nCompass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d\n\nSome headlines since Del Grasso wrote \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d:\n\n* \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n* \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n* \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n* \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n* \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n* \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n* \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n* \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n* \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n* \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n* \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n* \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n* \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n* \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d (Paysafe is market leader in Canada)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). \n\nThe current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors.  In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.\n\nEssentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in:\n\n* Dec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments\n* Dec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n* Dec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers\n* Jan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform\n* Jan 13 \u2014 Paysafecard launches in Moldova\n* Feb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform\n* Feb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n* Feb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n* Feb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models\n* Feb 26 \u2014 Paysafe wins \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award\n* Mar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n* Mar 4 \u2014 Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n* Mar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\\\\\n* Mar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan\n* Mar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases\n* Mar 18 \u2014 Paysafe announces new Board of Directors\n* Mar 19 \u2014 Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta\n* Mar 25 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase\n* April 1 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program\n* April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook\n* April 15 \u2014 Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador\n* April 21 \u2014 Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022\n* April 27 \u2014 Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers\n* April 29 \u2014 Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring\n* May 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving\n* May 20 \u2014 Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US\n* May 26 \u2014 REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments\n* June 1 \u2014 Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth\n* June 2 \u2014 Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe\n* June 3 \u2014 Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market\n* June 7 \u2014 Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments\n* June 23\u2014Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash\n* June 29 \u2014 Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan\n* June 30 \u2014 Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best \u2018Affiliate Software Supplier\u2019\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.\n* July 13 \u2014 Paysafe adds 20 new digital currencies to its digital wallet and expands this service to 11 new US states, bringing US presence to 48 states.\n* July 14 \u2014 Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution\n* July 19 \u2014 Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants.\n* July 20 \u2014 Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe\u2019s Income Access\n* July 21 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable \u2018banking-as-a-service\u2019 solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services.

This deal is a direct result of Paysafe\u2019s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. \"Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe\u2019s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks.\" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe\u2019s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.)\n* Aug 9 \u2014 Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor\n* Aug 10 \u2014 Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division\n* Aug 16 \u2014 Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% \n* Aug 16 \u2014 Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay \n* Aug 22 \u2014 Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM&amp;A / inorganic growth\n\nBill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, \u201can aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.\u201d\n\nInorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge.  Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).\n\nThrough his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\nFoley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: \u201cFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nValuation Metrics:\n\nAbove I compared Paysafe with PayPal.  A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n\\- Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow.\n\n\\- By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\n\\- Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels.  In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth  But even if you include 2020\u2019s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not investment advice.  Just a collections of observations.

        "selftext": "Q2 Earnings: August 16 - premarket\n\nTLDR: Institutions are currently buying 21x more than selling while it trades near all time low. None of the long list below has been priced in yet.\n\nIn light of China\u2019s recent crackdown on payment processors, FinTech company Paysafe\u2019s strategic move last year to exit those high-risk revenue channels is looking pretty smart. This de-risking will temporarily dampen Q2 YoY revenue growth, as it did with Q1, however, their CC transcripts indicate that tactical exit will likely no longer affect YoY revenue going into Q3 and Q4.\n\nBut this upcoming earnings report is less about revenue growth than it is about forward guidance and updates on their ongoing restructuring, acquisition pipeline and how their recent deleveraging will affect margins and free cash flow.\n\nThey reported strong FCF growth last quarter and a recent CNNE quarterly report revealed that, along with recently paying down $1.2 billion in debt, upon a Moody's upgrade, Paysafe successfully refinanced their remaining debt. This, overall restructuring could translate to $150+ million in cost savings annually which can dramatically improve their profit, free cash flow and M&amp;A outlook: critical elements of their growth strategy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEPS\n\nEven if this ER is about forward guidance, there\u2019s a good chance for an EPS beat which will make Q2 Paysafe\u2019s first profitable quarter as a newly public company. Analysts\u2019 average EPS estimate is reported to be 0.01 or 0.02 (depending on the source). We know that in Q1, without the $90+ million in one-time, non-recurring expenses associated with going public and paying down $1.2B debt, they would have beat analysts estimates with a positive EPS. For Q2, they won\u2019t have those expenses so, unless they introduce new costs from refinancing or impairment expenses on intangible assets, there appears to be solid basis for an EPS beat. My loose guess is for 0.05 EPS or better. Not a big deal to me if it doesn\u2019t work out that way, but it\u2019s entirely plausible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRevenue\n\nRegarding revenue, even though Paysafe is already integrated as a payment processor with 75% of US iGaming operators, let\u2019s ignore the facts that\n\n* many new states have legalized sports betting during Q1/Q2 (see below),\n* Paysafe\u2019s Q2 revenue could be bolstered by the strong growth recently reported by its several partners like Wynn, Caesar\u2019s, DraftKings and Penn,\n* Paysafe has new revenue streams from recent deals with Coinbase, Microsoft/XBox, Luckbox, Wix, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, PointsBet, Virginia Lottery, Rent Moola, Provena, FoxBet, Golden Nugget etc.,\n* Paysafe said early Q2 was already showing signs of record growth: \u201cWe continue to be pleased with where the top-line trends are going. We've had some actual record days in e-commerce processing, historical records, not just recovery records, but historical records.\u201d\n* or that the American Gaming Association reports sports betting has generated $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2021, 20% more than all of 2020 combined ($1.5B).\n\nRather than speculate about how much of that new revenue will affect Paysafe\u2019s Q2 balance sheet, I prefer to keep my sights on analysts estimates and Paysafe\u2019s own guidance, which has conservatively excluded US iGaming growth projections (55% CAGR).\n\nPaysafe offers Q2 revenue guidance of $365 - $385 million. With $341 million in revenue for Q1\u201920, this represents 7% to 13% YoY quarterly growth. We\u2019ve seen very little reason for them to miss this guidance. Quite the contrary.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 average Q2 revenue estimate is reported to be between $371.5 million and $378 million (depending on the source). That's right in the middle of guidance. Last quarter, Paysafe came in at the upper range of their guidance which, given all the good news, suggests that there\u2019s a very good chance that they\u2019ll beat the analyst estimate. That would result in around 9% to 11% YoY quarterly growth, which would be a solid improvement from Q1.\n\nAs a long-term investor, I\u2019ll be happy with anything above 7%. From there, any upside surprise will be welcome.\n\nLast quarter, Paysafe confirmed their 2021 full year projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume. Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.\n\nThis confirmed guidance implies that Q3 and Q4 will likely represent stronger revenue growth to compensate for the sluggish Q1 growth due to the channel exits. By Q3, Paysafe's balance sheet should reflect their many new partnerships and new US state markets opening up to legalized sports betting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecent Price Action\n\nAs Chairman of the Board Bill Foley recently noted, Paysafe \"has been unduly punished as the inevitable shareholder rotation plays out.\"\n\nOver the last few months many sources confirm regular and heavy intraday short volume (not short interest) which has successfully tanked the stock price on nothing but good news from the company. Meanwhile 13F filings continue to reveal institutions loading shares.\n\n\\[Side note: Some have a hard time wrapping their heads around this but the SEC allows this type of intraday price manipulation under the shield of making a market. It's a legal loophole that allows market makers to walk down (or up) the price to shake out weak hands in order to fill institutional orders by the end of each day. It doesn't help that many financial news outlets continue to misrepresent Paysafe\u2019s data, claiming they have only 4 employees and falsely reporting a massive Q1 EPS miss of -0.37 and -0.38 (Yahoo/CNBC). It was only 0.02. Such things can definitely deter investors who undertake proper due diligence so, hopefully, these outlets will get around to reporting accurate data.\\] But I digress.\n\nWhile the shenanigans have gone on, bringing the price near all time lows and pushing many retail shareholders to capitulation, Fintel reports institutions are accumulating 21 times more than they are selling. Very recent 13F\u2019s show Susquehanna increased their stake by 48% to over 3 million shares, Citigroup increased their position by 5000% to around 1.3 million shares, Bank of New York Mellon bought half a million shares and BlackRock just opened a new position of 8.3 million shares.\n\nBottom?\n\nWhoever has been pinning the stock down has always stopped near these current levels because its more or less the price paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares). In fact, the current price is likely below where Wells Fargo bought 13M shares, where BlackRock bought their 8.3M shares and where Blackstone took on another 37 million shares, according to their 13F's.\n\nThe current low price poses an interesting opportunity for value investors because, since those major fund managers decided to invest near this level, Paysafe has had zero bad news while steadily executing on their promised strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and as Bill Foley put it, \u201ccross-sell, cross-sell and cross-sell.\u201d\n\nSaid in another way, because Paysafe has excluded US iGaming growth from its projections, literally none of the following developments in value creation have yet been priced in:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Dec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments\n* Dec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n* Dec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers\n* Jan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform\n* Jan 13 \u2014 Paysafecard launches in Moldova\n* Feb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform\n* Feb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n* Feb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n* Feb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal serviceFeb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models\n* Feb 26 \u2014 Paysafe wins \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award\n* Mar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n* Mar 4 \u2014 Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n* Mar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n* Mar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan\n* Mar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases\n* Mar 18 \u2014 Paysafe announces new Board of Directors\n* Mar 19 \u2014 Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta\n* Mar 25 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands digital currency offering to US with Coinbase\n* April 1 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program\n* April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook\n* April 15 \u2014 Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador\n* April 21 \u2014 Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022\n* April 27 \u2014 Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers\n* April 29 \u2014 Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring\n* May 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving\n* May 20 \u2014 Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US\n* May 26 \u2014 REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments\n* June 1 \u2014 Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth\n* June 2 \u2014 Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe\n* June 3 \u2014 Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market\n* June 7 \u2014 Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments\n* June 23\u2014Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash\n* June 29 \u2014 Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan\n* June 30 \u2014 Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best \u2018Affiliate Software Supplier\u2019\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.\n* July 13 \u2014 Paysafe adds 20 new digital currencies to its digital wallet and expands this service to 11 new USstates, bringing US presence to 48 states.\n* July 14 \u2014 Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution\n* July 19 \u2014 Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants\n* .July 20 \u2014 Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe\u2019s Income Access\n* July 21 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable \u2018banking-as-a-service\u2019 solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services.

This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE\u2019s Q4 top line a solid boost.\n* Aug 4 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe\u2019s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. \"Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe\u2019s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks.\" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe\u2019s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, digital currencies and even PayPal.)\n* Aug 9 \u2014 Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor\n* Aug 10 \u2014 Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM&amp;A / inorganic growth\n\nAlong the lines of value creation, Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, \u201can aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.\u201d\n\nInorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. Yeah, that's 3,600X. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).\n\nThrough his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d 6,9\n\nFoley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: \u201cFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRounding out the Picture:\n\n\\#1 global leader in iGaming, #2 digital wallet in the world, and #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It has a transactional volume approaching $100 billion in over 40 currencies.\n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n\\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). 11 -- By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). 12\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\niGaming Expansion\n\nIt's worth repeating that Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s expertise in multi-jurisdictional regulations is an important aspect of its competitive MOAT (as discussed below). Paysafe is also an integrated back-end payment processor so many users don\u2019t realize they are utlizing their gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.\n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n\nFund manager Dan Loeb agrees: \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n\nCompass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d\n\nDel Grosso, who gave Paysafe a $19 price target added, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d 5 Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnalysts universally rate Paysafe as a \"BUY\"\n\nSome quotes :\n\nRBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d 4\n\nRBC recently reiterated their Outperform rating saying: \u201cOur positive thesis is predicated on three key points including: (1) PSFE has a unique set of assets within the payments space, in that it\u2019s a digital wallet, an integrated payment platform (with \\\\\\~50% tethered to online transactions), and provides an on ramp for cash to be digitized via eCash, and it\u2019s the combination of the three that create a two-sided market (serving both merchants &amp; consumers), (2) new secular growth opportunity in US iGaming, which is in its early innings and could surprise investors to the upside, and (3) Bill Foley (Non-Executive Chairman) and his team have a long history of driving share holder value, which we expect to continue at PSFE.\n\nBMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" 3\n\nEvercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' 2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMOAT: \u201crobust risk management operation\u201d\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and how is it able offer eCommerce services to the unbanked?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d 9\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nValuation\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\nPaysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n\nBy comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\nPaysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth (recent new acquisition) nor their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated. This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth. In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. Incorporating US iGaming growth will of course reveal a whole new picture.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up. Veteran market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not investment advice. For those who do want to invest in Paysafe, my only advice is to stay away from options. I\u2019ve watched this stock for a long time and the market makers have a track record of ruthlessly blowing up those positions. Common shares is the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n(1) [https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe](https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe).\n\n(2) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)\n\n(3) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(4) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(5) [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10) global capital\n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)",

        "selftext": "Q2 Earnings:  August 16 - premarket\n\nIn light of China\u2019s recent crackdown on payment processors, FinTech company Paysafe\u2019s strategic move last year to exit those high-risk revenue channels is looking pretty smart.  This de-risking will temporarily dampen Q2 YoY revenue growth, as it did with Q1, however, their CC transcripts indicate that tactical exit will likely no longer affect YoY revenue going into Q3 and Q4.\n\nBut this upcoming earnings report is less about revenue growth than it is about forward guidance and updates on their ongoing restructuring, acquisition pipeline and how their recent deleveraging will affect margins and free cash flow.\n\nThey reported strong FCF growth last quarter and a recent CNNE quarterly report revealed that, along with recently paying down $1.2 billion in debt, upon a Moody's upgrade, Paysafe successfully refinanced their remaining debt. This, overall restructuring could translate to $150+ million in cost savings annually which can dramatically improve their profit, free cash flow and M&amp;A outlook: critical elements of their growth strategy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# EPS\n\nEven if this ER is about forward guidance, there\u2019s a good chance for an EPS beat which will make Q2 Paysafe\u2019s first profitable quarter as a newly public company.  Analysts\u2019 average EPS estimate is reported to be 0.01 or 0.02 (depending on the source).  We know that in Q1, without the $90+ million in one-time, non-recurring expenses associated with going public and paying down $1.2B debt, they would have beat analysts estimates with a positive EPS.  For Q2, they won\u2019t have those expenses so, unless they introduce new costs from refinancing or impairment expenses on intangible assets, there appears to be solid basis for an EPS beat.  My loose guess is for 0.05 EPS or better. Not a big deal to me if it doesn\u2019t work out that way, but it\u2019s entirely plausible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Revenue\n\nRegarding revenue, even though Paysafe is already integrated as a payment processor with 75% of US iGaming operators, let\u2019s ignore the facts that\n\n* many new states have legalized sports betting during Q1/Q2 (see below),\n* Paysafe\u2019s Q2 revenue could be bolstered by the strong growth recently reported by its several partners like Wynn, Caesar\u2019s, DraftKings and Penn,\n* Paysafe has new revenue streams from recent deals with Coinbase, Microsoft/XBox, Luckbox, Wix, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, PointsBet, Virginia Lottery, Rent Moola, Provena, FoxBet, Golden Nugget etc.,\n* Paysafe said early Q2 was already showing signs of record growth: \u201cWe continue to be pleased with where the top-line trends are going. We've had some actual record days in e-commerce processing, historical records, not just recovery records, but historical records.\u201d\n* or that the American Gaming Association reports sports betting has generated $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2021, 20% more than all of 2020 combined ($1.5B).\n\nRather than speculate about how much of that new revenue will affect Paysafe\u2019s Q2 balance sheet, I prefer to keep my sights on analysts estimates and Paysafe\u2019s own guidance, which has conservatively excluded US iGaming growth projections (55% CAGR).\n\nPaysafe offers Q2 revenue guidance of $365 - $385 million.  With $341 million in revenue for Q1\u201920, this represents 7% to 13% YoY quarterly growth.  We\u2019ve seen very little reason for them to miss this guidance. Quite the contrary.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 average Q2 revenue estimate is reported to be between $371.5 million and $378 million (depending on the source).  That's right in the middle of guidance.  Last quarter, Paysafe came in at the upper range of their guidance which, given all the good news, suggests that there\u2019s a very good chance that they\u2019ll beat the analyst estimate.  That would result in around 9% to 11% YoY quarterly growth, which would be a solid improvement from Q1.\n\nAs a long-term investor, I\u2019ll be happy with anything above 7%.  From there, any upside surprise will be welcome.\n\nLast quarter, Paysafe confirmed their 2021 full year projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume. Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.\n\nThis confirmed guidance implies that Q3 and Q4 will likely represent stronger revenue growth to compensate for the sluggish Q1 growth due to the channel exits.  By Q3, Paysafe's balance sheet should reflect their many new partnerships and new US state markets opening up to legalized sports betting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Recent Price Action\n\nAs Chairman of the Board Bill Foley recently noted, Paysafe \"has been unduly punished as the inevitable shareholder rotation plays out.\"\n\nOver the last few months many sources confirm regular and heavy intraday short volume (not short interest) which has successfully tanked the stock price on nothing but good news from the company. Meanwhile 13F filings continue to reveal institutions loading shares.\n\n\\[Side note: Some have a hard time wrapping their heads around this but the SEC allows this type of intraday price manipulation under the shield of making a market.  It's a legal loophole that allows market makers to walk down (or up) the price to shake out weak hands in order to fill institutional orders by the end of each day.  It doesn't help that many financial news outlets continue to misrepresent Paysafe\u2019s data, claiming they have only 4 employees and falsely reporting a massive Q1 EPS miss of -0.37 and -0.38 (Yahoo/CNBC). It was only 0.02. Such things can definitely deter investors who undertake proper due diligence so, hopefully, these outlets will get around to reporting accurate data.\\]  But I digress.\n\nWhile the shenanigans have gone on, bringing the price near all time lows and pushing many retail shareholders to capitulation, Fintel reports institutions are accumulating 21 times more than they are selling.  Very recent 13F\u2019s show Susquehanna increased their stake by 48% to over 3 million shares, Citigroup increased their position by 5000% to around 1.3 million shares, Bank of New York Mellon bought half a million shares and BlackRock just opened a new position of 8.3 million shares.\n\n# Bottom?\n\nWhoever has been pinning the stock down has always stopped near these current levels because its more or less the price paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  In fact, the current price is likely below where Wells Fargo bought 13M shares, where BlackRock bought their 8.3M shares and where Blackstone took on another 37 million shares, according to their 13F's.\n\nThe current low price poses an interesting opportunity for value investors because, since those major fund managers decided to invest near this level, Paysafe has had zero bad news while steadily executing on their promised strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and as Bill Foley put it, \u201ccross-sell, cross-sell and cross-sell.\u201d\n\nSaid in another way, because Paysafe has excluded US iGaming growth from its projections, literally none of the following developments in value creation have yet been priced in:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Dec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments\n* Dec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n* Dec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers\n* Jan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform\n* Jan 13 \u2014 Paysafecard launches in Moldova\n* Feb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform\n* Feb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n* Feb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n* Feb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models\n* Feb 26 \u2014 Paysafe wins \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award\n* Mar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n* Mar 4 \u2014 Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n* Mar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n* Mar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan\n* Mar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases\n* Mar 18 \u2014 Paysafe announces new Board of Directors\n* Mar 19 \u2014 Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta\n* Mar 25 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase\n* April 1 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program\n* April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook\n* April 15 \u2014 Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador\n* April 21 \u2014 Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022\n* April 27 \u2014 Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers\n* April 29 \u2014 Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring\n* May 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving\n* May 20 \u2014 Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US\n* May 26 \u2014 REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments\n* June 1 \u2014 Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth\n* June 2 \u2014 Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe\n* June 3 \u2014 Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market\n* June 7 \u2014 Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments\n* June 23\u2014Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash\n* June 29 \u2014 Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan\n* June 30 \u2014 Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best \u2018Affiliate Software Supplier\u2019\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.\n* July 13 \u2014 Paysafe adds 20 new digital currencies to its digital wallet and expands this service to 11 new US states, bringing US presence to 48 states.\n* July 14 \u2014 Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution\n* July 19 \u2014 Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants.\n* July 20 \u2014 Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe\u2019s Income Access\n* July 21 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable \u2018banking-as-a-service\u2019 solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services.

This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE\u2019s Q4 top line a solid boost.\n* Aug 4 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe\u2019s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. \"Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe\u2019s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks.\" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe\u2019s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.)\n* Aug 9 \u2014 Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor\n* Aug 10 \u2014 Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# M&amp;A / inorganic growth\n\nAlong the lines of value creation, Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, \u201can aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.\u201d\n\nInorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge.  Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. Yeah, that's 3,600X.  Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).\n\nThrough his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return.  He says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d ^(6,9)\n\nFoley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further:  \u201cFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Rounding out the Picture:\n\n\\#1 global leader in iGaming, #2 digital wallet in the world, and #4 globally in integrated merchant processing.  Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets.   It has a transactional volume approaching $100 billion in over 40 currencies.\n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.   Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n\\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11   --)   By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# iGaming Expansion\n\nIt's worth repeating that Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s expertise in multi-jurisdictional regulations is an important aspect of its competitive MOAT (as discussed below).  Paysafe is also an integrated back-end payment processor so many users don\u2019t realize they are utlizing their gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.\n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n\nFund manager Dan Loeb agrees: \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n\nCompass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d\n\nDel Grosso, who gave Paysafe a $19 price target added, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d ^(5)  Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n* \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n* \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n* \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n* \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n* \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n* \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n* \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n* \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n* \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n* \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n* \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n* \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n* \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n* \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n* \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Analysts universally rate Paysafe as a \"BUY\"\n\nSome quotes :\n\nRBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d ^(4)\n\nRBC recently reiterated their Outperform rating saying: \u201cOur positive thesis is predicated on three key points including: (1) PSFE has a unique set of assets within the payments space, in that it\u2019s a digital wallet, an integrated payment platform (with \\\\\\~50% tethered to online transactions), and provides an on ramp for cash to be digitized via eCash, and it\u2019s the combination of the three that create a two-sided market (serving both merchants &amp; consumers), (2) new secular growth opportunity in US iGaming, which is in its early innings and could surprise investors to the upside, and (3) Bill Foley (Non-Executive Chairman) and his team have a long history of driving share holder value, which we expect to continue at PSFE.\n\nBMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" ^(3)\n\nEvercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# MOAT: \u201crobust risk management operation\u201d\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and how is it able offer eCommerce services to the unbanked?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d ^(9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Valuation\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\nPaysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n\nBy comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\nPaysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth (recent new acquisition) nor their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated. This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth. In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. Incorporating US iGaming growth will of course reveal a whole new picture.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n    \u2022\tEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n    \n    \u2022\tEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n    \n    \u2022\tEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\nMore conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n    \u2022\tEV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n    \n    \u2022\tEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n    \n    \u2022\tEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up. Veteran market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not investment advice. For those who do want to invest in Paysafe, my only advice is to stay away from options.  I\u2019ve watched this stock for a long time and the market makers have a track record of ruthlessly blowing up those positions.  Common shares is the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n(1) [https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe](https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe).\n\n(2) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)\n\n(3) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(4) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(5) [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10) [https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi](https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi)\n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)",

        "selftext": "There are three fairly basic ways that new traders lose money in 2021:\n\n**1)** They read some elaborate post about how some piece of garbage stock is the next MEME explosion.  To their newbie eyes the extensive DD looked convincing, and the stock is *only* $10 a share right now, so they they buy 1,000 shares.  And then they average down another 1,000. Two months later they are being told by the same people that were wrong about their DD to begin with,  to hold on to the now, $8 stock.  Even worse, they now believe that selling that stock is \"exactly what the evil hedge funds want you to do!\".  A few months after that they are questioning their life choices and stuck with a useless $4 stock.\n\n**2)** Most YouTube videos are geared towards trying to sell you a method of Day Trading that is based on *Gap n Go* strategies.  These methods, while real, are far more difficult than they are made to appear, but yet they are very marketable (i.e. \"how to turn $5,000 into $50,000!\").  Instead what happens is new traders become singularly focused on finding low float, highly shorted stocks that jump up after the open, convinced they are moments away from the next big score.  Once again, months later they are questioning their life choices and stuck with an account that has dropped far below the PDT requirements\n\nAnd finally that brings us to OTM options:\n\n**3)** Slightly more sophisticated than the first two methods of losing your money, this one requires actual thought and analysis.  \n\nThe appeal is obvious - they are cheap.  And if the stock explodes those options can double, triple, etc in value.  \n\nHere's why they don't work - The options themselves have no real value other than the pure premium you are paying.  When *buying* options, your goal should always be to pay as little premium as possible.  Ideally you would have options at total parity (i.e. Stock is at $100 and the $99 Call Option is worth - $1).  \n\nSimple formula here for ITM Options - (Strike Price + Option Price) - Stock Price = Premium you are paying.\n\nSimpler formula for OTM Options - Option Price = Premium you are paying.\n\nSo let's take an example -\n\nYou like **CSCO,** it is smart pick, the daily chart looks good, it is past earnings (and seriously, please stop holding options over earnings) and looks like clear skies ahead.  Two choices:\n\n56 Strike Call, Expires Aug 27th for $2.35\n\n59 Strike Call, Expires Aug 27th for .30 cents\n\nLet's say you are going to spend $500 - so you can get 2 of the 56 Calls or 16 of the 59 Calls.  \n\nIf next week CSCO hardly moves at all (current at $58.22), your 56 calls will be worth $2.22 - a loss of only 13 cents per call or $26.  \n\nHowever, in that same scenario, your 59 calls will expire worthless, a loss of $480.  \n\nOK, let's say CSCO goes up $1 next week, it is now at $59.22 - \n\nYour 56 Calls are now worth $3.22 (at expiration), a profit of .87 per call or $174.\n\nYour 59 calls are now worth .22 a loss of .08 per Call or -$128.\n\n**OTM Options place heavy lifting on the stock to get you to profitability.  You are betting on a huge move in the stock that pull your options ITM faster than Theta strips away their value.**    \n\n***You are almost always better off going with ITM options, that have a Delta of .6 or higher and are at least a week out, if not more.***  \n\nIn fact, if you just stuck to these three rules it would increase you likelihood of success a great deal:\n\n**1) Do not trade Options over earnings, trade them before, trade them after, but do not hold them** ***over*** **the earnings announcement.**\n\n**2) Do not go for the cheaper OTM options, instead choose Calls or Puts that have a higher Delta and are farther out in time.**\n\n**3) Do not trade Option Spreads unless you know how to leg out of them if they do not go your way.**\n\n(the 3rd one may seem like a small issue, but the number of people that get stuck in spreads they do not know how to exit is alarmingly high).\n\nThis advice may seem basic to some traders here, but if you look at the posts on this forum you will quickly see that the foundational rules you may have been following as a trader aren't as obvious as you think.  New traders clearly do not know these basic principles and we should stop assuming they do.",

        "selftext": "I posted [my July earnings trading report](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/ov71vv/my_july_earnings_report/) last month, and many of you were kind enough to share your thoughts with me.\n\nTLDR: My July results were almost a scratch, $93 into a positive column, and I was undecided if trading earnings is a worthwhile thing.\n\nFast forward to the end of August\u2026 I couldn\u2019t keep away from earnings, just love trading them.\n\nHere are my August stats:\n\n* 21 earnings trades (short condors and strangles, all small positions, average BPu $532.85 per position)\n* 19 wins and 2 losses. A win rate - 90%. Better than July\u2019s 77%. A little experience helps!\n* My wins brought in $567.68\n* Losses took away $104.00\n* Net profit $463.68.\n\nWins: ABNB, BBY, CRM, CSCO, DASH, GPS, HPQ, INTU, M, MRVL, NVDA, PTON, SNOW, SPLK, TGT, TJX, ULTA, URBN, WDC\n\nLosses: LOW, JWN\n\nThe wins are great - no doubt. But it is the losses that are really interesting and have a high learning value. My losses show my indecision between two lines of thought: to defend a losing trade or to exit ASAP to minimize the loss. I have seen convincing arguments for both approaches, and am not yet sure where I stand on this.\n\nI managed my losing LOW trade fairly well in the beginning, brought it from several hundred down to around $30 loss. I could have brought it to a win, but I made a mistake - misread where I was standing and exited for a small loss. I learned how to read the position correctly and did another losing trade right - turned it into a win.\n\nI decided to take a loss on JWN because my overall win rate for August was around 93% and I thought I could afford a small loss. But now I think it could\u2019ve been managed and perhaps turned. But we\u2019ll never know if it could and if I had the skill to do it.\n\nWhere do you stand on this question? Do you defend? Or take a loss and move on to the next trade?",

Last weeks theme was selling options, and boy did we sell! **$APPS short strangles returned close to 100%, with $BIDU following closely behind netting around 80%. Meme stocks also had muted volatility. I sold an $AMC 34 strangle for $630, and although I closed early, I was given the opportunity to close it out at the end of the week for mere pennies on the dollar. Last but not least, a long strangle on $UPST would\u2019ve netted you a whopping 460% return!** Unfortunately for us, earnings season is slowly coming to a close, meaning the quality of our plays will be diminishing greatly! Those looking to trade this week should proceed with caution, as there isn\u2019t much of an edge to be gained this time round. If you wish to track my trades and try them out for yourself, feel free to check out the community links on my profile! Let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don\u2019t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn\u2019t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It\u2019s literally all just gambling, and as a result I\u2019m probably gonna sit this week out entirely. Pay little attention to the sample plays below, as I\u2019ve only included them for inspiration, and in case anyone sees something I may have missed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Selling $DNUT puts may prove to be profitable.** Although justified, Krispy Kreme has been on a downtrend since its IPO. $DNUT is literally hemorrhaging money and fundamentally the company is a terrible investment.

Last weeks theme was selling options, and boy did we sell! **$APPS short strangles returned close to 100%, with $BIDU following closely behind netting around 80%. Meme stocks also had muted volatility. I sold an $AMC 34 strangle for $630, and although I closed early, I was given the opportunity to close it out at the end of the week for mere pennies on the dollar. Last but not least, a long strangle on $UPST would\u2019ve netted you a whopping 460% return!** Unfortunately for us, earnings season is slowly coming to a close, meaning the quality of our plays will be diminishing greatly! Those looking to trade this week should proceed with caution, as there isn\u2019t much of an edge to be gained this time round. If you wish to track my trades and try them out for yourself, feel free to check out the community links on my profile! Let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don\u2019t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn\u2019t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It\u2019s literally all just gambling, and as a result I\u2019m probably gonna sit this week out entirely. Pay little attention to the sample plays below, as I\u2019ve only included them for inspiration, and in case anyone sees something I may have missed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Selling $DNUT puts may prove to be profitable.** Although justified, Krispy Kreme has been on a downtrend since its IPO. $DNUT is literally hemorrhaging money and fundamentally the company is a terrible investment. A couple of years ago they actually went private after defrauding investors, doing shady audit practices, and literally using company money to buy back stores owned by family members of the executive board for FIVE TIMES what they were worth. More info on that [here.](https://www.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2009/03/three-krispy-kreme-ex-execs-settle-sec-charges/) Nowadays, the stock is priced as what it is - a fraudulent, cash burning business.

Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we\u2019re going up.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing.

Last weeks theme was selling options, and boy did we sell! **$APPS short strangles returned close to 100%, with $BIDU following closely behind netting around 80%. Meme stocks also had muted volatility. I sold an $AMC 34 strangle for $630, and although I closed early, I was given the opportunity to close it out at the end of the week for mere pennies on the dollar. Last but not least, a long strangle on $UPST would\u2019ve netted you a whopping 460% return!** Unfortunately for us, earnings season is slowly coming to a close, meaning the quality of our plays will be diminishing greatly! Those looking to trade this week should proceed with caution, as there isn\u2019t much of an edge to be gained this time round. If you wish to track my trades and try them out for yourself, feel free to check out the community links on my profile! Let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don\u2019t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn\u2019t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It\u2019s literally all just gambling, and as a result I\u2019m probably gonna sit this week out entirely. Pay little attention to the sample plays below, as I\u2019ve only included them for inspiration, and in case anyone sees something I may have missed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Selling $DNUT puts may prove to be profitable.** Although justified, Krispy Kreme has been on a downtrend since its IPO. $DNUT is literally hemorrhaging money and fundamentally the company is a terrible investment. A couple of years ago they actually went private after defrauding investors, doing shady audit practices, and literally using company money to buy back stores owned by family members of the executive board for FIVE TIMES what they were worth. More info on that [here.](https://www.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2009/03/three-krispy-kreme-ex-execs-settle-sec-charges/) Nowadays, the stock is priced as what it is - a fraudulent, cash burning business. Earnings is priced to fail, and as a result, any semblance of positive news will likely send us going upwards. If you have the balls, selling puts may prove to be profitable. The 15P is going for $0.80 giving you a breakeven of around 5.5%. You can even pickup pennies in front of the steamroller and sell the 12.5P for $0.05, giving you a breakeven of 17%. Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we\u2019re going up.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing. Options are pricing a 2% move, while historically Cisco moves around 5%. Given that prices remain the same or get cheaper by earnings, a strangle should net you some nice profits. If you\u2019re poor or want a binary directional play, I\u2019d look to buy puts. $CSCO is at ATHs so we\u2019re probably gonna do the classic \u201cdump after earnings regardless of the outcome\u201c thing that everyone seems to get tricked by. Regardless, at the time of writing, $CSCO strangles give us nice edge.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll that being said, there aren\u2019t many trades to run this time round! If I notice anything extra during this week, I\u2019ll look to keep you guys posted on my socials. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nAll in all, pretty awful week for trading. Most tickers are complete garbage, and there\u2019s little edge to be gained among those that aren\u2019t. No shame in sitting this one out! That being said, if you see any appealing plays I\u2019ve missed, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you\u2019d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**",

        "selftext": "(TSX:WELL)\n\nI\u2019m sure everyone has heard a lot about WELL Health - it was a pretty hot stock a couple months ago but I haven\u2019t been seeing much on them recently. I guess the novelty of the company started to wear off and people began to ask if WELL could continue to rise over the long term or if it was just a one-time thing due to the increased demand for virtual healthcare services amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The company has clearly done a great job recently with the expansions and acquisitions that they have been pursuing, including CRH and MyHealth, in order to diversify their exposure and I think WELL\u2019s beyond impressive Q2 results make it safe to say they aren\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nWELL achieved a record quarterly revenue of $61.8 million during the quarter, compared to revenue of $10.6 million generated during Q2-2020, an increase of 484% driven primarily by the CRH acquisition, which accounted for revenue of $36.7 million during the quarter. The company also produced positive EBITDA for the third consecutive quarter which is a great sign. With their own portfolio of over 25 clinics plus over 40 that were added from their acquisition of MyHealth, they are now the largest outpatient clinic operator in Canada. From a patient perspective, WELL\u2019s omni-channel patient visits grew by 19 per cent from quarter-to-quarter, registering 559,008 total visits in the quarter with in-person visits accounting for 43 per cent of the quota.\n\nLast month, WELL formed WELL Ventures, a wholly owned subsidiary that\u2019s purpose is to invest in companies that share WELL\u2019s vision on healthcare. Historically, WELL has been successful at identifying strong businesses to invest in and they hope to use WELL Ventures to continue finding profitable business opportunities.\n\nThe CEO of WELL has also mentioned a NASDAQ listing in October. Recently announced was their partnership with renowned law firm Fenwick &amp; West, which helped Facebook, Amazon, Cisco, and Coinbase with their IPOs. This is important because WELL\u2019s equivalents in the US are currently trading at much higher multiples making this a unique opportunity to get on the gains. Once WELL goes live on the NASDAQ, US funds will be hammering this stock.\n\nFor a deeper dive into their Q2 results, check out: [https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/well-health-achieves-record-revenue-and-adjusted-ebitda-in-q2-2021-with-484-yoy-revenue-growth-and-615-growth-in-its-adjusted-gross-profit-868134844.html](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/well-health-achieves-record-revenue-and-adjusted-ebitda-in-q2-2021-with-484-yoy-revenue-growth-and-615-growth-in-its-adjusted-gross-profit-868134844.html)\n\nThis is not financial advice, if you are interested in the company look into them!",

        "selftext": "**Disclaimer : This article was written to supplement my Options Trading Exit Strategies video. Those looking for more in depth explanations and examples should refer to the video, which can be found on my profile. Happy Trading!**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nWhat\u2019s poppin\u2019 bull-gang, Flux here with an options exit strategy \u201cguide\u201d. I wanted to make this writeup because more often than not, I see people making fundamentally sound trades, only to have their gains vanish due to having poor exit strategy. They either get too greedy and hold on for way too long, or they exit way too early and miss out on an insane runup and want to die for a couple of days afterwards. There\u2019s two parts to each trade - an entry and an exit - and if you\u2019re caught skimping on either end, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. Although this part of trading isn\u2019t glamourous, it\u2019s absolutely vital to your overall success as a trader, so it\u2019s crucial that you learn and study these concepts sooner rather than later. With all that being said, let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Types of Exits\n\nThere\u2019s three types of exits that I tend to use when I conduct my trades, each useful in their own right. I\u2019ll give a quick summary of them all, before providing an in depth analysis and examples of each.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Fundamental Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding the change of a company\u2019s fundamentals. These exits usually take place before the fundamental changes since you\u2019re not going to be able to react to the changes in real time and you\u2019ll end up getting front run by algos. Examples of this include taking an exit during an earnings runup or rundown, taking exits before company related news events, or taking an exit before any market-wide news events.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Technical Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. Once I see a pattern or indicator pass a certain threshold, I know it\u2019s likely time to exit my position. Some examples of technical exits may include exits taken around support and resistance levels, exits taken during gap fills, exits taken based off of technical patterns, and exits taken during the absence of any concrete patterns or indicators.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Psychologic Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding market psychology. This is the simplest of the three categories, and is often used in tandem with the other strategies to provide yourself with the best exit possible. Some strategies include exiting around whole numbers, screenshot theory, and individual gain theory. More on these later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nObviously there are going to be a handful of strategies and categories which I\u2019ve missed, but the ones I outlined above are likely going to be the ones which are most common to us retail traders.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Fundamental Exits\n\n**Fundamental exits revolve around one key idea - Sell the news.** More often than not, the results of a given news event are already baked into a stock's price well before the news event is confirmed or actually takes place. As a result, the price of a stock will almost always DROP even if this news is \u201cconfirmed\u201d, because it was already priced in. This can be observed anywhere from earnings runups to product launches to fundamental news events. You may be wondering why this drop even happens in the first place - if the news is baked into a stock's price, shouldn\u2019t it stay flat when the news is confirmed? Hint : Trading Algorithms.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlgorithms, or algos for short, are always behind the inevitable tanking of a stock's price post news event. It\u2019s quite easy to see why once you understand how these algorithms work. An algo can read through an entire earnings report / news transcript / whatever and fire off a corresponding trade in a fraction of a nanosecond, meaning that they\u2019re at a huge advantage since they **have the ability to sell the news after the news event hits.** This means that algos don\u2019t have to prematurely exit their position until they confirm that the underlying security was priced properly. If the underlying was priced to perfection, the algo takes its profits once the news confirms it (very common behavior among algos - take profits once there are no longer any catalysts in play), thereby causing the stock to tank. If the instrument wasn\u2019t priced properly, and there is a huge upside beat, the algo just stays in the trade and reaps the rewards, exiting at a later date instead. This concept is pretty difficult to wrap your head around initially, so let's go through an example.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**In our hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL has just reported earnings.** \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 1 : $AAPL is priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and confirms that $AAPL was indeed priced properly. The algo then takes its profits (as per common algo behavior), and dumps the position as a result of the priced in ER. Many other algos do the same as well, and the stock price \u201ctanks\u201d, resulting in a gap down the following day, and many left holding the bag, even on a seemingly good ER. Welcome to \u201cpriced in\u201d.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 2 : $AAPL is NOT priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and concludes that $AAPL was NOT priced properly. There was a huge upside beat. Instead of selling, the algo stays in the position because it knows that the underlying is undervalued based on the new news, and rides the wave up, exiting the position at a later date. $AAPL was not priced properly, and as a result, the news wasn\u2019t priced in.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn both cases, the algos win - they either escape with their profits, or ride the wave up for even more gains. **Us humans cannot act as quickly as an algo, and thus we\u2019ll always be at a disadvantage when it comes to fundamental exits. We always have to exit our positions prior to news catalysts to avoid getting front run.** News events are almost ALWAYS priced in. We can\u2019t sell the news AFTER the news drops because we cant digest and react to the news fast enough. We can\u2019t front run the algorithms, so we need to sell BEFORE any fundamental news catalysts, otherwise we run the risk of holding the bag. If there\u2019s one thing I want you all to take away from this article, it's that you should **always sell the news.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Earnings\n\nThis is a very simple concept once we understand the mechanisms outlined above. If you\u2019re in a trade, always look to close it out before earnings (unless you wanna get rug pulled, in which case go ahead, I'm not your daddy). If the news is priced in (which it probably is), you\u2019ll get front run by algos and they\u2019ll steal your profits. Do not gamble on the \u201cpriced-in\u201c news being wrong. You\u2019ll lose that bet 9/10 times. Please note that even if earnings is a beat, that \u201cbeat\u201d can still be priced in. Please, exit your trades before earnings, or you run the risk of getting blown out due to your own ignorance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Product Launches\n\nThis is similar to the concept we outlined above. In this hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL announces that they\u2019re going to reveal a new line of products in August. If that\u2019s the case, get ready to exit your position before the event. Every August $AAPL showcases their new iPhones for the year, therefore even though they haven\u2019t explicitly said they\u2019re going to reveal iPhones, the market is gonna price the event as if iPhones are going to be revealed. Once they reveal that their new products are in fact iPhones, the price will tank, because it was priced in, and algos followed the exact behavior outlined earlier. The only instance in which the price wouldn\u2019t tank would be if they announced that they\u2019re releasing a teleportation device or something. Believe it or not, the odds of that happening are astronomically low, so you\u2019re better off just selling before the reveal instead. Unless $AAPL comes out with something totally unexpected, the price will drop.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Fundamental News Events\n\nThis pertains to market moving news as a whole, like an FOMC speech or some macroeconomic event. If you know that JPow is gonna speak on Wednesday, it\u2019s probably best to exit your position before that since you\u2019ve honestly got no idea what\u2019s gonna happen as a byproduct of it. The entire market could take a shit or could fly green, nobody knows. Since we\u2019re traders, not gamblers, it\u2019s in our best interest to exit our positions or hedge in order to shield our gains. Fundamental news events are often crapshoots, and are the leading cause of solid gains getting unjustly erased in an instant.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Exits\n\nTechnical exits pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. In order to have the ability to do a technical exit, you must have a basic understanding of technical charts, patterns, and indicators. The entire field of technical analysis is easy to understand, but hard to master, so even if you don\u2019t have much experience in the area, I\u2019ll do my best to explain it all in a way which is friendly towards newer traders.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Exiting Around Support and Resistance\n\nThis is often one of the easiest exits to perform, as it\u2019s fairly straightforward to identify on a chart. **Whenever you start to approach an area which you\u2019ve deemed as a key level of support or resistance, consider exiting your trade.** If the price has bounced off of that particular level five times in the past, it\u2019ll likely hold true for the 6th time unless something has fundamentally changed about the company or the markets. As a result, you know that you should exit your trade as you approach the level, as it likely won\u2019t keep going in the same direction once we get to that point. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAn awesome example of this would be the [$CLF chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/9/9ymcqFZF.png) As we can tell, CLF trades in a nice ascending channel. In this case, we can use our trendlines to easily identify when to exit our trades in order to capture the maximum amount of our gains, saving us massive headaches. Once we get near any of the yellow trendlines, we should consider taking an exit since we\u2019re likely going to bounce off of it. Another great example of similar price movement can be found in [$AMD\u2019s chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/LzNxfKpr.png) It trades off of supports and resistances very consistently, allowing us to bag consistent gains. However, unlike CLF, AMD often has breakouts to the upside or downside, making it trickier to trade in the event of a breakout.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou may be wondering if there\u2019s any way you can capture the EXTRA gains in the event that the support or resistance levels don\u2019t hold. Although I don\u2019t recommend doing it too often, a well placed stop-loss can help protect your gains in the event that we reject off of a support or resistance, while simultaneously KEEPING you in the trade if we break through the support or resistance. Obviously, you\u2019ll need some experience trading to know exactly where to place your stop, and it\u2019s going to vary from ticker to ticker based on IV and the type of security or derivative you\u2019re trading. A well placed stop-loss can help magnify your returns while also preventing you from giving up any gains you\u2019ve already locked in. Be wary, too tight of a stop could take you out of a trade entirely before a run, but too loose of a stop could cause you to give up too much of your unrealized gains. It\u2019s a fine line to play, and that only comes with experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnother way you could play breakouts is by using a two stepped approach. First, you take your exit once you approach a given level of support or resistance to lock in your gains. You then set an alert within your broker slightly higher than that given level. If your alert gets tripped, you know that there\u2019s been a breakout, and you\u2019re clear to re-enter the trade to then capture any extra gains that may occur once it starts to run. If I run this strategy, I make sure to set my stop under the newly broken support or resistance in order to preserve my capital in the event of a false breakout. In the end, this method is much safer, but it requires you to sit at your computer twiddling your thumbs waiting for a breakout, so I personally don\u2019t prefer it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Gaps\n\nBefore we get into how to trade gaps, we need to understand what gaps are, and why they occur. [**Gaps are areas on a chart where the price of a stock moves sharply without any trades being placed.**](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/asVEHysx.png) Usually this happens as a result of a positive or negative catalyst affecting a stock outside of regular trading hours, resulting in a respective gap up or down the following day. A \u201cgap\u201d refers to a gap in the stock's price as a result of no trades being conducted within that range. Gaps are created because of low volume (technically no volume), and as a result, are prone to getting \u201cfilled\u201d very quickly. Once we are within the price range of a gap, it\u2019s very common that we will get sucked through the area with prices strongly trending towards the opposite side of the gap as a byproduct of the lack of volume.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen trading gaps, we need to recognize two important levels, and understand how price will act around them. **The very last trade that took place before the gap was created will be a very heavy level of resistance, and the very first trade that takes place after a gap will also be a very heavy level of resistance.** As a result, we will be very prone to rejecting off of these levels, so we want to fully exit our trade around these levels, no exceptions. Once we\u2019re past the initial resistance, we can look to re-enter the trade to capture the rest of our profits.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUnderstanding all of that, gap trades are relatively simple. First, we ride our trade up to our first level of resistance (the beginning of the gap, aka the price that the first trade was conducted at), and then take our exit to lock in our profits. Afterwards, we set an alert slightly above the resistance, so we get notified once we\u2019re past the resistance and are in the gap. Since we know there\u2019s no trading volume within the gap, there\u2019s a good chance we will get sucked through to the other side, meaning we should look to re-enter the trade as quickly as possible and then ride it to the opposite end of the gap (the end of the gap aka the price that the last trade was conducted at before the gap was created). Once we get to the opposite end of the gap, we fully exit the trade, because we know that 99% of the time we will reject off of this next heavy level of resistance. Gaps have a very rigid structure, and trade very similar to a breakout play. Enter a trade, exit at first resistance. Re-enter the trade after we break resistance, exit once we\u2019re at the second resistance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**If this concept was unclear or confusing, refer to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDKNRF_BZqQ) which has in-depth examples complete with visuals.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Clear Skies and Falling Knives\n\nA clear skies situation refers to when a stock is on a tear and has recently carved out new all time highs - think [$AMZN\u2019s recent run to $3750,](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/6/6E9FplY9.png) or [$CRSR\u2019s initial run to $50.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/e/EHxx1rVZ.png) A falling knife is the flipside of that, and refers to when a stock is essentially in freefall - like $NKLA when people found out Trevor Milton is a rat, or $WKHS when they lost the government contracts. In both situations, it can be extremely difficult to know when you should exit your trade since we don\u2019t have any technical levels to go off of, and as a result, we don\u2019t know when to anticipate a bounce. Even if we did have a general idea of where it was going to bounce, the market often over reacts, resulting in us blowing past our initial mark before starting our initial recovery.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The simplest way to play these situations is with a trailing stop.** Trailing stops were invented for situations like these, and they\u2019re honestly one of the most effective yet under-utilized tools. Set the stop, and it\u2019ll trail the stock as it moves. When a stock is carving out new highs, or plunging to new lows, a properly set trailing stop will let you get as close to maximum profits as possible while still allowing you to stay in the trade if we experience some turbulence along the way. If your trailing stop is set properly, you shouldn\u2019t get stopped out of the trade from natural market movements, and will only be forced out once we\u2019ve found a new high or low. I\u2019m not going to teach you how to properly set trailing stops as that\u2019s beyond the scope of this article, but it\u2019s something I may write about in the future given that enough people are interested.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Alternatively, if you want to abuse basic human psychology, you could also look to exit your position around whole numbers.** Humans are weird creatures, in the sense that we like \u201cwhole\u201d things - stock prices are no exception. You better believe there\u2019s going to be buyers or sellers setting up shop at nice, round numbers. Think $20, $50, $100, etc. If a stock is making a miracle run from $10, and is approaching $20, you better believe there\u2019s going to be a large number of people looking to take profits at the $20 mark, and as a result, you should look to exit the position around there. Again, this isn\u2019t a 100% concrete theory, and sometimes these levels won\u2019t hold at all, but it\u2019s still something to keep in mind. More on this later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Caveats\n\n**Please note, that these technical exits won\u2019t hold true given that a company's underlying fundamentals have changed. A stock's technical charts and indicators are only to be used as a summary of a company's fundamentals.** Technicals summarize the price action which is driven by the underlying fundamentals. If the fundamentals of a company change, the technical indicators and charts will also change, thereby making our old technical charts void. This is an extremely important concept that most traders and investors do not fully understand. Technicals summarize fundamentals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf $MSFT announces that they\u2019re coming out with a time machine, don\u2019t expect the stock's price to bounce off of the nearest overhead resistance, as that level is now void. $MSFT has fundamentally changed as a company, and as a result, the technicals will also need to change to reflect that. The same is true to the downside. If $MCD announces that they\u2019ve been grinding up humans and putting them into their hamburgers, don\u2019t expect the nearest level of support to hold - it\u2019s void. The stock will plunge into free fall until $MCD is properly priced given it\u2019s new fundamentals. Only then can we look to start re-establishing our technicals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Technicals are only to be used as a summary of a company\u2019s current fundamentals.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Psychological Exits\n\nPsychological exits consist of concepts and rules derived from how humans think and react to certain events. They are more conceptual in nature, and will vary from person to person. They aren\u2019t necessarily as concrete as the other types of exits due to their ambiguous nature. Everyone will apply these exits differently, and as a result I can\u2019t give you a consistent set of rules for each one. I can just explain the general concepts and provide different contexts regarding when to apply them. The rest is up to you!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Screenshot Theory\n\nThis is a very simple concept that I actually adopted from Wall Street Bets of all places - **If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.** If you\u2019re taking screenshots of your unrealized profits to flex on your friends, or random internet people, it\u2019s probably time to sell out of that position. The only reason you feel the need to flex your gains is because it\u2019s a life altering amount of money. I don\u2019t care what the fundamentals, or technicals say at that point. Cash out of the casino, and realize those gains. If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Individual Gain Theory\n\nThis concept refers to when you\u2019re trading with money that you cannot afford to lose, and you come in on somewhat of a win. Profit or loss, this money is going to fundamentally alter your life (for better or worse) because you were put in a position where you had to \u201ctrade\u201d money which you also needed elsewhere. If you\u2019re ever in a situation where you\u2019re forced to trade to make some extra dough, take those profits asap. A loss is often going to make your life a hell of a lot worse than a win will.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Whole Numbers\n\nHumans are weird creatures - we like \u201cwhole\u201d or \u201cround\u201d stuff, numbers being no exception. How often do you catch yourself submitting a buy order for 20$, or a sell order for $50. Unless you\u2019re cognizant of it, you\u2019re not going to think to yourself \u201cimma buy $CLF at 21.83\u201d. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re gonna round it up to $22, or down to $20, etc. The same goes for literally EVERYONE else. Just keep in mind that depending on the direction you\u2019re trading, there\u2019s often going to be buyers / sellers at whole numbers. $10, $20, $25, $30, etc. No number is safe. Look to time your exits before or after these numbers, as they may prove to be mini points of resistance. You\u2019ll often see sellers step in at whole numbers on the way up, and buyers step in at whole numbers on the way down. Use this to your advantage.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Emotional Exits\n\nThis concept applies to two key emotions - Euphoria and Hope. **The instant you start feeling euphoric about a trade and it\u2019s potential gains, step away from the trade.** You\u2019re not going to be thinking clearly enough to make an optimal trade or exit. There\u2019s a very high chance you\u2019re going to continue to chase the victory. If the victory starts slipping away from you, you're likely going to stay in the trade hoping that it goes back up to the previous high that you didn\u2019t sell at. In situations like this, by staying in the trade, you\u2019ll almost always hold your position well past the top, and will be prone to \u201cdiamond hands-ing\u201d your profits into the ground, ultimately coming up with a loss on a fundamentally sound trade. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou need to be conscious of the fact that you\u2019re euphoric, and that this trade went awesome, and exit the position intelligently. Once you start feeling euphoria, and consequently hope, there\u2019s no going back. You\u2019re not trading on fundamentals, and you\u2019re not trading on technicals either. You\u2019re simply not trading rationally. In situations like this, it\u2019s best to take a step back and exit the trade before you make a boneheaded move and end up giving your gains away. Emotions cloud judgement, and as traders, that\u2019s the last thing we want. Sell out of a position once you start feeling intense emotion.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Conclusion\n\nAll in all, options trading is a difficult game with many moving parts - If you're caught skimping on your exits, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. This aspect of trading is less glamorous and often overlooked, but is absolutely vital to your success as a trader.

Those looking for more in depth explanations and examples should refer to the video, which can be found on my profile. Happy Trading!**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nWhat\u2019s poppin\u2019 bull-gang, Flux here with an options exit strategy \u201cguide\u201d. I wanted to make this writeup because more often than not, I see people making fundamentally sound trades, only to have their gains vanish due to having poor exit strategy. They either get too greedy and hold on for way too long, or they exit way too early and miss out on an insane runup and want to die for a couple of days afterwards. There\u2019s two parts to each trade - an entry and an exit - and if you\u2019re caught skimping on either end, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. Although this part of trading isn\u2019t glamourous, it\u2019s absolutely vital to your overall success as a trader, so it\u2019s crucial that you learn and study these concepts sooner rather than later. With all that being said, let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Types of Exits\n\nThere\u2019s three types of exits that I tend to use when I conduct my trades, each useful in their own right. I\u2019ll give a quick summary of them all, before providing an in depth analysis and examples of each.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Fundamental Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding the change of a company\u2019s fundamentals. These exits usually take place before the fundamental changes since you\u2019re not going to be able to react to the changes in real time and you\u2019ll end up getting front run by algos. Examples of this include taking an exit during an earnings runup or rundown, taking exits before company related news events, or taking an exit before any market-wide news events.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Technical Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. Once I see a pattern or indicator pass a certain threshold, I know it\u2019s likely time to exit my position. Some examples of technical exits may include exits taken around support and resistance levels, exits taken during gap fills, exits taken based off of technical patterns, and exits taken during the absence of any concrete patterns or indicators.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Psychologic Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding market psychology. This is the simplest of the three categories, and is often used in tandem with the other strategies to provide yourself with the best exit possible. Some strategies include exiting around whole numbers, screenshot theory, and individual gain theory. More on these later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nObviously there are going to be a handful of strategies and categories which I\u2019ve missed, but the ones I outlined above are likely going to be the ones which are most common to us retail traders.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Fundamental Exits\n\n**Fundamental exits revolve around one key idea - Sell the news.** More often than not, the results of a given news event are already baked into a stock's price well before the news event is confirmed or actually takes place. As a result, the price of a stock will almost always DROP even if this news is \u201cconfirmed\u201d, because it was already priced in. This can be observed anywhere from earnings runups to product launches to fundamental news events. You may be wondering why this drop even happens in the first place - if the news is baked into a stock's price, shouldn\u2019t it stay flat when the news is confirmed? Hint : Trading Algorithms.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlgorithms, or algos for short, are always behind the inevitable tanking of a stock's price post news event. It\u2019s quite easy to see why once you understand how these algorithms work. An algo can read through an entire earnings report / news transcript / whatever and fire off a corresponding trade in a fraction of a nanosecond, meaning that they\u2019re at a huge advantage since they **have the ability to sell the news after the news event hits.** This means that algos don\u2019t have to prematurely exit their position until they confirm that the underlying security was priced properly. If the underlying was priced to perfection, the algo takes its profits once the news confirms it (very common behavior among algos - take profits once there are no longer any catalysts in play), thereby causing the stock to tank. If the instrument wasn\u2019t priced properly, and there is a huge upside beat, the algo just stays in the trade and reaps the rewards, exiting at a later date instead. This concept is pretty difficult to wrap your head around initially, so let's go through an example.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**In our hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL has just reported earnings.** \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 1 : $AAPL is priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and confirms that $AAPL was indeed priced properly. The algo then takes its profits (as per common algo behavior), and dumps the position as a result of the priced in ER. Many other algos do the same as well, and the stock price \u201ctanks\u201d, resulting in a gap down the following day, and many left holding the bag, even on a seemingly good ER. Welcome to \u201cpriced in\u201d.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 2 : $AAPL is NOT priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and concludes that $AAPL was NOT priced properly. There was a huge upside beat. Instead of selling, the algo stays in the position because it knows that the underlying is undervalued based on the new news, and rides the wave up, exiting the position at a later date. $AAPL was not priced properly, and as a result, the news wasn\u2019t priced in.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn both cases, the algos win - they either escape with their profits, or ride the wave up for even more gains. **Us humans cannot act as quickly as an algo, and thus we\u2019ll always be at a disadvantage when it comes to fundamental exits. We always have to exit our positions prior to news catalysts to avoid getting front run.** News events are almost ALWAYS priced in. We can\u2019t sell the news AFTER the news drops because we cant digest and react to the news fast enough. We can\u2019t front run the algorithms, so we need to sell BEFORE any fundamental news catalysts, otherwise we run the risk of holding the bag. If there\u2019s one thing I want you all to take away from this article, it's that you should **always sell the news.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Earnings\n\nThis is a very simple concept once we understand the mechanisms outlined above. If you\u2019re in a trade, always look to close it out before earnings (unless you wanna get rug pulled, in which case go ahead, I'm not your daddy). If the news is priced in (which it probably is), you\u2019ll get front run by algos and they\u2019ll steal your profits. Do not gamble on the \u201cpriced-in\u201c news being wrong. You\u2019ll lose that bet 9/10 times. Please note that even if earnings is a beat, that \u201cbeat\u201d can still be priced in. Please, exit your trades before earnings, or you run the risk of getting blown out due to your own ignorance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Product Launches\n\nThis is similar to the concept we outlined above. In this hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL announces that they\u2019re going to reveal a new line of products in August. If that\u2019s the case, get ready to exit your position before the event. Every August $AAPL showcases their new iPhones for the year, therefore even though they haven\u2019t explicitly said they\u2019re going to reveal iPhones, the market is gonna price the event as if iPhones are going to be revealed. Once they reveal that their new products are in fact iPhones, the price will tank, because it was priced in, and algos followed the exact behavior outlined earlier. The only instance in which the price wouldn\u2019t tank would be if they announced that they\u2019re releasing a teleportation device or something. Believe it or not, the odds of that happening are astronomically low, so you\u2019re better off just selling before the reveal instead. Unless $AAPL comes out with something totally unexpected, the price will drop.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Fundamental News Events\n\nThis pertains to market moving news as a whole, like an FOMC speech or some macroeconomic event. If you know that JPow is gonna speak on Wednesday, it\u2019s probably best to exit your position before that since you\u2019ve honestly got no idea what\u2019s gonna happen as a byproduct of it. The entire market could take a shit or could fly green, nobody knows. Since we\u2019re traders, not gamblers, it\u2019s in our best interest to exit our positions or hedge in order to shield our gains. Fundamental news events are often crapshoots, and are the leading cause of solid gains getting unjustly erased in an instant.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Exits\n\nTechnical exits pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. In order to have the ability to do a technical exit, you must have a basic understanding of technical charts, patterns, and indicators. The entire field of technical analysis is easy to understand, but hard to master, so even if you don\u2019t have much experience in the area, I\u2019ll do my best to explain it all in a way which is friendly towards newer traders.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Exiting Around Support and Resistance\n\nThis is often one of the easiest exits to perform, as it\u2019s fairly straightforward to identify on a chart. **Whenever you start to approach an area which you\u2019ve deemed as a key level of support or resistance, consider exiting your trade.** If the price has bounced off of that particular level five times in the past, it\u2019ll likely hold true for the 6th time unless something has fundamentally changed about the company or the markets. As a result, you know that you should exit your trade as you approach the level, as it likely won\u2019t keep going in the same direction once we get to that point. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAn awesome example of this would be the [$CLF chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/9/9ymcqFZF.png) As we can tell, CLF trades in a nice ascending channel. In this case, we can use our trendlines to easily identify when to exit our trades in order to capture the maximum amount of our gains, saving us massive headaches. Once we get near any of the yellow trendlines, we should consider taking an exit since we\u2019re likely going to bounce off of it. Another great example of similar price movement can be found in [$AMD\u2019s chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/LzNxfKpr.png) It trades off of supports and resistances very consistently, allowing us to bag consistent gains. However, unlike CLF, AMD often has breakouts to the upside or downside, making it trickier to trade in the event of a breakout.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou may be wondering if there\u2019s any way you can capture the EXTRA gains in the event that the support or resistance levels don\u2019t hold. Although I don\u2019t recommend doing it too often, a well placed stop-loss can help protect your gains in the event that we reject off of a support or resistance, while simultaneously KEEPING you in the trade if we break through the support or resistance. Obviously, you\u2019ll need some experience trading to know exactly where to place your stop, and it\u2019s going to vary from ticker to ticker based on IV and the type of security or derivative you\u2019re trading. A well placed stop-loss can help magnify your returns while also preventing you from giving up any gains you\u2019ve already locked in. Be wary, too tight of a stop could take you out of a trade entirely before a run, but too loose of a stop could cause you to give up too much of your unrealized gains. It\u2019s a fine line to play, and that only comes with experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnother way you could play breakouts is by using a two stepped approach. First, you take your exit once you approach a given level of support or resistance to lock in your gains. You then set an alert within your broker slightly higher than that given level. If your alert gets tripped, you know that there\u2019s been a breakout, and you\u2019re clear to re-enter the trade to then capture any extra gains that may occur once it starts to run. If I run this strategy, I make sure to set my stop under the newly broken support or resistance in order to preserve my capital in the event of a false breakout. In the end, this method is much safer, but it requires you to sit at your computer twiddling your thumbs waiting for a breakout, so I personally don\u2019t prefer it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Gaps\n\nBefore we get into how to trade gaps, we need to understand what gaps are, and why they occur. [**Gaps are areas on a chart where the price of a stock moves sharply without any trades being placed.**](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/asVEHysx.png) Usually this happens as a result of a positive or negative catalyst affecting a stock outside of regular trading hours, resulting in a respective gap up or down the following day. A \u201cgap\u201d refers to a gap in the stock's price as a result of no trades being conducted within that range. Gaps are created because of low volume (technically no volume), and as a result, are prone to getting \u201cfilled\u201d very quickly. Once we are within the price range of a gap, it\u2019s very common that we will get sucked through the area with prices strongly trending towards the opposite side of the gap as a byproduct of the lack of volume.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen trading gaps, we need to recognize two important levels, and understand how price will act around them. **The very last trade that took place before the gap was created will be a very heavy level of resistance, and the very first trade that takes place after a gap will also be a very heavy level of resistance.** As a result, we will be very prone to rejecting off of these levels, so we want to fully exit our trade around these levels, no exceptions. Once we\u2019re past the initial resistance, we can look to re-enter the trade to capture the rest of our profits.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUnderstanding all of that, gap trades are relatively simple. First, we ride our trade up to our first level of resistance (the beginning of the gap, aka the price that the first trade was conducted at), and then take our exit to lock in our profits. Afterwards, we set an alert slightly above the resistance, so we get notified once we\u2019re past the resistance and are in the gap. Since we know there\u2019s no trading volume within the gap, there\u2019s a good chance we will get sucked through to the other side, meaning we should look to re-enter the trade as quickly as possible and then ride it to the opposite end of the gap (the end of the gap aka the price that the last trade was conducted at before the gap was created). Once we get to the opposite end of the gap, we fully exit the trade, because we know that 99% of the time we will reject off of this next heavy level of resistance. Gaps have a very rigid structure, and trade very similar to a breakout play. Enter a trade, exit at first resistance. Re-enter the trade after we break resistance, exit once we\u2019re at the second resistance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**If this concept was unclear or confusing, refer to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDKNRF_BZqQ) which has in-depth examples complete with visuals.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Clear Skies and Falling Knives\n\nA clear skies situation refers to when a stock is on a tear and has recently carved out new all time highs - think [$AMZN\u2019s recent run to $3750,](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/6/6E9FplY9.png) or [$CRSR\u2019s initial run to $50.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/e/EHxx1rVZ.png) A falling knife is the flipside of that, and refers to when a stock is essentially in freefall - like $NKLA when people found out Trevor Milton is a rat, or $WKHS when they lost the government contracts. In both situations, it can be extremely difficult to know when you should exit your trade since we don\u2019t have any technical levels to go off of, and as a result, we don\u2019t know when to anticipate a bounce. Even if we did have a general idea of where it was going to bounce, the market often over reacts, resulting in us blowing past our initial mark before starting our initial recovery.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The simplest way to play these situations is with a trailing stop.** Trailing stops were invented for situations like these, and they\u2019re honestly one of the most effective yet under-utilized tools. Set the stop, and it\u2019ll trail the stock as it moves. When a stock is carving out new highs, or plunging to new lows, a properly set trailing stop will let you get as close to maximum profits as possible while still allowing you to stay in the trade if we experience some turbulence along the way. If your trailing stop is set properly, you shouldn\u2019t get stopped out of the trade from natural market movements, and will only be forced out once we\u2019ve found a new high or low. I\u2019m not going to teach you how to properly set trailing stops as that\u2019s beyond the scope of this article, but it\u2019s something I may write about in the future given that enough people are interested.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Alternatively, if you want to abuse basic human psychology, you could also look to exit your position around whole numbers.** Humans are weird creatures, in the sense that we like \u201cwhole\u201d things - stock prices are no exception. You better believe there\u2019s going to be buyers or sellers setting up shop at nice, round numbers. Think $20, $50, $100, etc. If a stock is making a miracle run from $10, and is approaching $20, you better believe there\u2019s going to be a large number of people looking to take profits at the $20 mark, and as a result, you should look to exit the position around there. Again, this isn\u2019t a 100% concrete theory, and sometimes these levels won\u2019t hold at all, but it\u2019s still something to keep in mind. More on this later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Caveats\n\n**Please note, that these technical exits won\u2019t hold true given that a company's underlying fundamentals have changed. A stock's technical charts and indicators are only to be used as a summary of a company's fundamentals.** Technicals summarize the price action which is driven by the underlying fundamentals. If the fundamentals of a company change, the technical indicators and charts will also change, thereby making our old technical charts void. This is an extremely important concept that most traders and investors do not fully understand. Technicals summarize fundamentals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf $MSFT announces that they\u2019re coming out with a time machine, don\u2019t expect the stock's price to bounce off of the nearest overhead resistance, as that level is now void. $MSFT has fundamentally changed as a company, and as a result, the technicals will also need to change to reflect that. The same is true to the downside. If $MCD announces that they\u2019ve been grinding up humans and putting them into their hamburgers, don\u2019t expect the nearest level of support to hold - it\u2019s void. The stock will plunge into free fall until $MCD is properly priced given it\u2019s new fundamentals. Only then can we look to start re-establishing our technicals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Technicals are only to be used as a summary of a company\u2019s current fundamentals.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Psychological Exits\n\nPsychological exits consist of concepts and rules derived from how humans think and react to certain events. They are more conceptual in nature, and will vary from person to person. They aren\u2019t necessarily as concrete as the other types of exits due to their ambiguous nature. Everyone will apply these exits differently, and as a result I can\u2019t give you a consistent set of rules for each one. I can just explain the general concepts and provide different contexts regarding when to apply them. The rest is up to you!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Screenshot Theory\n\nThis is a very simple concept that I actually adopted from Wall Street Bets of all places - **If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.** If you\u2019re taking screenshots of your unrealized profits to flex on your friends, or random internet people, it\u2019s probably time to sell out of that position. The only reason you feel the need to flex your gains is because it\u2019s a life altering amount of money. I don\u2019t care what the fundamentals, or technicals say at that point. Cash out of the casino, and realize those gains. If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Individual Gain Theory\n\nThis concept refers to when you\u2019re trading with money that you cannot afford to lose, and you come in on somewhat of a win. Profit or loss, this money is going to fundamentally alter your life (for better or worse) because you were put in a position where you had to \u201ctrade\u201d money which you also needed elsewhere. If you\u2019re ever in a situation where you\u2019re forced to trade to make some extra dough, take those profits asap. A loss is often going to make your life a hell of a lot worse than a win will.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Whole Numbers\n\nHumans are weird creatures - we like \u201cwhole\u201d or \u201cround\u201d stuff, numbers being no exception. How often do you catch yourself submitting a buy order for 20$, or a sell order for $50. Unless you\u2019re cognizant of it, you\u2019re not going to think to yourself \u201cimma buy $CLF at 21.83\u201d. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re gonna round it up to $22, or down to $20, etc. The same goes for literally EVERYONE else. Just keep in mind that depending on the direction you\u2019re trading, there\u2019s often going to be buyers / sellers at whole numbers. $10, $20, $25, $30, etc. No number is safe. Look to time your exits before or after these numbers, as they may prove to be mini points of resistance. You\u2019ll often see sellers step in at whole numbers on the way up, and buyers step in at whole numbers on the way down. Use this to your advantage.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Emotional Exits\n\nThis concept applies to two key emotions - Euphoria and Hope. **The instant you start feeling euphoric about a trade and it\u2019s potential gains, step away from the trade.** You\u2019re not going to be thinking clearly enough to make an optimal trade or exit. There\u2019s a very high chance you\u2019re going to continue to chase the victory. If the victory starts slipping away from you, you're likely going to stay in the trade hoping that it goes back up to the previous high that you didn\u2019t sell at. In situations like this, by staying in the trade, you\u2019ll almost always hold your position well past the top, and will be prone to \u201cdiamond hands-ing\u201d your profits into the ground, ultimately coming up with a loss on a fundamentally sound trade. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou need to be conscious of the fact that you\u2019re euphoric, and that this trade went awesome, and exit the position intelligently. Once you start feeling euphoria, and consequently hope, there\u2019s no going back. You\u2019re not trading on fundamentals, and you\u2019re not trading on technicals either. You\u2019re simply not trading rationally. In situations like this, it\u2019s best to take a step back and exit the trade before you make a boneheaded move and end up giving your gains away. Emotions cloud judgement, and as traders, that\u2019s the last thing we want. Sell out of a position once you start feeling intense emotion.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Conclusion\n\nAll in all, options trading is a difficult game with many moving parts - If you're caught skimping on your exits, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. This aspect of trading is less glamorous and often overlooked, but is absolutely vital to your success as a trader.

Those looking for more in depth explanations and examples should refer to the video, which can be found on my profile. Happy Trading!**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nWhat\u2019s poppin\u2019 bull-gang, Flux here with an options exit strategy \u201cguide\u201d. I wanted to make this writeup because more often than not, I see people making fundamentally sound trades, only to have their gains vanish due to having poor exit strategy. They either get too greedy and hold on for way too long, or they exit way too early and miss out on an insane runup and want to die for a couple of days afterwards. There\u2019s two parts to each trade - an entry and an exit - and if you\u2019re caught skimping on either end, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. Although this part of trading isn\u2019t glamourous, it\u2019s absolutely vital to your overall success as a trader, so it\u2019s crucial that you learn and study these concepts sooner rather than later. With all that being said, let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Types of Exits\n\nThere\u2019s three types of exits that I tend to use when I conduct my trades, each useful in their own right. I\u2019ll give a quick summary of them all, before providing an in depth analysis and examples of each.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Fundamental Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding the change of a company\u2019s fundamentals. These exits usually take place before the fundamental changes since you\u2019re not going to be able to react to the changes in real time and you\u2019ll end up getting front run by algos. Examples of this include taking an exit during an earnings runup or rundown, taking exits before company related news events, or taking an exit before any market-wide news events.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Technical Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. Once I see a pattern or indicator pass a certain threshold, I know it\u2019s likely time to exit my position. Some examples of technical exits may include exits taken around support and resistance levels, exits taken during gap fills, exits taken based off of technical patterns, and exits taken during the absence of any concrete patterns or indicators.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Psychologic Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding market psychology. This is the simplest of the three categories, and is often used in tandem with the other strategies to provide yourself with the best exit possible. Some strategies include exiting around whole numbers, screenshot theory, and individual gain theory. More on these later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nObviously there are going to be a handful of strategies and categories which I\u2019ve missed, but the ones I outlined above are likely going to be the ones which are most common to us retail traders.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Fundamental Exits\n\n**Fundamental exits revolve around one key idea - Sell the news.** More often than not, the results of a given news event are already baked into a stock's price well before the news event is confirmed or actually takes place. As a result, the price of a stock will almost always DROP even if this news is \u201cconfirmed\u201d, because it was already priced in. This can be observed anywhere from earnings runups to product launches to fundamental news events. You may be wondering why this drop even happens in the first place - if the news is baked into a stock's price, shouldn\u2019t it stay flat when the news is confirmed? Hint : Trading Algorithms.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlgorithms, or algos for short, are always behind the inevitable tanking of a stock's price post news event. It\u2019s quite easy to see why once you understand how these algorithms work. An algo can read through an entire earnings report / news transcript / whatever and fire off a corresponding trade in a fraction of a nanosecond, meaning that they\u2019re at a huge advantage since they **have the ability to sell the news after the news event hits.** This means that algos don\u2019t have to prematurely exit their position until they confirm that the underlying security was priced properly. If the underlying was priced to perfection, the algo takes its profits once the news confirms it (very common behavior among algos - take profits once there are no longer any catalysts in play), thereby causing the stock to tank. If the instrument wasn\u2019t priced properly, and there is a huge upside beat, the algo just stays in the trade and reaps the rewards, exiting at a later date instead. This concept is pretty difficult to wrap your head around initially, so let's go through an example.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**In our hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL has just reported earnings.** \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 1 : $AAPL is priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and confirms that $AAPL was indeed priced properly. The algo then takes its profits (as per common algo behavior), and dumps the position as a result of the priced in ER. Many other algos do the same as well, and the stock price \u201ctanks\u201d, resulting in a gap down the following day, and many left holding the bag, even on a seemingly good ER. Welcome to \u201cpriced in\u201d.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 2 : $AAPL is NOT priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and concludes that $AAPL was NOT priced properly. There was a huge upside beat. Instead of selling, the algo stays in the position because it knows that the underlying is undervalued based on the new news, and rides the wave up, exiting the position at a later date. $AAPL was not priced properly, and as a result, the news wasn\u2019t priced in.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn both cases, the algos win - they either escape with their profits, or ride the wave up for even more gains. **Us humans cannot act as quickly as an algo, and thus we\u2019ll always be at a disadvantage when it comes to fundamental exits. We always have to exit our positions prior to news catalysts to avoid getting front run.** News events are almost ALWAYS priced in. We can\u2019t sell the news AFTER the news drops because we cant digest and react to the news fast enough. We can\u2019t front run the algorithms, so we need to sell BEFORE any fundamental news catalysts, otherwise we run the risk of holding the bag. If there\u2019s one thing I want you all to take away from this article, it's that you should **always sell the news.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Earnings\n\nThis is a very simple concept once we understand the mechanisms outlined above. If you\u2019re in a trade, always look to close it out before earnings (unless you wanna get rug pulled, in which case go ahead, I'm not your daddy). If the news is priced in (which it probably is), you\u2019ll get front run by algos and they\u2019ll steal your profits. Do not gamble on the \u201cpriced-in\u201c news being wrong. You\u2019ll lose that bet 9/10 times. Please note that even if earnings is a beat, that \u201cbeat\u201d can still be priced in. Please, exit your trades before earnings, or you run the risk of getting blown out due to your own ignorance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Product Launches\n\nThis is similar to the concept we outlined above. In this hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL announces that they\u2019re going to reveal a new line of products in August. If that\u2019s the case, get ready to exit your position before the event. Every August $AAPL showcases their new iPhones for the year, therefore even though they haven\u2019t explicitly said they\u2019re going to reveal iPhones, the market is gonna price the event as if iPhones are going to be revealed. Once they reveal that their new products are in fact iPhones, the price will tank, because it was priced in, and algos followed the exact behavior outlined earlier. The only instance in which the price wouldn\u2019t tank would be if they announced that they\u2019re releasing a teleportation device or something. Believe it or not, the odds of that happening are astronomically low, so you\u2019re better off just selling before the reveal instead. Unless $AAPL comes out with something totally unexpected, the price will drop.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Fundamental News Events\n\nThis pertains to market moving news as a whole, like an FOMC speech or some macroeconomic event. If you know that JPow is gonna speak on Wednesday, it\u2019s probably best to exit your position before that since you\u2019ve honestly got no idea what\u2019s gonna happen as a byproduct of it. The entire market could take a shit or could fly green, nobody knows. Since we\u2019re traders, not gamblers, it\u2019s in our best interest to exit our positions or hedge in order to shield our gains. Fundamental news events are often crapshoots, and are the leading cause of solid gains getting unjustly erased in an instant.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Exits\n\nTechnical exits pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. In order to have the ability to do a technical exit, you must have a basic understanding of technical charts, patterns, and indicators. The entire field of technical analysis is easy to understand, but hard to master, so even if you don\u2019t have much experience in the area, I\u2019ll do my best to explain it all in a way which is friendly towards newer traders.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Exiting Around Support and Resistance\n\nThis is often one of the easiest exits to perform, as it\u2019s fairly straightforward to identify on a chart. **Whenever you start to approach an area which you\u2019ve deemed as a key level of support or resistance, consider exiting your trade.** If the price has bounced off of that particular level five times in the past, it\u2019ll likely hold true for the 6th time unless something has fundamentally changed about the company or the markets. As a result, you know that you should exit your trade as you approach the level, as it likely won\u2019t keep going in the same direction once we get to that point. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAn awesome example of this would be the [$CLF chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/9/9ymcqFZF.png) As we can tell, CLF trades in a nice ascending channel. In this case, we can use our trendlines to easily identify when to exit our trades in order to capture the maximum amount of our gains, saving us massive headaches. Once we get near any of the yellow trendlines, we should consider taking an exit since we\u2019re likely going to bounce off of it. Another great example of similar price movement can be found in [$AMD\u2019s chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/LzNxfKpr.png) It trades off of supports and resistances very consistently, allowing us to bag consistent gains. However, unlike CLF, AMD often has breakouts to the upside or downside, making it trickier to trade in the event of a breakout.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou may be wondering if there\u2019s any way you can capture the EXTRA gains in the event that the support or resistance levels don\u2019t hold. Although I don\u2019t recommend doing it too often, a well placed stop-loss can help protect your gains in the event that we reject off of a support or resistance, while simultaneously KEEPING you in the trade if we break through the support or resistance. Obviously, you\u2019ll need some experience trading to know exactly where to place your stop, and it\u2019s going to vary from ticker to ticker based on IV and the type of security or derivative you\u2019re trading. A well placed stop-loss can help magnify your returns while also preventing you from giving up any gains you\u2019ve already locked in. Be wary, too tight of a stop could take you out of a trade entirely before a run, but too loose of a stop could cause you to give up too much of your unrealized gains. It\u2019s a fine line to play, and that only comes with experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnother way you could play breakouts is by using a two stepped approach. First, you take your exit once you approach a given level of support or resistance to lock in your gains. You then set an alert within your broker slightly higher than that given level. If your alert gets tripped, you know that there\u2019s been a breakout, and you\u2019re clear to re-enter the trade to then capture any extra gains that may occur once it starts to run. If I run this strategy, I make sure to set my stop under the newly broken support or resistance in order to preserve my capital in the event of a false breakout. In the end, this method is much safer, but it requires you to sit at your computer twiddling your thumbs waiting for a breakout, so I personally don\u2019t prefer it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Gaps\n\nBefore we get into how to trade gaps, we need to understand what gaps are, and why they occur. [**Gaps are areas on a chart where the price of a stock moves sharply without any trades being placed.**](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/asVEHysx.png) Usually this happens as a result of a positive or negative catalyst affecting a stock outside of regular trading hours, resulting in a respective gap up or down the following day. A \u201cgap\u201d refers to a gap in the stock's price as a result of no trades being conducted within that range. Gaps are created because of low volume (technically no volume), and as a result, are prone to getting \u201cfilled\u201d very quickly. Once we are within the price range of a gap, it\u2019s very common that we will get sucked through the area with prices strongly trending towards the opposite side of the gap as a byproduct of the lack of volume.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen trading gaps, we need to recognize two important levels, and understand how price will act around them. **The very last trade that took place before the gap was created will be a very heavy level of resistance, and the very first trade that takes place after a gap will also be a very heavy level of resistance.** As a result, we will be very prone to rejecting off of these levels, so we want to fully exit our trade around these levels, no exceptions. Once we\u2019re past the initial resistance, we can look to re-enter the trade to capture the rest of our profits.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUnderstanding all of that, gap trades are relatively simple. First, we ride our trade up to our first level of resistance (the beginning of the gap, aka the price that the first trade was conducted at), and then take our exit to lock in our profits. Afterwards, we set an alert slightly above the resistance, so we get notified once we\u2019re past the resistance and are in the gap. Since we know there\u2019s no trading volume within the gap, there\u2019s a good chance we will get sucked through to the other side, meaning we should look to re-enter the trade as quickly as possible and then ride it to the opposite end of the gap (the end of the gap aka the price that the last trade was conducted at before the gap was created). Once we get to the opposite end of the gap, we fully exit the trade, because we know that 99% of the time we will reject off of this next heavy level of resistance. Gaps have a very rigid structure, and trade very similar to a breakout play. Enter a trade, exit at first resistance. Re-enter the trade after we break resistance, exit once we\u2019re at the second resistance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**If this concept was unclear or confusing, refer to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDKNRF_BZqQ) which has in-depth examples complete with visuals.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Clear Skies and Falling Knives\n\nA clear skies situation refers to when a stock is on a tear and has recently carved out new all time highs - think [$AMZN\u2019s recent run to $3750,](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/6/6E9FplY9.png) or [$CRSR\u2019s initial run to $50.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/e/EHxx1rVZ.png) A falling knife is the flipside of that, and refers to when a stock is essentially in freefall - like $NKLA when people found out Trevor Milton is a rat, or $WKHS when they lost the government contracts. In both situations, it can be extremely difficult to know when you should exit your trade since we don\u2019t have any technical levels to go off of, and as a result, we don\u2019t know when to anticipate a bounce. Even if we did have a general idea of where it was going to bounce, the market often over reacts, resulting in us blowing past our initial mark before starting our initial recovery.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The simplest way to play these situations is with a trailing stop.** Trailing stops were invented for situations like these, and they\u2019re honestly one of the most effective yet under-utilized tools. Set the stop, and it\u2019ll trail the stock as it moves. When a stock is carving out new highs, or plunging to new lows, a properly set trailing stop will let you get as close to maximum profits as possible while still allowing you to stay in the trade if we experience some turbulence along the way. If your trailing stop is set properly, you shouldn\u2019t get stopped out of the trade from natural market movements, and will only be forced out once we\u2019ve found a new high or low. I\u2019m not going to teach you how to properly set trailing stops as that\u2019s beyond the scope of this article, but it\u2019s something I may write about in the future given that enough people are interested.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Alternatively, if you want to abuse basic human psychology, you could also look to exit your position around whole numbers.** Humans are weird creatures, in the sense that we like \u201cwhole\u201d things - stock prices are no exception. You better believe there\u2019s going to be buyers or sellers setting up shop at nice, round numbers. Think $20, $50, $100, etc. If a stock is making a miracle run from $10, and is approaching $20, you better believe there\u2019s going to be a large number of people looking to take profits at the $20 mark, and as a result, you should look to exit the position around there. Again, this isn\u2019t a 100% concrete theory, and sometimes these levels won\u2019t hold at all, but it\u2019s still something to keep in mind. More on this later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Caveats\n\n**Please note, that these technical exits won\u2019t hold true given that a company's underlying fundamentals have changed. A stock's technical charts and indicators are only to be used as a summary of a company's fundamentals.** Technicals summarize the price action which is driven by the underlying fundamentals. If the fundamentals of a company change, the technical indicators and charts will also change, thereby making our old technical charts void. This is an extremely important concept that most traders and investors do not fully understand. Technicals summarize fundamentals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf $MSFT announces that they\u2019re coming out with a time machine, don\u2019t expect the stock's price to bounce off of the nearest overhead resistance, as that level is now void. $MSFT has fundamentally changed as a company, and as a result, the technicals will also need to change to reflect that. The same is true to the downside. If $MCD announces that they\u2019ve been grinding up humans and putting them into their hamburgers, don\u2019t expect the nearest level of support to hold - it\u2019s void. The stock will plunge into free fall until $MCD is properly priced given it\u2019s new fundamentals. Only then can we look to start re-establishing our technicals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Technicals are only to be used as a summary of a company\u2019s current fundamentals.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Psychological Exits\n\nPsychological exits consist of concepts and rules derived from how humans think and react to certain events. They are more conceptual in nature, and will vary from person to person. They aren\u2019t necessarily as concrete as the other types of exits due to their ambiguous nature. Everyone will apply these exits differently, and as a result I can\u2019t give you a consistent set of rules for each one. I can just explain the general concepts and provide different contexts regarding when to apply them. The rest is up to you!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Screenshot Theory\n\nThis is a very simple concept that I actually adopted from Wall Street Bets of all places - **If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.** If you\u2019re taking screenshots of your unrealized profits to flex on your friends, or random internet people, it\u2019s probably time to sell out of that position. The only reason you feel the need to flex your gains is because it\u2019s a life altering amount of money. I don\u2019t care what the fundamentals, or technicals say at that point. Cash out of the casino, and realize those gains. If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Individual Gain Theory\n\nThis concept refers to when you\u2019re trading with money that you cannot afford to lose, and you come in on somewhat of a win. Profit or loss, this money is going to fundamentally alter your life (for better or worse) because you were put in a position where you had to \u201ctrade\u201d money which you also needed elsewhere. If you\u2019re ever in a situation where you\u2019re forced to trade to make some extra dough, take those profits asap. A loss is often going to make your life a hell of a lot worse than a win will.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Whole Numbers\n\nHumans are weird creatures - we like \u201cwhole\u201d or \u201cround\u201d stuff, numbers being no exception. How often do you catch yourself submitting a buy order for 20$, or a sell order for $50. Unless you\u2019re cognizant of it, you\u2019re not going to think to yourself \u201cimma buy $CLF at 21.83\u201d. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re gonna round it up to $22, or down to $20, etc. The same goes for literally EVERYONE else. Just keep in mind that depending on the direction you\u2019re trading, there\u2019s often going to be buyers / sellers at whole numbers. $10, $20, $25, $30, etc. No number is safe. Look to time your exits before or after these numbers, as they may prove to be mini points of resistance. You\u2019ll often see sellers step in at whole numbers on the way up, and buyers step in at whole numbers on the way down. Use this to your advantage.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Emotional Exits\n\nThis concept applies to two key emotions - Euphoria and Hope. **The instant you start feeling euphoric about a trade and it\u2019s potential gains, step away from the trade.** You\u2019re not going to be thinking clearly enough to make an optimal trade or exit. There\u2019s a very high chance you\u2019re going to continue to chase the victory. If the victory starts slipping away from you, you're likely going to stay in the trade hoping that it goes back up to the previous high that you didn\u2019t sell at. In situations like this, by staying in the trade, you\u2019ll almost always hold your position well past the top, and will be prone to \u201cdiamond hands-ing\u201d your profits into the ground, ultimately coming up with a loss on a fundamentally sound trade. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou need to be conscious of the fact that you\u2019re euphoric, and that this trade went awesome, and exit the position intelligently. Once you start feeling euphoria, and consequently hope, there\u2019s no going back. You\u2019re not trading on fundamentals, and you\u2019re not trading on technicals either. You\u2019re simply not trading rationally. In situations like this, it\u2019s best to take a step back and exit the trade before you make a boneheaded move and end up giving your gains away. Emotions cloud judgement, and as traders, that\u2019s the last thing we want. Sell out of a position once you start feeling intense emotion.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Conclusion\n\nAll in all, options trading is a difficult game with many moving parts - If you're caught skimping on your exits, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. This aspect of trading is less glamorous and often overlooked, but is absolutely vital to your success as a trader.

I wanted to make this writeup because more often than not, I see people making fundamentally sound trades, only to have their gains vanish due to having poor exit strategy. They either get too greedy and hold on for way too long, or they exit way too early and miss out on an insane runup and want to die for a couple of days afterwards.

With all that being said, let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Types of Exits\n\nThere\u2019s three types of exits that I tend to use when I conduct my trades, each useful in their own right. I\u2019ll give a quick summary of them all, before providing an in depth analysis and examples of each.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Fundamental Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding the change of a company\u2019s fundamentals. These exits usually take place before the fundamental changes since you\u2019re not going to be able to react to the changes in real time and you\u2019ll end up getting front run by algos. Examples of this include taking an exit during an earnings runup or rundown, taking exits before company related news events, or taking an exit before any market-wide news events.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Technical Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. Once I see a pattern or indicator pass a certain threshold, I know it\u2019s likely time to exit my position. Some examples of technical exits may include exits taken around support and resistance levels, exits taken during gap fills, exits taken based off of technical patterns, and exits taken during the absence of any concrete patterns or indicators.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Psychologic Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding market psychology. This is the simplest of the three categories, and is often used in tandem with the other strategies to provide yourself with the best exit possible. Some strategies include exiting around whole numbers, screenshot theory, and individual gain theory. More on these later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nObviously there are going to be a handful of strategies and categories which I\u2019ve missed, but the ones I outlined above are likely going to be the ones which are most common to us retail traders.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Fundamental Exits\n\n**Fundamental exits revolve around one key idea - Sell the news.** More often than not, the results of a given news event are already baked into a stock's price well before the news event is confirmed or actually takes place. As a result, the price of a stock will almost always DROP even if this news is \u201cconfirmed\u201d, because it was already priced in. This can be observed anywhere from earnings runups to product launches to fundamental news events. You may be wondering why this drop even happens in the first place - if the news is baked into a stock's price, shouldn\u2019t it stay flat when the news is confirmed? Hint : Trading Algorithms.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlgorithms, or algos for short, are always behind the inevitable tanking of a stock's price post news event. It\u2019s quite easy to see why once you understand how these algorithms work. An algo can read through an entire earnings report / news transcript / whatever and fire off a corresponding trade in a fraction of a nanosecond, meaning that they\u2019re at a huge advantage since they **have the ability to sell the news after the news event hits.** This means that algos don\u2019t have to prematurely exit their position until they confirm that the underlying security was priced properly. If the underlying was priced to perfection, the algo takes its profits once the news confirms it (very common behavior among algos - take profits once there are no longer any catalysts in play), thereby causing the stock to tank. If the instrument wasn\u2019t priced properly, and there is a huge upside beat, the algo just stays in the trade and reaps the rewards, exiting at a later date instead. This concept is pretty difficult to wrap your head around initially, so let's go through an example.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**In our hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL has just reported earnings.** \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 1 : $AAPL is priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and confirms that $AAPL was indeed priced properly. The algo then takes its profits (as per common algo behavior), and dumps the position as a result of the priced in ER. Many other algos do the same as well, and the stock price \u201ctanks\u201d, resulting in a gap down the following day, and many left holding the bag, even on a seemingly good ER. Welcome to \u201cpriced in\u201d.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 2 : $AAPL is NOT priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and concludes that $AAPL was NOT priced properly. There was a huge upside beat. Instead of selling, the algo stays in the position because it knows that the underlying is undervalued based on the new news, and rides the wave up, exiting the position at a later date. $AAPL was not priced properly, and as a result, the news wasn\u2019t priced in.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn both cases, the algos win - they either escape with their profits, or ride the wave up for even more gains. **Us humans cannot act as quickly as an algo, and thus we\u2019ll always be at a disadvantage when it comes to fundamental exits. We always have to exit our positions prior to news catalysts to avoid getting front run.** News events are almost ALWAYS priced in. We can\u2019t sell the news AFTER the news drops because we cant digest and react to the news fast enough. We can\u2019t front run the algorithms, so we need to sell BEFORE any fundamental news catalysts, otherwise we run the risk of holding the bag. If there\u2019s one thing I want you all to take away from this article, it's that you should **always sell the news.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Earnings\n\nThis is a very simple concept once we understand the mechanisms outlined above. If you\u2019re in a trade, always look to close it out before earnings (unless you wanna get rug pulled, in which case go ahead, I'm not your daddy). If the news is priced in (which it probably is), you\u2019ll get front run by algos and they\u2019ll steal your profits. Do not gamble on the \u201cpriced-in\u201c news being wrong. You\u2019ll lose that bet 9/10 times. Please note that even if earnings is a beat, that \u201cbeat\u201d can still be priced in. Please, exit your trades before earnings, or you run the risk of getting blown out due to your own ignorance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Product Launches\n\nThis is similar to the concept we outlined above. In this hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL announces that they\u2019re going to reveal a new line of products in August. If that\u2019s the case, get ready to exit your position before the event. Every August $AAPL showcases their new iPhones for the year, therefore even though they haven\u2019t explicitly said they\u2019re going to reveal iPhones, the market is gonna price the event as if iPhones are going to be revealed. Once they reveal that their new products are in fact iPhones, the price will tank, because it was priced in, and algos followed the exact behavior outlined earlier. The only instance in which the price wouldn\u2019t tank would be if they announced that they\u2019re releasing a teleportation device or something. Believe it or not, the odds of that happening are astronomically low, so you\u2019re better off just selling before the reveal instead. Unless $AAPL comes out with something totally unexpected, the price will drop.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Fundamental News Events\n\nThis pertains to market moving news as a whole, like an FOMC speech or some macroeconomic event. If you know that JPow is gonna speak on Wednesday, it\u2019s probably best to exit your position before that since you\u2019ve honestly got no idea what\u2019s gonna happen as a byproduct of it. The entire market could take a shit or could fly green, nobody knows. Since we\u2019re traders, not gamblers, it\u2019s in our best interest to exit our positions or hedge in order to shield our gains. Fundamental news events are often crapshoots, and are the leading cause of solid gains getting unjustly erased in an instant.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Exits\n\nTechnical exits pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. In order to have the ability to do a technical exit, you must have a basic understanding of technical charts, patterns, and indicators. The entire field of technical analysis is easy to understand, but hard to master, so even if you don\u2019t have much experience in the area, I\u2019ll do my best to explain it all in a way which is friendly towards newer traders.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Exiting Around Support and Resistance\n\nThis is often one of the easiest exits to perform, as it\u2019s fairly straightforward to identify on a chart. **Whenever you start to approach an area which you\u2019ve deemed as a key level of support or resistance, consider exiting your trade.** If the price has bounced off of that particular level five times in the past, it\u2019ll likely hold true for the 6th time unless something has fundamentally changed about the company or the markets. As a result, you know that you should exit your trade as you approach the level, as it likely won\u2019t keep going in the same direction once we get to that point. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAn awesome example of this would be the [$CLF chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/9/9ymcqFZF.png) As we can tell, CLF trades in a nice ascending channel. In this case, we can use our trendlines to easily identify when to exit our trades in order to capture the maximum amount of our gains, saving us massive headaches. Once we get near any of the yellow trendlines, we should consider taking an exit since we\u2019re likely going to bounce off of it. Another great example of similar price movement can be found in [$AMD\u2019s chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/LzNxfKpr.png) It trades off of supports and resistances very consistently, allowing us to bag consistent gains. However, unlike CLF, AMD often has breakouts to the upside or downside, making it trickier to trade in the event of a breakout.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou may be wondering if there\u2019s any way you can capture the EXTRA gains in the event that the support or resistance levels don\u2019t hold. Although I don\u2019t recommend doing it too often, a well placed stop-loss can help protect your gains in the event that we reject off of a support or resistance, while simultaneously KEEPING you in the trade if we break through the support or resistance. Obviously, you\u2019ll need some experience trading to know exactly where to place your stop, and it\u2019s going to vary from ticker to ticker based on IV and the type of security or derivative you\u2019re trading. A well placed stop-loss can help magnify your returns while also preventing you from giving up any gains you\u2019ve already locked in. Be wary, too tight of a stop could take you out of a trade entirely before a run, but too loose of a stop could cause you to give up too much of your unrealized gains. It\u2019s a fine line to play, and that only comes with experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnother way you could play breakouts is by using a two stepped approach. First, you take your exit once you approach a given level of support or resistance to lock in your gains. You then set an alert within your broker slightly higher than that given level. If your alert gets tripped, you know that there\u2019s been a breakout, and you\u2019re clear to re-enter the trade to then capture any extra gains that may occur once it starts to run. If I run this strategy, I make sure to set my stop under the newly broken support or resistance in order to preserve my capital in the event of a false breakout. In the end, this method is much safer, but it requires you to sit at your computer twiddling your thumbs waiting for a breakout, so I personally don\u2019t prefer it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Gaps\n\nBefore we get into how to trade gaps, we need to understand what gaps are, and why they occur. [**Gaps are areas on a chart where the price of a stock moves sharply without any trades being placed.**](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/asVEHysx.png) Usually this happens as a result of a positive or negative catalyst affecting a stock outside of regular trading hours, resulting in a respective gap up or down the following day. A \u201cgap\u201d refers to a gap in the stock's price as a result of no trades being conducted within that range. Gaps are created because of low volume (technically no volume), and as a result, are prone to getting \u201cfilled\u201d very quickly. Once we are within the price range of a gap, it\u2019s very common that we will get sucked through the area with prices strongly trending towards the opposite side of the gap as a byproduct of the lack of volume.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen trading gaps, we need to recognize two important levels, and understand how price will act around them. **The very last trade that took place before the gap was created will be a very heavy level of resistance, and the very first trade that takes place after a gap will also be a very heavy level of resistance.** As a result, we will be very prone to rejecting off of these levels, so we want to fully exit our trade around these levels, no exceptions. Once we\u2019re past the initial resistance, we can look to re-enter the trade to capture the rest of our profits.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUnderstanding all of that, gap trades are relatively simple. First, we ride our trade up to our first level of resistance (the beginning of the gap, aka the price that the first trade was conducted at), and then take our exit to lock in our profits. Afterwards, we set an alert slightly above the resistance, so we get notified once we\u2019re past the resistance and are in the gap. Since we know there\u2019s no trading volume within the gap, there\u2019s a good chance we will get sucked through to the other side, meaning we should look to re-enter the trade as quickly as possible and then ride it to the opposite end of the gap (the end of the gap aka the price that the last trade was conducted at before the gap was created). Once we get to the opposite end of the gap, we fully exit the trade, because we know that 99% of the time we will reject off of this next heavy level of resistance. Gaps have a very rigid structure, and trade very similar to a breakout play. Enter a trade, exit at first resistance. Re-enter the trade after we break resistance, exit once we\u2019re at the second resistance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**If this concept was unclear or confusing, refer to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDKNRF_BZqQ) which has in-depth examples complete with visuals.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Clear Skies and Falling Knives\n\nA clear skies situation refers to when a stock is on a tear and has recently carved out new all time highs - think [$AMZN\u2019s recent run to $3750,](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/6/6E9FplY9.png) or [$CRSR\u2019s initial run to $50.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/e/EHxx1rVZ.png) A falling knife is the flipside of that, and refers to when a stock is essentially in freefall - like $NKLA when people found out Trevor Milton is a rat, or $WKHS when they lost the government contracts. In both situations, it can be extremely difficult to know when you should exit your trade since we don\u2019t have any technical levels to go off of, and as a result, we don\u2019t know when to anticipate a bounce. Even if we did have a general idea of where it was going to bounce, the market often over reacts, resulting in us blowing past our initial mark before starting our initial recovery.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The simplest way to play these situations is with a trailing stop.** Trailing stops were invented for situations like these, and they\u2019re honestly one of the most effective yet under-utilized tools. Set the stop, and it\u2019ll trail the stock as it moves. When a stock is carving out new highs, or plunging to new lows, a properly set trailing stop will let you get as close to maximum profits as possible while still allowing you to stay in the trade if we experience some turbulence along the way. If your trailing stop is set properly, you shouldn\u2019t get stopped out of the trade from natural market movements, and will only be forced out once we\u2019ve found a new high or low. I\u2019m not going to teach you how to properly set trailing stops as that\u2019s beyond the scope of this article, but it\u2019s something I may write about in the future given that enough people are interested.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Alternatively, if you want to abuse basic human psychology, you could also look to exit your position around whole numbers.** Humans are weird creatures, in the sense that we like \u201cwhole\u201d things - stock prices are no exception. You better believe there\u2019s going to be buyers or sellers setting up shop at nice, round numbers. Think $20, $50, $100, etc. If a stock is making a miracle run from $10, and is approaching $20, you better believe there\u2019s going to be a large number of people looking to take profits at the $20 mark, and as a result, you should look to exit the position around there. Again, this isn\u2019t a 100% concrete theory, and sometimes these levels won\u2019t hold at all, but it\u2019s still something to keep in mind. More on this later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Caveats\n\n**Please note, that these technical exits won\u2019t hold true given that a company's underlying fundamentals have changed. A stock's technical charts and indicators are only to be used as a summary of a company's fundamentals.** Technicals summarize the price action which is driven by the underlying fundamentals. If the fundamentals of a company change, the technical indicators and charts will also change, thereby making our old technical charts void. This is an extremely important concept that most traders and investors do not fully understand. Technicals summarize fundamentals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf $MSFT announces that they\u2019re coming out with a time machine, don\u2019t expect the stock's price to bounce off of the nearest overhead resistance, as that level is now void. $MSFT has fundamentally changed as a company, and as a result, the technicals will also need to change to reflect that. The same is true to the downside. If $MCD announces that they\u2019ve been grinding up humans and putting them into their hamburgers, don\u2019t expect the nearest level of support to hold - it\u2019s void. The stock will plunge into free fall until $MCD is properly priced given it\u2019s new fundamentals. Only then can we look to start re-establishing our technicals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Technicals are only to be used as a summary of a company\u2019s current fundamentals.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Psychological Exits\n\nPsychological exits consist of concepts and rules derived from how humans think and react to certain events. They are more conceptual in nature, and will vary from person to person. They aren\u2019t necessarily as concrete as the other types of exits due to their ambiguous nature. Everyone will apply these exits differently, and as a result I can\u2019t give you a consistent set of rules for each one. I can just explain the general concepts and provide different contexts regarding when to apply them. The rest is up to you!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Screenshot Theory\n\nThis is a very simple concept that I actually adopted from Wall Street Bets of all places - **If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.** If you\u2019re taking screenshots of your unrealized profits to flex on your friends, or random internet people, it\u2019s probably time to sell out of that position. The only reason you feel the need to flex your gains is because it\u2019s a life altering amount of money. I don\u2019t care what the fundamentals, or technicals say at that point. Cash out of the casino, and realize those gains. If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Individual Gain Theory\n\nThis concept refers to when you\u2019re trading with money that you cannot afford to lose, and you come in on somewhat of a win. Profit or loss, this money is going to fundamentally alter your life (for better or worse) because you were put in a position where you had to \u201ctrade\u201d money which you also needed elsewhere. If you\u2019re ever in a situation where you\u2019re forced to trade to make some extra dough, take those profits asap. A loss is often going to make your life a hell of a lot worse than a win will.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Whole Numbers\n\nHumans are weird creatures - we like \u201cwhole\u201d or \u201cround\u201d stuff, numbers being no exception. How often do you catch yourself submitting a buy order for 20$, or a sell order for $50. Unless you\u2019re cognizant of it, you\u2019re not going to think to yourself \u201cimma buy $CLF at 21.83\u201d. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re gonna round it up to $22, or down to $20, etc. The same goes for literally EVERYONE else. Just keep in mind that depending on the direction you\u2019re trading, there\u2019s often going to be buyers / sellers at whole numbers. $10, $20, $25, $30, etc. No number is safe. Look to time your exits before or after these numbers, as they may prove to be mini points of resistance. You\u2019ll often see sellers step in at whole numbers on the way up, and buyers step in at whole numbers on the way down. Use this to your advantage.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Emotional Exits\n\nThis concept applies to two key emotions - Euphoria and Hope. **The instant you start feeling euphoric about a trade and it\u2019s potential gains, step away from the trade.** You\u2019re not going to be thinking clearly enough to make an optimal trade or exit. There\u2019s a very high chance you\u2019re going to continue to chase the victory. If the victory starts slipping away from you, you're likely going to stay in the trade hoping that it goes back up to the previous high that you didn\u2019t sell at. In situations like this, by staying in the trade, you\u2019ll almost always hold your position well past the top, and will be prone to \u201cdiamond hands-ing\u201d your profits into the ground, ultimately coming up with a loss on a fundamentally sound trade. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou need to be conscious of the fact that you\u2019re euphoric, and that this trade went awesome, and exit the position intelligently. Once you start feeling euphoria, and consequently hope, there\u2019s no going back. You\u2019re not trading on fundamentals, and you\u2019re not trading on technicals either. You\u2019re simply not trading rationally. In situations like this, it\u2019s best to take a step back and exit the trade before you make a boneheaded move and end up giving your gains away. Emotions cloud judgement, and as traders, that\u2019s the last thing we want. Sell out of a position once you start feeling intense emotion.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Conclusion\n\nAll in all, options trading is a difficult game with many moving parts - If you're caught skimping on your exits, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. This aspect of trading is less glamorous and often overlooked, but is absolutely vital to your success as a trader.

Happy Trading!**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nWhat\u2019s poppin\u2019 bull-gang, Flux here with an options exit strategy \u201cguide\u201d. I wanted to make this writeup because more often than not, I see people making fundamentally sound trades, only to have their gains vanish due to having poor exit strategy. They either get too greedy and hold on for way too long, or they exit way too early and miss out on an insane runup and want to die for a couple of days afterwards. There\u2019s two parts to each trade - an entry and an exit - and if you\u2019re caught skimping on either end, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. Although this part of trading isn\u2019t glamourous, it\u2019s absolutely vital to your overall success as a trader, so it\u2019s crucial that you learn and study these concepts sooner rather than later. With all that being said, let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Types of Exits\n\nThere\u2019s three types of exits that I tend to use when I conduct my trades, each useful in their own right. I\u2019ll give a quick summary of them all, before providing an in depth analysis and examples of each.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Fundamental Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding the change of a company\u2019s fundamentals. These exits usually take place before the fundamental changes since you\u2019re not going to be able to react to the changes in real time and you\u2019ll end up getting front run by algos. Examples of this include taking an exit during an earnings runup or rundown, taking exits before company related news events, or taking an exit before any market-wide news events.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Technical Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. Once I see a pattern or indicator pass a certain threshold, I know it\u2019s likely time to exit my position. Some examples of technical exits may include exits taken around support and resistance levels, exits taken during gap fills, exits taken based off of technical patterns, and exits taken during the absence of any concrete patterns or indicators.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Psychologic Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding market psychology. This is the simplest of the three categories, and is often used in tandem with the other strategies to provide yourself with the best exit possible. Some strategies include exiting around whole numbers, screenshot theory, and individual gain theory. More on these later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nObviously there are going to be a handful of strategies and categories which I\u2019ve missed, but the ones I outlined above are likely going to be the ones which are most common to us retail traders.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Fundamental Exits\n\n**Fundamental exits revolve around one key idea - Sell the news.** More often than not, the results of a given news event are already baked into a stock's price well before the news event is confirmed or actually takes place. As a result, the price of a stock will almost always DROP even if this news is \u201cconfirmed\u201d, because it was already priced in. This can be observed anywhere from earnings runups to product launches to fundamental news events. You may be wondering why this drop even happens in the first place - if the news is baked into a stock's price, shouldn\u2019t it stay flat when the news is confirmed? Hint : Trading Algorithms.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlgorithms, or algos for short, are always behind the inevitable tanking of a stock's price post news event. It\u2019s quite easy to see why once you understand how these algorithms work. An algo can read through an entire earnings report / news transcript / whatever and fire off a corresponding trade in a fraction of a nanosecond, meaning that they\u2019re at a huge advantage since they **have the ability to sell the news after the news event hits.** This means that algos don\u2019t have to prematurely exit their position until they confirm that the underlying security was priced properly. If the underlying was priced to perfection, the algo takes its profits once the news confirms it (very common behavior among algos - take profits once there are no longer any catalysts in play), thereby causing the stock to tank. If the instrument wasn\u2019t priced properly, and there is a huge upside beat, the algo just stays in the trade and reaps the rewards, exiting at a later date instead. This concept is pretty difficult to wrap your head around initially, so let's go through an example.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**In our hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL has just reported earnings.** \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 1 : $AAPL is priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and confirms that $AAPL was indeed priced properly. The algo then takes its profits (as per common algo behavior), and dumps the position as a result of the priced in ER. Many other algos do the same as well, and the stock price \u201ctanks\u201d, resulting in a gap down the following day, and many left holding the bag, even on a seemingly good ER. Welcome to \u201cpriced in\u201d.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 2 : $AAPL is NOT priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and concludes that $AAPL was NOT priced properly. There was a huge upside beat. Instead of selling, the algo stays in the position because it knows that the underlying is undervalued based on the new news, and rides the wave up, exiting the position at a later date. $AAPL was not priced properly, and as a result, the news wasn\u2019t priced in.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn both cases, the algos win - they either escape with their profits, or ride the wave up for even more gains. **Us humans cannot act as quickly as an algo, and thus we\u2019ll always be at a disadvantage when it comes to fundamental exits. We always have to exit our positions prior to news catalysts to avoid getting front run.** News events are almost ALWAYS priced in. We can\u2019t sell the news AFTER the news drops because we cant digest and react to the news fast enough. We can\u2019t front run the algorithms, so we need to sell BEFORE any fundamental news catalysts, otherwise we run the risk of holding the bag. If there\u2019s one thing I want you all to take away from this article, it's that you should **always sell the news.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Earnings\n\nThis is a very simple concept once we understand the mechanisms outlined above. If you\u2019re in a trade, always look to close it out before earnings (unless you wanna get rug pulled, in which case go ahead, I'm not your daddy). If the news is priced in (which it probably is), you\u2019ll get front run by algos and they\u2019ll steal your profits. Do not gamble on the \u201cpriced-in\u201c news being wrong. You\u2019ll lose that bet 9/10 times. Please note that even if earnings is a beat, that \u201cbeat\u201d can still be priced in. Please, exit your trades before earnings, or you run the risk of getting blown out due to your own ignorance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Product Launches\n\nThis is similar to the concept we outlined above. In this hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL announces that they\u2019re going to reveal a new line of products in August. If that\u2019s the case, get ready to exit your position before the event. Every August $AAPL showcases their new iPhones for the year, therefore even though they haven\u2019t explicitly said they\u2019re going to reveal iPhones, the market is gonna price the event as if iPhones are going to be revealed. Once they reveal that their new products are in fact iPhones, the price will tank, because it was priced in, and algos followed the exact behavior outlined earlier. The only instance in which the price wouldn\u2019t tank would be if they announced that they\u2019re releasing a teleportation device or something. Believe it or not, the odds of that happening are astronomically low, so you\u2019re better off just selling before the reveal instead. Unless $AAPL comes out with something totally unexpected, the price will drop.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Fundamental News Events\n\nThis pertains to market moving news as a whole, like an FOMC speech or some macroeconomic event. If you know that JPow is gonna speak on Wednesday, it\u2019s probably best to exit your position before that since you\u2019ve honestly got no idea what\u2019s gonna happen as a byproduct of it. The entire market could take a shit or could fly green, nobody knows. Since we\u2019re traders, not gamblers, it\u2019s in our best interest to exit our positions or hedge in order to shield our gains. Fundamental news events are often crapshoots, and are the leading cause of solid gains getting unjustly erased in an instant.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Exits\n\nTechnical exits pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. In order to have the ability to do a technical exit, you must have a basic understanding of technical charts, patterns, and indicators. The entire field of technical analysis is easy to understand, but hard to master, so even if you don\u2019t have much experience in the area, I\u2019ll do my best to explain it all in a way which is friendly towards newer traders.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Exiting Around Support and Resistance\n\nThis is often one of the easiest exits to perform, as it\u2019s fairly straightforward to identify on a chart. **Whenever you start to approach an area which you\u2019ve deemed as a key level of support or resistance, consider exiting your trade.** If the price has bounced off of that particular level five times in the past, it\u2019ll likely hold true for the 6th time unless something has fundamentally changed about the company or the markets. As a result, you know that you should exit your trade as you approach the level, as it likely won\u2019t keep going in the same direction once we get to that point. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAn awesome example of this would be the [$CLF chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/9/9ymcqFZF.png) As we can tell, CLF trades in a nice ascending channel. In this case, we can use our trendlines to easily identify when to exit our trades in order to capture the maximum amount of our gains, saving us massive headaches. Once we get near any of the yellow trendlines, we should consider taking an exit since we\u2019re likely going to bounce off of it. Another great example of similar price movement can be found in [$AMD\u2019s chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/LzNxfKpr.png) It trades off of supports and resistances very consistently, allowing us to bag consistent gains. However, unlike CLF, AMD often has breakouts to the upside or downside, making it trickier to trade in the event of a breakout.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou may be wondering if there\u2019s any way you can capture the EXTRA gains in the event that the support or resistance levels don\u2019t hold. Although I don\u2019t recommend doing it too often, a well placed stop-loss can help protect your gains in the event that we reject off of a support or resistance, while simultaneously KEEPING you in the trade if we break through the support or resistance. Obviously, you\u2019ll need some experience trading to know exactly where to place your stop, and it\u2019s going to vary from ticker to ticker based on IV and the type of security or derivative you\u2019re trading. A well placed stop-loss can help magnify your returns while also preventing you from giving up any gains you\u2019ve already locked in. Be wary, too tight of a stop could take you out of a trade entirely before a run, but too loose of a stop could cause you to give up too much of your unrealized gains. It\u2019s a fine line to play, and that only comes with experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnother way you could play breakouts is by using a two stepped approach. First, you take your exit once you approach a given level of support or resistance to lock in your gains. You then set an alert within your broker slightly higher than that given level. If your alert gets tripped, you know that there\u2019s been a breakout, and you\u2019re clear to re-enter the trade to then capture any extra gains that may occur once it starts to run. If I run this strategy, I make sure to set my stop under the newly broken support or resistance in order to preserve my capital in the event of a false breakout. In the end, this method is much safer, but it requires you to sit at your computer twiddling your thumbs waiting for a breakout, so I personally don\u2019t prefer it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Gaps\n\nBefore we get into how to trade gaps, we need to understand what gaps are, and why they occur. [**Gaps are areas on a chart where the price of a stock moves sharply without any trades being placed.**](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/asVEHysx.png) Usually this happens as a result of a positive or negative catalyst affecting a stock outside of regular trading hours, resulting in a respective gap up or down the following day. A \u201cgap\u201d refers to a gap in the stock's price as a result of no trades being conducted within that range. Gaps are created because of low volume (technically no volume), and as a result, are prone to getting \u201cfilled\u201d very quickly. Once we are within the price range of a gap, it\u2019s very common that we will get sucked through the area with prices strongly trending towards the opposite side of the gap as a byproduct of the lack of volume.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen trading gaps, we need to recognize two important levels, and understand how price will act around them. **The very last trade that took place before the gap was created will be a very heavy level of resistance, and the very first trade that takes place after a gap will also be a very heavy level of resistance.** As a result, we will be very prone to rejecting off of these levels, so we want to fully exit our trade around these levels, no exceptions. Once we\u2019re past the initial resistance, we can look to re-enter the trade to capture the rest of our profits.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUnderstanding all of that, gap trades are relatively simple. First, we ride our trade up to our first level of resistance (the beginning of the gap, aka the price that the first trade was conducted at), and then take our exit to lock in our profits. Afterwards, we set an alert slightly above the resistance, so we get notified once we\u2019re past the resistance and are in the gap. Since we know there\u2019s no trading volume within the gap, there\u2019s a good chance we will get sucked through to the other side, meaning we should look to re-enter the trade as quickly as possible and then ride it to the opposite end of the gap (the end of the gap aka the price that the last trade was conducted at before the gap was created). Once we get to the opposite end of the gap, we fully exit the trade, because we know that 99% of the time we will reject off of this next heavy level of resistance. Gaps have a very rigid structure, and trade very similar to a breakout play. Enter a trade, exit at first resistance. Re-enter the trade after we break resistance, exit once we\u2019re at the second resistance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**If this concept was unclear or confusing, refer to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDKNRF_BZqQ) which has in-depth examples complete with visuals.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Clear Skies and Falling Knives\n\nA clear skies situation refers to when a stock is on a tear and has recently carved out new all time highs - think [$AMZN\u2019s recent run to $3750,](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/6/6E9FplY9.png) or [$CRSR\u2019s initial run to $50.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/e/EHxx1rVZ.png) A falling knife is the flipside of that, and refers to when a stock is essentially in freefall - like $NKLA when people found out Trevor Milton is a rat, or $WKHS when they lost the government contracts. In both situations, it can be extremely difficult to know when you should exit your trade since we don\u2019t have any technical levels to go off of, and as a result, we don\u2019t know when to anticipate a bounce. Even if we did have a general idea of where it was going to bounce, the market often over reacts, resulting in us blowing past our initial mark before starting our initial recovery.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The simplest way to play these situations is with a trailing stop.** Trailing stops were invented for situations like these, and they\u2019re honestly one of the most effective yet under-utilized tools. Set the stop, and it\u2019ll trail the stock as it moves. When a stock is carving out new highs, or plunging to new lows, a properly set trailing stop will let you get as close to maximum profits as possible while still allowing you to stay in the trade if we experience some turbulence along the way. If your trailing stop is set properly, you shouldn\u2019t get stopped out of the trade from natural market movements, and will only be forced out once we\u2019ve found a new high or low. I\u2019m not going to teach you how to properly set trailing stops as that\u2019s beyond the scope of this article, but it\u2019s something I may write about in the future given that enough people are interested.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Alternatively, if you want to abuse basic human psychology, you could also look to exit your position around whole numbers.** Humans are weird creatures, in the sense that we like \u201cwhole\u201d things - stock prices are no exception. You better believe there\u2019s going to be buyers or sellers setting up shop at nice, round numbers. Think $20, $50, $100, etc. If a stock is making a miracle run from $10, and is approaching $20, you better believe there\u2019s going to be a large number of people looking to take profits at the $20 mark, and as a result, you should look to exit the position around there. Again, this isn\u2019t a 100% concrete theory, and sometimes these levels won\u2019t hold at all, but it\u2019s still something to keep in mind. More on this later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Caveats\n\n**Please note, that these technical exits won\u2019t hold true given that a company's underlying fundamentals have changed. A stock's technical charts and indicators are only to be used as a summary of a company's fundamentals.** Technicals summarize the price action which is driven by the underlying fundamentals. If the fundamentals of a company change, the technical indicators and charts will also change, thereby making our old technical charts void. This is an extremely important concept that most traders and investors do not fully understand. Technicals summarize fundamentals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf $MSFT announces that they\u2019re coming out with a time machine, don\u2019t expect the stock's price to bounce off of the nearest overhead resistance, as that level is now void. $MSFT has fundamentally changed as a company, and as a result, the technicals will also need to change to reflect that. The same is true to the downside. If $MCD announces that they\u2019ve been grinding up humans and putting them into their hamburgers, don\u2019t expect the nearest level of support to hold - it\u2019s void. The stock will plunge into free fall until $MCD is properly priced given it\u2019s new fundamentals. Only then can we look to start re-establishing our technicals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Technicals are only to be used as a summary of a company\u2019s current fundamentals.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Psychological Exits\n\nPsychological exits consist of concepts and rules derived from how humans think and react to certain events. They are more conceptual in nature, and will vary from person to person. They aren\u2019t necessarily as concrete as the other types of exits due to their ambiguous nature. Everyone will apply these exits differently, and as a result I can\u2019t give you a consistent set of rules for each one. I can just explain the general concepts and provide different contexts regarding when to apply them. The rest is up to you!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Screenshot Theory\n\nThis is a very simple concept that I actually adopted from Wall Street Bets of all places - **If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.** If you\u2019re taking screenshots of your unrealized profits to flex on your friends, or random internet people, it\u2019s probably time to sell out of that position. The only reason you feel the need to flex your gains is because it\u2019s a life altering amount of money. I don\u2019t care what the fundamentals, or technicals say at that point. Cash out of the casino, and realize those gains. If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Individual Gain Theory\n\nThis concept refers to when you\u2019re trading with money that you cannot afford to lose, and you come in on somewhat of a win. Profit or loss, this money is going to fundamentally alter your life (for better or worse) because you were put in a position where you had to \u201ctrade\u201d money which you also needed elsewhere. If you\u2019re ever in a situation where you\u2019re forced to trade to make some extra dough, take those profits asap. A loss is often going to make your life a hell of a lot worse than a win will.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Whole Numbers\n\nHumans are weird creatures - we like \u201cwhole\u201d or \u201cround\u201d stuff, numbers being no exception. How often do you catch yourself submitting a buy order for 20$, or a sell order for $50. Unless you\u2019re cognizant of it, you\u2019re not going to think to yourself \u201cimma buy $CLF at 21.83\u201d. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re gonna round it up to $22, or down to $20, etc. The same goes for literally EVERYONE else. Just keep in mind that depending on the direction you\u2019re trading, there\u2019s often going to be buyers / sellers at whole numbers. $10, $20, $25, $30, etc. No number is safe. Look to time your exits before or after these numbers, as they may prove to be mini points of resistance. You\u2019ll often see sellers step in at whole numbers on the way up, and buyers step in at whole numbers on the way down. Use this to your advantage.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Emotional Exits\n\nThis concept applies to two key emotions - Euphoria and Hope. **The instant you start feeling euphoric about a trade and it\u2019s potential gains, step away from the trade.** You\u2019re not going to be thinking clearly enough to make an optimal trade or exit. There\u2019s a very high chance you\u2019re going to continue to chase the victory. If the victory starts slipping away from you, you're likely going to stay in the trade hoping that it goes back up to the previous high that you didn\u2019t sell at. In situations like this, by staying in the trade, you\u2019ll almost always hold your position well past the top, and will be prone to \u201cdiamond hands-ing\u201d your profits into the ground, ultimately coming up with a loss on a fundamentally sound trade. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou need to be conscious of the fact that you\u2019re euphoric, and that this trade went awesome, and exit the position intelligently. Once you start feeling euphoria, and consequently hope, there\u2019s no going back. You\u2019re not trading on fundamentals, and you\u2019re not trading on technicals either. You\u2019re simply not trading rationally. In situations like this, it\u2019s best to take a step back and exit the trade before you make a boneheaded move and end up giving your gains away. Emotions cloud judgement, and as traders, that\u2019s the last thing we want. Sell out of a position once you start feeling intense emotion.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Conclusion\n\nAll in all, options trading is a difficult game with many moving parts - If you're caught skimping on your exits, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. This aspect of trading is less glamorous and often overlooked, but is absolutely vital to your success as a trader.

        "selftext": "As an investor, you may have the benefit of a custodian without giving much thought to the importance of their role. The Securities Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) custody rule requires that Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) safeguard their client\u2019s assets, by imposing requirements designed to protect client funds and securities. Custodians also process trading, settling, and reconciling of assets purchased and sold. Additionally, they maintain all economic benefits to account owners including collecting income, corporate actions and proxy issues.\n\n#### Qualified Custodians\u00a0\n\nAn investment advisor is required to maintain client funds and securities with a qualified custodian, which can be a bank, registered broker-dealer and a few other types of entities. Examples of large custodians include Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade and Fidelity. The qualified custodian either maintains client funds and securities in a separate account under the client\u2019s name or, in accounts under the name of the investment advisor, as agent or trustee for the clients. Second, the investment advisor opening the custodial account must promptly notify the client in writing of the qualified custodian\u2019s name, address, how the funds or securities are maintained when the account is opened and following any changes to this information. Account statements from the qualified custodian must be provided to the client at least quarterly, permitting advisory clients the opportunity to compare these statements with any statements they receive from the advisor.\n\n#### Annual Exams and Additional Protections\n\nIf the investment advisor has custody of client assets, they must enter into a written agreement with an independent public accountant to examine the assets on a surprise basis every year, with the examiner contacting some advisory clients to confirm their holdings with those listed on the advisor\u2019s records. If the qualified custodian is the investment advisor or, is affiliated, they must meet additional requirements, including obtaining an annual opinion from an independent public accountant regarding the effectiveness of the custodian\u2019s procedures for safeguarding client funds. Safekeeping of assets includes maintaining ownership, providing valuation, accounting, and reporting assets.\u00a0\n\n#### Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC)\n\nAn SIPC is a nonprofit organization that protects against the loss of cash and securities held by a customer at a SIPC member firm. The SIPC will cover up to $500,000 in securities, including a $250,000 limit for cash. In addition to SIPC, some custodians provide their customers with additional \u201cexcess of SIPC\u201d coverage through private insurers. The excess coverage is only used when SIPC coverage is exhausted and, like SIPC, does not cover investment losses due to market fluctuation or other investment losses.\n\n#### Steps Investors Should Take\n\nWhen working with an investment advisor, ask about the custodian they will use for your accounts, are they an SIPC member and do they provide an \u201cexcess of SIPC\u201d coverage. Will accounts be in your name or the investment advisor\u2019s name, as your agent? When you issue checks for deposit, always make your check payable directly to your custodian. If your investment advisor is registered with the SEC, you should always receive a separate statement, at least quarterly, directly from the custodian. Even with the protections offered by the \u201ccustody rule\u201d and SIPC, investors should exercise care when making investment decisions.  \n\n\n  \n[https://www.pantagraph.com/business/kingston-safeguarding-your-investments/article\\_9a55c4e8-12d2-554a-b6bd-3afaa429e29a.html](https://www.pantagraph.com/business/kingston-safeguarding-your-investments/article_9a55c4e8-12d2-554a-b6bd-3afaa429e29a.html)",

Additionally, they maintain all economic benefits to account owners including collecting income, corporate actions and proxy issues.\n\nQualified Custodians\u00a0\n\nAn investment advisor is required to maintain client funds and securities with a qualified custodian, which can be a bank, registered broker-dealer and a few other types of entities. Examples of large custodians include Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade and Fidelity. The qualified custodian either maintains client funds and securities in a separate account under the client\u2019s name or, in accounts under the name of the investment advisor, as agent or trustee for the clients. Second, the investment advisor opening the custodial account must promptly notify the client in writing of the qualified custodian\u2019s name, address, how the funds or securities are maintained when the account is opened and following any changes to this information. Account statements from the qualified custodian must be provided to the client at least quarterly, permitting advisory clients the opportunity to compare these statements with any statements they receive from the advisor.\n\nAnnual Exams and Additional Protections\n\nIf the investment advisor has custody of client assets, they must enter into a written agreement with an independent public accountant to examine the assets on a surprise basis every year, with the examiner contacting some advisory clients to confirm their holdings with those listed on the advisor\u2019s records. If the qualified custodian is the investment advisor or, is affiliated, they must meet additional requirements, including obtaining an annual opinion from an independent public accountant regarding the effectiveness of the custodian\u2019s procedures for safeguarding client funds. Safekeeping of assets includes maintaining ownership, providing valuation, accounting, and reporting assets.\u00a0\n\nSecurities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC)\n\nAn SIPC is a nonprofit organization that protects against the loss of cash and securities held by a customer at a SIPC member firm. The SIPC will cover up to $500,000 in securities, including a $250,000 limit for cash. In addition to SIPC, some custodians provide their customers with additional \u201cexcess of SIPC\u201d coverage through private insurers. The excess coverage is only used when SIPC coverage is exhausted and, like SIPC, does not cover investment losses due to market fluctuation or other investment losses.\n\nSteps Investors Should Take\n\nWhen working with an investment advisor, ask about the custodian they will use for your accounts, are they an SIPC member and do they provide an \u201cexcess of SIPC\u201d coverage. Will accounts be in your name or the investment advisor\u2019s name, as your agent? When you issue checks for deposit, always make your check payable directly to your custodian. If your investment advisor is registered with the SEC, you should always receive a separate statement, at least quarterly, directly from the custodian. Even with the protections offered by the \u201ccustody rule\u201d and SIPC, investors should exercise care when making investment decisions.\n\n[https://www.pantagraph.com/business/kingston-safeguarding-your-investments/article\\_9a55c4e8-12d2-554a-b6bd-3afaa429e29a.html](https://www.pantagraph.com/business/kingston-safeguarding-your-investments/article_9a55c4e8-12d2-554a-b6bd-3afaa429e29a.html)",
