        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, September 3, 2021**\n\nStocks finished the day mixed, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) falling while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) pushed higher, closing 0.31% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 0.46%. Market participants are digesting the release of the August Jobs Report, which showed a sharp deceleration in employment amid the latest surge by the coronavirus Delta variant. \n\nThe Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly \u2153 of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous month\u2019s numbers. Here are the numbers.\n\n* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \\+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July\n* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July\n* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July \n* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July\n\nPresident Biden said of the report, \u201cWhile I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what we\u2019ve seen this year in continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.\u201d\n\nThis is a little confusing but follow me here. In a weird quirk of the market, the low employment numbers actually benefit equities by staving off the need for tapering, which is why we saw tech stocks in particular popping today. Members of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially close at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the \u201csubstantial further progress mark\u201d the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, \u201cI think that one more good job report if it\u2019s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.\u201d Regardless, as I have said before, I remain unconcerned by taper talks, I think the real test for equities will come when discussion about potential interest rate hikes begins.\n\nSteve Sosnick, Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers, said of the report \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the market really trying to wrestle with the idea of what matters to it more: Is it about the economy, or is it about monetary policy? Now, we\u2019ve been in a monetary-driven market for so long it\u2019s hard to say that monetary factors aren\u2019t at the forefront of the market\u2019s mindset right now. But what I think we may be seeing here \u2026 we can\u2019t really figure out whether this delays tapering in a meaningful way. But there\u2019s stuff in here that is not necessarily bad other than the headline number. Wages are good, the unemployment rate is good.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Moderna (MRNA), Workday (WDAY), Nvidia (NVDA) were among the best-performing stocks in the Nasdaq today, driving it higher.\n* US auto safety regulators disclosed they are investigating a July 26 fatal crash involving a Tesla that may or may not have been using the advanced driver assistance system. This is the latest regulatory headache for Tesla and their autonomous driving technology given there is already another investigation currently underway.\n* Dish\u2019s (DISH) Sling TV, which reportedly has 2.7 million subs as of December 2020, has partnered with Penn National Gaming (PENN) to launch a Barstools Sports Channel on its streaming service. \n* Match Group (MTCH), which owns popular dating app Tinder, filed a letter with Dutch competition regulators to public state their decision regarding a complaint filed against Apple for anti-competitive practices for forcing Match to use Apple\u2019s in-app payment system. Ever since Fortnite-maker Epic Games\u2019 original lawsuit against Apple regarding this seems more and more companies are hopping on. A new South Korean law that was recently passed forces Apple and Google to accept third-party payment systems.\n* Amid regulatory crackdown and a falling stock price, Alibaba (BABA) committed to spending the equivalent of roughly $15.5 billion by 2025 towards the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s drive to \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d. \n* Beyond Meats (BYND) COO Sanjay Shah steps down from his role with no public explanation given. He originally joined the company from Tesla in 2019\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Adobe (ADBE) target raised by Argus from $650 to $764 at Buy. Stock currently around $665\n* Broadcom (AVGO) with a host of target raises. Average price target $550 at Buy. Stock currently around $498\n* DocuSign (DOCU) with a host of target raises. Average price target $345 at Buy. Stock currently around $310\n* Lululemon (LULU) target raised by Telsey Advisory Group from $440 to $460 at Outperform. Stock currently around $388\n* Quanta Services (PWR) with three target raises. Stock currently around $116\n   * Northland Securities from $103 to $129 at Outperform\n   * Piper Sandler from $120 to $140 at Overweight. Stock currently around $116\n   * KeyCorp from $115 to $129 at Overweight. Stock currently around $116\n* American Eagle (AEO) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $43 to $45 at Buy. Stock currently around $27\n* Kirkland (KIRK) target raised by Craig Hallum from $37 to $40 at Buy. Stock currently around $24\n\n\u201cOur greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.\u201d - Confucius",

TheStreet score**\n\nThe first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I\u2019m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.\n\nFrom thestreet.com:\n\n***A (Excellent)*** *\u2013 The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication \u2014 not a guarantee \u2014 we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*\n\nAnd about the methodology (source: https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html):\n\n*TheStreet Ratings\u2019 stock model projects a stock\u2019s total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*\n\n**2. Zacks Rank**\n\nIt is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we\u2019re avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company\u2019s shares. More from https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6:\n\n*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s +10.6% .*\n\n**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**\n\nWe\u2019re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.\n\nWjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:\n\n*\u201cA\u201d Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company\u2019s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company\u2019s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our \u201cA\u201d rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a \u201c****Strong Buy****\u201c.*\n\n*\u201cB\u201d rating:* ***Good.*** *The company\u2019s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our \u201cB\u201d rating is considered the equivalent of a \u201c****Buy****\u201c.*\n\n**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**\n\nIt is required that the Yahoo Finance stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.\n\n**5. Piotroski F-Score**\n\nThe Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company\u2019s financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski\u2019s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:\n\n*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*\n\nIt is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from https://www.gurufocus.com.\n\n**6. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**\n\nThe rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.\n\n*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*\n\n*A low score doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a bullish case for it.*\n\nPlease note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the reading. What do you think about this stock selection and the strategy? Feel free to leave a comment below.\n\n*Michael*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosures:\n\n* What you see here is my personal opinion, my own investments and should not be treated as investing advice\n* I\u2019m an amateur investor",

TheStreet score**\n\nThe first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I\u2019m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.\n\nFrom thestreet.com:\n\n***A (Excellent)*** *\u2013 The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication \u2014 not a guarantee \u2014 we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*\n\nAnd about the methodology (source: https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html):\n\n*TheStreet Ratings\u2019 stock model projects a stock\u2019s total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*\n\n**2. Zacks Rank**\n\nIt is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we\u2019re avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company\u2019s shares. More from https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6:\n\n*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s +10.6% .*\n\n**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**\n\nWe\u2019re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.\n\nWjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:\n\n*\u201cA\u201d Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company\u2019s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company\u2019s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our \u201cA\u201d rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a \u201c****Strong Buy****\u201c.*\n\n*\u201cB\u201d rating:* ***Good.*** *The company\u2019s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our \u201cB\u201d rating is considered the equivalent of a \u201c****Buy****\u201c.*\n\n**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**\n\nIt is required that the Yahoo Finance stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.\n\n**5. Piotroski F-Score**\n\nThe Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company\u2019s financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski\u2019s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:\n\n*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*\n\nIt is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from https://www.gurufocus.com.\n\n**6. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**\n\nThe rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.\n\n*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*\n\n*A low score doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a bullish case for it.*\n\nPlease note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the reading. What do you think about this stock selection and the strategy? Feel free to leave a comment below.\n\n*Michael*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosures:\n\n* What you see here is my personal opinion, my own investments and should not be treated as investing advice\n* I\u2019m an amateur investor",

So effectively it should have been priced in with all the weak hands leaving, and for at least the option IV should have increased yet it wasnt, and now puts more than doubled. Also at times when the market is overly sure of event X going in Y direction, the absolute opposite happens. Its pretty fucking wild that we pretty much all called it. Usually that never happens. Anyone who bought puts was granted the easiest play ever. \n\nYou can claim its the PIPE dumping but I dont think the Saudis are stupid enough to dump all their shares in pre-market. There are no short shares available. It seems like retail is all selling NOW despite being warned extensively.",

        "selftext": "Listen up you autistic retards this shit is serious. Coinbase has basically been hoeing hardcore since its direct listing in April. This bitch has been getting reamed for 4 months BUT \\*cue picture\\* let's take a look at the chart and see what's up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[COIN Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/x6qvq5tiuvk71.png?width=2358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3eec4721d35b1315ec0be5e51129e93926fc00f)\n\nNow i ain't no fucking artist and i may have a learning disability but I know a cup when i see one and if you look at this chart, even in ur peripheries you'll notice a small cup and handle that's formed in between the support lines, you'll also notice the middle support line recently did an r/S flip i.e. went from being a resistance line to support line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow with the small cup in place it may be high time for Coinbase to continue this trend up and fill up the bigger cup by flying back to the 420-450 range. Also the velocity at which alt currencies move if there is a decent rally in the next few weeks, there's potential this sees an even bigger push to go back up where it came from. The MACD looks bullish with potentially indicating this reversal will become a rally. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n However, the fundamentals are also insanely undervalued right now. I'm talking this thing has a mufuckin current PE ratio of 28 only considering the first 2 quarters this year i.e. NOT COUNTING any estimates from q3 and q4 this year. I'm talking they made rev of about a billion dollars in FY2020 with about 350 mill in net income, Q1 2021 they made over 1.6 billion in revenue and more than doubled net income relative to the ENTIRE PREVIOUS YEAR.  Q2 2021 they made revenue of 2.23 billion netting 1.6 fucking billion in a damn quarter. They're literally reaching exponential growth as we speak and lets be honest the industry they're in is primed to grow substantially in the foreseeable future. Now if you look at their guidance for q3 and q4 they are not expecting to beat the net income of q2 but they also expect continued profitability and could potentially beat forecasts IF certain coins that are traded on their platform rally hard. For comparison, Square is trading at a FORWARD PE (2024) of 73, PayPal FORWARD PE 2024 of 32, I could go on and on. So really their current annual PE is considerably less than 28 once earnings come in for q3 and q4.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a cash cow of a company fundamentals and technicals seem to be aligning nicely. I think you can't go wrong with far out leaps however you must know that I am retarded and you would be an even bigger retard if you listened to me, jk you prolly can't even read so I'm not worried.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR COIN to the moon fam!!!\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not currently in a position but considering loading the $300 calls exp dec 21",

        "selftext": " Dear \\*\\*\\*\\*,\n\nIn response to new Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) rules related to pattern day trading, we are updating our policy (which will go into effect on or about September 14, 2021). Because your account was noted for pattern day trading in the past year, we wanted to make sure you're aware of the change and how it could impact your account.\n\n**Understanding the new policy.** In line with the new FINRA rules, our new policy allows for only one flag removal within the life of an account. This means that if your account is flagged again in the future, the flag cannot be removed. Previously, our policy allowed the flag to be removed from an account up to three times within a rolling year before the account was flagged permanently.\n\n**What if your account is flagged?** If your account is flagged for pattern day trading, you'll have to maintain a minimum equity balance of $25,000 at the start of each trading day to continue day trading. If you place a day trade in a flagged account with a balance under $25,000 in equity, you'll be restricted to closing transactions until you bring your equity above $25,000.\n\nTo learn more about the pattern day trading rule and how to avoid breaking it, please view our [FAQ](https://www.tdameritrade.com/why-td-ameritrade/contact-us/top-faqs.html) or [*The Ticker Tape*](https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/trading/avoid-violating-pattern-day-trader-rule-18005).\n\n**Questions? We're here for you.** If you have questions or if we can help you with this process in any way, please don't hesitate to let us know.

        "selftext": "Listen up you autistic retards this shit is serious. Coinbase has basically been hoeing hardcore since its direct listing in April. This bitch has been getting reamed 4 and a half months and counting but \\*cue picture\\* let's take a look at the chart and see what's up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CB Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/aqjaxo37nvk71.png?width=2358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=478a56b2d64a8f5278121224d85d13646b93ade2)\n\nNow i ain't no fucking artist and i may have a learning disability but I know a cup when i see one and if you look at this chart, even in ur peripheries you'll notice a small cup and handle that's formed in between the support lines, you'll also notice the middle support line recently did an r/S flip i.e. went from being a resistance line to support line.\n\nNow with the small cup in place it may be high time for Coinbase to continue this trend up and fill up the bigger cup by flying back to the 420-450 range. Also the velocity at which alt currencies move if there is a decent rally in the next few weeks, there's potential this sees an even bigger push to go back up where it came from. The MACD looks bullish with potentially indicating this reversal will become a rally. \n\n However, the fundamentals are also insanely undervalued right now. I'm talking this thing has a mufuckin current PE ratio of 28 only considering the first 2 quarters this year i.e. NOT COUNTING any estimates from q3 and q4 this year. I'm talking they made rev of about a billion dollars in FY2020 with about 350 mill in net income, Q1 2021 they made over 1.6 billion in revenue and more than doubled net income relative to the ENTIRE PREVIOUS YEAR.  Q2 2021 they made revenue of 2.23 billion netting 1.6 fucking billion in a damn quarter. They're literally reaching exponential growth as we speak and lets be honest the industry they're in is primed to grow substantially in the foreseeable future. Now if you look at their guidance for q3 and q4 they are not expecting to beat the net income of q2 but they also expect continued profitability and could potentially beat forecasts IF certain coins that are traded on their platform rally hard. For comparison, Square is trading at a FORWARD PE (2024) of 73, PayPal FORWARD PE 2024 of 32, I could go on and on. So really their current annual PE is considerably less than 28 once earnings come in for q3 and q4.\n\nThis is a cash cow of a company fundamentals and technicals seem to be aligning nicely. I think you can't go wrong with far out leaps however you must know that I am retarded and you would be an even bigger retard if you listened to me, jk you prolly can't even read so I'm not worried.\n\nTL:DR COIN to the moon fam!!!",

        "selftext": " \n\n22nd\u00a0Century (XXII) Announces the Completion of Its Trifecta of Market Sectors with Tobacco, Cannabis, and Now Hops\n\nMassive IP portfolio on the Tobacco and Cannabis Plants.\u00a0**Now hops also?**\u00a0I would say they have all major areas covered. (I will dive more into that later) no pun intended.\n\nGood day everyone,\n\nWe are updating coverage on\u00a0**22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: XXII),**\u00a0a leading plant-based, biotechnology company that is focused on tobacco harm reduction, very-low nicotine content tobacco, and hemp/cannabis research.\n\nCurrent price $3.57/share (at market close Aug. 31, 2021)\n\nOn August 16, 2021, XXII moved to the NASDAQ Exchange from the NYSE-American. The company participated in the closing bell ceremony on the same day. The company believes the move will increase their visibility and exposure to investors.\n\nWhen I look at\u00a0[the company stock chart](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=XXII), I see how XXII has come off recent dips this year. On April 26th, the shares peaked at $6.07, then dipped to $3.56 on May 13th. On July 1st\u00a0the shares had climbed back to $4.63 before consolidating to today\u2019s level. XXII shares have now crossed their 200 DMA of $3.34 and are\u00a0**approaching their 50 DMA of $3.67/share in a bullish manner**.\n\nI often note insider holdings as a value metric because the insiders have a vested interest in the company\u2019s success. Insider ownership isn\u2019t very high (under 3%) at XXII, but the institutional ownership (all data per YF) is at 36.4% of the outstanding shares.\u00a0**Some of the big guns are holding XXII shares like Blackrock (5.99%) and Vanguard (4.68%). ETF Managers Group is holding 7.38% of the company\u2019s shares.**\u00a0Hedge funds prefer the companies they invest in to perform sooner rather than later.\n\nWhen we last covered XXII in July, we talked about the company\u2019s trifecta of core products, tobacco, cannabis, and an unknown third leg. I spent some time trying to figure out what that third product was going to be. Since XXII was already in the tobacco and cannabis sectors I thought the new market would be psilocybin. Boy was I wrong. While psilocybin is an exciting and developing market, it is still relatively small and in it\u2019s infancy. XXII doesn\u2019t chase small markets.\n\nIn a\u00a0[letter to shareholders](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/22nd-century-group-enters-global-132000137.html)\u00a0published Monday, August 30th, CEO James Mish said \u201cI am proud to announce our third plant-based franchise \u2013 the global\u00a0**specialty hops market**. Like our existing franchises, the hop plant market is ripe for disruption and offers opportunities for 22nd Century to provide unique and significant competitive advantages to commercial partners. The addition of hops, a critical input for the $500 billion global brewing industry as well as a growing source of medically-important molecules, expands our total addressable markets to an estimated $1.3 trillion.\u201d\n\n95% of all hops are used to make beer. The rising demand for microbrew and craft beers is driving the specialty hops market where distinctive flavors, aromas and nutritional uses are important in creating unique and differentiated products. The XXII R&amp;D program objectives include creating new proprietary hop plants and valuable IP using their know-how and technologies, utilizing double haploids, gene-editing, molecular breeding, and other non-GMO technology.\n\nXXII is establishing a new subsidiary in the Netherlands, 22nd Century Group Europe B.V., to open new revenue opportunities in hops, as well as serve their tobacco and hemp/cannabis plant franchises through an expanded global footprint.\n\nXXII is on the move now with a move toward globalization and a new product pipeline that may generate revenues quickly. The demand for proprietary, specialized, non-GMO hops is high and XXII has the tools to provide them.\n\n7/23/2021 Cowen Initiated Coverage Outperform $5.00\n\n**On the tobacco front**, earlier in August, the company announced that they were highly confident their MRTP (modified risk tobacco products) application has completed the FDA\u2019s scientific review process and is now in the documentation process, the final stage before the FDA announces its decision. While the company\u2019s VLN cigarettes were approved for sale in 2019, this important designation will allow 22nd Century to communicate key features of VLN\u00ae King and VLN\u00ae Menthol King, including the headline claim of \u201c95% less nicotine.\u201d VLN\u00ae tastes, smells, and smokes like a conventional cigarette. Both the FDA and the Biden administration have been looking for ways to curb illness, and consequently healthcare expenses, associated with cigarette smoking.\n\n**On the cannabis front**, XXII has been building its network of partnerships to maximize the upstream segment of the cannabinoid value chain since 2019. Components of 22nd Century\u2019s proprietary value chain include: plant profiling tailored to the needs of customers (CannaMetrix), genetics to deliver differentiated traits to maximize yield of a specific cannabinoid or deliver a certain taste or fragrance profile (KeyGene), and commercial-scale plant breeding and cultivation of disruptive plant lines as well as year-round ingredient extraction/purification (Extractas Bioscience, Sawatch Agriculture, Folium Botanical, Aurora Cannabis, Needle Rock Farms, and Panacea).\n\nThe XXII \u201ctrifecta\u201d of market sectors it participates in is now complete with tobacco, cannabis, and hops. As CEO Mish pointed out above, these three sectors address an\u00a0**estimated market of $1.3T**. Sometimes we get lost with those numbers but each\u00a0**1% of a $1.3T market potential is $13B**.\n\nStay tuned for more coverage on 22nd\u00a0Century Group coming very soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 22nd Century Group, Inc.  \n22nd Century Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: XXII) is a leading plant biotechnology and intellectual property company focused on improving health and wellness through plant science. 22nd Century uses modern plant breeding technologies, gene-editing, and molecular breeding to deliver value to its customers in the life science and consumer products industries by creating new, proprietary tobacco, hemp/cannabis and hop plants with optimized alkaloid and flavonoid profiles as well as improved yields and valuable agronomic traits. 22nd Century was founded to build intellectual property related to nicotine biosynthesis in the tobacco plant and to commercialize its proprietary reduced nicotine content (RNC) tobacco plants, which have become the cornerstone of FDA\u2019s comprehensive plan to address the enormous amount of death and disease caused by addiction to smoking.\u00a0**The Company has also begun to leverage its plant science expertise and existing partnerships to create and commercialize new, proprietary hemp/cannabis and hop plants to optimize their genetics and create valuable new intellectual property.**\n\n[Privacy policy and disclaimer](https://mailchi.mp/tradersnewssource/exciting-report-in-a-hot-sector-coming-tomorrow-649728?e=[UNIQID])",

        "selftext": "Hey gang!\n\nMarkets were cruising for a good portion of the day before pulling back a bit. Really kind of a muted day for the markets as a whole, with the exception of the IWM charging nearly a full percent. That's good for our small caps! With markets stagnating and the VIX rising, tomorrow's market movement will depend on the nonfarm payroll numbers, which are released before the market opens. \n\nSome analysts are expecting the ending of expanded federal unemployment benefits to surge job numbers. If this month's payroll numbers disappoint, I expect next months to obliterate expectations as people will go back to work in some capacity and seasonal hiring will start picking up. \n\nObligatory: these are not stock recommendations, **this does not constitute financial advice - if you need that kind of advice contact your broker**, I'm just analyzing unusual option data, (so if you don't see your favorite stonk, don't take it personally) please do you own DD, replaying the best Star Wars game ever made Knights of the Old Republic (someone commented about this yesterday but it got swept away), etc. etc. etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|STOCK|PRICE|VOLUME (AVG)|CALLS% - PUTS%|MOST ACTIVE|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|BBIG|7.99|458.3K (74K)|89 - 11|Sept 20c (33.7K)|\n|RAAS\\*|5.68|28.4K (681)|86 - 14|Sept 7.5c (11.3K), Sept 5p (2.8K)|\n|KPLT\\*|5.53|96.2K (7.1K)|94 - 6|Sept 7.5c (20K)|\n|NXE\\*|5.44|3.7K (933)|91 - 9|Sept 5c (471)|\n|MMAT\\*|5.76|71.7K (30.1K)|89 - 11|Sept 5c (12.6K)|\n|GSAT|2.08|146.5K (24.1K)|89 - 11|Sept 2.5c (40.4K)|\n|MILE|4.44|43K (3.2K)|96 - 4|Sept 5c (14.6K)|\n|DNN|1.40|37.9K (7.7K)|95 - 5|Oct 2c (8K), Jan 23 2c (6.1K)|\n|INFI|3.82|30.5K (2.8K)|99 - 1|Oct 5c (16.5K)|\n|SWN|4.89|25.2K (7.6K)|89 - 11|Sept 4.5c (9.7K)|\n|PROG|1.05|21.8K (2.5K)|95 - 5|Sept 1c (4.8K), Jan 1.5c (2.9K)|\n|HIPO|4.39|16.1K (2.3K)|57 - 43|Oct 6c (3.1K), Sept 4p (1.9K)|\n|YVR|2.05|12.5K (1.2K)|100 - 0|Sept 2.5c (8.8K)|\n|CRVS|2.72|10.6K (84)|100 - 0|Sept 2.5c (5.3K), Sept 5c (5K)|\n|WTRH|1.28|9.6K (2.5K)|97 - 3|Sept 1.5c (2.2K)|\n|UEC|2.84|8.1K (3.3K)|96 - 4|Sept 2.5c (1.1K)|\n|HMY|3.53|4.9K (1.3K)|88 - 12|Jan 4c (3.7K)|\n|ADTX|1.80|3.8K (1K)|96 - 4|Oct 2.5c (1.5K)|\n|ALZN|3.35|3.7K (1K)|98 - 2|Sept 5c (2.4K)|\n|AMPE|1.73|3.4K (1.5K)|84 - 16|Sept 2c (987)|\n|CBIO|4.75|3.3K (614)|92 - 8|Oct 5c (780)|\n|WWR|3.92|3.1K (1.7K)|95 - 5|Feb 5c (1K)|\n|CRTD|3.37|3K (765)|97 - 3|Sept 5c (1.9K)|\n|JG|2.36|3K (375)|79 - 21|Oct 5c (762)|\n|REPH|2.45|2.9K (569)|99 - 1|Apr 2.5c (1.4K), Apr 7.5c (872), Apr 5c (600)|\n\n\\* denotes the stock started the day below $5/share\n\nNotes:\n\n**BBIG -15%** Experienced the inverse of yesterday, as there wasn't enough gas to keep on the upward pressure. 781.7K calls vs 173.5K puts in the OI heading into the trading session. 407.9K calls, 50.4K puts, and over 105 million shares traded today. BBIG just opened up weekly options, which I'm sure is going to blow up several people's accounts. If you're in the play for the \"proxy\", I wouldn't go with short term options, as theta will eat you alive. OI numbers are starting to shift heavily toward September expiration. \n\n**RAAS +21.8%** Was trading at $5.91 in the mid-day report. No news for the cloud-based communications company from China. Interesting that with a super bullish day, the second most active option are puts. Will they print tomorrow?\n\n**KPLT +15.8%** Was trading at $5.43 in the mid-day report. No news. Very popular stocks across social media right now. \n\n**NXE +10.3%** No news. Apparently uranium demand has been rising for months, according to u/Epraksemet_Nalej**.** Always interesting when a stock has elevated option activity, but one option hardly stands out from the rest. \n\n**MMAT +16%** In the mid-day report, MMAT was trading at $5.18. No news. \n\n**GSAT +11.1%** Was trading at $2.27 in the earlier report.  GSAT filed an 8-K update describing receipt of \"an additional advance payment of $37.5 million from a customer...\". The company will use the funds to repay some debt. Saw some saying \"Is this coming from Apple?\" Most likely no, as Apple isn't a customer of theirs. The Apple news was tied to the iPhone having Qualcomm chips. QCOM is a GSAT customer. \n\n**MILE +6.2%** Traded at $4.41 in the early report. I hate the amount of mail this company sends me. I don't want your pay-per-mile auto insurance, thx.  Big sweeps for ATM calls. \n\n**DNN +8.5%** Was trading at $1.36 in the early report. Again, apparently uranium is entering a super cycle. Multiple large (2,000+) orders for options at the $2 strike in both October and January 2023.\n\n**INFI +6.4%** In the mid-day edition, was trading at $3.80.  Announced they will participate in Wells Fargo's Healthcare Conference and H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference, both virtually. Notable that the most activity is for October calls. \n\n**SWN +4%** In the mid-day edition, was trading at $4.88. Completed acquisition of Indigo Natural Resources and updated 2021 free cash flow guidance. \n\n**PROG +7.4%** Traded at $1.02 in the early report. No news that I could find. Large sweeps for LEAPS. \n\n**HIPO -14.7%.** Traded at $4.38 in the early report. Has fallen 60% since it's SPAC-based IPO in January. Today marks the day private investment in public equity investors are able to unload their shares as per the merger agreement. Still a lot of call traders. \n\n**YVR +12%** Traded at $2.12 in the early report. Has given back 4.8% AH. Signed an agreement to acquire iNDIEFLIX, an \"edutainment\" company. \n\n**CRVS +16.7%** No news that I could find. Half of the unusual volume came from 5,000 bear call spreads with September options - sell the $2.50 call, buy the $5 call for upside protection. \n\n**WTRH -7.25%** Traded at $1.33 in the early report.  Supposedly one of the most shorted penny stocks, but these rumors are unsubstantiated. Perhaps someone can dig up the ortex numbers. \n\n**UEC +10.94%** Traded at $2.78 in the early report. Uranium stocks getting a lot of love today. Through UEC's finviz page I did find an interesting write up about uranium stocks that cited GLJ Research raised its price target on uranium mining company Cameco. The analyst for GLJ sees massive upside for uranium spot prices. Hmm if all of these uranium stocks hopped one one analysts recommendation, will the gains hold/continue or revert back a little bit? Worthwhile to note that the article I pulled this information from was published by notorious hedge fund The Motley Fool, who very well could be short uranium. \n\n**HMY -4.34%** Traded at $3.47 in the early report.  Released earnings either yesterday or the day before, I can't tell (conflicting sources). Two orders each for 1,750 Jan $4 calls under the \"Stock Contingent\" condition. \n\n**ADTX -1.64%** Back on the list after a brief absence. No news. \n\n**ALZN +5.68%** Traded at $3.32 in the early report. No news that I could find. Single order for 1,061 September $5 calls. \n\n**AMPE +6.13%** No news driving option/price movement that I could find. \n\n**CBIO -1.45%** Finally some different stocks other than the March bear call spreads as the most active. No news.  \n\n**WWR +1.29%** No news, and I don't think I've ever heard of this company before. They hold interests in a graphite project in Alabama. Formerly known as Uranium Resources, Inc, so potential Uranium sympathy play? Most popular options are pretty far out, could be a big short hedging their position. \n\n**CRTD -0.59% (+2% AH).** No news that I could find. \n\n**JG +15.12%** I couldn't find a direct reason for JG's big gain today. First time hearing about this Chinese mobile developer service provider. Always interesting when there's elevated option activity but not a single one stands out. \n\n**REPH -0.81%** Traded at $2.55 in the early report.  Apr ratio spreads continue to be the most active. \n\nIf anyone has any questions about anything, by all means, don't hesitate to reach out either here or by DM. I float the DM option out there because you might think something is too embarrassing to ask about, or you're new or whatever, but please just ask someone. Knowledge is the best weapon. \n\n*To reiterate - I DON'T PICK THESE STOCKS. They qualify by having elevated (at least 1.4x) option activity compared to normal. I'll be more than happy to check a stock's option activity for you, but save the \"wHaT aBoUt mY sToNk iTs gOiNg mOoN!\" type comments.* \n\nShout out to \"random ticker comment with no context\" gang!\n\nboom",

The original version can be found [here](https://babbl.substack.com/p/labor-day-weekend-and-more-bullish)\n\n**TLDR:** stock market news sentiment remains significantly bullish for yet another week in a row, driven by optimistic monthly reports released for the month of August and continued upward trends from the SP500 and global cryptocurrency market.\n\n# 1. This Week\u2019s News Sentiment \ud83d\udcf0\n\nAs we commence our first week of Autumn 2021, stock market news remains just as bullish as it was to end the summer. News coverage this week was relatively unchanged in terms of sentiment compared to last week. Overall, the average finance article written this week scored a 0.35 in terms of sentiment (meaning that just over 1-in-3 sentences written about the markets this week leaned optimistically) and a 0.63 in terms of time-sense expressed (meaning that almost 2-in-3 sentences published this week were written in future tense). Here\u2019s a look at the major news events driving the continued all-time high bullish sentiment this past week:\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Stocks: The major U.S. stock indexes traded in a narrow range all week, but the S&amp;P 500 managed to post a modest gain for the second week in a row.1 The NASDAQ outperformed its peers for the second consecutive week while the Dow fell slightly. Despite sustaining a mid-month decline, the S&amp;P 500 recovered to record its seventh positive month in a row, posting a return of about 3% in August. The index reached 12 record closing highs in the month versus 7 in July.\n\n\u20bf Cryptos: Much of this week\u2019s news optimism can be attributed to the continued meteoric rise in cryptocurrency prices. Global cryptocurrency market capitalization grew 11.5% this week to $2.4T dollars to cap off the largest month in history in terms of cryptocurrency trading volume. The majority of crypto-related headlines this week came on the back of Ethereum ($ETH) which rose more than 20% to $3,935.17 per coin this week at the time of this writing; other big crypto movers this week include Solana ($SOL) and Bitcoin ($BTC) as it eyes its first \u201cgolden cross\u201d since May 2020.\n\n\ud83e\udd85 Economy: While news optimism remains relatively high overall, time-sense fell slightly this week as a slew of monthly economic reports were released for the month of August. A private report showed that the U.S. economy recorded its 15th consecutive monthly gain in manufacturing activity in August. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index rose 0.4% to 59.9. Any reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing activity. We also saw August\u2019s monthly job report this week. The economy generated 235,000 new jobs last month, far short of economists\u2019 expectations and trailing gains of nearly 1.1 million in July and 962,000 in June. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2% from 5.4% in July.\n\n# 2. Most Mentioned Tickers \ud83d\udcca\n\nEach week we analyze the number of headlines written about each stock and cryptocurrency. The most mentioned tickers in this week\u2019s news and the tickers with the biggest volume increase compared to last week are shown here: [most mentioned tickers 8/30-9/3](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d976bee-76fb-40f8-b7b7-1a97515e6ff3_1230x753.png)\n\n\ud83c\udf4e Apple ($AAPL): For the second consecutive week, $AAPL was mentioned more in news coverage than any other ticker in finance articles scraped this week. A mainstay of our weekly most-mentioned list, Apple Inc. churns news headlines, whether or not there\u2019s actually significant news to report about the company or its stock. Following the 10-year anniversary of Tim Cook\u2019s tenure as Apple CEO last week \u2014 as part of which he received $750M in $AAPL share value under the terms of his contract \u2014 headlines this week centered around an open letter written to Cook by Apple employees presenting a litany of grievances including concerns about privacy and diversity within the company. Apple also saw headlines from outside the workplace this week, as regulators from around the world mount pressure on the company\u2019s current App Store policy, accusing Apple of exerting too much control (ex. a 30% commission on in-app purchases) on developers who use it to sell products.\n\n\u201cWhat is Apple Thinking?\u201d | The New York Times\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd27 Automatic Data Processing Inc. ($ADP): The ticker with the biggest increase in news headlines this week compared to last week was $ADP. The stock fell a slight -0.86% last week and has now dropped nearly 3% over the past month to $207.38 per share as the company plans to go ex-dividend on September 9th. This means investors who purchase and settle shares of $ADP before this upcoming Thursday will be eligible to receive the company\u2019s $0.93 dividend payment per share, which will be paid out on October 1st. Automatic Data Processing\u2019s previous dividend payment consumed approximately 61% of the company\u2019s free cash flow last year, and while this is in the normal range for most dividend-paying organizations, analysts seem to agree that the decision bodes well for the company\u2019s long-term strategy by freeing up some space on their margins during a relatively lean period in its history as a business. Overall news sentiment for $ADP scored a +41.05% on a scale from -100% to +100%, signaling relatively bullish sentiment to boot over the past week.\n\n\u201cAutomatic Data Processing, Inc. Is About To Go Ex-Dividend, And It Pays A 1.8% Yield\u201d | Yahoo Finance\n\n# 3. Sentiment Winners and Losers \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4e\n\nEach week we summarize the most extreme sentiment scores in the news for each ticker to help you decide where to focus your attention. Here\u2019s a look at which tickers scored the highest (and lowest) in terms of optimism, pessimism, speculation, and reaction expressed in this past week\u2019s news: [most optimistic and pessimistic tickers 8/30-9/3](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29ce2ff0-9cf0-4d9e-b630-893857f80eee_2181x1305.png)\n\n# Sentiment: Most Optimistic\ud83d\ude00 and Pessimistic\ud83d\ude12 Tickers\n\n\ud83d\udcf6 Motorola Solutions Inc. ($MSI): This week\u2019s most optimistic stock in news coverage was Motorola Solutions Inc. (optimism score: 58.9%). $MSI stock rose a mere 0.76% on the week to build on 46.7% growth so far in 2021. Motorola Solutions \u2014 which succeeded Motorola, Inc., following the spinoff of the mobile phone division into Motorola Mobility in 2011 \u2014 has been spoken of with relatively good cheer compared to industry competitors like Qualcomm ($QCOM) and Verizon ($VZ). Much of the optimism has come as a revelation following the company\u2019s Q2 earnings released nearly a month ago on August 5th, in which the company revealed stratospheric annual earnings per share growth of 41% compound. While some may call it an old-fashioned investment in today\u2019s age of \u201ctech-stock blue sky investing\u201d, it\u2019s hard to argue with bonafide profitability like this if you\u2019re investing for the long-term. This week\u2019s most optimistic $MSI article:\n\n\u201cHere's Why I Think Motorola Solutions Is An Interesting Stock\u201d | Simply Wall St.\n\n\ud83d\udc15 Shiba Inu Coin ($SHIB): This week\u2019s most pessimistic (and reactive) ticker in news coverage was Shiba Inu Coin (pessimism score: 29.3%). Even though we saw relatively low amounts of pessimism in this week\u2019s news coverage across the board, $SHIB saw more pessimism expressed in articles this week than any other ticker, as the fringe cryptocurrency reached its lowest price of the past month on Tuesday (a whopping $0.000006735 per coin \u2014 yes, that\u2019s five zeroes after the decimal) as its developers announced that they\u2019d be removing a portion of the existing $SHIB supply from circulation. Though $SHIB price rose considerably heading into the weekend and continues to trend upwards at the time of this writing, it\u2019s still down 11% in value over the past month. Keep in mind that the coin \u2014 which was created in April as a blatant meme and borderline Ponzi scheme in response to the meteoric rise in the price of Dogecoin early this year \u2014 has grown 45x in value since its inception four months ago. In other words: a $1,000 investment in Shiba Inu Coin back in April is now worth somewhere around $42,000. This week\u2019s most pessimistic $SHIB article:\n\n\u201cHow the Shiba Inu Coin Burn is Attempting to Rekindle a Meme\u2019s Magic\u201d | Fast Company\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Time-Sense: Most Speculative\ud83e\udd14\u23e9 and Reactive\ud83d\ude2e\u23ee\ufe0f Tickers: \n\nimage: [most speculative and reactive tickers 8/30-9/3](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9219e3f-a6d0-4987-8b31-8e3d32fc3bfd_2203x1315.png)\n\n\ud83d\udd0b FirstEnergy Corp. ($FE): The stock with the most speculative (ie. future-tense) sentiment measured in the news coverage this week was FirstEnergy (speculation score: 95.4%). $FE stock 2.86% this week to $39.59 to cap a 34.16% run in share price year-to-date as the energy utility company has benefited from improving electricity demand in recent months. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. retail electricity sales are likely to inch up 2.7% in 2021 after sliding 3.9% in 2020. Given the growth in demand, coupled with FirstEnergy\u2019s 96.5% earnings growth this year and given that its stock is still trading 52.8% below its estimated fair value (according to Simply Wall St.), analysts speculate that its stock is set to remain a handsome mid- to long-term investment. Analysts also cite $FE\u2019s 14% return on equity (ROE) as a reassuring sign that the company is growing in value and effectively managing investors\u2019 money. This week\u2019s most speculative $FE article:\n\n\u201cShould You Be Excited About FirstEnergy Corp.'s 14% Return On Equity?\u201d | Simply Wall St.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udc5c PVH Corp. ($PVH): The stock with the most reactive (ie. past-tense) sentiment measured in the news coverage this week was PVH Corp. (reaction score: 53.6%). $PVH stock price stair-stepped up 5.12% to $118.84 per share on Wednesday following the release of its Q2 earnings report, which beat consensus analyst earnings and laid out an upbeat outlook for the remainder of the year. The company (formerly known as Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation) is one of the world\u2019s largest clothing conglomerates and owner/licenser of brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Kenneth Cole New York, and Michael Kors. PVH Corp announced quarterly earnings per share of $2.72 \u2014 crushing analyst estimates $1.52 \u2014 and posted revenue growth of 46% YoY to $2.31 billion as consumers begin to return to their pre-pandemic apparel shopping habits. Following the beat-and-raise report, analysts at JPMorgan and Credit Suisse both announced increased price targets for $PVH. The most reactive $PVH article this week:\n\n\u201cPVH, IBD Stock Of Day, Breaks Out As Calvin Klein Owner's Earnings Beat\u201d | Investor\u2019s Business Daily\n\n# Biggest Mood Swings and Changes \ud83c\udfad\ud83d\udd00\n\nEach week we compare the sentiment of each ticker to its sentiment from the previous week. Presented below are the tickers that saw the biggest change in each of our four sentiment metrics this week compared to last: [image](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68ffb0c2-1e95-4b38-b913-cf5a9e81061e_2038x769.png)\n\n\ud83d\udcbd Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) saw the largest increase in optimism expressed this week compared to last week after $AMD stock broke resistance above $109 per share early in the week; analysts at Benzinga say the stock has now settled into its second bullish pattern of the past month. On Wednesday, it was reported the U.S. Department of Energy was nearing a deal worth $500 million to purchase a supercomputer made with AMD and NVIDIA Corp.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Coinbase Inc. ($COIN) recorded the largest increase in pessimism expressed this week despite the stock rallying 8.62% to $278.44 per share. This increase in pessimism can be widely attributed to a handful of contrarian, negative articles published by the likes of the Motley Fool and SeekingAlpha arguing that the underlying volatility of digital assets makes Coinbase an inherently risky stock to invest in.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Hewlett Packard Enterprises Co. ($HPE) posted the biggest increase in speculative language expressed this week compared to last as the stock remained relatively flat over the trading period, rising just 0.06% to $15.67 per share. Much of the speculation surrounding the company\u2019s lackluster earnings report released early in the week, in which the company\u2019s continued supply chain issues showed through. Analysts wonder if HP\u2019s component supply concerns will continue.\n\n\ud83d\udc89 Moderna Inc. ($MRNA) received the biggest increase in reactive language expressed after increasing in stock price by more than 13% to $416.70 per share on strong trading volume and new research released this week suggesting that the company\u2019s COVID-19 shot may offer longer-lasting protection that Pfizer\u2019s amid growing conversation about the importance (or lack thereof) of booster shots.\n\n# 4. Market Mood Outlook \ud83c\udf21\ufe0f\ud83d\udd2d\n\nThis past week brought a close to the month of August and commenced the unofficial start of Fall 2021. In terms of market action, August was the 7th consecutive month of stock market growth, and the largest month in history in terms of cryptocurrency trade volume. This past week was no exception to the tremendous momentum in both realms, and news sentiment reflected this: stock market news articles published this week saw more optimism expressed on average than any other week this year except for one (the first week of August, the height of Q2 earnings).\n\nLooking ahead into September and October, the extreme optimism is showing no signs of slowing down as Wall Street expectations for the next stock market earnings season continue to rise. Over July and August, forecasts for third-quarter earnings of companies in the S&amp;P 500 rose 3.8%, according to FactSet. That\u2019s the fourth-largest such increase during the first two months of a quarter since 2009.\n\nWhile market bulls are currently reveling in the continued outperforms of stocks, market bears may be quick to point out that we are growing more and more due for some sort of correction. The S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t suffered a 5% pullback since October 2020. The last time the index experienced such a long period without a big drop was from June 2016 to early February 2018. With that in mind, we will continue to watch the progression of international economic factors like the COVID-19 Delta variant and the transition to Taliban rule in Afghanistan for any inkling of adverse impact on the U.S. stock market. That\u2019s all for today\u2019s report; good luck this week everyone, and thanks for reading. \ud83d\ude4f",

        "selftext": " Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report \"Global AI in Computer Vision Market By Offering, By Machine Learning Model, By Function, By Application, By End User, By Regional Outlook, COVID-19 Impact Analysis Report and Forecast, 2021 - 2027\" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p06131405/?utm\\_source=GNW  \nThe AI in a computer or a computer-enabled robotic system makes it capable to manage information and generate results in decision making, learning, and solving problems. The results are produced in such a manner that they are quite similar to the thought process of humans.  \n\n\nComputer vision is one of the domains of computer science. It is focused on reproducing the intricacy of the human vision system. This enables the computers to recognize and process objects from the presented images and videos in a similar manner like humans. As a huge amount of data is generated on daily basis, it is important to have the application of computer vision. Therefore, it is the key catalyst for the growth of computer vision. The precision rates of object detection have been improving with superior and advanced hardware and algorithms in computer vision. The percentage of accuracy reached from 50% to 99%, so computers are responding more quickly to visual inputs as compared to humans.  \n\n\nThe increasing need for automation and quality inspection, growing demand for computer vision systems in non-conventional applications are the major factors driving the growth of the AI in computer vision market. Moreover, the increasing need for ASICs is also expected to boost the growth of the market. Similarly, favorable policies and government initiatives to support industrial integration and adoption of AI into the edge devices are likely to create new growth avenues for the market players. However, increasing security concerns associated with cloud-based image processing and analytics are likely to restraint market growth.  \n\n\nCOVID-19 Impact  \n\n\nThe sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 has impacted various industries. Though, it had a negligible impact on AI in the computer vision market. The outbreak of the COVID-19 has caused a major impediment to the export-oriented economies from a regional point of view. It is due to the temporary closure of manufacturing units. For example, the automotive industry of Germany has been rigorously affected because most of the automobile trade in this region takes place with China and Italy. Apart from the issues related to imports and exports, the manufacturing industry growth in Germany has also been hampered by the shutdown of manufacturing plants and reduces speed in operations in order to curb the spread of COVID-19.  \n\n\nOffering Outlook  \n\n\nBased on Offering, the market is segmented into Software and Hardware. Hardware segment is further bifurcated across Processor, Memory and Storage. The software segment would exhibit highest growth rate during the forecast period.

The CRM stock was from the result of Slack acquisition. \n\nFor Intel, I'm waiting to see how their big.Little CPUs and ARC GPUs will perform in reviews. If the reviews are good, I'm going big in Intel. There is usually a huge lag between a reviews of CPUs/GPUs to Wallstreet reacting. For example, AMD Zen2 was going to be a massive success if you read the reviews. Wallstreet didn't react until many months later. In addition, the government will keep Intel alive no matter what because they need a domestic chip manufacturer. Lookout for a ton of government subsidies to Intel.\n\nFor Qualcomm, I'm betting that their Nuvia acquisition will allow them to move into the laptop/desktop market but it's a small bet right now. Again, I will wait for reviews of their first Nuvia product before deciding if I want to buy more because of the lag between reviews and Wallstreet reacting.\n\nSo far, I've beaten S&amp;P500 last year and this year so far.",

        "selftext": "Matterport will create a digital clone of our world for the metaverse.\n\nBefore I explain how, check out my previous DD posts for some context.  \n[MTTR Bringing 3D Photogrammetry Experiences](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ou2ap9/mttr_bringing_3d_photogrammetry_experiences_to/)  \n[MTTR Explosive Potential](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3469k/mttr_update_explosive_avenues_of_potential/)\n\nNow, you\u2019re probably wondering \u201cWhat is the metaverse u/cru3211?\u201d\n\nLet me tell you.\n\n# The Metaverse\n\nThe **metaverse** is a paradigm shift in the way we organize ourselves as a society. It\u2019s an evolutionary embodiment of technology &amp; the internet. It\u2019s commonly envisioned as a \u201csecond layer\u201d to our world. Sort of like\u2026 a virtual clone of it\u2026 that\u2019s digitized. See where this is going?\n\nThis is the **spatial web**. It represents an emerging three-dimensional web experience. It\u2019ll blow the old internet out of the water.\n\nresearch: metaverse, web 3.0, and spatial web for more insights.\n\nMSG me and I\u2019ll ramble more about the metaverse. For now, just understand that it\u2019s an inevitable innovation that will see widespread growth within the next decade. Matterport is likely (but not guaranteed) to be a part of this evolution.\n\n# Government Contract\n\nMatterport has entered the public sector to digitize the valuable assets of the US government.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201cThrough the use of Matterport\u2019s technology, federal agencies will be  \nable to *digitize and index* government facilities, infrastructure and  \nother assets such ***as airplanes, ships and submarines.\u201d***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n\u201cFor example, in the event of an emergency, digital twins of  \n**buildings, roads, bridges, tunnels, water supplies or electrical grids** can be instantly viewed and analyzed by authorized users to  \nrespond more efficiently\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n\u201cAccess to 3D digital twins and the spatial data behind them can fuel  \na multitude of use cases such as **emergency response, military**  \n**training and historical preservation**.\u201d - George Hoyem at In-Q-Tel\n\nHow could you not be bullish? They\u2019re creating a private searchable 3D database. This is immensely powerful. Imagine being able to visualize the entire underground infrastructure of NYC without having to dig everything up? \n\n# Collaboration Tool\n\nYou know how on Google docs you can live collaborate with other users on a doc? I use it all the time. Matterport just added that for digital twins. That leads me to my next point.\n\n# Prediction:\n\nI\u2019ve come to believe that Google will want Matterport. I have no evidence of this, it\u2019s just a feeling. This is because the two companies align in a variety of ways. (I guess Google could just develop their own tech, but I just feel like they might take the easy route and acquire.)\n\n* Google Earth has exteriors of 3D buildings, but not interiors. Imagine how Matterport\u2019s 3D dataset could be utilized for that tool?\n* Matterport and Google are both platform companies with a focus on big data and indexing that data.\n* Google Real-estate searching was removed about a decade ago, but what if this was the catalyst for them to bring it back. I predict that Google will bring back real estate searching but integrate it with 3D interactive experiences.\n* Google\u2019s AI research could be fueled by Matterport\u2019s datasets.\n* Matterport could be integrated with Google\u2019s suite of apps.\n\n**My positions:**  \n100 shares at $14.
