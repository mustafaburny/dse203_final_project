        "selftext": "Hi guys! I\u2019ve been tinkering around with a theoretical portfolio and planning to make it my majority holdings in the foreseeable future. Do chip in your thoughts about it!\n\nAAPL - 5.57%\nMSFT - 10.44%\nAMZN - 9.52%\nFB - 9.17%\nGOOG - 6.91%\nNVDA - 10.3%\nADBE - 13.54%\nASML - 9.07%\nTSM - 7.48%\nV - 9.35%\nMA - 8.64%\n\nI think majority of the stock selections are pretty mainstream, picked to mimic QQQ. I personally added TSM and ASML as I\u2019m a strong believer in semiconductors going forward.\n\nWhat differentiates the portfolio above and QQQ is the weights itself. Instead of adjusting it based on market cap, I\u2019ve decided to optimise the weights above with a sole focus - to maximise Sortino Ratio.\n\nBacktested portfolio since Sept 2012 vs QQQ:\nCAGR - 36.71% vs 20.06%\nStDev - 16.97% vs 14.97%\nBest Year - 57.78% vs 38.96%\nWorst Year - 5.52% vs -3.63%\nSortino Ratio - 4.17 vs 2.28\n\nBy analysing the numbers above, it\u2019s basically a less diverse portfolio with 11 holdings, higher StdDev but significantly higher returns, and a much more efficient fund. Even the worst year for it is still a positive return. \n\nYes I\u2019m aware that my findings are based on historical prices and it doesn\u2019t guarantee future returns",

        "selftext": "Since everyone has been talking about investing in SQ, I thought maybe we could start an open discussion about the risks of Square the business, whether or not we can continue to expect a skyrocketing share price in the years to come.\n\nI'll point out some things I'm iffy about, would like to get feedback on what you all think. Maybe there's things I'm not aware of.\n\n* Competitors. Square has a good product in an explosive growth industry, but I see their products easily replicable by Apple, Google, and PayPal. Should their business prove to have high demand and margins, there's no doubt FAANG giants will follow. Square has a head start, but do they have a competitive advantage? They have lots of commercial business data atm, but I'm doubtful of the value of that in today's market (more on that in my next point). They're beginning to collect consumer data, but imagine how much more data Visa and Mastercard has over them on that. Their technology is easily replicable by other big companies with enough resources to execute.\n* The limitations of the loan business. One of Square's most promising competitive advantages is that they provide loans to small businesses that show promising growth and room for expansion based on their revenue and profit which is logged into the Square system. There is an undeniable market of unserved small business owners that greatly benefit from this feature, but it's doubtful that this would unleash profits that wouldn't hit a low ceiling most of the time. For example, a hair salon can only purchase so many new salon chairs before they run out of customers to serve within that vicinity. Square could strike gold with a really profitable revolutionary small business, but I don't see why those businesses wouldn't be funded by VC's first before coming to Square. Even if they came to Square first, those businesses are one in a million. I do see Square making profits here, but not profits that would take them out of a niche player role.\n* The limitations of commercial business data. With current data limitations, it's impossible for Square's current technology to be an efficient evaluator of which businesses can achieve explosive growth and which ones will never escape low margins. There are too many non-numerical variables in determining a profitable business. Data technology and AI is not there yet.\n* Personal finance inertia. For Square to disrupt the banking industry, they need some clear advantage over banks. Why should we do the extra work of switching over if we are at an established bank? I'm not saying Square wouldn't be a better option than a traditional bank, but it takes a lot to turn the tide in an industry as conservative as the banking industry.\n\nFeel free to refute any of these concerns, maybe there's something really compelling to Square that I'm not seeing. If I'm wrong, I'd love to know.",

        "selftext": "So we've done pretty good in the last week and in yesterday's alerts with multiple alerts panning out really well e.g **$AAPL, $MELI, $SRNE, $NVAX, $SQ, $NKLA, $KNDI, $NFLX. $PDD** etc. I also posted a [detailed spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fT2P9JKxmnyZFFXEOl9QWBsqAqzTwYi-UXSPJ2InECw/edit?usp=sharing) with results from the last week. We had an accuracy of **75%** last week. Some alerts like **$TDOC** also did not pan out yesterday which just shows that the tool is not 100% perfect.\n\nThe tool is still very new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes.\n\nBullish    means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the current     close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means the stock is  expected to stay the same or go low in the next few days.\n\n# Bullish Alerts\n\n**$ILMN** \\- Bullish probability of 88.43%. I know this dropped hard today but the tool is bullish on it. If it starts to go back, it will be a good setup. If it continue going down, don't get in. **Risky setup, careful!**\n\n**$NVAX** \\- Bullish probability of 77.14%. I like that it dropped today. Either get in if it touches the support at $160 and bounces back or get in on a pull back at the moving averages ([https://i.imgur.com/EXdP8y1.png](https://i.imgur.com/EXdP8y1.png))\n\n**$LULU** \\- Bullish probability of 74.80%. Seems like a good setup, especially with a small pullback ([https://i.imgur.com/5misOTH.png](https://i.imgur.com/5misOTH.png))\n\n**$FSLY** \\- Bullish probability of 74.46%. This dropped right at its 50 MA. A good setup as long as the price stays above 50MA ([https://i.imgur.com/GS9bBot.png](https://i.imgur.com/GS9bBot.png)). Exit otherwise.\n\n# Bearish Alerts\n\n**$BAC** \\-  Bearish probability of 86.76%. I like it for a bearish setup if it can below the support of $25.2 ([https://i.imgur.com/wAiBWbo.png](https://i.imgur.com/wAiBWbo.png)).\n\n**$ZNGA** \\-  Bearish probability of 83.96%. This is at a very strong support level at $9.9. **Do not get in unless it breaks the support** ([https://i.imgur.com/kUJuBgr.png](https://i.imgur.com/kUJuBgr.png)).\n\n**$GILD** \\-  Bearish probability of 82.68%. Might go up a bit before going down further. Healthcare stocks are risky though so be careful.\n\n**$WDC** \\-  Bearish probability of 82.66%. Only a good setup if price stays below the support level of $37.8 ([https://i.imgur.com/8ky7k3v.png](https://i.imgur.com/8ky7k3v.png))\n\n \n\n**Note:**  A lot of time has gone into these tools and it takes time to write  these alerts, look at    charts, and post them here. Would love for you  guys to **try out our** [discord](https://discord.gg/X2hHeJ) **channel** where I post alerts from various tools, not just the options one. Please hit me up if you want to link, it's free to join.\n\n**If you don't like these alerts, please don't be a hater, just ignore them. They are not perfect and I know that.**",

        "selftext": "Hello! Would really appreciate if I could get your feedback on my current portfolio / any advice on how to improve :)\n\nA bit of background on myself: I am 29 years old from Singapore and had put in about half my savings into 'safe' Singapore stocks pre-COVID (mainly local banks and the STI ETF) because my friends / family recommended that I do this (instead of leaving my money in the bank) years back when I was just starting out and had absolutely 0 knowledge about investing. I am currently down about US$11k but plan to keep the $ in for long term anyway.\n\nOnly at the height of COVID, some time in March, did I turn my attention to overseas exchanges (big regret starting so late). Since then I have pumped in about US$85k and to date I am up around US$14k overall. I mainly started with small positions to test the waters but added to my positions / bought new stocks over the last 4 months.\n\nThis is my current portfolio w rough stock weightage:\n\nSE 21% FVRR 13% PINS 8% NIO 7% TCEHY 7% AMZN 4% NFLX 4% BABA 3% GOOGL 3% FB 2% PDD 2% JD 2% ATVI 2% DIS 2% WDAY 2% MA 2% XOM 2% BP 2% V 1% MCD 1% AIR 1% KO 1% HLT 1% MAR 1% CINE 1% CCL 1% NCLH 1% DAL 1% PLAY 1% UAA 1%\n\nDisclaimer:\n\n* I know I have far too many stocks and am spread WAY too thin... have been wanting to trim and consolidate for a while. Admittedly I didn't really know what I was doing at the beginning and just bought small positions in many stocks :'(\n* I got greedy and bought some really bad stocks during the early June offline rally (i.e. airlines, cruises and PLAY) and I am kicking myself now. But hoping not to sell off any at a loss if possible to hold longer and wait for spikes\n* I am extremely bullish on tech, esp e-comm (clearly), mainly because I have been working in this industry and closely following big tech since I graduated from uni. Witnessed and experienced first-hand the rapid growth of e-comm in Southeast Asia and am very aware of the untapped potential. Unfortunately I had neither the foresight nor the gall to buy these stocks earlier\u2026\n* All the money I have invested has been accrued from years of working, saving, and being stingy lol + profits from a small e-comm side business I run -- none from my parents!",
