        "selftext": "**Calling the great options brains!**    \n In preparation for next week, I scanned the earnings calendar and I picked 11 stocks based on market cap and options volume.   \nThen, I created this sheet where I analysed the previous earnings move of the stocks as well as the expected move from MarketChameleon.   \nI, then, adjusted the expected move to reflect the worst-case scenarios.    \nAfter that, I looked at the delta of each lower and higher strike of the expected move range and came up with suggested Iron Condors for some (5 of them). The rest are either too low in profit or wide bid/ask spread.     \n**Please note the following:**    \n1. The expected move will change in value as the trading week begins. (The sheet has formulas and will update itself).    \n2. The delta is based on the last close price. I will have to update that manually as the market opens.   \n   \n3. I intend on buying ICs (For credit of course) 1-2 hours before the earnings announcements and close the trade at the IV crush. For example, if the earnings are on Tuesday BMO, I will open the trade on Monday (1-2 hours before market close). If the earnings are on Tuesday AMC, I will open the trade on the same day (1-2 hours before market close).    \n4. My approach in these ICs is to play it as safe as possible. As a consequence, both max profit and loss are relatively small.  5. Feel free to create an editable copy of this sheet.     \n\n\nThe reason why I'm sharing this sheet is that I value your feedback. **I am by no means encouraging anyone to use these suggested trades** as some values will change as the market opens.    \n\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SwuLwerRVl9XtTN4mMVp2niNLqVW-HgJv6aKN7xcOhg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SwuLwerRVl9XtTN4mMVp2niNLqVW-HgJv6aKN7xcOhg/edit?usp=sharing)",

        "selftext": "Big bank earnings will continue to crash the market, particularly tech, this week, as I mentioned in my previous posts. Expect the market to slide Wednesday and Thursday too, though probably not as much.\n\nAmazon calls are gonna be DIRT CHEAP on Friday 7/17. Remember, they post earnings 7/23 AMC. Here's your play for bigly tendies:\n\n1. Long 7/24 OTM AMZN calls on Friday 7/17. This is a no brainer. There's gonna be a YUGE run-up in anticipation of earnings\n\n2. Sell calls 7/23 10 minutes before market closes. Wait, what? Why sell just before earnings? BECAUSE THE EARNINGS ARE GONNA BE SHIT.\n\nBezos doesn't want to seem like he's profiting from a pandemic. Clearly Amazon's revenue will be YUGE this quarter from shopping and from AWS. He's gonna blow Amazon's cash so that costs are really high.\n\nProtestors set up guillotine outside his mansion: https://www.fox5dc.com/news/protesters-set-up-guillotine-outside-of-jeff-bezos-dc-home\n\nBezos announces huge one-time bonus for Amazon employees right before the end of Q2 (LAST MINUTE INCREASE IN COSTS TO LOWER PROFITS): https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/29/tech/amazon-bonuses-frontline-workers/index.html - fyi, this bonus adds up to ~$5 billion cost.\n\nThank me later. No, AMZN won't crash from earnings, but it will NOT go up much at all. If you're super ballsy you could even sell calls Thursday 7/23 at the end of trading",

        "selftext": "I am a college student who is interested in investing and am working on a summer project to make investing, specifically long-term investing in stocks, more accessible to the everyday person.\n\nAs part of this project, I wanted to brainstorm and breakdown companies using a simple, systemic framework that is easily understood and digested by beginners while still allowing them to see the bigger picture. It is not to learn about every single detail about a company, but to share/record relevant information for someone to invest for the long-term.\n\nThis framework consists of analyzing a company's competitive advantages (moats), potential, risks, and valuation.\n\nThis is probably common knowledge to you guys but I'm just going to breakdown the categories for consistency and clarity.\n\nMoats:\n\n* Low-cost producer Ex: Walmart can undercut the prices of local grocery stores because of their efficient supply system and the fact that they buy their products in bulk.\n* High Switching Costs: When switching from Apple products to Android products, it is notoriously difficult to transfer files and photos from one device to the other.\n* Network Effect: As more people join Facebook, the platform becomes more valuable because users now have more people to connect and interact with.\n* Intangible Assets: Brands, (patents, trademarks, and copyrights), government approvals, or a geographic advantage. Ex: Starbucks can charge a high price for its coffee products and thus make lots of profit because they can uphold their brand reputation so effectively.\n* Efficient Scale or toll moat: Only a few players can enter a market and be successful. Mastercard's competitors, namely Visa, have no interest in undercutting Mastercard as doing so would only hurt their profits and margins. Instead, they function in a healthy, stable\u00a0duopoly\u00a0to preserve their market share and profits. This grants high barriers to entry for any company trying to enter the payment network space.\n\nPotential:\n\nThis section is to be filled with various reasons that the company is expected to grow in the foreseeable future. This is great for identifying if a company seems to have the ability to grow for the long haul. Below are various categories/examples of potential:\n\n* Product Potential: If a company can continuously innovate and make revolutionary breakthroughs/innovations in their products. Ex: Tesla's cars are improving every year with better batteries and a self-driving system that makes itself better the more data it acquires.\n* Market Potential: If a company can expand its market to new horizons. Ex: The iPhone SE has allowed Apple to start making the iPhone more accessible to the middle class, effectively allowing them to access a new part of the cellular device market due to its lower price point.\n* Business Model Potential: Changing the business model to ensure that the company keeps its footing within the industry. Ex: Boeing transitioned from making the majority of their revenue selling aircraft to servicing/repairing them.\n\nRisks:\n\nVarious risks go along with any company, and I believe that correctly identifying and evaluating these can make or break whether a company is a worthy long-term investment or not. These risks can be broken up into two distinct categories: external and internal risks. That is, risks that happen outside of a company versus risks that come from within.\n\nA couple of external risk examples include:\n\n* Competition: Samsung went from having 20% marketshare in China vs. 1% in just five years because of the likes of huawei, xiaomi etc.   \n* Government Regulations and Restrictions: Since Lockheed-Martin, a private military contractor, has its biggest client as the US government, their revenue that comes internationally can come to a halt it the US government decides to sanction a country that makes up a significant portion of their international revenue.\n* Unforeseen Event Risk: COVID-19 has been detrimental to the majority of businesses. AMC theaters, for example, have forced AMC theaters to close all of their theaters until further notice, which has stopped all of their revenue.\n\nA couple of internal risk examples include:\n\n* High Debt: Since AT&amp;T has recently acquired both DirecTV and Time-Warner, they have a high amount of debt (around $160 billion) that will take a substantial amount of time to pay off, and it must be predicted whether or not they will pay it off.\n* Concentrated Revenue: Since around 50% of Apple's revenue comes from their iPhone sales, if their sales were greatly reduced, this would be detrimental to the company's revenue.\n\nValuation: Any methods/metrics that seem relevant plus an approximate margin of safety price\n\nHere is an example of my own breakdown on Apple:  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xr790iG6U3xQbUJ5sVKYRBXyhTVpQV\\_Sdkb5S55LbY0/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xr790iG6U3xQbUJ5sVKYRBXyhTVpQV_Sdkb5S55LbY0/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**\\*** These categories (especially for potential and risks) are by no means the only ones available, and I would greatly appreciate it if anyone can think up of any other effective categories for any of the four company factors that I listed above. Also, is this system flawed and ineffective, and if so, how and where is it ineffective?**\\***\n\nThank you for reading this far. If you have any questions or if anything is unclear, don't hesitate to ask. I am openly looking for constructive criticism, so any sort of feedback will be extremely helpful. Or if you want to share something similar of your own I would love to get this thread going. :)",

        "selftext": "Long time lurker, first time poster here to tell you retards that you've been sleeping on CNK. I've looked through WSB and haven't noticed many recent posts on Cinemark so I figured I'd start one.\n\nFrom Yahoo Finance profile: Cinemark Holdings, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, engages in the motion picture exhibition business. As of February 10, 2020, it operated 548 theatres with 6,082 screens in 41 states of the United States, Brazil, and Argentina, as well as 13 other Latin American countries. The company was founded in 1984 and is headquartered in Plano, Texas.\n\nPros:\n-Healthy balance sheet. Cinemark has enough cash to survive even if permanently closed through end of 2021.\n-Cinemark's movie theaters can function profitably at low (25-30%) capacity. \n-Cinemark will likely gain marketshare as a result of AMC's dire financial situation/possible bankruptcy. AMC was already heavily indebted pre-corona and recently took on additional debt to stave off bankruptcy.\n-There was Amazon hype about possible acquisition of AMC, but in my opinion Cinemark is a much better acquisition option: better balance sheet (way less debt and higher profit margins), audience that may not be captured already by Amazon Prime video, still very large market share in US, ranks as the 3rd largest movie theater chain in the word, etc.\n-reached close to $20 share price recently before 2nd wave hype pushed it all the way down to ~$10.5. Currently sits at ~$12.5\n-reopening all theaters July 24th\n\nCons:\n-coronavirus cases developing adversely, which risks postponing openings/movie screenings further. Particularly worrying is exposure to Latam (accounts for 15-20% of revenues) because Brazil is fucked right now.\n-new blockbuster movies delayed to July 31st +\n\n\nIF you disagree, FUCK YOU. But also, why?\n\ntldr; long shares or long dated OTM calls for guaranteed profit\nmy positions: 6800 shares at avg cost of $12.5 and 100 7/17 $15 calls because they're cheap and i'm not a pussy\n\ndislosure: this is not financial advice, just my opinions. do your own research before you jump in",

Its valuation is only slightly above $1 billion, making it a relative bargain, it is solidly profitable, and it trades at a trailing P/E ratio of just around 4.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Boeing**\n\nNot a great week for Boeing $BA.

My Size offers online retailers innovative measurement and sizing solutions to reduce expensive returns triggered by size errors. It\u2019s a high risk nanocap with a market capitalization of just $8 million yet has huge potential with its patent protected MySizeID solution that has been licensed by platforms, including Shopify and Lightspeed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hepion Pharmaceuticals (warning HIGHLY SPECULATIVE)**\n\nHepion Pharmaceuticals %HEPA announced on Tuesday that its clinical phase, CRV431, was efficacious in two preclinical research models related to COVID-19.

And who will go to the theater?\nAMC will have to operate at half capacity, but another question is what was the average capacity prior to Covid? I am unable to find an article passed on this stat. If average capacity was less then 50% in the first place that doesn\u2019t hold value but I truly haven\u2019t been to a theater in a very long time. \nBig action films I also can\u2019t imagine will begin production such as your marvels, your Disney\u2019s movies? It could also play a similar role in the industry as sports where filming could restart but actors and actresses do not want to begin for health concerns. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on AMC and shorting?",

        "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm a new investor here, and a Canadian.\n\n**A bit of a background:**\n\nI have approximately 57k held in a TFSA account of a big bank, out of which 50k was foolishly deposited into an account because I was able to get free trades during a promo. I haven't touched that 50k and it's just sitting there...The other 7k is in mutual funds and I'm extremely displeased with the returns. I had initially started it back in 2011 and have only got approximately $1k return in the past 9 years!\n\nSo, this brings me to today. I found out that we have a free trading platform similar to RobinHood, called Wealthsimple. You can't do much besides buying and selling the traditional way (as far as I'm aware). For instance, you can't buy/sell options, have margin accounts, and if you buy and sell US stocks, you'll have to immediately convert the funds into Canadian dollars as there's no way to keep it in US dollars (Wealthsimple doesn't have a US account yet).\n\nI'm OK with all of this as I know very little about making fancy trades.\n\nCurrently, I'm watching some Canadian stocks: Husky Energy and Cenovus Energy (both oil and gas companies), Air Canada, Cineplex (one of our biggest theatre/cinema akin to AMC in the US) and Bombardier. All of these companies took a major hit in mid-March where their stocks plunged.\n\n**What I'm interested in:**\n\nHSE (Husky) and Bombardier are under $5. In fact, Bombardier is under 50c. I'm thinking of investing in Bombardier because even though they're bleeding, they've sold off some of their businesses off (railway to Alstom in France and airplane-manufacturing to Airbus) and are trying to streamline. Secondly, they're one of the biggest employers of Quebec and one of the prominent companies in Canada and part of the country's heritage and pride.\n\nSo, this brings me to the next question: I've read in this sub and beyond that when a company declares bankruptcy, a lot of times their stock jumps up for a day or two. Should I try to buy as much stock as possible (for Bombardier) and hope to cash in during the surge?  Secondly, what are the chances that the Canadian government, which has bailed out many large companies numerous times before will let Bombardier sink this time?",
