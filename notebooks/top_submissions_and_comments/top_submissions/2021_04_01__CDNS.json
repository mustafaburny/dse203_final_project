        "selftext": "I was fortunate enough to meet with Abel Avellan along with other investors recently. I wanted to share my notes with the reddit community to help clear up a lot of confusion and misinformation out there. \n\nDisclaimer:  I am not a financial advisor ... do your own due diligence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***BlueWalker-3 Deployment:***\n\n* BlueWalker-3 will have the full technology stack implemented\n   * 10 meters x 10 meters array and has ability to connect directly to handset and provide streaming, voice, data\n   * Have tested apps on core networks of Vodafone, AT&amp;T, Rakuten and some other telcos in Africa\n   * Have interconnectivity with telcos setup and ready for launch\n* Using two vendors, one is Rakuten\u2019s Altiostar that is the interface with the carrier\u2019s network \n* Designed service so AST doesn\u2019t need to modify current mobile phone in any way\n* After you get a text message to opt in, your phone takes over and you won\u2019t know if you are connected to a satellite or a tower\n* BlueWalker-3 is 1.5 ton satellite the size of a pickup truck\n   * Will be launched this year from Kazakhstan \n   * The profile of the satellite is very thin, like a table and built in modules\n* The deployment of BlueWalker-3 is the final production of all the development that has gone into the technology.  After the successful launch we will go immediately into producing 20 satellites for first phase of launch\n* The biggest risk?  I put in context this way.  Connecting to a phone from a satellite is nothing new.  This has happened for 25 years.  Satellite phones are bulky and proprietary.  The premise of what we do is that EVERY phone today is part of our market.\n* Satellite phone is 1 watt of power and 3DBI of gain and bulky\n* An iPhone today is 0.25 watt of power and \u00bd DBI of gain\n* Difference is the satellite phones connect to a satellite that is a couple hundred kilograms, whereas our satellites are 1.5-2 tons and have all the power and gain to connect to a regular handset\n* The satellite will fly at 600 kilometers\n* The full production satellite will be larger, 20 meters x 20 meters array and will be a little bit heavier \n* Building satellite with modules called microns which are elements that form the phase array \n* Built the tech ourselves in Israel, but will be outsourcing future production to NEC in Japan - but all the tech is our IP and the final production and assembly will be done in Midland TX\n\n***Utilizing Wireless Carrier Partner\u2019s Spectrum:***\n\n* We will be using lowband, midband and c-band.  We have the ability to tune into any cellular spectrum 700-950mhz, 1700-2200mhz and C-Band \n* Our ability to utilize a carrier\u2019s spectrum is software-defined, so we can tune per beam per cell into multiple different bands.  So we have total flexibility\n* We don\u2019t own the spectrum, we partner with AT&amp;T, Vodafone, Telefonica, American Movil, etc to use their spectrum where it isn\u2019t lit up (used) and then interconnect that spectrum to our gateways via B-Band 45Ghz (satellite backhaul).\n* You have a field of view which is the area a satellite can see which is 2,800 kilometers (not sure if this is the right number), within each of the field of view you have cells which is the equivalent to a tower. \n   * So for a satellite you can have 2,800 cells in low band and 10,000 cells in midband\n* All these cells are in the frequencies that are native to current mobile phones.  We don\u2019t want to modify current phones.  We want users to be able to access SpaceMobile from responding to a text message \n* All the native cellular spectrum is used which then gets translated to the B-Band spectrum down to the gateway where we have eNodeB and rack of equipment that then connect to the carrier\u2019s network\n* In the US we only need 2 gateways, but we will be using 3 gateways in carrier neutral locations of American Tower.\n* 1 East Coast, 1 in Midland and 1 in Hawaii\n\n***Mobile Users Covered by a Cell:***\n\n* Depends on what spectrum is being used, but it\u2019s between 300 - 10,000 users based on how much overbooking you are putting on the spectrum and what packages you are offering\n* Roughly per satellite we can produce 1.6 million gigabytes per month. If you were to allocate 1 gigabyte to each user that\u2019s 1.6 million subscribers. \n   * But in the equatorial areas where we are charging $1 or less, you can multiply those subscribers by 10x.  In the US if you\u2019re charging $25/year, then you give people more data. \n   * High end market is for people moving in and out of connectivity\n      * If you\u2019re in the home you use WiFi\n      * If you\u2019re in coverage area you use your current carrier plan\n      * If you move out of coverage you will connect to SpaceMobile. If you\u2019re on a plane or driving to the hamptons or going to a cabin in a remote location, you would connect to SpaceMobile.\n   * The other part of the opportunity is people who don\u2019t have internet or phone\n      * We are starting with this market in the equatorial countries\n\n***Working with Vodafone and AT&amp;T:***\n\n* Vodafone is the largest telco in the world outside of China\n* 640M subscribers and a leader in technology development. They are very progressive in how they think about utilizing new technology\n* Vodafone is the largest holder of cellular spectrum on the planet\n* I personally financed $7.5M to develop the technology and launched the BW-1 to prove that the technology works\n* Then I invited Vodafone to work together\n   * Vodafone has worked closely with me to help design the service from the beginning to ensure that nothing in their network infrastructure would be changed\n      * (Vodafone CTO in March 2020 video said they\u2019ve been working with AST SpaceMobile for 18 months \u2192 Mid 2018)\n   * Vodafone spends hundred of billions of dollars every year on their current infrastructure.  I want to piggyback their investment and not change anything \n* Vodafone provided a lot of technical support\n* Also provided access to their supply chain which was very important\n* Vodafone diligenced AST for over a year\n* Vodafone invested in Series B and in the PIPE\n* We are very close to Vodafone and they are an ideal partner\n* Also American Tower, Samsung useful to have handset guy), and Rakuten Altiostar is very important for us\n* Abel also partnered with AT&amp;T in his first company, so he has a great relationship and that\u2019s why he partnered with them now\n\n***Issues with Latency, Existing Protocols and Noise:***\n\n* These problems are solved by the technology covered by our patent claims. These issues were addressed by our demonstration with BW1\n* All the cellular infrastructure is designed to work with a range of 100km. If you go out on a boat, you stop seeing a coast because the earth is curved. The same thing happens with signals. So all the LTE and 5G protocols and every system is designed to sustain 100km of distance.  \n* Typically you have towers 5-25km from where you are. \n* There are two effects:  when you have a satellite high up that is moving, you have two effects on the signal = one is doppler and one is delay\n* Doppler is the same effect when you see F-1 racing car, when you see it approach and then it\u2019s going away the sound changes\n* Satellites have the same issue when it approaches you and it\u2019s going away.  \n* Cell phones can\u2019t cope with these issues.  So we have patents that can deal with doppler and delay without needing to modify current mobile phones.  We have patents that also cover how to create kilowatt satellites cost-effectively, we patents for the architecture.  We have a family of patents to deal with all these issues.\n* One key aspect, all of this technology goes into software that is on the ground and not in the satellite.  We want to be completely independent of 3G 4G 5G tech that is used by mobile handset.\n* The satellite is like a gigantic mirror relay. The satellite is a beam former and takes those beams from cellular spectrum and translates it down via satellite spectrum to the gateway\n* Phased array is very well known technology.  Every tower has a phased array and we adapted that to be used in our satellites.\n\n***What\u2019s the Magic:***\n\n* We have the ability to create a large aperture cost effectively that has sensitivity and power to collect signal from mobile phones. This ability is protocol agnostic whether it\u2019s 3G 4G 5G, that doesn\u2019t change. Building a satellite of this size at an effective cost is a big part of the magic\n* The other part of the magic is the software that manages communication from satellite and the mobile phone.\n\n***Launch Costs:***\n\n* There are many launch providers.  US, SpaceX, Astra, Blue Origin, Europeans, Russians (we\u2019re using Soyuz), Indians launched BW1.  So many options for launch providers.\n* Cost has gone down orders of magnitude. NASA you could pay $30-50k per kg, now it\u2019s order of magnitude less and continues to go down.\n\n***Selecting Wireless Carrier Partners:***\n\n* Big believer in creating huge barriers entry\n   * 1,000 patent claims\n   * Highly technological approach to solve the problem\n   * It will take years for competitors to try to catch up with us\n   * We have patent insurance with Lloyd\u2019s of London \u2192 AST pays premium each year and when someone violate patents Lloyd\u2019s utilizes legal resources to pursue\n* Other barrier of entry, we have 800M subscribers out of 5B in the world under mutual exclusivity which will keep others from trying to enter\n* Won\u2019t do anymore of these mutually exclusive deals\n* It\u2019s a multi-billion dollar opportunity and market is big enough that other competitors will eventually come\n   * I\u2019m ok with this, but I\u2019m years ahead and I have 20% of market secured with mutual exclusivity\n   * I will be launching service first and will have experience \n   * Patents will position us to have 5-10 years of advantage\n* But market is so big, the focus is delivering the technology and getting service up and running by 2023\n* Yes there will be customer (wireless carrier) announcements after the merger closing, but I can\u2019t say when\n   * To give you a sense, it takes 1 telco to add 200M subscribers\n   * This is great business model - 1 agreement we get millions of subscribers\n* Future agreements won\u2019t be mutually exclusive, so we will add as many carriers as we can. For example in South America we have 3 out of 4 largest carriers\n* AT&amp;T won\u2019t let me disclose everything we\u2019re doing, but they are looking at SpaceMobile to have the same effect as when they had exclusivity with iPhone vs. competition\n   * Just imagine one telco saying you\u2019re phone can work everywhere, on a plane or train vs. competitor \n\n***Competitive Landscape:***\n\n* Lynk is trying to accomplish something similar with $10M of funding, which is very tough\n   * Have not partnered with any wireless carriers to date\n   * Lynk\u2019s patents reference me in the prior art\n   * Their approach is using small satellites like what we did with BlueWalker 1\n      * You can\u2019t do broadband or other services with small satellites\n      * You may be able to send a text message and the receive something back 2 hours later\n   * It\u2019s unclear how you can deliver this solution to customers without working with wireless carriers\n* Omnispace \n   * Omnispace is a spectrum play\n   * I know them very well and don\u2019t see them as a direct competitor to AST SpaceMobile\n* AST SpaceMobile: we are making a play for all the large wireless telco carriers which makes the model work.  Everyone else is doing something completely different\n\n***Milestones / Catalysts:***\n\n* One major milestone obviously is the launch of BW3\n* Another major milestone would be increasing the signed access to 1.3B of subscribers to a number that I can\u2019t disclose yet\n* There will be service launches and regulatory approvals on a per country basis, many of them in Vodafone markets - many of these coming\n* There may be news with some of our technology partners providing non-dilutive financing to support us\n* We will start manufacturing of the 20 satellites and I will do a video of the facility that will be coming out\n* We will keep the market informed, but I need to keep a balance to not share too much to competitors \n* The US Senate passed a bipartisan $9B 5G Fund for Rural America \n   * AST SpaceMobile was part of FCC comment period for the 5G Fund\n   * I am confident we will get some portion of this fund \n      * For example, SpaceX got $885.5M of the $9.2B RDOF (Rural Digital Opportunity Fund) \n      * SpaceX is providing Internet to the home, however we are providing connectivity for the mobile handset in rural areas which is important for 5G \n      * This is the only way for the US to light up 5G across the entire country, especially rural areas\n   * It will be perfect timing as the decision will be made after the launch of BW3, but before the constellation is launch\n      * 7 senators writing letters to the FCC in support of AST SpaceMobile\n      * AT&amp;T is also supporting us \n* We will keep the cadence of the marketing up\n   * Video with Jason Silva is just the beginning\n   * We will do videos of the facility, satellite launches, etc\n* We are going to have wonderful research coverage, not only because of interest in our company but also people that are covering our investors/partners American Tower, Vodafone, AT&amp;T - they are all going to be in\n   * I can\u2019t say who will be covering us, but it will be very good coverage\n\n***Final Thoughts:***\n\n* Have all the technology components in place and more than funded now.\n* Commercial risks are gone. Will announce many more wireless carrier customers soon.\n* This will work, it's just a matter of time.",

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was fortunate enough to meet with Abel Avellan along with other investors recently. I wanted to share my notes with the reddit community to help clear up a lot of confusion and misinformation out there.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor ... do your own due diligence.\n\n***BlueWalker-3 Deployment:***\n\n* BlueWalker-3 will have the full technology stack implemented\n   * 10 meters x 10 meters array and has ability to connect directly to handset and provide streaming, voice, data\n   * Have tested apps on core networks of Vodafone, AT&amp;T, Rakuten and some other telcos in Africa\n   * Have interconnectivity with telcos setup and ready for launch\n* Using two vendors, one is Rakuten\u2019s Altiostar that is the interface with the carrier\u2019s network\n* Designed service so AST doesn\u2019t need to modify current mobile phone in any way\n* After you get a text message to opt in, your phone takes over and you won\u2019t know if you are connected to a satellite or a tower\n* BlueWalker-3 is 1.5 ton satellite the size of a pickup truck\n   * Will be launched this year from Kazakhstan\n   * The profile of the satellite is very thin, like a table and built in modules\n* The deployment of BlueWalker-3 is the final production of all the development that has gone into the technology. After the successful launch we will go immediately into producing 20 satellites for first phase of launch\n* The biggest risk? I put in context this way. Connecting to a phone from a satellite is nothing new. This has happened for 25 years. Satellite phones are bulky and proprietary. The premise of what we do is that EVERY phone today is part of our market.\n* Satellite phone is 1 watt of power and 3DBI of gain and bulky\n* An iPhone today is 0.25 watt of power and \u00bd DBI of gain\n* Difference is the satellite phones connect to a satellite that is a couple hundred kilograms, whereas our satellites are 1.5-2 tons and have all the power and gain to connect to a regular handset\n* The satellite will fly at 600 kilometers\n* The full production satellite will be larger, 20 meters x 20 meters array and will be a little bit heavier\n* Building satellite with modules called microns which are elements that form the phase array\n* Built the tech ourselves in Israel, but will be outsourcing future production to NEC in Japan - but all the tech is our IP and the final production and assembly will be done in Midland TX\n\n***Utilizing Wireless Carrier Partner\u2019s Spectrum:***\n\n* We will be using lowband, midband and c-band. We have the ability to tune into any cellular spectrum 700-950mhz, 1700-2200mhz and C-Band\n* Our ability to utilize a carrier\u2019s spectrum is software-defined, so we can tune per beam per cell into multiple different bands. So we have total flexibility\n* We don\u2019t own the spectrum, we partner with AT&amp;T, Vodafone, Telefonica, American Movil, etc to use their spectrum where it isn\u2019t lit up (used) and then interconnect that spectrum to our gateways via B-Band 45Ghz (satellite backhaul).\n* You have a field of view which is the area a satellite can see which is 2,800 kilometers (not sure if this is the right number), within each of the field of view you have cells which is the equivalent to a tower.\n   * So for a satellite you can have 2,800 cells in low band and 10,000 cells in midband\n* All these cells are in the frequencies that are native to current mobile phones. We don\u2019t want to modify current phones. We want users to be able to access SpaceMobile from responding to a text message\n* All the native cellular spectrum is used which then gets translated to the B-Band spectrum down to the gateway where we have eNodeB and rack of equipment that then connect to the carrier\u2019s network\n* In the US we only need 2 gateways, but we will be using 3 gateways in carrier neutral locations of American Tower.\n* 1 East Coast, 1 in Midland and 1 in Hawaii\n\n***Mobile Users Covered by a Cell:***\n\n* Depends on what spectrum is being used, but it\u2019s between 300 - 10,000 users based on how much overbooking you are putting on the spectrum and what packages you are offering\n* Roughly per satellite we can produce 1.6 million gigabytes per month. If you were to allocate 1 gigabyte to each user that\u2019s 1.6 million subscribers.\n   * But in the equatorial areas where we are charging $1 or less, you can multiply those subscribers by 10x. In the US if you\u2019re charging $25/year, then you give people more data.\n   * High end market is for people moving in and out of connectivity\n      * If you\u2019re in the home you use WiFi\n      * If you\u2019re in coverage area you use your current carrier plan\n      * If you move out of coverage you will connect to SpaceMobile. If you\u2019re on a plane or driving to the hamptons or going to a cabin in a remote location, you would connect to SpaceMobile.\n   * The other part of the opportunity is people who don\u2019t have internet or phone\n      * We are starting with this market in the equatorial countries\n\n***Working with Vodafone and AT&amp;T:***\n\n* Vodafone is the largest telco in the world outside of China\n* 640M subscribers and a leader in technology development. They are very progressive in how they think about utilizing new technology\n* Vodafone is the largest holder of cellular spectrum on the planet\n* I personally financed $7.5M to develop the technology and launched the BW-1 to prove that the technology works\n* Then I invited Vodafone to work together \n   * Vodafone has worked closely with me to help design the service from the beginning to ensure that nothing in their network infrastructure would be changed \n      * (Vodafone CTO in March 2020 video said they\u2019ve been working with AST SpaceMobile for 18 months \u2192 Mid 2018)\n   * Vodafone spends hundred of billions of dollars every year on their current infrastructure. I want to piggyback their investment and not change anything\n* Vodafone provided a lot of technical support\n* Also provided access to their supply chain which was very important\n* Vodafone diligenced AST for over a year\n* Vodafone invested in Series B and in the PIPE\n* We are very close to Vodafone and they are an ideal partner\n* Also American Tower, Samsung useful to have handset guy), and Rakuten Altiostar is very important for us\n* Abel also partnered with AT&amp;T in his first company, so he has a great relationship and that\u2019s why he partnered with them now\n\n***Issues with Latency, Existing Protocols and Noise:***\n\n* These problems are solved by the technology covered by our patent claims. These issues were addressed by our demonstration with BW1\n* All the cellular infrastructure is designed to work with a range of 100km. If you go out on a boat, you stop seeing a coast because the earth is curved. The same thing happens with signals. So all the LTE and 5G protocols and every system is designed to sustain 100km of distance.\n* Typically you have towers 5-25km from where you are.\n* There are two effects: when you have a satellite high up that is moving, you have two effects on the signal = one is doppler and one is delay\n* Doppler is the same effect when you see F-1 racing car, when you see it approach and then it\u2019s going away the sound changes\n* Satellites have the same issue when it approaches you and it\u2019s going away.\n* Cell phones can\u2019t cope with these issues. So we have patents that can deal with doppler and delay without needing to modify current mobile phones. We have patents that also cover how to create kilowatt satellites cost-effectively, we patents for the architecture. We have a family of patents to deal with all these issues.\n* One key aspect, all of this technology goes into software that is on the ground and not in the satellite. We want to be completely independent of 3G 4G 5G tech that is used by mobile handset.\n* The satellite is like a gigantic mirror relay. The satellite is a beam former and takes those beams from cellular spectrum and translates it down via satellite spectrum to the gateway\n* Phased array is very well known technology. Every tower has a phased array and we adapted that to be used in our satellites.\n\n***What\u2019s the Magic:***\n\n* We have the ability to create a large aperture cost effectively that has sensitivity and power to collect signal from mobile phones. This ability is protocol agnostic whether it\u2019s 3G 4G 5G, that doesn\u2019t change. Building a satellite of this size at an effective cost is a big part of the magic\n* The other part of the magic is the software that manages communication from satellite and the mobile phone.\n\n***Launch Costs:***\n\n* There are many launch providers. US, SpaceX, Astra, Blue Origin, Europeans, Russians (we\u2019re using Soyuz), Indians launched BW1. So many options for launch providers.\n* Cost has gone down orders of magnitude. NASA you could pay $30-50k per kg, now it\u2019s order of magnitude less and continues to go down.\n\n***Selecting Wireless Carrier Partners:***\n\n* Big believer in creating huge barriers entry \n   * 1,000 patent claims\n   * Highly technological approach to solve the problem\n   * It will take years for competitors to try to catch up with us\n   * We have patent insurance with Lloyd\u2019s of London \u2192 AST pays premium each year and when someone violate patents Lloyd\u2019s utilizes legal resources to pursue\n* Other barrier of entry, we have 800M subscribers out of 5B in the world under mutual exclusivity which will keep others from trying to enter\n* Won\u2019t do anymore of these mutually exclusive deals\n* It\u2019s a multi-billion dollar opportunity and market is big enough that other competitors will eventually come\n   * I\u2019m ok with this, but I\u2019m years ahead and I have 20% of market secured with mutual exclusivity\n   * I will be launching service first and will have experience\n   * Patents will position us to have 5-10 years of advantage\n* But market is so big, the focus is delivering the technology and getting service up and running by 2023\n* Yes there will be customer (wireless carrier) announcements after the merger closing, but I can\u2019t say when\n   * To give you a sense, it takes 1 telco to add 200M subscribers\n   * This is great business model - 1 agreement we get millions of subscribers\n* Future agreements won\u2019t be mutually exclusive, so we will add as many carriers as we can. For example in South America we have 3 out of 4 largest carriers\n* AT&amp;T won\u2019t let me disclose everything we\u2019re doing, but they are looking at SpaceMobile to have the same effect as when they had exclusivity with iPhone vs. competition\n   * Just imagine one telco saying you\u2019re phone can work everywhere, on a plane or train vs. competitor\n\n***Competitive Landscape:***\n\n* Lynk is trying to accomplish something similar with $10M of funding, which is very tough\n   * Have not partnered with any wireless carriers to date\n   * Lynk\u2019s patents reference me in the prior art\n   * Their approach is using small satellites like what we did with BlueWalker 1\n      * You can\u2019t do broadband or other services with small satellites\n      * You may be able to send a text message and the receive something back 2 hours later\n   * It\u2019s unclear how you can deliver this solution to customers without working with wireless carriers\n* Omnispace\n   * Omnispace is a spectrum play\n   * I know them very well and don\u2019t see them as a direct competitor to AST SpaceMobile\n* AST SpaceMobile: we are making a play for all the large wireless telco carriers which makes the model work. Everyone else is doing something completely different\n\n***Milestones / Catalysts:***\n\n* One major milestone obviously is the launch of BW3\n* Another major milestone would be increasing the signed access to 1.3B of subscribers to a number that I can\u2019t disclose yet\n* There will be service launches and regulatory approvals on a per country basis, many of them in Vodafone markets - many of these coming\n* There may be news with some of our technology partners providing non-dilutive financing to support us\n* We will start manufacturing of the 20 satellites and I will do a video of the facility that will be coming out\n* We will keep the market informed, but I need to keep a balance to not share too much to competitors\n* The US Senate passed a bipartisan $9B 5G Fund for Rural America\n   * AST SpaceMobile was part of FCC comment period for the 5G Fund\n   * I am confident we will get some portion of this fund\n      * For example, SpaceX got $885.5M of the $9.2B RDOF (Rural Digital Opportunity Fund)\n      * SpaceX is providing Internet to the home, however we are providing connectivity for the mobile handset in rural areas which is important for 5G\n      * This is the only way for the US to light up 5G across the entire country, especially rural areas\n   * It will be perfect timing as the decision will be made after the launch of BW3, but before the constellation is launch\n      * 7 senators writing letters to the FCC in support of AST SpaceMobile\n      * AT&amp;T is also supporting us\n* We will keep the cadence of the marketing up \n   * Video with Jason Silva is just the beginning\n   * We will do videos of the facility, satellite launches, etc\n* We are going to have wonderful research coverage, not only because of interest in our company but also people that are covering our investors/partners American Tower, Vodafone, AT&amp;T - they are all going to be in\n   * I can\u2019t say who will be covering us, but it will be very good coverage\n\n***Final Thoughts:***\n\n* Have all the technology components in place and more than funded now.\n* Commercial risks are gone. Will announce many more wireless carrier customers soon.\n* This will work, it's just a matter of time.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 26th, 2021.\n\n# **Taxes and inflation will be key themes for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/taxes-and-inflation-will-be-key-themes-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The final week of April is going to be a busy one for markets with a Federal Reserve meeting and a deluge of earnings news.\n*****\n&gt; Hot topics in markets will continue to be inflation and taxes.\n*****\n&gt; President Joe Biden is expected to detail his \u201cAmerican Families Plan\u201d and the tax increases to pay for it, including a much higher capital gains tax for the wealthy. The plan is the second part of his Build Back Better agenda and will include new spending proposals aimed at helping families. The president addresses a joint session of Congress Wednesday evening.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s a huge week for earnings with about a third of the S&amp;P 500 reporting, including Big Tech names, such as Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.\n*****\n&gt; As many have already done, firms like Boeing, Ford, Caterpillar and McDonald\u2019s, are likely to detail cost pressures they are facing from rising materials and transportation costs and supply chain disruptions.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, the Fed is expected to defend its policy of letting inflation run hot, while assuring markets it sees the pick-up in prices as only temporary. The central bank meets on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; # The central bank takes the main stage\n&gt; \u201cI think the Fed would like not to be a feature next week, but the Fed will be forced from the background because of concerns about inflation,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank is not expected to make any policy moves, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s press briefing following the meeting Wednesday will be closely watched.\n*****\n&gt; So far, the barrage of earnings news has been positive, with 86% of companies reporting earnings beats. Corporate profits are expected to be up about 33.9% for the first quarter, based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Revenues are about 9.9% higher.\n*****\n&gt; There is important inflation data Friday when the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge is reported.\n*****\n&gt; The personal consumption expenditure report is expected to show a 1.8% rise in core inflation, still below the Fed\u2019s target of 2%. Other data releases include the first-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday, which is expected to have grown by 6.5%, according to Dow Jones.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the Fed has no urgency to shift monetary policy at this point,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. \u201cThe Fed needs to acknowledge that the data is improving. We had a strong first quarter.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed needs to acknowledge that but at the same time they\u2019re keeping extremely accommodative policy in place, so they\u2019ll have to make a note to the fact that the easy policy is warranted,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Lyngen said the Fed will likely point to continued concerns about the pandemic globally as a potential risk to the economic recovery.\n*****\n&gt; Powell is also expected to once more explain that the Fed will let inflation rise above its 2% target for a period of time before it raises rates so that the economy can have more time to heal. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge for the Fed,\u201d said Swonk.\n*****\n&gt; The base effects for the next several months will make inflation appear to have jumped sharply because of the comparison to a weak period last year. The consumer price index for April could be above 3%, compared to 2.6% last month, Swonk added.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is trying to let a lot more people get out onto the dance floor before it calls \u2018last call,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cReally what Powell has been saying since day one is if we take care of people on the margins and bring them back into the labor force, the rest will take care of itself.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were slightly lower in the past week, and Treasury yields held at lower levels. The 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.55% Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.1%, ending the week at 4,180, while Nasdaq Composite was down nearly 0.3% at 14,016. The Dow was off just shy of 0.5% at 34,043.\n*****\n&gt; # Tax hike prospects\n&gt; Stocks were hit hard on Thursday when after a news report said that Biden is expected to propose a capital gains tax rate of 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million a year.\n*****\n&gt; Combined with the 3.8% net investment income tax, the new levy would more than double the long term capital gains rate of 20% or the richest Americans.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said Biden is expected to propose raising the income tax rate for those earning more than $400,000.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think a lot of people are starting to price in the risk there going to be a significant increase in both corporate and capital gains taxes,\u201d said Lyngen.\n*****\n&gt; So far, companies have not provided much in the way of commentary on the proposed hike in corporate taxes to 28% from 21% but they have been talking about other costs.\n*****\n&gt; David Bianco, chief investment strategist for the Americas at DWS, said he expects larger companies will do better dealing with supply chain constraints than smaller ones. Big Tech is also likely to fare better during the semiconductor shortage than auto makers, which have already announced production shutdowns, he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext week is tech week. I think we\u2019re going to get down on our knees and just be in awe of their business models and their ability to grow at a behemoth scale,\u201d Bianco said.\n*****\n&gt; He said he\u2019s not in favor of Wall Street\u2019s popular trade into cyclicals and out of growth. He still favors growth.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re overweight equities really because we\u2019re concerned about rising interest rates,\u201d Bianco said. \u201cI\u2019m not bullish in that I expect the market to rise that much from here.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe stuck with growth and dug deeper into bond substitutes, utilities, staples, real estate,\u201d he said, adding he is underweight industrials, energy and materials. \u201cEnergy is doomed. It\u2019s being nationalized via regulation. I do like industrials, they are well-run companies, but I do think infrastructure spending expectations for classic infrastructure are too high.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He also said industrials are good businesses, but the stocks have become overvalued.\n*****\n&gt; Bianco said he likes big box stores, but smaller retailers are facing big challenges that were already impacting them prior to Covid. He also finds small biotech firms attractive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI like healthcare stocks. Those valuations are reasonable. People have been paranoid about politicians beating on them since 1992. They manage through it and lately they\u2019ve been delivering,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/03KqldG.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/FctG7IL.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Iq1PKMJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/eegfti6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/cdNcBaJ.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yhkNZLm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9js7oZJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/g84GywG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/64LgRnj.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/dD0vkLd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LaQNKey.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rOIVB71.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/hKlmSsP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Fntbm0R.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Next Bump in Post-Election Year Rally Could Be in May\n\n&gt; As of yesterday\u2019s close, DJIA was up 10.5% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 was up 10.1% and NASDAQ was at 7.0%. Compared to average post-election year historical performance since 1950 graphed in the charts above and below, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are all still comfortably above past post-election year average performance for this point of the year.\n\n&gt; Due to Covid-19, 2021 so far has been more volatile than the average post-election year. Aside from larger magnitude swings in performance, we have observed the return of seasonality with choppiness in February and weakness in March following monthly options expiration. Strength this April is also aligning with historical in post-election year April strength.\n\n&gt; Historically, the next area of potential concern for the current rally is just after mid-May. This is also right around the time Q1 earnings season is beginning to wrap and focus shifts to Q2 estimates, graduations, and other early summer activities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/6d832ea3cc4bbc31e8cfe94f03d98ac6/8e21ed4124083bdb-70/s500x750/83b3d05531a38363e7eae827dfdc65cea7df6790.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8d8b97ef2c731be8f580e16dbe25d431/8e21ed4124083bdb-5f/s500x750/1e8a68dfbdeea8147d89c8ac91122b1b05419ecb.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/cd741bab290266df3e64e5ed52a0d7a7/8e21ed4124083bdb-b0/s500x750/6384a25868caf6c5fcfad8e452b0ae508758114a.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Leading Indicators Suggest an Accelerating U.S. Economy\n\n&gt; The economic reacceleration is underway in the U.S., as the expanding vaccination campaign, lifting of mobility restrictions, and infusion of fiscal stimulus combined to lift the Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) in March. The LEI grew 1.3% month over month, ahead of Bloomberg consensus forecasts of 1%, raising the Conference Board\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) expectations to 6% on a year-over-year basis.\n\n&gt; After a weaker-than-expected February release that was primarily disrupted by the winter storm, data in March snapped back in a strong fashion. All ten components of the LEI rose in March, while jobless claims were the largest contributor to the growth of the index. Labor market data has continued to improve since the measurement period, as weekly jobless claims have posted back-to-back pandemic lows. The ISM New Orders Index was the second largest contributor to the LEI, which climbed to its highest levels since 2004.\n\n&gt; The Conference Board revised the February data lower, however, snapping what was a 10-month streak of growth for the index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the LEI is back on the rise, suggesting further economic momentum in the coming months:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.23.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cMomentum breeds momentum, and we expect the U.S. economy will continue to improve in the coming months as we move forward with reopening plans,\u201d noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAs the rest of the world continues to improve as well, we expect some spill-over effects to also benefit the US economy.\u201d\n\n&gt; The U.S. is currently vaccinating around 3 million people per day, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and over half of the adult population has received at least one dose of the vaccine. Meanwhile, over 80% of the population above the age of 65\u2014the most at-risk age segment of the population\u2014has received at least one dose of the vaccine. The improving vaccination data has helped embolden policymakers to lift restrictions, and prompted us to upgrade our GDP forecast for the U.S. to 6.25-6.75% in our recent Weekly Market Commentary.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Happens After The First Rate Hike?\n\n&gt; \u201cDon\u2019t fight the Fed.\u201d Old investment saying\n\n&gt; One of the popular questions we\u2019ve received lately is what do stocks do after the first rate hike? Let\u2019s be clear, we think the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) will leave rates low until at least 2023, but what if we get a sudden dose of inflation? This isn\u2019t our base case, but a rate hike could potentially happen sooner in that situation.\n\n&gt; After all, the first rate hike in 2015 set off a huge sell-off into early February 2016, as the market was quite upset and let it be known that it felt the Fed acted too soon. In fact, the first hikes of 2004 and 1999 also saw losses the first three months after the first hike, but eventually stocks were in the green a year later.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe first hike in recent cycles has indeed brought with it some selling pressure, but hikes usually take place in strong economies, so it isn\u2019t surprising to see returns turn green once you go further out,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut let\u2019s not sound any alarms yet, we don\u2019t see a rate hike for a couple of years. Still, it\u2019s good to know what the playbook could be once it happens.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, that initial rate hike can cause some hiccups the first three months, but returns turn much better 6- and 12-months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.21.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1)**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Twin Deficits and the US Dollar\n\n&gt; It was a particularly challenging year for the greenback in 2020, where the world\u2019s reserve currency acted as a \u201csafe haven\u201d asset at the height of the March 2020 market volatility, only to fall over the remainder of the year. With the U.S. outpacing much of the developed world in economic growth in 2021, Treasury yields have been rising and the dollar has strengthened, bucking the consensus view for dollar weakness.\n\n&gt; We view the \u201ctwin deficits\u201d of the U.S. economy\u2014the combination of the budget deficit and the current account deficit\u2014as a long-term structural driver of a weaker U.S. dollar. As a historical net importer, the U.S. has usually carried a trade deficit (leading to a broader current account deficit in the process), while the flood of pandemic aid has stretched the budget deficit and ballooned the sum of the twin deficits to all-time lows as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP). As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, changes in the twin deficits have been a relatively accurate predictor in the long-term trend of the value of the US dollar:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.22.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; With the twin deficits reaching all-time lows, it\u2019s hard to be bullish the US dollar over the long-term relative to its major counterparts. \u201cThe short-dollar trade has certainly been a frustrating one for investors this year, but the long-term trend continues to point lower,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, a counter-trend rally like we saw in the first quarter might have been enough to flush out some of the crowded consensus for a lower dollar.\u201d\n\n&gt; U.S. economic growth has outpaced our developed nation counterparts to begin 2021, but expectations for growth in the rest of the world may be playing catch up. In particular, the 30-year German bund yield broke out to its highest level since the onset of the pandemic, suggesting growth expectations for one of our major trade partners may be on the rise.\n\n&gt; A soft dollar has a variety of investment implications. While we continue to favor U.S. stock market exposure over developed international markets, investments overseas may benefit from the tailwind of the softer dollar. Meanwhile, commodities have historically benefitted from a weaker dollar, and may be positioned for further upside as economic activity in the rest of the world heats up. For more on our tactical market views, check out our April Global Portfolio Strategy.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Dips in Short Supply\n\n&gt; While many areas of the market have seen sizable pullbacks this year, the broader market has been stingier. Just this morning, a client was lamenting the fact that they had a decent amount of cash, but the market just wasn't providing opportunities to get in. So far this year, the S&amp;P 500's largest decline from a peak (on a closing basis) has been 4.23%, and given that we're not even four full months into the year, we initially thought that 4% seemed normal enough especially when the earlier months of the year tend to be positive.\n\n&gt; In order to see how this year stacks up to prior years, the chart below shows the duration into each year (on a percentage basis) that the S&amp;P 500 first closed down 5% or more from its YTD peak. Years in green indicate that there wasn't a single point in the entire year that the S&amp;P 500 experienced a 5% decline. The last occurrence was in 2017, and there have been a total of seven years since 1928. As we near the end of April, we're nearly a third of the way into 2021, and compared to the 'average' year, we've already gone longer without a 5% pullback. Since 1928, the S&amp;P 500 usually experiences its first 5%+ pullback 28% of the way into the year, which coincidentally enough works out to April 15th - the day before Federal taxes are typically due! In fact, at this point in prior years, the S&amp;P 500 has already experienced its first 5%+ pullback more than 65% of the time. Believe it or not, in 30% of all years since 1928 the first 5% drop occurred in the month of January.\n\n&gt; Based on prior years, the market to this point has in fact been stingy in terms of providing opportunities for investors to add exposure, although based on today's reports of new capital gains tax increases from the Biden Administration, that window may soon open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042221-5-Pullbacks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What is a 200-Day Moving Average Again?\n\n&gt; If we've learned anything over the last two trading days after what seemed like a one-way move higher for the S&amp;P 500, it is that equities can also go down. Even after the declines of the last couple of days, though, the S&amp;P 500 still remains close to 4% above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and more than 10% above its 200-DMA. While there have been a handful of days since the COVID lows where the S&amp;P 500 has dipped below its 50-DMA, there hasn't been a single day since last June where the S&amp;P 500 came even close to testing its 200-DMA. We're only in late April now, but as long as the S&amp;P 500 doesn't see a significant fall in the next two months, it has the potential to go a full year without closing below its 200-DMA. When the 200-DMA does finally come into play again, many investors may not recognize what it is.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042021-SP-500.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the percentage of time over a rolling one-year period that the S&amp;P 500 traded above its 200-DMA. At 89% now, the current level is hardly remarkable by historical standards. Right before the COVID crash last year, the percentage reached as high as 97.6%, and three years ago in March 2018, it was up at 100%. What is remarkable about the chart, though, is how elevated this moving average has been for so long. The last time it was below 50% was back in December 2009!\n\n&gt; It's easy to tell by looking at the chart, but thanks to short and swift pullbacks in the post-financial crisis period, this current streak without a sub-50% reading is the longest on record. To put a little more meat on the example, after the current streak of nearly 11.5 years, the next longest streak stretched over a period of just under ten years spanning from April 1991 through March 2001 while the one behind that was less than five years (ending in May 2008). And you only thought the market had been defying gravity recently!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042021-Above-200-DMA.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 23rd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVSgvKq0pQw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4.25.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNEOWj2EubI))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 26th, 2021.\n\n# **Taxes and inflation will be key themes for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/taxes-and-inflation-will-be-key-themes-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The final week of April is going to be a busy one for markets with a Federal Reserve meeting and a deluge of earnings news.\n*****\n&gt; Hot topics in markets will continue to be inflation and taxes.\n*****\n&gt; President Joe Biden is expected to detail his \u201cAmerican Families Plan\u201d and the tax increases to pay for it, including a much higher capital gains tax for the wealthy. The plan is the second part of his Build Back Better agenda and will include new spending proposals aimed at helping families. The president addresses a joint session of Congress Wednesday evening.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s a huge week for earnings with about a third of the S&amp;P 500 reporting, including Big Tech names, such as Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.\n*****\n&gt; As many have already done, firms like Boeing, Ford, Caterpillar and McDonald\u2019s, are likely to detail cost pressures they are facing from rising materials and transportation costs and supply chain disruptions.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, the Fed is expected to defend its policy of letting inflation run hot, while assuring markets it sees the pick-up in prices as only temporary. The central bank meets on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; # The central bank takes the main stage\n&gt; \u201cI think the Fed would like not to be a feature next week, but the Fed will be forced from the background because of concerns about inflation,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank is not expected to make any policy moves, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s press briefing following the meeting Wednesday will be closely watched.\n*****\n&gt; So far, the barrage of earnings news has been positive, with 86% of companies reporting earnings beats. Corporate profits are expected to be up about 33.9% for the first quarter, based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Revenues are about 9.9% higher.\n*****\n&gt; There is important inflation data Friday when the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge is reported.\n*****\n&gt; The personal consumption expenditure report is expected to show a 1.8% rise in core inflation, still below the Fed\u2019s target of 2%. Other data releases include the first-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday, which is expected to have grown by 6.5%, according to Dow Jones.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the Fed has no urgency to shift monetary policy at this point,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. \u201cThe Fed needs to acknowledge that the data is improving. We had a strong first quarter.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed needs to acknowledge that but at the same time they\u2019re keeping extremely accommodative policy in place, so they\u2019ll have to make a note to the fact that the easy policy is warranted,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Lyngen said the Fed will likely point to continued concerns about the pandemic globally as a potential risk to the economic recovery.\n*****\n&gt; Powell is also expected to once more explain that the Fed will let inflation rise above its 2% target for a period of time before it raises rates so that the economy can have more time to heal. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge for the Fed,\u201d said Swonk.\n*****\n&gt; The base effects for the next several months will make inflation appear to have jumped sharply because of the comparison to a weak period last year. The consumer price index for April could be above 3%, compared to 2.6% last month, Swonk added.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is trying to let a lot more people get out onto the dance floor before it calls \u2018last call,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cReally what Powell has been saying since day one is if we take care of people on the margins and bring them back into the labor force, the rest will take care of itself.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were slightly lower in the past week, and Treasury yields held at lower levels. The 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.55% Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.1%, ending the week at 4,180, while Nasdaq Composite was down nearly 0.3% at 14,016. The Dow was off just shy of 0.5% at 34,043.\n*****\n&gt; # Tax hike prospects\n&gt; Stocks were hit hard on Thursday when after a news report said that Biden is expected to propose a capital gains tax rate of 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million a year.\n*****\n&gt; Combined with the 3.8% net investment income tax, the new levy would more than double the long term capital gains rate of 20% or the richest Americans.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said Biden is expected to propose raising the income tax rate for those earning more than $400,000.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think a lot of people are starting to price in the risk there going to be a significant increase in both corporate and capital gains taxes,\u201d said Lyngen.\n*****\n&gt; So far, companies have not provided much in the way of commentary on the proposed hike in corporate taxes to 28% from 21% but they have been talking about other costs.\n*****\n&gt; David Bianco, chief investment strategist for the Americas at DWS, said he expects larger companies will do better dealing with supply chain constraints than smaller ones. Big Tech is also likely to fare better during the semiconductor shortage than auto makers, which have already announced production shutdowns, he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext week is tech week. I think we\u2019re going to get down on our knees and just be in awe of their business models and their ability to grow at a behemoth scale,\u201d Bianco said.\n*****\n&gt; He said he\u2019s not in favor of Wall Street\u2019s popular trade into cyclicals and out of growth. He still favors growth.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re overweight equities really because we\u2019re concerned about rising interest rates,\u201d Bianco said. \u201cI\u2019m not bullish in that I expect the market to rise that much from here.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe stuck with growth and dug deeper into bond substitutes, utilities, staples, real estate,\u201d he said, adding he is underweight industrials, energy and materials. \u201cEnergy is doomed. It\u2019s being nationalized via regulation. I do like industrials, they are well-run companies, but I do think infrastructure spending expectations for classic infrastructure are too high.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He also said industrials are good businesses, but the stocks have become overvalued.\n*****\n&gt; Bianco said he likes big box stores, but smaller retailers are facing big challenges that were already impacting them prior to Covid. He also finds small biotech firms attractive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI like healthcare stocks. Those valuations are reasonable. People have been paranoid about politicians beating on them since 1992. They manage through it and lately they\u2019ve been delivering,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/03KqldG.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/FctG7IL.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Iq1PKMJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/eegfti6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/cdNcBaJ.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yhkNZLm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9js7oZJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/g84GywG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/64LgRnj.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/dD0vkLd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LaQNKey.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rOIVB71.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/hKlmSsP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Fntbm0R.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Next Bump in Post-Election Year Rally Could Be in May\n\n&gt; As of yesterday\u2019s close, DJIA was up 10.5% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 was up 10.1% and NASDAQ was at 7.0%. Compared to average post-election year historical performance since 1950 graphed in the charts above and below, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are all still comfortably above past post-election year average performance for this point of the year.\n\n&gt; Due to Covid-19, 2021 so far has been more volatile than the average post-election year. Aside from larger magnitude swings in performance, we have observed the return of seasonality with choppiness in February and weakness in March following monthly options expiration. Strength this April is also aligning with historical in post-election year April strength.\n\n&gt; Historically, the next area of potential concern for the current rally is just after mid-May. This is also right around the time Q1 earnings season is beginning to wrap and focus shifts to Q2 estimates, graduations, and other early summer activities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/6d832ea3cc4bbc31e8cfe94f03d98ac6/8e21ed4124083bdb-70/s500x750/83b3d05531a38363e7eae827dfdc65cea7df6790.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8d8b97ef2c731be8f580e16dbe25d431/8e21ed4124083bdb-5f/s500x750/1e8a68dfbdeea8147d89c8ac91122b1b05419ecb.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/cd741bab290266df3e64e5ed52a0d7a7/8e21ed4124083bdb-b0/s500x750/6384a25868caf6c5fcfad8e452b0ae508758114a.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Leading Indicators Suggest an Accelerating U.S. Economy\n\n&gt; The economic reacceleration is underway in the U.S., as the expanding vaccination campaign, lifting of mobility restrictions, and infusion of fiscal stimulus combined to lift the Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) in March. The LEI grew 1.3% month over month, ahead of Bloomberg consensus forecasts of 1%, raising the Conference Board\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) expectations to 6% on a year-over-year basis.\n\n&gt; After a weaker-than-expected February release that was primarily disrupted by the winter storm, data in March snapped back in a strong fashion. All ten components of the LEI rose in March, while jobless claims were the largest contributor to the growth of the index. Labor market data has continued to improve since the measurement period, as weekly jobless claims have posted back-to-back pandemic lows. The ISM New Orders Index was the second largest contributor to the LEI, which climbed to its highest levels since 2004.\n\n&gt; The Conference Board revised the February data lower, however, snapping what was a 10-month streak of growth for the index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the LEI is back on the rise, suggesting further economic momentum in the coming months:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.23.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cMomentum breeds momentum, and we expect the U.S. economy will continue to improve in the coming months as we move forward with reopening plans,\u201d noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAs the rest of the world continues to improve as well, we expect some spill-over effects to also benefit the US economy.\u201d\n\n&gt; The U.S. is currently vaccinating around 3 million people per day, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and over half of the adult population has received at least one dose of the vaccine. Meanwhile, over 80% of the population above the age of 65\u2014the most at-risk age segment of the population\u2014has received at least one dose of the vaccine. The improving vaccination data has helped embolden policymakers to lift restrictions, and prompted us to upgrade our GDP forecast for the U.S. to 6.25-6.75% in our recent Weekly Market Commentary.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Happens After The First Rate Hike?\n\n&gt; \u201cDon\u2019t fight the Fed.\u201d Old investment saying\n\n&gt; One of the popular questions we\u2019ve received lately is what do stocks do after the first rate hike? Let\u2019s be clear, we think the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) will leave rates low until at least 2023, but what if we get a sudden dose of inflation? This isn\u2019t our base case, but a rate hike could potentially happen sooner in that situation.\n\n&gt; After all, the first rate hike in 2015 set off a huge sell-off into early February 2016, as the market was quite upset and let it be known that it felt the Fed acted too soon. In fact, the first hikes of 2004 and 1999 also saw losses the first three months after the first hike, but eventually stocks were in the green a year later.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe first hike in recent cycles has indeed brought with it some selling pressure, but hikes usually take place in strong economies, so it isn\u2019t surprising to see returns turn green once you go further out,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut let\u2019s not sound any alarms yet, we don\u2019t see a rate hike for a couple of years. Still, it\u2019s good to know what the playbook could be once it happens.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, that initial rate hike can cause some hiccups the first three months, but returns turn much better 6- and 12-months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.21.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1)**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Twin Deficits and the US Dollar\n\n&gt; It was a particularly challenging year for the greenback in 2020, where the world\u2019s reserve currency acted as a \u201csafe haven\u201d asset at the height of the March 2020 market volatility, only to fall over the remainder of the year. With the U.S. outpacing much of the developed world in economic growth in 2021, Treasury yields have been rising and the dollar has strengthened, bucking the consensus view for dollar weakness.\n\n&gt; We view the \u201ctwin deficits\u201d of the U.S. economy\u2014the combination of the budget deficit and the current account deficit\u2014as a long-term structural driver of a weaker U.S. dollar. As a historical net importer, the U.S. has usually carried a trade deficit (leading to a broader current account deficit in the process), while the flood of pandemic aid has stretched the budget deficit and ballooned the sum of the twin deficits to all-time lows as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP). As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, changes in the twin deficits have been a relatively accurate predictor in the long-term trend of the value of the US dollar:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.22.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; With the twin deficits reaching all-time lows, it\u2019s hard to be bullish the US dollar over the long-term relative to its major counterparts. \u201cThe short-dollar trade has certainly been a frustrating one for investors this year, but the long-term trend continues to point lower,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, a counter-trend rally like we saw in the first quarter might have been enough to flush out some of the crowded consensus for a lower dollar.\u201d\n\n&gt; U.S. economic growth has outpaced our developed nation counterparts to begin 2021, but expectations for growth in the rest of the world may be playing catch up. In particular, the 30-year German bund yield broke out to its highest level since the onset of the pandemic, suggesting growth expectations for one of our major trade partners may be on the rise.\n\n&gt; A soft dollar has a variety of investment implications. While we continue to favor U.S. stock market exposure over developed international markets, investments overseas may benefit from the tailwind of the softer dollar. Meanwhile, commodities have historically benefitted from a weaker dollar, and may be positioned for further upside as economic activity in the rest of the world heats up. For more on our tactical market views, check out our April Global Portfolio Strategy.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Dips in Short Supply\n\n&gt; While many areas of the market have seen sizable pullbacks this year, the broader market has been stingier. Just this morning, a client was lamenting the fact that they had a decent amount of cash, but the market just wasn't providing opportunities to get in. So far this year, the S&amp;P 500's largest decline from a peak (on a closing basis) has been 4.23%, and given that we're not even four full months into the year, we initially thought that 4% seemed normal enough especially when the earlier months of the year tend to be positive.\n\n&gt; In order to see how this year stacks up to prior years, the chart below shows the duration into each year (on a percentage basis) that the S&amp;P 500 first closed down 5% or more from its YTD peak. Years in green indicate that there wasn't a single point in the entire year that the S&amp;P 500 experienced a 5% decline. The last occurrence was in 2017, and there have been a total of seven years since 1928. As we near the end of April, we're nearly a third of the way into 2021, and compared to the 'average' year, we've already gone longer without a 5% pullback. Since 1928, the S&amp;P 500 usually experiences its first 5%+ pullback 28% of the way into the year, which coincidentally enough works out to April 15th - the day before Federal taxes are typically due! In fact, at this point in prior years, the S&amp;P 500 has already experienced its first 5%+ pullback more than 65% of the time. Believe it or not, in 30% of all years since 1928 the first 5% drop occurred in the month of January.\n\n&gt; Based on prior years, the market to this point has in fact been stingy in terms of providing opportunities for investors to add exposure, although based on today's reports of new capital gains tax increases from the Biden Administration, that window may soon open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042221-5-Pullbacks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What is a 200-Day Moving Average Again?\n\n&gt; If we've learned anything over the last two trading days after what seemed like a one-way move higher for the S&amp;P 500, it is that equities can also go down. Even after the declines of the last couple of days, though, the S&amp;P 500 still remains close to 4% above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and more than 10% above its 200-DMA. While there have been a handful of days since the COVID lows where the S&amp;P 500 has dipped below its 50-DMA, there hasn't been a single day since last June where the S&amp;P 500 came even close to testing its 200-DMA. We're only in late April now, but as long as the S&amp;P 500 doesn't see a significant fall in the next two months, it has the potential to go a full year without closing below its 200-DMA. When the 200-DMA does finally come into play again, many investors may not recognize what it is.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042021-SP-500.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the percentage of time over a rolling one-year period that the S&amp;P 500 traded above its 200-DMA. At 89% now, the current level is hardly remarkable by historical standards. Right before the COVID crash last year, the percentage reached as high as 97.6%, and three years ago in March 2018, it was up at 100%. What is remarkable about the chart, though, is how elevated this moving average has been for so long. The last time it was below 50% was back in December 2009!\n\n&gt; It's easy to tell by looking at the chart, but thanks to short and swift pullbacks in the post-financial crisis period, this current streak without a sub-50% reading is the longest on record. To put a little more meat on the example, after the current streak of nearly 11.5 years, the next longest streak stretched over a period of just under ten years spanning from April 1991 through March 2001 while the one behind that was less than five years (ending in May 2008). And you only thought the market had been defying gravity recently!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042021-Above-200-DMA.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 23rd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVSgvKq0pQw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4.25.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNEOWj2EubI))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 5th, 2021.\n\n# **Blowout jobs report could power stocks higher in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/blowout-jobs-report-could-power-stocks-higher-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; April started off with a rally, and the market could continue to notch gains as the month gets underway, strategists say.\n*****\n&gt; The U.S. Labor Department\u2019s surprisingly strong March jobs report this Friday showed that there were 916,000 jobs added in March, compared to the 675,000 expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is expected to be fairly quiet, with a few economic reports and Federal Reserve speakers filling the lull before earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s service sector survey will be released next Monday and should get close attention after institute\u2019s manufacturing survey came in at the highest level since 1983. Minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting will be released next Wednesday afternoon.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cLiterally everything, or almost everything, should be very robust for the foreseeable future, I would think. We\u2019re coming off a low base,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a very strong second quarter as the economy reopens and stimulus spending kicks in, and that should be positive for stocks \u2014 unless interest rates rise too quickly.\n*****\n&gt; Major stock indices were sharply higher as the calendar rolled into April.\n*****\n&gt; On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2% to a new record close of 4,019.87. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 170 points, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.8%.\n*****\n&gt; The closely watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, was higher at 1.68% Friday morning, well below recent high of 1.77% reached earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year is important because it influences mortgages and other loans, but recently it has also had a negative correlation recently with tech stocks. When the 10-year yield edged higher, tech went lower.\n*****\n&gt; # All eyes on earnings\n&gt; \u201cThe macro calendar is pretty light. I think attention will turn to earnings pretty quickly,\u201d said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi U.S. Wealth Management. \u201cThat will be the next thing to turn to.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market is often weaker just ahead of earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; First quarter earnings are expected to be up 24.2% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. It will be the first quarter where the prior year results included the impact of the pandemic shutdown.\n*****\n&gt; Some strategists expect the earnings season to bring with it more favorable comments from companies that could lead to positive forecast revisions, providing fuel for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApproximately 13 months ago, COVID-19 sent us home from our offices and our kids from school. While the pandemic nearly shut down the world economy, an unprecedented policy response kept the economy afloat, leading to the shortest recessionary decline and the steepest stock market bounce in history,\u201d noted Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said that the 78% rise in the S&amp;P 500 from the bottom last March was driven in a big way by earnings.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn each of the past two recovery periods, the trend of positive revisions lasted 2-3 years, providing an important tailwind for the market,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; He added that economists have continued to revise growth forecasts higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur work shows that every 1% change in GDP drives a 2\u00bd\u20133% change in revenues, and even larger improvements in profits,\u201d Golub wrote.\n*****\n&gt; # April is far from cruelest month\nAside from an expected earnings bounce, some strategists have been expecting April to be a bullish time for stocks, as it has been historically.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Lee, managing partner of Fundstrat, for instance, points to the decline in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange\u2019s Volatility Index, to pre-pandemic levels and says that\u2019s constructive for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; The VIX is calculated based on the puts and the calls in the S&amp;P 500, trading on the CBOE.\n*****\n&gt; Lee also noted that when the market closes higher on March 31, the final day of the first quarter, and again on April 1, the first day of the second quarter, the market has had a better April performance than usual.\n*****\n&gt; Since World War II, when those two days were positive, the S&amp;P 500 rose an average 2.4% for April, versus its usual 1.3% gain, Lee said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe bottom line is this is [a] positive environment and risk/reward for stocks. This keeps us constructive,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the market enters April and the second quarter with a tailwind.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApril is usually good. It\u2019s the best month in terms of average price change. The second quarter is not a bad quarter on average. It\u2019s up 2.8% on average since 1990, and all 11 sectors have posted average gains,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said some of the cyclicals may have gotten ahead of themselves and energy, industrials and financials could pause. Those sectors have been outperforming while tech has been lagging.\n*****\n&gt; The market enters the \u201csell in May\u201d period during the second quarter. The market adage, \u201csell in May and go away,\u201d is based on the idea that stocks tend to underperform from May through October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn that sell in May period, tech has been a pretty good performer. Now is probably not the time to begin bailing out of tech,\u201d Stovall said. \u201cTech could end up receiving a near-term reprieve.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and investors will review them for any fresh comments on inflation. With prices for fuel and other commodities already rising, investors are becoming concerned that more stimulus could send inflation higher.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said after the March meeting that the Fed sees inflationary pressures as transient, but the markets are still concerned that it could become a bigger issue. Inflation is currently well below the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\n*****\n&gt; The producer price index \u2014 which gauges the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output \u2014 will also be watched closely when it is reported Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As for Fed speakers, Powell is expected to discuss the global economy on an International Monetary Fund panel Thursday, which will be moderated by CNBC\u2019s Sara Eisen.\n*****\n&gt; Other central bank speakers include Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who speaks Tuesday and Wednesday, and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin who speaks Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks on a Chicago Council on Global Affairs webinar Monday on the economic recovery Monday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/W5VnHdw.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/OWAqXe4.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/seUECBP.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/8x71bbA.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/B0iQJ5r.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/walbCuS.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pBIopWq.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mZ6A4CJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H4WjcRK.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DzPTCDd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5iiOoya.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Mx4A08w.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/JR37Qxb.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/EHPQCzz.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks Love April\n\n&gt; \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.\u201d Mark Twain\n\n&gt; What more can we say other than few months have been kinder to stocks lately than the month of April. In fact, it was last year that saw the S&amp;P 500 Index gain an incredible 12.7%, for one of the greatest one-month gains in history. We noted at the time that 10% or greater months tended to usually kick off strength, not mark the end of it like many were claiming last year. Once again, history looks to have rhymed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Just how strong has April been lately? \u201cI had to double check, but sure enough, stocks have closed higher in April an incredible 14 out of the past 15 years,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOther than my Cincinnati Bengals breaking my heart, few things are more consistent than stocks higher in April.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, April is a great month for stocks across the board:\n\n&gt; * Since 1950 it is the second best month\n&gt; * The past 20 years it is the best month\n&gt; * The past 10 years it is the second best month\n&gt; * n a post-election year it ranks fourth out of 12\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog-2-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Taking it a step further, here\u2019s what the average April looks like. It sprints out to impressive gains the first 18 days or so, then it coasts in like Usain Bolt in a race.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Strength Day Before Good Friday Weakness Day After\n\n&gt; Good Friday (and Easter) land at the beginning of April this year. Historically the longer-term track record of Good Friday (page 98 of STA 2021) is bullish with notable average gains by DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 on the trading day before. NASDAQ has advanced 19 of the last 20 days before Good Friday. Monday, the day after Easter has exactly the opposite record since 1980 and is in the running for the worst day after of any holiday. Since 2004 the day after has been improving with S&amp;P 500 up 11 of the last 17. The second day after Easter has exhibited consistent strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/18c936f61eaab75df8a37f82d9dbe999/1d45246093ca4966-9f/s500x750/8c5d6cb1961e8e706f98e686065bf4690a97bded.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Humble Victory Lap\n\n&gt; It has been a little over a year since the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and it was certainly an eventful year, to say the least. It\u2019s also been one year since we at LPL Research upgraded our view on equities from market weight to overweight in Road to Recovery Playbook Update believing there had been a shift in the risk-reward dynamic between stocks and bonds.\n\n&gt; It certainly was not an easy call, and it was made with the S&amp;P 500 rallying roughly 15% from its low. Little did we know however, that the S&amp;P 500 would stage the greatest one year rally in history. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the rally from the 2020 low eclipsed the rallies from the 2009 and 1982 lows, climbing almost 75% since the low:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Investing is a challenging endeavor, one that even the most seasoned and successful participants need to remain ever vigilant, for Mr. Market is always ready to serve a fresh batch of humble pie\u2014a lesson we always keep in mind.\n\n&gt; \u201cFew on the Street were willing to lean into the market turmoil and change their outlook on stocks, but it was a call that paid off for us,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cEven though we turned out to be on the correct side of history, investing is a \u2018what have you done for me lately\u2019 industry, and we have to continue to remain disciplined with our approach.\u201d\n\n&gt; Despite the historic rally off the low, we continue to overweight equities in our portfolios, as the backdrop of an expanding economy and favorable monetary conditions should be supportive of stocks over bonds going forward, but we acknowledge that year 2 of a bull market has a way of challenging investors.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Turn Off, Tune Out\n\n&gt; The first quarter of 2021 comes to a close today, and as fast as time seems to fly, it's been a long one. Take GameStop (GME). It may seem like months and months ago, but it wasn't until late January that the stock started to go crazy as the 'Reddit Rebellion' launched and caused a mad scramble by hedge funds to cover any and all of their short positions. Think about it. In under three months, we've seen at least two large funds (Melvin Capital and Archegos), not to mention the collapse of supply chain finance giant Greensill Capital. Sometimes we go an entire year without blowups of this magnitude.\n\n&gt; Despite the tumultuous headlines and market volatility along with the frustrating churn in the market lately, US equities are finishing off the quarter well. Stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are up an average of 11.9% so far this year and grouped by sector they're all averaging gains. Leading the way higher, stocks in the Energy sector stand apart from every other sector with an average gain of over 20%. After Energy, stocks in the Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors are both up an average of over 15%. On the other side of the chart, sectors underperforming are generally defensive in nature with Health Care and Utilities both averaging YTD gains of less than 5%. One notable underperforming sector given its size is Technology. With an average gain of 7.2% YTD, stocks in the Technology sector are underperforming the broader market by more than 4.5 percentage points.\n\n&gt; Given the underperformance of Technology YTD, we can't help but remember some market 'certainties' over the years that never quite came to fruition. Remember after the initial surge off the lows coming out of the Credit Crisis in 2008 and 2009? While Financials were the best performing sector coming off the lows, the rally in the sector ran out of steam and stalled out. All we kept hearing at the time was that 'the market couldn't rally without the Financials', but rally it did. Now, after Technology outperformed during COVID and through last Summer, the sector has stalled out, and we're hearing the same phrase now as we did back then with the only difference being that Technology has replaced Financials as the sector that the market couldn't rally without. Since September 2nd though, when we first started to see the 'Big Shift' in the market, the S&amp;P 500 has nearly tripled the return of the Technology sector, and despite Tech's underperformance, the S&amp;P 500 has still managed double-digit percentage gains. When it comes to the old conventional wisdom of the market, investors would be best served by doing the opposite of Timothy Leary by 'turning off' and 'tuning out' all the noise.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/avgsectors.png))**\n\n&gt; In the tables below, we list the top and bottom twenty performing S&amp;P 500 stocks so far this year. Starting with the winners, L Brands (LB) and Marathon (MRO) are both already up over 60%, while another five stocks have rallied 50%+. With the exception of HollyFrontier (HFC), which is up 39.9%, every other one of the top 20 stocks is up over 40% - in just three months! What's most notable about this table, though, isn't what's on it, but what isn't. Technology has a larger number of components in the S&amp;P 500 than any other sector, but only one stock from the sector - Applied Materials (AMAT) - made the list of top performers, and only one other besides AMAT (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) made the top 50.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Best-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n&gt; At the other end of the spectrum, there are only 13 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are down over 10% YTD, and the 20th worst-performing stock is down less than 9%. And while there was only little representation from the Technology sector on the list of biggest YTD winners above, there's no shortage on the list of losers with eight of the twenty coming from that sector. It's only been three months, but stretching back to early last September, the market has gotten along just fine without the help of Technology.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Worst-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Are the Financials and Energy Sectors Due for Rotation?\n\n&gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup and an earlier post, the Energy sector far and away has been the best performing S&amp;P 500 sector in Q1. The sector is on pace to close out the quarter with a gain of just under 30%. That is nearly double the return of the next best performing sector: Financials. Granted, Financials have likewise been on an impressive run, gaining over 15%.\n\n&gt; As shown in the charts below, going back to at least 1990, Q1 of 2021 is on pace to go down as the Energy sector's single largest quarterly gain on record. Amazingly, the next two quarters that stand as runners-up have both come within the past year. Those were last quarter when the sector rose 25.78% and Q2 of 2020 when it rallied 28.68%. For the Financial sector, this quarter's gain stands in the top decile of all quarterly moves of the past three decades, and that follows last quarter's 22.52% gain which stands in the top 5%. As shown in the charts below, for both sectors, gains of 15% or more in a single quarter have been fairly uncommon with only a handful of past instances.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Bars-Sectors2.png))**\n\n&gt; That brings to question if strong runs in one quarter result in rotation out of those sectors the following quarter. In the tables below, we show the performance of the Financials and Energy sectors from the end of quarters with gains of 15% or more. Starting with a look at Financials, that rotation has not necessarily always occurred as the sector has consistently risen over the following three months. Of the ten prior instances, there have only been two quarters, Q3 2009 and Q1 2012, in which Financials were lower by the end of the next quarter. Those were also some of the few times that Financials were lower at the end of the first and second month of the quarter. We would note, though, that the current instance is also the first time since 2009 that there have been back-to-back quarters that the sector has seen gains of 15% or more. Back during that last occurrence (Q3 2009), returns were in fact weaker after that second quarter of large gains.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Fin-2a.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the Energy sector, of the nine prior instances where the sector rallied over 15%, this was the first time with two sequential quarters boasting 15% or larger gains. Additionally, rotation out of Energy stocks has been far more commonplace. As shown in the table below, from the conclusion of those quarters with big gains, the sector has averaged a decline throughout the next quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Energy-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks and Inflation\n\n&gt; As we continue LPL Research\u2019s Inflation Week, today we will examine how stocks have historically done at different inflation levels. For more color on our views on inflation, please read here and here, and look out for tomorrow\u2019s blog, where we\u2019ll examine some of the factors that have kept inflation low and that will likely continue to put a lid on inflation in the future.\n\n&gt; Looking at S&amp;P 500 Index returns going back to 1950, stocks have tended to like low inflation. As shown below, the lower inflation is, the better the S&amp;P 500 Index returns tend to be, although the strong performance for negative inflation may be due to markets rebounding off of lows. Taking it a step further, if inflation is trending lower, then stocks do much better (18.8% on average) versus if inflation is trending higher (6.4% on average).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cYou can\u2019t argue with history, as it sure appears that inflation that\u2019s under control is a tailwind for stocks,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIt is when inflation starts to turn higher that it can knock stocks down. Given our base case is for modest inflation, this is another feather in the cap for the bulls.\u201d\n\n&gt; Looking at a scatter plot of inflation and the S&amp;P 500, there is a fairly wide dispersion in some cases, so this is by no means a perfect indicator. Still, the regression line moves from the upper left to the lower right, suggesting lower inflation indeed historically has benefitted stocks more than higher inflation.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The inflation question is one that isn\u2019t going away, especially as the US continues to add more fiscal and monetary stimulus. Although this isn\u2019t a very consensus call, we think inflation will be capped once we get past 2021 and this should help stocks overall.\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DzPTCDd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EFoYhPI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS MONTH'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IAo7GlZ.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n( NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/LGaokuS.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  4.6.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eu0hmtC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ew3RuFT.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q9506N2.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2URCkYe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hcSTJcm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJ2s00r.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.9.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wEoA0Ew.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.9.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MdchFK4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Paychex, Inc. $98.76\n**Paychex, Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 5th, 2021.\n\n# **Blowout jobs report could power stocks higher in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/blowout-jobs-report-could-power-stocks-higher-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; April started off with a rally, and the market could continue to notch gains as the month gets underway, strategists say.\n*****\n&gt; The U.S. Labor Department\u2019s surprisingly strong March jobs report this Friday showed that there were 916,000 jobs added in March, compared to the 675,000 expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is expected to be fairly quiet, with a few economic reports and Federal Reserve speakers filling the lull before earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s service sector survey will be released next Monday and should get close attention after institute\u2019s manufacturing survey came in at the highest level since 1983. Minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting will be released next Wednesday afternoon.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cLiterally everything, or almost everything, should be very robust for the foreseeable future, I would think. We\u2019re coming off a low base,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a very strong second quarter as the economy reopens and stimulus spending kicks in, and that should be positive for stocks \u2014 unless interest rates rise too quickly.\n*****\n&gt; Major stock indices were sharply higher as the calendar rolled into April.\n*****\n&gt; On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2% to a new record close of 4,019.87. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 170 points, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.8%.\n*****\n&gt; The closely watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, was higher at 1.68% Friday morning, well below recent high of 1.77% reached earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year is important because it influences mortgages and other loans, but recently it has also had a negative correlation recently with tech stocks. When the 10-year yield edged higher, tech went lower.\n*****\n&gt; # All eyes on earnings\n&gt; \u201cThe macro calendar is pretty light. I think attention will turn to earnings pretty quickly,\u201d said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi U.S. Wealth Management. \u201cThat will be the next thing to turn to.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market is often weaker just ahead of earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; First quarter earnings are expected to be up 24.2% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. It will be the first quarter where the prior year results included the impact of the pandemic shutdown.\n*****\n&gt; Some strategists expect the earnings season to bring with it more favorable comments from companies that could lead to positive forecast revisions, providing fuel for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApproximately 13 months ago, COVID-19 sent us home from our offices and our kids from school. While the pandemic nearly shut down the world economy, an unprecedented policy response kept the economy afloat, leading to the shortest recessionary decline and the steepest stock market bounce in history,\u201d noted Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said that the 78% rise in the S&amp;P 500 from the bottom last March was driven in a big way by earnings.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn each of the past two recovery periods, the trend of positive revisions lasted 2-3 years, providing an important tailwind for the market,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; He added that economists have continued to revise growth forecasts higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur work shows that every 1% change in GDP drives a 2\u00bd\u20133% change in revenues, and even larger improvements in profits,\u201d Golub wrote.\n*****\n&gt; # April is far from cruelest month\nAside from an expected earnings bounce, some strategists have been expecting April to be a bullish time for stocks, as it has been historically.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Lee, managing partner of Fundstrat, for instance, points to the decline in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange\u2019s Volatility Index, to pre-pandemic levels and says that\u2019s constructive for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; The VIX is calculated based on the puts and the calls in the S&amp;P 500, trading on the CBOE.\n*****\n&gt; Lee also noted that when the market closes higher on March 31, the final day of the first quarter, and again on April 1, the first day of the second quarter, the market has had a better April performance than usual.\n*****\n&gt; Since World War II, when those two days were positive, the S&amp;P 500 rose an average 2.4% for April, versus its usual 1.3% gain, Lee said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe bottom line is this is [a] positive environment and risk/reward for stocks. This keeps us constructive,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the market enters April and the second quarter with a tailwind.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApril is usually good. It\u2019s the best month in terms of average price change. The second quarter is not a bad quarter on average. It\u2019s up 2.8% on average since 1990, and all 11 sectors have posted average gains,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said some of the cyclicals may have gotten ahead of themselves and energy, industrials and financials could pause. Those sectors have been outperforming while tech has been lagging.\n*****\n&gt; The market enters the \u201csell in May\u201d period during the second quarter. The market adage, \u201csell in May and go away,\u201d is based on the idea that stocks tend to underperform from May through October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn that sell in May period, tech has been a pretty good performer.

In fact, it was last year that saw the S&amp;P 500 Index gain an incredible 12.7%, for one of the greatest one-month gains in history. We noted at the time that 10% or greater months tended to usually kick off strength, not mark the end of it like many were claiming last year. Once again, history looks to have rhymed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Just how strong has April been lately? \u201cI had to double check, but sure enough, stocks have closed higher in April an incredible 14 out of the past 15 years,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOther than my Cincinnati Bengals breaking my heart, few things are more consistent than stocks higher in April.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, April is a great month for stocks across the board:\n\n&gt; * Since 1950 it is the second best month\n&gt; * The past 20 years it is the best month\n&gt; * The past 10 years it is the second best month\n&gt; * n a post-election year it ranks fourth out of 12\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog-2-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Taking it a step further, here\u2019s what the average April looks like. It sprints out to impressive gains the first 18 days or so, then it coasts in like Usain Bolt in a race.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Strength Day Before Good Friday Weakness Day After\n\n&gt; Good Friday (and Easter) land at the beginning of April this year. Historically the longer-term track record of Good Friday (page 98 of STA 2021) is bullish with notable average gains by DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 on the trading day before. NASDAQ has advanced 19 of the last 20 days before Good Friday. Monday, the day after Easter has exactly the opposite record since 1980 and is in the running for the worst day after of any holiday. Since 2004 the day after has been improving with S&amp;P 500 up 11 of the last 17. The second day after Easter has exhibited consistent strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/18c936f61eaab75df8a37f82d9dbe999/1d45246093ca4966-9f/s500x750/8c5d6cb1961e8e706f98e686065bf4690a97bded.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Humble Victory Lap\n\n&gt; It has been a little over a year since the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and it was certainly an eventful year, to say the least. It\u2019s also been one year since we at LPL Research upgraded our view on equities from market weight to overweight in Road to Recovery Playbook Update believing there had been a shift in the risk-reward dynamic between stocks and bonds.\n\n&gt; It certainly was not an easy call, and it was made with the S&amp;P 500 rallying roughly 15% from its low. Little did we know however, that the S&amp;P 500 would stage the greatest one year rally in history. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the rally from the 2020 low eclipsed the rallies from the 2009 and 1982 lows, climbing almost 75% since the low:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Investing is a challenging endeavor, one that even the most seasoned and successful participants need to remain ever vigilant, for Mr. Market is always ready to serve a fresh batch of humble pie\u2014a lesson we always keep in mind.\n\n&gt; \u201cFew on the Street were willing to lean into the market turmoil and change their outlook on stocks, but it was a call that paid off for us,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cEven though we turned out to be on the correct side of history, investing is a \u2018what have you done for me lately\u2019 industry, and we have to continue to remain disciplined with our approach.\u201d\n\n&gt; Despite the historic rally off the low, we continue to overweight equities in our portfolios, as the backdrop of an expanding economy and favorable monetary conditions should be supportive of stocks over bonds going forward, but we acknowledge that year 2 of a bull market has a way of challenging investors.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Turn Off, Tune Out\n\n&gt; The first quarter of 2021 comes to a close today, and as fast as time seems to fly, it's been a long one. Take GameStop (GME). It may seem like months and months ago, but it wasn't until late January that the stock started to go crazy as the 'Reddit Rebellion' launched and caused a mad scramble by hedge funds to cover any and all of their short positions. Think about it. In under three months, we've seen at least two large funds (Melvin Capital and Archegos), not to mention the collapse of supply chain finance giant Greensill Capital. Sometimes we go an entire year without blowups of this magnitude.\n\n&gt; Despite the tumultuous headlines and market volatility along with the frustrating churn in the market lately, US equities are finishing off the quarter well. Stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are up an average of 11.9% so far this year and grouped by sector they're all averaging gains. Leading the way higher, stocks in the Energy sector stand apart from every other sector with an average gain of over 20%. After Energy, stocks in the Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors are both up an average of over 15%. On the other side of the chart, sectors underperforming are generally defensive in nature with Health Care and Utilities both averaging YTD gains of less than 5%. One notable underperforming sector given its size is Technology. With an average gain of 7.2% YTD, stocks in the Technology sector are underperforming the broader market by more than 4.5 percentage points.\n\n&gt; Given the underperformance of Technology YTD, we can't help but remember some market 'certainties' over the years that never quite came to fruition. Remember after the initial surge off the lows coming out of the Credit Crisis in 2008 and 2009? While Financials were the best performing sector coming off the lows, the rally in the sector ran out of steam and stalled out. All we kept hearing at the time was that 'the market couldn't rally without the Financials', but rally it did. Now, after Technology outperformed during COVID and through last Summer, the sector has stalled out, and we're hearing the same phrase now as we did back then with the only difference being that Technology has replaced Financials as the sector that the market couldn't rally without. Since September 2nd though, when we first started to see the 'Big Shift' in the market, the S&amp;P 500 has nearly tripled the return of the Technology sector, and despite Tech's underperformance, the S&amp;P 500 has still managed double-digit percentage gains. When it comes to the old conventional wisdom of the market, investors would be best served by doing the opposite of Timothy Leary by 'turning off' and 'tuning out' all the noise.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/avgsectors.png))**\n\n&gt; In the tables below, we list the top and bottom twenty performing S&amp;P 500 stocks so far this year. Starting with the winners, L Brands (LB) and Marathon (MRO) are both already up over 60%, while another five stocks have rallied 50%+. With the exception of HollyFrontier (HFC), which is up 39.9%, every other one of the top 20 stocks is up over 40% - in just three months! What's most notable about this table, though, isn't what's on it, but what isn't. Technology has a larger number of components in the S&amp;P 500 than any other sector, but only one stock from the sector - Applied Materials (AMAT) - made the list of top performers, and only one other besides AMAT (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) made the top 50.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Best-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n&gt; At the other end of the spectrum, there are only 13 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are down over 10% YTD, and the 20th worst-performing stock is down less than 9%. And while there was only little representation from the Technology sector on the list of biggest YTD winners above, there's no shortage on the list of losers with eight of the twenty coming from that sector. It's only been three months, but stretching back to early last September, the market has gotten along just fine without the help of Technology.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Worst-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Are the Financials and Energy Sectors Due for Rotation?\n\n&gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup and an earlier post, the Energy sector far and away has been the best performing S&amp;P 500 sector in Q1. The sector is on pace to close out the quarter with a gain of just under 30%. That is nearly double the return of the next best performing sector: Financials. Granted, Financials have likewise been on an impressive run, gaining over 15%.\n\n&gt; As shown in the charts below, going back to at least 1990, Q1 of 2021 is on pace to go down as the Energy sector's single largest quarterly gain on record. Amazingly, the next two quarters that stand as runners-up have both come within the past year. Those were last quarter when the sector rose 25.78% and Q2 of 2020 when it rallied 28.68%. For the Financial sector, this quarter's gain stands in the top decile of all quarterly moves of the past three decades, and that follows last quarter's 22.52% gain which stands in the top 5%. As shown in the charts below, for both sectors, gains of 15% or more in a single quarter have been fairly uncommon with only a handful of past instances.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Bars-Sectors2.png))**\n\n&gt; That brings to question if strong runs in one quarter result in rotation out of those sectors the following quarter. In the tables below, we show the performance of the Financials and Energy sectors from the end of quarters with gains of 15% or more. Starting with a look at Financials, that rotation has not necessarily always occurred as the sector has consistently risen over the following three months. Of the ten prior instances, there have only been two quarters, Q3 2009 and Q1 2012, in which Financials were lower by the end of the next quarter. Those were also some of the few times that Financials were lower at the end of the first and second month of the quarter. We would note, though, that the current instance is also the first time since 2009 that there have been back-to-back quarters that the sector has seen gains of 15% or more. Back during that last occurrence (Q3 2009), returns were in fact weaker after that second quarter of large gains.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Fin-2a.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the Energy sector, of the nine prior instances where the sector rallied over 15%, this was the first time with two sequential quarters boasting 15% or larger gains. Additionally, rotation out of Energy stocks has been far more commonplace. As shown in the table below, from the conclusion of those quarters with big gains, the sector has averaged a decline throughout the next quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Energy-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks and Inflation\n\n&gt; As we continue LPL Research\u2019s Inflation Week, today we will examine how stocks have historically done at different inflation levels. For more color on our views on inflation, please read here and here, and look out for tomorrow\u2019s blog, where we\u2019ll examine some of the factors that have kept inflation low and that will likely continue to put a lid on inflation in the future.\n\n&gt; Looking at S&amp;P 500 Index returns going back to 1950, stocks have tended to like low inflation. As shown below, the lower inflation is, the better the S&amp;P 500 Index returns tend to be, although the strong performance for negative inflation may be due to markets rebounding off of lows. Taking it a step further, if inflation is trending lower, then stocks do much better (18.8% on average) versus if inflation is trending higher (6.4% on average).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cYou can\u2019t argue with history, as it sure appears that inflation that\u2019s under control is a tailwind for stocks,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIt is when inflation starts to turn higher that it can knock stocks down. Given our base case is for modest inflation, this is another feather in the cap for the bulls.\u201d\n\n&gt; Looking at a scatter plot of inflation and the S&amp;P 500, there is a fairly wide dispersion in some cases, so this is by no means a perfect indicator. Still, the regression line moves from the upper left to the lower right, suggesting lower inflation indeed historically has benefitted stocks more than higher inflation.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The inflation question is one that isn\u2019t going away, especially as the US continues to add more fiscal and monetary stimulus. Although this isn\u2019t a very consensus call, we think inflation will be capped once we get past 2021 and this should help stocks overall.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 2nd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4.4.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd1mS00Cw_E))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$STZ** \n&gt; * **$SCHN** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$LNN** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$CAG** \n&gt; * **$GBX** \n&gt; * **$MSM** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$DCT** \n&gt; * **$LW** \n&gt; * **$SGH** \n&gt; * **$APOG** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$LNDC** \n&gt; * **$RGP** \n&gt; * **$PLUS** \n&gt; * **$NTIC** \n&gt; * **$MAXN** \n&gt; * **$EVAX** \n&gt; * **$MITO** \n&gt; * **$JKS** \n&gt; * **$JFIN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DzPTCDd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EFoYhPI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS MONTH'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IAo7GlZ.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n( NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/LGaokuS.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  4.6.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eu0hmtC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ew3RuFT.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q9506N2.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2URCkYe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hcSTJcm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJ2s00r.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.9.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wEoA0Ew.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.9.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MdchFK4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Paychex, Inc. $98.76\n**Paychex, Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 5th, 2021.\n\n# **Blowout jobs report could power stocks higher in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/blowout-jobs-report-could-power-stocks-higher-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; April started off with a rally, and the market could continue to notch gains as the month gets underway, strategists say.\n*****\n&gt; The U.S. Labor Department\u2019s surprisingly strong March jobs report this Friday showed that there were 916,000 jobs added in March, compared to the 675,000 expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is expected to be fairly quiet, with a few economic reports and Federal Reserve speakers filling the lull before earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s service sector survey will be released next Monday and should get close attention after institute\u2019s manufacturing survey came in at the highest level since 1983. Minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting will be released next Wednesday afternoon.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cLiterally everything, or almost everything, should be very robust for the foreseeable future, I would think. We\u2019re coming off a low base,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a very strong second quarter as the economy reopens and stimulus spending kicks in, and that should be positive for stocks \u2014 unless interest rates rise too quickly.\n*****\n&gt; Major stock indices were sharply higher as the calendar rolled into April.\n*****\n&gt; On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2% to a new record close of 4,019.87. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 170 points, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.8%.\n*****\n&gt; The closely watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, was higher at 1.68% Friday morning, well below recent high of 1.77% reached earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year is important because it influences mortgages and other loans, but recently it has also had a negative correlation recently with tech stocks. When the 10-year yield edged higher, tech went lower.\n*****\n&gt; # All eyes on earnings\n&gt; \u201cThe macro calendar is pretty light. I think attention will turn to earnings pretty quickly,\u201d said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi U.S. Wealth Management. \u201cThat will be the next thing to turn to.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market is often weaker just ahead of earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; First quarter earnings are expected to be up 24.2% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. It will be the first quarter where the prior year results included the impact of the pandemic shutdown.\n*****\n&gt; Some strategists expect the earnings season to bring with it more favorable comments from companies that could lead to positive forecast revisions, providing fuel for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApproximately 13 months ago, COVID-19 sent us home from our offices and our kids from school. While the pandemic nearly shut down the world economy, an unprecedented policy response kept the economy afloat, leading to the shortest recessionary decline and the steepest stock market bounce in history,\u201d noted Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said that the 78% rise in the S&amp;P 500 from the bottom last March was driven in a big way by earnings.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn each of the past two recovery periods, the trend of positive revisions lasted 2-3 years, providing an important tailwind for the market,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; He added that economists have continued to revise growth forecasts higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur work shows that every 1% change in GDP drives a 2\u00bd\u20133% change in revenues, and even larger improvements in profits,\u201d Golub wrote.\n*****\n&gt; # April is far from cruelest month\nAside from an expected earnings bounce, some strategists have been expecting April to be a bullish time for stocks, as it has been historically.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Lee, managing partner of Fundstrat, for instance, points to the decline in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange\u2019s Volatility Index, to pre-pandemic levels and says that\u2019s constructive for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; The VIX is calculated based on the puts and the calls in the S&amp;P 500, trading on the CBOE.\n*****\n&gt; Lee also noted that when the market closes higher on March 31, the final day of the first quarter, and again on April 1, the first day of the second quarter, the market has had a better April performance than usual.\n*****\n&gt; Since World War II, when those two days were positive, the S&amp;P 500 rose an average 2.4% for April, versus its usual 1.3% gain, Lee said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe bottom line is this is [a] positive environment and risk/reward for stocks. This keeps us constructive,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the market enters April and the second quarter with a tailwind.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApril is usually good. It\u2019s the best month in terms of average price change. The second quarter is not a bad quarter on average. It\u2019s up 2.8% on average since 1990, and all 11 sectors have posted average gains,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said some of the cyclicals may have gotten ahead of themselves and energy, industrials and financials could pause. Those sectors have been outperforming while tech has been lagging.\n*****\n&gt; The market enters the \u201csell in May\u201d period during the second quarter. The market adage, \u201csell in May and go away,\u201d is based on the idea that stocks tend to underperform from May through October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn that sell in May period, tech has been a pretty good performer. Now is probably not the time to begin bailing out of tech,\u201d Stovall said. \u201cTech could end up receiving a near-term reprieve.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and investors will review them for any fresh comments on inflation. With prices for fuel and other commodities already rising, investors are becoming concerned that more stimulus could send inflation higher.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said after the March meeting that the Fed sees inflationary pressures as transient, but the markets are still concerned that it could become a bigger issue. Inflation is currently well below the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\n*****\n&gt; The producer price index \u2014 which gauges the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output \u2014 will also be watched closely when it is reported Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As for Fed speakers, Powell is expected to discuss the global economy on an International Monetary Fund panel Thursday, which will be moderated by CNBC\u2019s Sara Eisen.\n*****\n&gt; Other central bank speakers include Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who speaks Tuesday and Wednesday, and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin who speaks Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks on a Chicago Council on Global Affairs webinar Monday on the economic recovery Monday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/W5VnHdw.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/OWAqXe4.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/seUECBP.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/8x71bbA.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/B0iQJ5r.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/walbCuS.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pBIopWq.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mZ6A4CJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H4WjcRK.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DzPTCDd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5iiOoya.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Mx4A08w.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/JR37Qxb.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/EHPQCzz.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks Love April\n\n&gt; \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.\u201d Mark Twain\n\n&gt; What more can we say other than few months have been kinder to stocks lately than the month of April. In fact, it was last year that saw the S&amp;P 500 Index gain an incredible 12.7%, for one of the greatest one-month gains in history. We noted at the time that 10% or greater months tended to usually kick off strength, not mark the end of it like many were claiming last year. Once again, history looks to have rhymed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Just how strong has April been lately? \u201cI had to double check, but sure enough, stocks have closed higher in April an incredible 14 out of the past 15 years,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOther than my Cincinnati Bengals breaking my heart, few things are more consistent than stocks higher in April.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, April is a great month for stocks across the board:\n\n&gt; * Since 1950 it is the second best month\n&gt; * The past 20 years it is the best month\n&gt; * The past 10 years it is the second best month\n&gt; * n a post-election year it ranks fourth out of 12\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog-2-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Taking it a step further, here\u2019s what the average April looks like. It sprints out to impressive gains the first 18 days or so, then it coasts in like Usain Bolt in a race.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Strength Day Before Good Friday Weakness Day After\n\n&gt; Good Friday (and Easter) land at the beginning of April this year. Historically the longer-term track record of Good Friday (page 98 of STA 2021) is bullish with notable average gains by DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 on the trading day before. NASDAQ has advanced 19 of the last 20 days before Good Friday. Monday, the day after Easter has exactly the opposite record since 1980 and is in the running for the worst day after of any holiday. Since 2004 the day after has been improving with S&amp;P 500 up 11 of the last 17. The second day after Easter has exhibited consistent strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/18c936f61eaab75df8a37f82d9dbe999/1d45246093ca4966-9f/s500x750/8c5d6cb1961e8e706f98e686065bf4690a97bded.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Humble Victory Lap\n\n&gt; It has been a little over a year since the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and it was certainly an eventful year, to say the least. It\u2019s also been one year since we at LPL Research upgraded our view on equities from market weight to overweight in Road to Recovery Playbook Update believing there had been a shift in the risk-reward dynamic between stocks and bonds.\n\n&gt; It certainly was not an easy call, and it was made with the S&amp;P 500 rallying roughly 15% from its low. Little did we know however, that the S&amp;P 500 would stage the greatest one year rally in history. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the rally from the 2020 low eclipsed the rallies from the 2009 and 1982 lows, climbing almost 75% since the low:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Investing is a challenging endeavor, one that even the most seasoned and successful participants need to remain ever vigilant, for Mr. Market is always ready to serve a fresh batch of humble pie\u2014a lesson we always keep in mind.\n\n&gt; \u201cFew on the Street were willing to lean into the market turmoil and change their outlook on stocks, but it was a call that paid off for us,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cEven though we turned out to be on the correct side of history, investing is a \u2018what have you done for me lately\u2019 industry, and we have to continue to remain disciplined with our approach.\u201d\n\n&gt; Despite the historic rally off the low, we continue to overweight equities in our portfolios, as the backdrop of an expanding economy and favorable monetary conditions should be supportive of stocks over bonds going forward, but we acknowledge that year 2 of a bull market has a way of challenging investors.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Turn Off, Tune Out\n\n&gt; The first quarter of 2021 comes to a close today, and as fast as time seems to fly, it's been a long one. Take GameStop (GME). It may seem like months and months ago, but it wasn't until late January that the stock started to go crazy as the 'Reddit Rebellion' launched and caused a mad scramble by hedge funds to cover any and all of their short positions. Think about it. In under three months, we've seen at least two large funds (Melvin Capital and Archegos), not to mention the collapse of supply chain finance giant Greensill Capital. Sometimes we go an entire year without blowups of this magnitude.\n\n&gt; Despite the tumultuous headlines and market volatility along with the frustrating churn in the market lately, US equities are finishing off the quarter well. Stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are up an average of 11.9% so far this year and grouped by sector they're all averaging gains. Leading the way higher, stocks in the Energy sector stand apart from every other sector with an average gain of over 20%. After Energy, stocks in the Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors are both up an average of over 15%. On the other side of the chart, sectors underperforming are generally defensive in nature with Health Care and Utilities both averaging YTD gains of less than 5%. One notable underperforming sector given its size is Technology. With an average gain of 7.2% YTD, stocks in the Technology sector are underperforming the broader market by more than 4.5 percentage points.\n\n&gt; Given the underperformance of Technology YTD, we can't help but remember some market 'certainties' over the years that never quite came to fruition. Remember after the initial surge off the lows coming out of the Credit Crisis in 2008 and 2009? While Financials were the best performing sector coming off the lows, the rally in the sector ran out of steam and stalled out. All we kept hearing at the time was that 'the market couldn't rally without the Financials', but rally it did. Now, after Technology outperformed during COVID and through last Summer, the sector has stalled out, and we're hearing the same phrase now as we did back then with the only difference being that Technology has replaced Financials as the sector that the market couldn't rally without. Since September 2nd though, when we first started to see the 'Big Shift' in the market, the S&amp;P 500 has nearly tripled the return of the Technology sector, and despite Tech's underperformance, the S&amp;P 500 has still managed double-digit percentage gains. When it comes to the old conventional wisdom of the market, investors would be best served by doing the opposite of Timothy Leary by 'turning off' and 'tuning out' all the noise.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/avgsectors.png))**\n\n&gt; In the tables below, we list the top and bottom twenty performing S&amp;P 500 stocks so far this year. Starting with the winners, L Brands (LB) and Marathon (MRO) are both already up over 60%, while another five stocks have rallied 50%+. With the exception of HollyFrontier (HFC), which is up 39.9%, every other one of the top 20 stocks is up over 40% - in just three months! What's most notable about this table, though, isn't what's on it, but what isn't. Technology has a larger number of components in the S&amp;P 500 than any other sector, but only one stock from the sector - Applied Materials (AMAT) - made the list of top performers, and only one other besides AMAT (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) made the top 50.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Best-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n&gt; At the other end of the spectrum, there are only 13 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are down over 10% YTD, and the 20th worst-performing stock is down less than 9%. And while there was only little representation from the Technology sector on the list of biggest YTD winners above, there's no shortage on the list of losers with eight of the twenty coming from that sector. It's only been three months, but stretching back to early last September, the market has gotten along just fine without the help of Technology.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Worst-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Are the Financials and Energy Sectors Due for Rotation?\n\n&gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup and an earlier post, the Energy sector far and away has been the best performing S&amp;P 500 sector in Q1. The sector is on pace to close out the quarter with a gain of just under 30%. That is nearly double the return of the next best performing sector: Financials. Granted, Financials have likewise been on an impressive run, gaining over 15%.\n\n&gt; As shown in the charts below, going back to at least 1990, Q1 of 2021 is on pace to go down as the Energy sector's single largest quarterly gain on record. Amazingly, the next two quarters that stand as runners-up have both come within the past year. Those were last quarter when the sector rose 25.78% and Q2 of 2020 when it rallied 28.68%. For the Financial sector, this quarter's gain stands in the top decile of all quarterly moves of the past three decades, and that follows last quarter's 22.52% gain which stands in the top 5%. As shown in the charts below, for both sectors, gains of 15% or more in a single quarter have been fairly uncommon with only a handful of past instances.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Bars-Sectors2.png))**\n\n&gt; That brings to question if strong runs in one quarter result in rotation out of those sectors the following quarter. In the tables below, we show the performance of the Financials and Energy sectors from the end of quarters with gains of 15% or more. Starting with a look at Financials, that rotation has not necessarily always occurred as the sector has consistently risen over the following three months. Of the ten prior instances, there have only been two quarters, Q3 2009 and Q1 2012, in which Financials were lower by the end of the next quarter. Those were also some of the few times that Financials were lower at the end of the first and second month of the quarter. We would note, though, that the current instance is also the first time since 2009 that there have been back-to-back quarters that the sector has seen gains of 15% or more. Back during that last occurrence (Q3 2009), returns were in fact weaker after that second quarter of large gains.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Fin-2a.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the Energy sector, of the nine prior instances where the sector rallied over 15%, this was the first time with two sequential quarters boasting 15% or larger gains. Additionally, rotation out of Energy stocks has been far more commonplace. As shown in the table below, from the conclusion of those quarters with big gains, the sector has averaged a decline throughout the next quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Energy-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks and Inflation\n\n&gt; As we continue LPL Research\u2019s Inflation Week, today we will examine how stocks have historically done at different inflation levels. For more color on our views on inflation, please read here and here, and look out for tomorrow\u2019s blog, where we\u2019ll examine some of the factors that have kept inflation low and that will likely continue to put a lid on inflation in the future.\n\n&gt; Looking at S&amp;P 500 Index returns going back to 1950, stocks have tended to like low inflation. As shown below, the lower inflation is, the better the S&amp;P 500 Index returns tend to be, although the strong performance for negative inflation may be due to markets rebounding off of lows. Taking it a step further, if inflation is trending lower, then stocks do much better (18.8% on average) versus if inflation is trending higher (6.4% on average).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cYou can\u2019t argue with history, as it sure appears that inflation that\u2019s under control is a tailwind for stocks,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIt is when inflation starts to turn higher that it can knock stocks down. Given our base case is for modest inflation, this is another feather in the cap for the bulls.\u201d\n\n&gt; Looking at a scatter plot of inflation and the S&amp;P 500, there is a fairly wide dispersion in some cases, so this is by no means a perfect indicator. Still, the regression line moves from the upper left to the lower right, suggesting lower inflation indeed historically has benefitted stocks more than higher inflation.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The inflation question is one that isn\u2019t going away, especially as the US continues to add more fiscal and monetary stimulus. Although this isn\u2019t a very consensus call, we think inflation will be capped once we get past 2021 and this should help stocks overall.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 2nd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4.4.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd1mS00Cw_E))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$STZ** \n&gt; * **$SCHN** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$LNN** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$CAG** \n&gt; * **$GBX** \n&gt; * **$MSM** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$DCT** \n&gt; * **$LW** \n&gt; * **$SGH** \n&gt; * **$APOG** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$LNDC** \n&gt; * **$RGP** \n&gt; * **$PLUS** \n&gt; * **$NTIC** \n&gt; * **$MAXN** \n&gt; * **$EVAX** \n&gt; * **$MITO** \n&gt; * **$JKS** \n&gt; * **$JFIN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DzPTCDd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EFoYhPI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS MONTH'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IAo7GlZ.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n( NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/LGaokuS.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  4.6.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eu0hmtC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ew3RuFT.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q9506N2.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2URCkYe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hcSTJcm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJ2s00r.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.9.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wEoA0Ew.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.9.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MdchFK4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Paychex, Inc. $98.76\n**Paychex, Inc.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 5th, 2021.\n\n# **Blowout jobs report could power stocks higher in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/blowout-jobs-report-could-power-stocks-higher-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; April started off with a rally, and the market could continue to notch gains as the month gets underway, strategists say.\n*****\n&gt; The U.S. Labor Department\u2019s surprisingly strong March jobs report this Friday showed that there were 916,000 jobs added in March, compared to the 675,000 expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is expected to be fairly quiet, with a few economic reports and Federal Reserve speakers filling the lull before earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s service sector survey will be released next Monday and should get close attention after institute\u2019s manufacturing survey came in at the highest level since 1983. Minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting will be released next Wednesday afternoon.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cLiterally everything, or almost everything, should be very robust for the foreseeable future, I would think. We\u2019re coming off a low base,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a very strong second quarter as the economy reopens and stimulus spending kicks in, and that should be positive for stocks \u2014 unless interest rates rise too quickly.\n*****\n&gt; Major stock indices were sharply higher as the calendar rolled into April.\n*****\n&gt; On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2% to a new record close of 4,019.87. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 170 points, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.8%.\n*****\n&gt; The closely watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, was higher at 1.68% Friday morning, well below recent high of 1.77% reached earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year is important because it influences mortgages and other loans, but recently it has also had a negative correlation recently with tech stocks. When the 10-year yield edged higher, tech went lower.\n*****\n&gt; # All eyes on earnings\n&gt; \u201cThe macro calendar is pretty light. I think attention will turn to earnings pretty quickly,\u201d said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi U.S. Wealth Management. \u201cThat will be the next thing to turn to.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market is often weaker just ahead of earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; First quarter earnings are expected to be up 24.2% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. It will be the first quarter where the prior year results included the impact of the pandemic shutdown.\n*****\n&gt; Some strategists expect the earnings season to bring with it more favorable comments from companies that could lead to positive forecast revisions, providing fuel for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApproximately 13 months ago, COVID-19 sent us home from our offices and our kids from school. While the pandemic nearly shut down the world economy, an unprecedented policy response kept the economy afloat, leading to the shortest recessionary decline and the steepest stock market bounce in history,\u201d noted Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said that the 78% rise in the S&amp;P 500 from the bottom last March was driven in a big way by earnings.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn each of the past two recovery periods, the trend of positive revisions lasted 2-3 years, providing an important tailwind for the market,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; He added that economists have continued to revise growth forecasts higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur work shows that every 1% change in GDP drives a 2\u00bd\u20133% change in revenues, and even larger improvements in profits,\u201d Golub wrote.\n*****\n&gt; # April is far from cruelest month\nAside from an expected earnings bounce, some strategists have been expecting April to be a bullish time for stocks, as it has been historically.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Lee, managing partner of Fundstrat, for instance, points to the decline in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange\u2019s Volatility Index, to pre-pandemic levels and says that\u2019s constructive for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; The VIX is calculated based on the puts and the calls in the S&amp;P 500, trading on the CBOE.\n*****\n&gt; Lee also noted that when the market closes higher on March 31, the final day of the first quarter, and again on April 1, the first day of the second quarter, the market has had a better April performance than usual.\n*****\n&gt; Since World War II, when those two days were positive, the S&amp;P 500 rose an average 2.4% for April, versus its usual 1.3% gain, Lee said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe bottom line is this is [a] positive environment and risk/reward for stocks. This keeps us constructive,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the market enters April and the second quarter with a tailwind.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApril is usually good. It\u2019s the best month in terms of average price change. The second quarter is not a bad quarter on average. It\u2019s up 2.8% on average since 1990, and all 11 sectors have posted average gains,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said some of the cyclicals may have gotten ahead of themselves and energy, industrials and financials could pause. Those sectors have been outperforming while tech has been lagging.\n*****\n&gt; The market enters the \u201csell in May\u201d period during the second quarter. The market adage, \u201csell in May and go away,\u201d is based on the idea that stocks tend to underperform from May through October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn that sell in May period, tech has been a pretty good performer. Now is probably not the time to begin bailing out of tech,\u201d Stovall said. \u201cTech could end up receiving a near-term reprieve.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and investors will review them for any fresh comments on inflation. With prices for fuel and other commodities already rising, investors are becoming concerned that more stimulus could send inflation higher.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said after the March meeting that the Fed sees inflationary pressures as transient, but the markets are still concerned that it could become a bigger issue. Inflation is currently well below the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\n*****\n&gt; The producer price index \u2014 which gauges the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output \u2014 will also be watched closely when it is reported Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As for Fed speakers, Powell is expected to discuss the global economy on an International Monetary Fund panel Thursday, which will be moderated by CNBC\u2019s Sara Eisen.\n*****\n&gt; Other central bank speakers include Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who speaks Tuesday and Wednesday, and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin who speaks Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks on a Chicago Council on Global Affairs webinar Monday on the economic recovery Monday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/W5VnHdw.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/OWAqXe4.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/seUECBP.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/8x71bbA.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/B0iQJ5r.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/walbCuS.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pBIopWq.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mZ6A4CJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H4WjcRK.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DzPTCDd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5iiOoya.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Mx4A08w.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/JR37Qxb.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/EHPQCzz.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks Love April\n\n&gt; \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.\u201d Mark Twain\n\n&gt; What more can we say other than few months have been kinder to stocks lately than the month of April. In fact, it was last year that saw the S&amp;P 500 Index gain an incredible 12.7%, for one of the greatest one-month gains in history. We noted at the time that 10% or greater months tended to usually kick off strength, not mark the end of it like many were claiming last year. Once again, history looks to have rhymed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Just how strong has April been lately? \u201cI had to double check, but sure enough, stocks have closed higher in April an incredible 14 out of the past 15 years,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOther than my Cincinnati Bengals breaking my heart, few things are more consistent than stocks higher in April.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, April is a great month for stocks across the board:\n\n&gt; * Since 1950 it is the second best month\n&gt; * The past 20 years it is the best month\n&gt; * The past 10 years it is the second best month\n&gt; * n a post-election year it ranks fourth out of 12\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog-2-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Taking it a step further, here\u2019s what the average April looks like. It sprints out to impressive gains the first 18 days or so, then it coasts in like Usain Bolt in a race.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Strength Day Before Good Friday Weakness Day After\n\n&gt; Good Friday (and Easter) land at the beginning of April this year. Historically the longer-term track record of Good Friday (page 98 of STA 2021) is bullish with notable average gains by DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 on the trading day before. NASDAQ has advanced 19 of the last 20 days before Good Friday. Monday, the day after Easter has exactly the opposite record since 1980 and is in the running for the worst day after of any holiday. Since 2004 the day after has been improving with S&amp;P 500 up 11 of the last 17. The second day after Easter has exhibited consistent strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/18c936f61eaab75df8a37f82d9dbe999/1d45246093ca4966-9f/s500x750/8c5d6cb1961e8e706f98e686065bf4690a97bded.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Humble Victory Lap\n\n&gt; It has been a little over a year since the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and it was certainly an eventful year, to say the least. It\u2019s also been one year since we at LPL Research upgraded our view on equities from market weight to overweight in Road to Recovery Playbook Update believing there had been a shift in the risk-reward dynamic between stocks and bonds.\n\n&gt; It certainly was not an easy call, and it was made with the S&amp;P 500 rallying roughly 15% from its low. Little did we know however, that the S&amp;P 500 would stage the greatest one year rally in history. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the rally from the 2020 low eclipsed the rallies from the 2009 and 1982 lows, climbing almost 75% since the low:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Investing is a challenging endeavor, one that even the most seasoned and successful participants need to remain ever vigilant, for Mr. Market is always ready to serve a fresh batch of humble pie\u2014a lesson we always keep in mind.\n\n&gt; \u201cFew on the Street were willing to lean into the market turmoil and change their outlook on stocks, but it was a call that paid off for us,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cEven though we turned out to be on the correct side of history, investing is a \u2018what have you done for me lately\u2019 industry, and we have to continue to remain disciplined with our approach.\u201d\n\n&gt; Despite the historic rally off the low, we continue to overweight equities in our portfolios, as the backdrop of an expanding economy and favorable monetary conditions should be supportive of stocks over bonds going forward, but we acknowledge that year 2 of a bull market has a way of challenging investors.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Turn Off, Tune Out\n\n&gt; The first quarter of 2021 comes to a close today, and as fast as time seems to fly, it's been a long one. Take GameStop (GME). It may seem like months and months ago, but it wasn't until late January that the stock started to go crazy as the 'Reddit Rebellion' launched and caused a mad scramble by hedge funds to cover any and all of their short positions. Think about it. In under three months, we've seen at least two large funds (Melvin Capital and Archegos), not to mention the collapse of supply chain finance giant Greensill Capital. Sometimes we go an entire year without blowups of this magnitude.\n\n&gt; Despite the tumultuous headlines and market volatility along with the frustrating churn in the market lately, US equities are finishing off the quarter well. Stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are up an average of 11.9% so far this year and grouped by sector they're all averaging gains. Leading the way higher, stocks in the Energy sector stand apart from every other sector with an average gain of over 20%. After Energy, stocks in the Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors are both up an average of over 15%. On the other side of the chart, sectors underperforming are generally defensive in nature with Health Care and Utilities both averaging YTD gains of less than 5%. One notable underperforming sector given its size is Technology. With an average gain of 7.2% YTD, stocks in the Technology sector are underperforming the broader market by more than 4.5 percentage points.\n\n&gt; Given the underperformance of Technology YTD, we can't help but remember some market 'certainties' over the years that never quite came to fruition. Remember after the initial surge off the lows coming out of the Credit Crisis in 2008 and 2009? While Financials were the best performing sector coming off the lows, the rally in the sector ran out of steam and stalled out. All we kept hearing at the time was that 'the market couldn't rally without the Financials', but rally it did. Now, after Technology outperformed during COVID and through last Summer, the sector has stalled out, and we're hearing the same phrase now as we did back then with the only difference being that Technology has replaced Financials as the sector that the market couldn't rally without. Since September 2nd though, when we first started to see the 'Big Shift' in the market, the S&amp;P 500 has nearly tripled the return of the Technology sector, and despite Tech's underperformance, the S&amp;P 500 has still managed double-digit percentage gains. When it comes to the old conventional wisdom of the market, investors would be best served by doing the opposite of Timothy Leary by 'turning off' and 'tuning out' all the noise.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/avgsectors.png))**\n\n&gt; In the tables below, we list the top and bottom twenty performing S&amp;P 500 stocks so far this year. Starting with the winners, L Brands (LB) and Marathon (MRO) are both already up over 60%, while another five stocks have rallied 50%+. With the exception of HollyFrontier (HFC), which is up 39.9%, every other one of the top 20 stocks is up over 40% - in just three months! What's most notable about this table, though, isn't what's on it, but what isn't. Technology has a larger number of components in the S&amp;P 500 than any other sector, but only one stock from the sector - Applied Materials (AMAT) - made the list of top performers, and only one other besides AMAT (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) made the top 50.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Best-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n&gt; At the other end of the spectrum, there are only 13 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are down over 10% YTD, and the 20th worst-performing stock is down less than 9%. And while there was only little representation from the Technology sector on the list of biggest YTD winners above, there's no shortage on the list of losers with eight of the twenty coming from that sector. It's only been three months, but stretching back to early last September, the market has gotten along just fine without the help of Technology.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Worst-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Are the Financials and Energy Sectors Due for Rotation?\n\n&gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup and an earlier post, the Energy sector far and away has been the best performing S&amp;P 500 sector in Q1. The sector is on pace to close out the quarter with a gain of just under 30%. That is nearly double the return of the next best performing sector: Financials. Granted, Financials have likewise been on an impressive run, gaining over 15%.\n\n&gt; As shown in the charts below, going back to at least 1990, Q1 of 2021 is on pace to go down as the Energy sector's single largest quarterly gain on record. Amazingly, the next two quarters that stand as runners-up have both come within the past year. Those were last quarter when the sector rose 25.78% and Q2 of 2020 when it rallied 28.68%. For the Financial sector, this quarter's gain stands in the top decile of all quarterly moves of the past three decades, and that follows last quarter's 22.52% gain which stands in the top 5%. As shown in the charts below, for both sectors, gains of 15% or more in a single quarter have been fairly uncommon with only a handful of past instances.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Bars-Sectors2.png))**\n\n&gt; That brings to question if strong runs in one quarter result in rotation out of those sectors the following quarter. In the tables below, we show the performance of the Financials and Energy sectors from the end of quarters with gains of 15% or more. Starting with a look at Financials, that rotation has not necessarily always occurred as the sector has consistently risen over the following three months. Of the ten prior instances, there have only been two quarters, Q3 2009 and Q1 2012, in which Financials were lower by the end of the next quarter. Those were also some of the few times that Financials were lower at the end of the first and second month of the quarter. We would note, though, that the current instance is also the first time since 2009 that there have been back-to-back quarters that the sector has seen gains of 15% or more. Back during that last occurrence (Q3 2009), returns were in fact weaker after that second quarter of large gains.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Fin-2a.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the Energy sector, of the nine prior instances where the sector rallied over 15%, this was the first time with two sequential quarters boasting 15% or larger gains. Additionally, rotation out of Energy stocks has been far more commonplace. As shown in the table below, from the conclusion of those quarters with big gains, the sector has averaged a decline throughout the next quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Energy-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks and Inflation\n\n&gt; As we continue LPL Research\u2019s Inflation Week, today we will examine how stocks have historically done at different inflation levels. For more color on our views on inflation, please read here and here, and look out for tomorrow\u2019s blog, where we\u2019ll examine some of the factors that have kept inflation low and that will likely continue to put a lid on inflation in the future.\n\n&gt; Looking at S&amp;P 500 Index returns going back to 1950, stocks have tended to like low inflation. As shown below, the lower inflation is, the better the S&amp;P 500 Index returns tend to be, although the strong performance for negative inflation may be due to markets rebounding off of lows. Taking it a step further, if inflation is trending lower, then stocks do much better (18.8% on average) versus if inflation is trending higher (6.4% on average).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cYou can\u2019t argue with history, as it sure appears that inflation that\u2019s under control is a tailwind for stocks,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIt is when inflation starts to turn higher that it can knock stocks down. Given our base case is for modest inflation, this is another feather in the cap for the bulls.\u201d\n\n&gt; Looking at a scatter plot of inflation and the S&amp;P 500, there is a fairly wide dispersion in some cases, so this is by no means a perfect indicator. Still, the regression line moves from the upper left to the lower right, suggesting lower inflation indeed historically has benefitted stocks more than higher inflation.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The inflation question is one that isn\u2019t going away, especially as the US continues to add more fiscal and monetary stimulus. Although this isn\u2019t a very consensus call, we think inflation will be capped once we get past 2021 and this should help stocks overall.\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DzPTCDd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EFoYhPI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS MONTH'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IAo7GlZ.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n( NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/LGaokuS.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  4.6.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eu0hmtC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ew3RuFT.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q9506N2.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2URCkYe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hcSTJcm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJ2s00r.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.9.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wEoA0Ew.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.9.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MdchFK4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Paychex, Inc. $98.76\n**Paychex, Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 5th, 2021.\n\n# **Blowout jobs report could power stocks higher in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/blowout-jobs-report-could-power-stocks-higher-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; April started off with a rally, and the market could continue to notch gains as the month gets underway, strategists say.\n*****\n&gt; The U.S. Labor Department\u2019s surprisingly strong March jobs report this Friday showed that there were 916,000 jobs added in March, compared to the 675,000 expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is expected to be fairly quiet, with a few economic reports and Federal Reserve speakers filling the lull before earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s service sector survey will be released next Monday and should get close attention after institute\u2019s manufacturing survey came in at the highest level since 1983. Minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting will be released next Wednesday afternoon.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cLiterally everything, or almost everything, should be very robust for the foreseeable future, I would think. We\u2019re coming off a low base,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a very strong second quarter as the economy reopens and stimulus spending kicks in, and that should be positive for stocks \u2014 unless interest rates rise too quickly.\n*****\n&gt; Major stock indices were sharply higher as the calendar rolled into April.\n*****\n&gt; On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2% to a new record close of 4,019.87. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 170 points, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.8%.\n*****\n&gt; The closely watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, was higher at 1.68% Friday morning, well below recent high of 1.77% reached earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year is important because it influences mortgages and other loans, but recently it has also had a negative correlation recently with tech stocks. When the 10-year yield edged higher, tech went lower.\n*****\n&gt; # All eyes on earnings\n&gt; \u201cThe macro calendar is pretty light. I think attention will turn to earnings pretty quickly,\u201d said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi U.S. Wealth Management. \u201cThat will be the next thing to turn to.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market is often weaker just ahead of earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; First quarter earnings are expected to be up 24.2% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. It will be the first quarter where the prior year results included the impact of the pandemic shutdown.\n*****\n&gt; Some strategists expect the earnings season to bring with it more favorable comments from companies that could lead to positive forecast revisions, providing fuel for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApproximately 13 months ago, COVID-19 sent us home from our offices and our kids from school. While the pandemic nearly shut down the world economy, an unprecedented policy response kept the economy afloat, leading to the shortest recessionary decline and the steepest stock market bounce in history,\u201d noted Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said that the 78% rise in the S&amp;P 500 from the bottom last March was driven in a big way by earnings.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn each of the past two recovery periods, the trend of positive revisions lasted 2-3 years, providing an important tailwind for the market,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; He added that economists have continued to revise growth forecasts higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur work shows that every 1% change in GDP drives a 2\u00bd\u20133% change in revenues, and even larger improvements in profits,\u201d Golub wrote.\n*****\n&gt; # April is far from cruelest month\nAside from an expected earnings bounce, some strategists have been expecting April to be a bullish time for stocks, as it has been historically.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Lee, managing partner of Fundstrat, for instance, points to the decline in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange\u2019s Volatility Index, to pre-pandemic levels and says that\u2019s constructive for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; The VIX is calculated based on the puts and the calls in the S&amp;P 500, trading on the CBOE.\n*****\n&gt; Lee also noted that when the market closes higher on March 31, the final day of the first quarter, and again on April 1, the first day of the second quarter, the market has had a better April performance than usual.\n*****\n&gt; Since World War II, when those two days were positive, the S&amp;P 500 rose an average 2.4% for April, versus its usual 1.3% gain, Lee said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe bottom line is this is [a] positive environment and risk/reward for stocks. This keeps us constructive,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the market enters April and the second quarter with a tailwind.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApril is usually good. It\u2019s the best month in terms of average price change. The second quarter is not a bad quarter on average. It\u2019s up 2.8% on average since 1990, and all 11 sectors have posted average gains,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said some of the cyclicals may have gotten ahead of themselves and energy, industrials and financials could pause.

Inflation is currently well below the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\n*****\n&gt; The producer price index \u2014 which gauges the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output \u2014 will also be watched closely when it is reported Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As for Fed speakers, Powell is expected to discuss the global economy on an International Monetary Fund panel Thursday, which will be moderated by CNBC\u2019s Sara Eisen.\n*****\n&gt; Other central bank speakers include Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who speaks Tuesday and Wednesday, and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin who speaks Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks on a Chicago Council on Global Affairs webinar Monday on the economic recovery Monday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/W5VnHdw.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/OWAqXe4.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/seUECBP.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/8x71bbA.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/B0iQJ5r.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/walbCuS.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pBIopWq.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mZ6A4CJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H4WjcRK.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DzPTCDd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5iiOoya.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Mx4A08w.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/JR37Qxb.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/EHPQCzz.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks Love April\n\n&gt; \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.\u201d Mark Twain\n\n&gt; What more can we say other than few months have been kinder to stocks lately than the month of April. In fact, it was last year that saw the S&amp;P 500 Index gain an incredible 12.7%, for one of the greatest one-month gains in history. We noted at the time that 10% or greater months tended to usually kick off strength, not mark the end of it like many were claiming last year. Once again, history looks to have rhymed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Just how strong has April been lately? \u201cI had to double check, but sure enough, stocks have closed higher in April an incredible 14 out of the past 15 years,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOther than my Cincinnati Bengals breaking my heart, few things are more consistent than stocks higher in April.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, April is a great month for stocks across the board:\n\n&gt; * Since 1950 it is the second best month\n&gt; * The past 20 years it is the best month\n&gt; * The past 10 years it is the second best month\n&gt; * n a post-election year it ranks fourth out of 12\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog-2-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Taking it a step further, here\u2019s what the average April looks like. It sprints out to impressive gains the first 18 days or so, then it coasts in like Usain Bolt in a race.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Strength Day Before Good Friday Weakness Day After\n\n&gt; Good Friday (and Easter) land at the beginning of April this year. Historically the longer-term track record of Good Friday (page 98 of STA 2021) is bullish with notable average gains by DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 on the trading day before. NASDAQ has advanced 19 of the last 20 days before Good Friday. Monday, the day after Easter has exactly the opposite record since 1980 and is in the running for the worst day after of any holiday. Since 2004 the day after has been improving with S&amp;P 500 up 11 of the last 17. The second day after Easter has exhibited consistent strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/18c936f61eaab75df8a37f82d9dbe999/1d45246093ca4966-9f/s500x750/8c5d6cb1961e8e706f98e686065bf4690a97bded.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Humble Victory Lap\n\n&gt; It has been a little over a year since the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and it was certainly an eventful year, to say the least. It\u2019s also been one year since we at LPL Research upgraded our view on equities from market weight to overweight in Road to Recovery Playbook Update believing there had been a shift in the risk-reward dynamic between stocks and bonds.\n\n&gt; It certainly was not an easy call, and it was made with the S&amp;P 500 rallying roughly 15% from its low. Little did we know however, that the S&amp;P 500 would stage the greatest one year rally in history. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the rally from the 2020 low eclipsed the rallies from the 2009 and 1982 lows, climbing almost 75% since the low:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Investing is a challenging endeavor, one that even the most seasoned and successful participants need to remain ever vigilant, for Mr. Market is always ready to serve a fresh batch of humble pie\u2014a lesson we always keep in mind.\n\n&gt; \u201cFew on the Street were willing to lean into the market turmoil and change their outlook on stocks, but it was a call that paid off for us,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cEven though we turned out to be on the correct side of history, investing is a \u2018what have you done for me lately\u2019 industry, and we have to continue to remain disciplined with our approach.\u201d\n\n&gt; Despite the historic rally off the low, we continue to overweight equities in our portfolios, as the backdrop of an expanding economy and favorable monetary conditions should be supportive of stocks over bonds going forward, but we acknowledge that year 2 of a bull market has a way of challenging investors.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Turn Off, Tune Out\n\n&gt; The first quarter of 2021 comes to a close today, and as fast as time seems to fly, it's been a long one. Take GameStop (GME). It may seem like months and months ago, but it wasn't until late January that the stock started to go crazy as the 'Reddit Rebellion' launched and caused a mad scramble by hedge funds to cover any and all of their short positions. Think about it. In under three months, we've seen at least two large funds (Melvin Capital and Archegos), not to mention the collapse of supply chain finance giant Greensill Capital. Sometimes we go an entire year without blowups of this magnitude.\n\n&gt; Despite the tumultuous headlines and market volatility along with the frustrating churn in the market lately, US equities are finishing off the quarter well. Stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are up an average of 11.9% so far this year and grouped by sector they're all averaging gains. Leading the way higher, stocks in the Energy sector stand apart from every other sector with an average gain of over 20%. After Energy, stocks in the Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors are both up an average of over 15%. On the other side of the chart, sectors underperforming are generally defensive in nature with Health Care and Utilities both averaging YTD gains of less than 5%. One notable underperforming sector given its size is Technology. With an average gain of 7.2% YTD, stocks in the Technology sector are underperforming the broader market by more than 4.5 percentage points.\n\n&gt; Given the underperformance of Technology YTD, we can't help but remember some market 'certainties' over the years that never quite came to fruition. Remember after the initial surge off the lows coming out of the Credit Crisis in 2008 and 2009? While Financials were the best performing sector coming off the lows, the rally in the sector ran out of steam and stalled out. All we kept hearing at the time was that 'the market couldn't rally without the Financials', but rally it did. Now, after Technology outperformed during COVID and through last Summer, the sector has stalled out, and we're hearing the same phrase now as we did back then with the only difference being that Technology has replaced Financials as the sector that the market couldn't rally without. Since September 2nd though, when we first started to see the 'Big Shift' in the market, the S&amp;P 500 has nearly tripled the return of the Technology sector, and despite Tech's underperformance, the S&amp;P 500 has still managed double-digit percentage gains. When it comes to the old conventional wisdom of the market, investors would be best served by doing the opposite of Timothy Leary by 'turning off' and 'tuning out' all the noise.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/avgsectors.png))**\n\n&gt; In the tables below, we list the top and bottom twenty performing S&amp;P 500 stocks so far this year. Starting with the winners, L Brands (LB) and Marathon (MRO) are both already up over 60%, while another five stocks have rallied 50%+. With the exception of HollyFrontier (HFC), which is up 39.9%, every other one of the top 20 stocks is up over 40% - in just three months! What's most notable about this table, though, isn't what's on it, but what isn't. Technology has a larger number of components in the S&amp;P 500 than any other sector, but only one stock from the sector - Applied Materials (AMAT) - made the list of top performers, and only one other besides AMAT (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) made the top 50.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Best-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n&gt; At the other end of the spectrum, there are only 13 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are down over 10% YTD, and the 20th worst-performing stock is down less than 9%. And while there was only little representation from the Technology sector on the list of biggest YTD winners above, there's no shortage on the list of losers with eight of the twenty coming from that sector. It's only been three months, but stretching back to early last September, the market has gotten along just fine without the help of Technology.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Worst-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Are the Financials and Energy Sectors Due for Rotation?\n\n&gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup and an earlier post, the Energy sector far and away has been the best performing S&amp;P 500 sector in Q1. The sector is on pace to close out the quarter with a gain of just under 30%. That is nearly double the return of the next best performing sector: Financials. Granted, Financials have likewise been on an impressive run, gaining over 15%.\n\n&gt; As shown in the charts below, going back to at least 1990, Q1 of 2021 is on pace to go down as the Energy sector's single largest quarterly gain on record. Amazingly, the next two quarters that stand as runners-up have both come within the past year. Those were last quarter when the sector rose 25.78% and Q2 of 2020 when it rallied 28.68%. For the Financial sector, this quarter's gain stands in the top decile of all quarterly moves of the past three decades, and that follows last quarter's 22.52% gain which stands in the top 5%. As shown in the charts below, for both sectors, gains of 15% or more in a single quarter have been fairly uncommon with only a handful of past instances.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Bars-Sectors2.png))**\n\n&gt; That brings to question if strong runs in one quarter result in rotation out of those sectors the following quarter. In the tables below, we show the performance of the Financials and Energy sectors from the end of quarters with gains of 15% or more. Starting with a look at Financials, that rotation has not necessarily always occurred as the sector has consistently risen over the following three months. Of the ten prior instances, there have only been two quarters, Q3 2009 and Q1 2012, in which Financials were lower by the end of the next quarter. Those were also some of the few times that Financials were lower at the end of the first and second month of the quarter. We would note, though, that the current instance is also the first time since 2009 that there have been back-to-back quarters that the sector has seen gains of 15% or more. Back during that last occurrence (Q3 2009), returns were in fact weaker after that second quarter of large gains.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Fin-2a.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the Energy sector, of the nine prior instances where the sector rallied over 15%, this was the first time with two sequential quarters boasting 15% or larger gains. Additionally, rotation out of Energy stocks has been far more commonplace. As shown in the table below, from the conclusion of those quarters with big gains, the sector has averaged a decline throughout the next quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Energy-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks and Inflation\n\n&gt; As we continue LPL Research\u2019s Inflation Week, today we will examine how stocks have historically done at different inflation levels. For more color on our views on inflation, please read here and here, and look out for tomorrow\u2019s blog, where we\u2019ll examine some of the factors that have kept inflation low and that will likely continue to put a lid on inflation in the future.\n\n&gt; Looking at S&amp;P 500 Index returns going back to 1950, stocks have tended to like low inflation. As shown below, the lower inflation is, the better the S&amp;P 500 Index returns tend to be, although the strong performance for negative inflation may be due to markets rebounding off of lows. Taking it a step further, if inflation is trending lower, then stocks do much better (18.8% on average) versus if inflation is trending higher (6.4% on average).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cYou can\u2019t argue with history, as it sure appears that inflation that\u2019s under control is a tailwind for stocks,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIt is when inflation starts to turn higher that it can knock stocks down. Given our base case is for modest inflation, this is another feather in the cap for the bulls.\u201d\n\n&gt; Looking at a scatter plot of inflation and the S&amp;P 500, there is a fairly wide dispersion in some cases, so this is by no means a perfect indicator. Still, the regression line moves from the upper left to the lower right, suggesting lower inflation indeed historically has benefitted stocks more than higher inflation.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The inflation question is one that isn\u2019t going away, especially as the US continues to add more fiscal and monetary stimulus. Although this isn\u2019t a very consensus call, we think inflation will be capped once we get past 2021 and this should help stocks overall.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 2nd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4.4.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd1mS00Cw_E))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$STZ** \n&gt; * **$SCHN** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$LNN** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$CAG** \n&gt; * **$GBX** \n&gt; * **$MSM** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$DCT** \n&gt; * **$LW** \n&gt; * **$SGH** \n&gt; * **$APOG** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$LNDC** \n&gt; * **$RGP** \n&gt; * **$PLUS** \n&gt; * **$NTIC** \n&gt; * **$MAXN** \n&gt; * **$EVAX** \n&gt; * **$MITO** \n&gt; * **$JKS** \n&gt; * **$JFIN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DzPTCDd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EFoYhPI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS MONTH'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IAo7GlZ.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n( NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/LGaokuS.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  4.6.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eu0hmtC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ew3RuFT.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q9506N2.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2URCkYe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hcSTJcm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJ2s00r.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.9.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wEoA0Ew.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.9.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MdchFK4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Paychex, Inc. $98.76\n**Paychex, Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 5th, 2021.\n\n# **Blowout jobs report could power stocks higher in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/blowout-jobs-report-could-power-stocks-higher-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; April started off with a rally, and the market could continue to notch gains as the month gets underway, strategists say.\n*****\n&gt; The U.S. Labor Department\u2019s surprisingly strong March jobs report this Friday showed that there were 916,000 jobs added in March, compared to the 675,000 expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is expected to be fairly quiet, with a few economic reports and Federal Reserve speakers filling the lull before earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s service sector survey will be released next Monday and should get close attention after institute\u2019s manufacturing survey came in at the highest level since 1983. Minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting will be released next Wednesday afternoon.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cLiterally everything, or almost everything, should be very robust for the foreseeable future, I would think. We\u2019re coming off a low base,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a very strong second quarter as the economy reopens and stimulus spending kicks in, and that should be positive for stocks \u2014 unless interest rates rise too quickly.\n*****\n&gt; Major stock indices were sharply higher as the calendar rolled into April.\n*****\n&gt; On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2% to a new record close of 4,019.87. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 170 points, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.8%.\n*****\n&gt; The closely watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, was higher at 1.68% Friday morning, well below recent high of 1.77% reached earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year is important because it influences mortgages and other loans, but recently it has also had a negative correlation recently with tech stocks. When the 10-year yield edged higher, tech went lower.\n*****\n&gt; # All eyes on earnings\n&gt; \u201cThe macro calendar is pretty light. I think attention will turn to earnings pretty quickly,\u201d said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi U.S. Wealth Management. \u201cThat will be the next thing to turn to.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market is often weaker just ahead of earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; First quarter earnings are expected to be up 24.2% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. It will be the first quarter where the prior year results included the impact of the pandemic shutdown.\n*****\n&gt; Some strategists expect the earnings season to bring with it more favorable comments from companies that could lead to positive forecast revisions, providing fuel for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApproximately 13 months ago, COVID-19 sent us home from our offices and our kids from school. While the pandemic nearly shut down the world economy, an unprecedented policy response kept the economy afloat, leading to the shortest recessionary decline and the steepest stock market bounce in history,\u201d noted Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said that the 78% rise in the S&amp;P 500 from the bottom last March was driven in a big way by earnings.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn each of the past two recovery periods, the trend of positive revisions lasted 2-3 years, providing an important tailwind for the market,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; He added that economists have continued to revise growth forecasts higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur work shows that every 1% change in GDP drives a 2\u00bd\u20133% change in revenues, and even larger improvements in profits,\u201d Golub wrote.\n*****\n&gt; # April is far from cruelest month\nAside from an expected earnings bounce, some strategists have been expecting April to be a bullish time for stocks, as it has been historically.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Lee, managing partner of Fundstrat, for instance, points to the decline in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange\u2019s Volatility Index, to pre-pandemic levels and says that\u2019s constructive for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; The VIX is calculated based on the puts and the calls in the S&amp;P 500, trading on the CBOE.\n*****\n&gt; Lee also noted that when the market closes higher on March 31, the final day of the first quarter, and again on April 1, the first day of the second quarter, the market has had a better April performance than usual.\n*****\n&gt; Since World War II, when those two days were positive, the S&amp;P 500 rose an average 2.4% for April, versus its usual 1.3% gain, Lee said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe bottom line is this is [a] positive environment and risk/reward for stocks. This keeps us constructive,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the market enters April and the second quarter with a tailwind.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApril is usually good. It\u2019s the best month in terms of average price change. The second quarter is not a bad quarter on average. It\u2019s up 2.8% on average since 1990, and all 11 sectors have posted average gains,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said some of the cyclicals may have gotten ahead of themselves and energy, industrials and financials could pause. Those sectors have been outperforming while tech has been lagging.\n*****\n&gt; The market enters the \u201csell in May\u201d period during the second quarter. The market adage, \u201csell in May and go away,\u201d is based on the idea that stocks tend to underperform from May through October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn that sell in May period, tech has been a pretty good performer. Now is probably not the time to begin bailing out of tech,\u201d Stovall said. \u201cTech could end up receiving a near-term reprieve.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and investors will review them for any fresh comments on inflation. With prices for fuel and other commodities already rising, investors are becoming concerned that more stimulus could send inflation higher.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said after the March meeting that the Fed sees inflationary pressures as transient, but the markets are still concerned that it could become a bigger issue. Inflation is currently well below the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\n*****\n&gt; The producer price index \u2014 which gauges the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output \u2014 will also be watched closely when it is reported Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As for Fed speakers, Powell is expected to discuss the global economy on an International Monetary Fund panel Thursday, which will be moderated by CNBC\u2019s Sara Eisen.\n*****\n&gt; Other central bank speakers include Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who speaks Tuesday and Wednesday, and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin who speaks Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks on a Chicago Council on Global Affairs webinar Monday on the economic recovery Monday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/W5VnHdw.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/OWAqXe4.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/seUECBP.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/8x71bbA.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/B0iQJ5r.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/walbCuS.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pBIopWq.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mZ6A4CJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H4WjcRK.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DzPTCDd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5iiOoya.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Mx4A08w.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/JR37Qxb.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/EHPQCzz.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks Love April\n\n&gt; \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.\u201d Mark Twain\n\n&gt; What more can we say other than few months have been kinder to stocks lately than the month of April. In fact, it was last year that saw the S&amp;P 500 Index gain an incredible 12.7%, for one of the greatest one-month gains in history. We noted at the time that 10% or greater months tended to usually kick off strength, not mark the end of it like many were claiming last year. Once again, history looks to have rhymed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Just how strong has April been lately? \u201cI had to double check, but sure enough, stocks have closed higher in April an incredible 14 out of the past 15 years,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOther than my Cincinnati Bengals breaking my heart, few things are more consistent than stocks higher in April.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, April is a great month for stocks across the board:\n\n&gt; * Since 1950 it is the second best month\n&gt; * The past 20 years it is the best month\n&gt; * The past 10 years it is the second best month\n&gt; * n a post-election year it ranks fourth out of 12\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog-2-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Taking it a step further, here\u2019s what the average April looks like. It sprints out to impressive gains the first 18 days or so, then it coasts in like Usain Bolt in a race.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Strength Day Before Good Friday Weakness Day After\n\n&gt; Good Friday (and Easter) land at the beginning of April this year. Historically the longer-term track record of Good Friday (page 98 of STA 2021) is bullish with notable average gains by DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 on the trading day before. NASDAQ has advanced 19 of the last 20 days before Good Friday. Monday, the day after Easter has exactly the opposite record since 1980 and is in the running for the worst day after of any holiday. Since 2004 the day after has been improving with S&amp;P 500 up 11 of the last 17. The second day after Easter has exhibited consistent strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/18c936f61eaab75df8a37f82d9dbe999/1d45246093ca4966-9f/s500x750/8c5d6cb1961e8e706f98e686065bf4690a97bded.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Humble Victory Lap\n\n&gt; It has been a little over a year since the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and it was certainly an eventful year, to say the least. It\u2019s also been one year since we at LPL Research upgraded our view on equities from market weight to overweight in Road to Recovery Playbook Update believing there had been a shift in the risk-reward dynamic between stocks and bonds.\n\n&gt; It certainly was not an easy call, and it was made with the S&amp;P 500 rallying roughly 15% from its low. Little did we know however, that the S&amp;P 500 would stage the greatest one year rally in history. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the rally from the 2020 low eclipsed the rallies from the 2009 and 1982 lows, climbing almost 75% since the low:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Investing is a challenging endeavor, one that even the most seasoned and successful participants need to remain ever vigilant, for Mr. Market is always ready to serve a fresh batch of humble pie\u2014a lesson we always keep in mind.\n\n&gt; \u201cFew on the Street were willing to lean into the market turmoil and change their outlook on stocks, but it was a call that paid off for us,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cEven though we turned out to be on the correct side of history, investing is a \u2018what have you done for me lately\u2019 industry, and we have to continue to remain disciplined with our approach.\u201d\n\n&gt; Despite the historic rally off the low, we continue to overweight equities in our portfolios, as the backdrop of an expanding economy and favorable monetary conditions should be supportive of stocks over bonds going forward, but we acknowledge that year 2 of a bull market has a way of challenging investors.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Turn Off, Tune Out\n\n&gt; The first quarter of 2021 comes to a close today, and as fast as time seems to fly, it's been a long one. Take GameStop (GME). It may seem like months and months ago, but it wasn't until late January that the stock started to go crazy as the 'Reddit Rebellion' launched and caused a mad scramble by hedge funds to cover any and all of their short positions. Think about it. In under three months, we've seen at least two large funds (Melvin Capital and Archegos), not to mention the collapse of supply chain finance giant Greensill Capital. Sometimes we go an entire year without blowups of this magnitude.\n\n&gt; Despite the tumultuous headlines and market volatility along with the frustrating churn in the market lately, US equities are finishing off the quarter well. Stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are up an average of 11.9% so far this year and grouped by sector they're all averaging gains. Leading the way higher, stocks in the Energy sector stand apart from every other sector with an average gain of over 20%. After Energy, stocks in the Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors are both up an average of over 15%. On the other side of the chart, sectors underperforming are generally defensive in nature with Health Care and Utilities both averaging YTD gains of less than 5%. One notable underperforming sector given its size is Technology. With an average gain of 7.2% YTD, stocks in the Technology sector are underperforming the broader market by more than 4.5 percentage points.\n\n&gt; Given the underperformance of Technology YTD, we can't help but remember some market 'certainties' over the years that never quite came to fruition. Remember after the initial surge off the lows coming out of the Credit Crisis in 2008 and 2009? While Financials were the best performing sector coming off the lows, the rally in the sector ran out of steam and stalled out. All we kept hearing at the time was that 'the market couldn't rally without the Financials', but rally it did. Now, after Technology outperformed during COVID and through last Summer, the sector has stalled out, and we're hearing the same phrase now as we did back then with the only difference being that Technology has replaced Financials as the sector that the market couldn't rally without. Since September 2nd though, when we first started to see the 'Big Shift' in the market, the S&amp;P 500 has nearly tripled the return of the Technology sector, and despite Tech's underperformance, the S&amp;P 500 has still managed double-digit percentage gains. When it comes to the old conventional wisdom of the market, investors would be best served by doing the opposite of Timothy Leary by 'turning off' and 'tuning out' all the noise.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/avgsectors.png))**\n\n&gt; In the tables below, we list the top and bottom twenty performing S&amp;P 500 stocks so far this year. Starting with the winners, L Brands (LB) and Marathon (MRO) are both already up over 60%, while another five stocks have rallied 50%+. With the exception of HollyFrontier (HFC), which is up 39.9%, every other one of the top 20 stocks is up over 40% - in just three months! What's most notable about this table, though, isn't what's on it, but what isn't. Technology has a larger number of components in the S&amp;P 500 than any other sector, but only one stock from the sector - Applied Materials (AMAT) - made the list of top performers, and only one other besides AMAT (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) made the top 50.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Best-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n&gt; At the other end of the spectrum, there are only 13 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are down over 10% YTD, and the 20th worst-performing stock is down less than 9%. And while there was only little representation from the Technology sector on the list of biggest YTD winners above, there's no shortage on the list of losers with eight of the twenty coming from that sector. It's only been three months, but stretching back to early last September, the market has gotten along just fine without the help of Technology.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Worst-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Are the Financials and Energy Sectors Due for Rotation?\n\n&gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup and an earlier post, the Energy sector far and away has been the best performing S&amp;P 500 sector in Q1. The sector is on pace to close out the quarter with a gain of just under 30%. That is nearly double the return of the next best performing sector: Financials. Granted, Financials have likewise been on an impressive run, gaining over 15%.\n\n&gt; As shown in the charts below, going back to at least 1990, Q1 of 2021 is on pace to go down as the Energy sector's single largest quarterly gain on record. Amazingly, the next two quarters that stand as runners-up have both come within the past year. Those were last quarter when the sector rose 25.78% and Q2 of 2020 when it rallied 28.68%. For the Financial sector, this quarter's gain stands in the top decile of all quarterly moves of the past three decades, and that follows last quarter's 22.52% gain which stands in the top 5%. As shown in the charts below, for both sectors, gains of 15% or more in a single quarter have been fairly uncommon with only a handful of past instances.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Bars-Sectors2.png))**\n\n&gt; That brings to question if strong runs in one quarter result in rotation out of those sectors the following quarter. In the tables below, we show the performance of the Financials and Energy sectors from the end of quarters with gains of 15% or more. Starting with a look at Financials, that rotation has not necessarily always occurred as the sector has consistently risen over the following three months. Of the ten prior instances, there have only been two quarters, Q3 2009 and Q1 2012, in which Financials were lower by the end of the next quarter. Those were also some of the few times that Financials were lower at the end of the first and second month of the quarter. We would note, though, that the current instance is also the first time since 2009 that there have been back-to-back quarters that the sector has seen gains of 15% or more. Back during that last occurrence (Q3 2009), returns were in fact weaker after that second quarter of large gains.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Fin-2a.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the Energy sector, of the nine prior instances where the sector rallied over 15%, this was the first time with two sequential quarters boasting 15% or larger gains. Additionally, rotation out of Energy stocks has been far more commonplace. As shown in the table below, from the conclusion of those quarters with big gains, the sector has averaged a decline throughout the next quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Energy-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks and Inflation\n\n&gt; As we continue LPL Research\u2019s Inflation Week, today we will examine how stocks have historically done at different inflation levels. For more color on our views on inflation, please read here and here, and look out for tomorrow\u2019s blog, where we\u2019ll examine some of the factors that have kept inflation low and that will likely continue to put a lid on inflation in the future.\n\n&gt; Looking at S&amp;P 500 Index returns going back to 1950, stocks have tended to like low inflation. As shown below, the lower inflation is, the better the S&amp;P 500 Index returns tend to be, although the strong performance for negative inflation may be due to markets rebounding off of lows. Taking it a step further, if inflation is trending lower, then stocks do much better (18.8% on average) versus if inflation is trending higher (6.4% on average).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cYou can\u2019t argue with history, as it sure appears that inflation that\u2019s under control is a tailwind for stocks,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIt is when inflation starts to turn higher that it can knock stocks down. Given our base case is for modest inflation, this is another feather in the cap for the bulls.\u201d\n\n&gt; Looking at a scatter plot of inflation and the S&amp;P 500, there is a fairly wide dispersion in some cases, so this is by no means a perfect indicator. Still, the regression line moves from the upper left to the lower right, suggesting lower inflation indeed historically has benefitted stocks more than higher inflation.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The inflation question is one that isn\u2019t going away, especially as the US continues to add more fiscal and monetary stimulus. Although this isn\u2019t a very consensus call, we think inflation will be capped once we get past 2021 and this should help stocks overall.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 2nd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4.4.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd1mS00Cw_E))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$STZ** \n&gt; * **$SCHN** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$LNN** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$CAG** \n&gt; * **$GBX** \n&gt; * **$MSM** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$DCT** \n&gt; * **$LW** \n&gt; * **$SGH** \n&gt; * **$APOG** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$LNDC** \n&gt; * **$RGP** \n&gt; * **$PLUS** \n&gt; * **$NTIC** \n&gt; * **$MAXN** \n&gt; * **$EVAX** \n&gt; * **$MITO** \n&gt; * **$JKS** \n&gt; * **$JFIN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DzPTCDd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EFoYhPI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS MONTH'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IAo7GlZ.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n( NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/LGaokuS.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  4.6.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eu0hmtC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ew3RuFT.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q9506N2.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2URCkYe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hcSTJcm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJ2s00r.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.9.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wEoA0Ew.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.9.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MdchFK4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Paychex, Inc. $98.76\n**Paychex, Inc.
