        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, July 13, 2021**\n\nToday was quite action-packed, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) once again recording a fresh intraday high for the second time this week before turning lower towards the end of the session. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, performed the worst, falling 1.75% at the time of writing. Market participants are digesting the beginning of Q2 earning season and a new report that showed in June, consumer prices have surged by the most since 2008.\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s June Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May\u2019s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year\u2019s pandemic-era lows.\n\nWhile the CPI print is not ideal, the market\u2019s somewhat muted reaction (though there was a little volatility) seems to confirm that market participants are increasingly pricing in higher-than-expected inflationary data and are buying into the Federal Reserve\u2019s argument that current pressures are transitory and due to pandemic-related disruptions. Moreover, it is very important to consider that current inflationary data is calculated on a year-on-year basis, so base effects are very much inflating the current numbers. In other words, inflationary readings are high because they are being measured using numbers from June 2020 when prices across the board collapsed as lockdowns and social distancing policies were implemented across the world. As I have said many times in the past, I am personally not yet worried about current inflationary pressures translating into a prolonged cycle of higher prices, though one always has to acknowledge the risks in the market and be prepared to act. \n\nIn other news, Q2 earnings seasons kicked off today, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) both reporting today, as well as Pepsi (PEP). JP Morgan, which is often considered a bellwether for the US economy given its sheer size, reported great results, driven in part by the release of $3 billion the bank had set aside to protect against potential losses from default loans during the pandemic, a sign that consumers held up better than the bank expected. JPM recorded revenues of $31.4 billion and profits of $11.948 billion, a staggering improvement from profits of $4.687 billion a year ago. One downside from the earnings report is a sharp reduction in revenues produced from trading, which is not surprising given the insane run by the market in 2020. \n\nThis quarter, earnings for companies in the SPY are expected to grow by 64% year-on-year, according to FactSet, which would mark the fastest rate of earnings growth since the fourth quarter of 2009, when the US was emerging from the 11.948 housing-bubble induced recession. \n\nA big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to Q2 2020, a period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 2021 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.\n\nGoldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market participants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions? (2) How are companies planning to prioritize cash spending? (3) How will companies deal with policy uncertainties, especially surrounding a potential tax hike?\n\nIn addition to earnings season, market participants are also looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell giving his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Analysts are expecting Powell to once again strike a dovish tone (meaning unlikely to take aggressive action against inflation and instead favor employment), given the mixed June Job Report, which saw a better than expected number of jobs added to the economy but the unemployment rate tick higher and last week\u2019s meeting minutes which showed an increasing divide between members regarding the timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing. In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, a unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Disney (DIS) outperformed the market again today thanks to the great success of Marvel\u2019s \u201cBlack Widow\u201d, which generated $80 billion in theater sales and $60 billion in streaming sales, the best domestic opening for a movie since the pandemic began. \n* Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk defended the electric-vehicle maker's purchase of SolarCity Corp. in court, telling a Delaware judge that he didn't act improperly during the negotiating process. This comes in response to a lawsuit filed by TSLA shareholders that allege Musk forced the company to buy SolarCity, a solar-cell manufacturer, in order to save his investment in the company.\n* Netflix and Universal have reached a licensing deal that will see more Universal movies, including animated pictures from DreamWorks, available on its streaming platform. \n* Despite successfully completing the company's first trip with Richard Branson as a passenger, shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) remain under pressure after the company announced it planned to take advantage of the elevated stock price by selling $500 million in stock, with the stock down roughly 25% from Friday\u2019s prices. \n* Broadcom (AVGO) is reportedly in talks to buy the SAS Institute, a software company with upwards of $3 billion a year in revenue in a deal valued between $15-$20 billion. This is yet another acquisition by one of the world\u2019s largest semiconductor companies.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it was acquiring cybersecurity firm RiskIQ to help reduce risk amid \u201cthe increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks\u201d.\n* SolarWinds says that unknown hackers exploited a previously unknown flaw in two of its programs to go after \"a limited, targeted set of customers.\" The company went on to say the hack was \u201ccompletely unrelated\u201d to last year\u2019s attack\u201d and that the company was still \u201cunaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers\u201d. Seems like hackers find it easy to attack this company. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* AutoDesk (ADSK) target raised by Mizuho from $335 to $355 at Buy.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, July 13, 2021**\n\nToday was quite action-packed, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) once again recording a fresh intraday high for the second time this week before turning lower towards the end of the session. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, performed the worst, falling 1.75% at the time of writing. Market participants are digesting the beginning of Q2 earning season and a new report that showed in June, consumer prices have surged by the most since 2008.\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s June Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May\u2019s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year\u2019s pandemic-era lows.\n\nWhile the CPI print is not ideal, the market\u2019s somewhat muted reaction (though there was a little volatility) seems to confirm that market participants are increasingly pricing in higher-than-expected inflationary data and are buying into the Federal Reserve\u2019s argument that current pressures are transitory and due to pandemic-related disruptions. Moreover, it is very important to consider that current inflationary data is calculated on a year-on-year basis, so base effects are very much inflating the current numbers. In other words, inflationary readings are high because they are being measured using numbers from June 2020 when prices across the board collapsed as lockdowns and social distancing policies were implemented across the world. As I have said many times in the past, I am personally not yet worried about current inflationary pressures translating into a prolonged cycle of higher prices, though one always has to acknowledge the risks in the market and be prepared to act. \n\nIn other news, Q2 earnings seasons kicked off today, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) both reporting today, as well as Pepsi (PEP). JP Morgan, which is often considered a bellwether for the US economy given its sheer size, reported great results, driven in part by the release of $3 billion the bank had set aside to protect against potential losses from default loans during the pandemic, a sign that consumers held up better than the bank expected. JPM recorded revenues of $31.4 billion and profits of $11.948 billion, a staggering improvement from profits of $4.687 billion a year ago. One downside from the earnings report is a sharp reduction in revenues produced from trading, which is not surprising given the insane run by the market in 2020. \n\nThis quarter, earnings for companies in the SPY are expected to grow by 64% year-on-year, according to FactSet, which would mark the fastest rate of earnings growth since the fourth quarter of 2009, when the US was emerging from the 11.948 housing-bubble induced recession. \n\nA big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to Q2 2020, a period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 2021 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.\n\nGoldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market participants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions? (2) How are companies planning to prioritize cash spending? (3) How will companies deal with policy uncertainties, especially surrounding a potential tax hike?\n\nIn addition to earnings season, market participants are also looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell giving his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Analysts are expecting Powell to once again strike a dovish tone (meaning unlikely to take aggressive action against inflation and instead favor employment), given the mixed June Job Report, which saw a better than expected number of jobs added to the economy but the unemployment rate tick higher and last week\u2019s meeting minutes which showed an increasing divide between members regarding the timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing. In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, a unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Disney (DIS) outperformed the market again today thanks to the great success of Marvel\u2019s \u201cBlack Widow\u201d, which generated $80 billion in theater sales and $60 billion in streaming sales, the best domestic opening for a movie since the pandemic began. \n* Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk defended the electric-vehicle maker's purchase of SolarCity Corp. in court, telling a Delaware judge that he didn't act improperly during the negotiating process. This comes in response to a lawsuit filed by TSLA shareholders that allege Musk forced the company to buy SolarCity, a solar-cell manufacturer, in order to save his investment in the company.\n* Netflix and Universal have reached a licensing deal that will see more Universal movies, including animated pictures from DreamWorks, available on its streaming platform. \n* Despite successfully completing the company's first trip with Richard Branson as a passenger, shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) remain under pressure after the company announced it planned to take advantage of the elevated stock price by selling $500 million in stock, with the stock down roughly 25% from Friday\u2019s prices. \n* Broadcom (AVGO) is reportedly in talks to buy the SAS Institute, a software company with upwards of $3 billion a year in revenue in a deal valued between $15-$20 billion. This is yet another acquisition by one of the world\u2019s largest semiconductor companies.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it was acquiring cybersecurity firm RiskIQ to help reduce risk amid \u201cthe increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks\u201d.\n* SolarWinds says that unknown hackers exploited a previously unknown flaw in two of its programs to go after \"a limited, targeted set of customers.\" The company went on to say the hack was \u201ccompletely unrelated\u201d to last year\u2019s attack\u201d and that the company was still \u201cunaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers\u201d. Seems like hackers find it easy to attack this company. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* AutoDesk (ADSK) target raised by Mizuho from $335 to $355 at Buy.

        "selftext": "[S&amp;P 500 rises for a 7th straight day after strong jobs report, best winning streak in 10 months (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/01/stock-market-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n&gt;Stocks rose on Friday and the S&amp;P 500 hit another record high after the June jobs report showed an accelerating recovery for the U.S. labor market.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The broad market index rose 0.75% to 4,352.34, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.81% to notch its own record at 14,639.33. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 152.82 points to close at 34,786.35. The S&amp;P 500 has now risen for seven consecutive sessions, its longest winning streak since August.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Solid moves by major tech stocks helped support the overall market on Friday, with shares of Apple and Salesforce rising by nearly 2% and 1.3%, respectively. Microsoft jumped 2.2%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For the week, the Nasdaq Composite rose nearly 2%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Dow climbed 1.7% and 1%, respectively. Several sectors closed at record levels on Friday, including tech and health care.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The strong week on Wall Street was spurred by a string of solid economic reports, capped by a better-than-expected jobs report on Friday morning.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The economy [added 850,000 jobs last month](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/jobs-report-june-2021.html), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting an addition of 706,000. The print topped the revised 583,000 jobs created in May.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThis is a strong report and should be taken as a sign of things to come for an accelerating labor market,\u201d Aberdeen Standard Investments deputy chief economist James McCann said in a note.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Angelo Kourkafas, an investment strategist at Edward Jones, said that the report showed solid growth but wouldn\u2019t change the Fed\u2019s policy path, hitting a sweet spot for markets.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cI think it was one of these goldilocks-type of reports, because hiring accelerated -- which is a positive sign for the second half and the recovery -- but not so much that it would trigger a reaction of an accelerated timeline for the Federal Reserve to start tapering,\u201d Kourkafas said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In addition to the job gains, average hourly wages rose 0.3% for the month and are up 3.6% year over year, matching expectations.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said that the report eased concerns about a labor shortage.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cI think we also learned that the explanations for the weaker numbers from April and May -- namely that seasonal probably weighing on job growth and probably some impact from the unemployment benefits on labor supply -- that those were pretty good explanations. So I think it was reassuring, in that sense,\u201d Hatzius said on CNBC\u2019s \u201c[Squawk on the Street](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-on-the-street/),\u201d adding that the unemployment rate coming in higher than expected showed that the recovery still had a long way to go.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The S&amp;P 500 has now risen in five of the past six weeks, while the Nasdaq has gained in six of the past seven weeks.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Even with the recent strength for stocks, market strategists say that uncertainty about the future of the Fed\u2019s asset purchases and the upcoming earnings season could keep stocks from making major gains in the near term.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThe market is still very much concerned about the Fed\u2019s reaction function,\u201d said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors, adding that he thought there was still a lot of slack in the labor market.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One weak spot for the markets this week was small caps, as the Russell 2000 slipped 1% on Friday to finish negative for the week.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On Friday, shares of Boeing fell 1.3%, weighing on the Dow, after a 737 cargo plane made an [emergency landing off the coast of Honolulu](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/boeing-cargo-plane-makes-emergency-landing-in-ocean-off-honolulu-coast-faa-says.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_content=Main&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1625234441).

        "selftext": "Palantir is an American software company that specializes in big data analytics, with a market cap of 43 billion. They started building software for the intelligence community in the US to assist in counterterrorism investigations by helping them identify patterns hidden deep within large data sets. Later, they realized that similarly to the intelligence community, commercial institutions did not have the most effective tools to manage and make sense of the data involved in large projects. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9fvuzczr1tc71.png?width=1236&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b5c0be5fc4da1a37bbbbfdfc8893617d005ee3e\n\nAny large scale company or business will always collect a ton of data most often stored in texts such as spreadsheets or databases (which requires programming knowledge to navigate through). A common issue large companies have is simply having too much data. Palantir creates software that consolidates a company's data and displays it in a comprehensible, easily digestible user interface for the company to use. This allows Palantir to work with companies/organizations like the CDC for medicine, the military for national security, etc. \n\nWith Palantir, a normal non-technical operator can click their computer to pull up an order, or an issue that Palanrie detected, make any changes and or notify whoever needs the attention. Let's take the CDC for example. When the vaccine rolled out, Palantir had a huge hand in this. Palantir gives a visual display of where the vaccine is going, how many, and any issues that have risen (if any), allowing for fast response time. For example, Palantir could display a map with the various routes to different deployment sites with pictures of a little truck representing the shipments being routed to their destination. An operator could click one of these shipments/routes and pull up any data of that specific point. With data being displayed and organized in this way it makes it easy to analyze data, where things are going, and what kind of picture the data represents, rather than staring at a spreadsheet of numbers. This is just one example, Palantir is customizable enough where it can represent any business/organization's structure.\n\nPalantir\u2019s revenue streams consist of their two main software: [Gotham](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/), which was designed primarily for the defence and intelligence sector, and [Foundry](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/) for the commercial sector. However, the platforms are not exclusive to either sector. For example, Gotham is also offered to commercial customers in the financial services industry. The two platforms can either be used separately or bundled together as a single ecosystem. Currently, revenue is more or less evenly split between the government and commercial sectors. \n\nGotham\u2019s main tools include:\n\nGaia \u2013 lets users plan, execute, and report on operations via a shared live map. Live maps track real-time data and users drag and drop objects from other Gotham applications directly into Gaia.\n\nDossier \u2013 is a live collaboration document editor to share analysis and discover intelligence. Users can collaborate across teams and organizations to create a living, interactive, and up-to-date document.\n\nVideo \u2013 an application designed to interact with both streaming and historical video data. Users can review video footage in the platform as well as enhance raw footage with geospatial information and overlays based on other data sources.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q927qfws1tc71.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aaaf57a3db79d3446b09c24f5205bc918159d4e1\n\nFoundry\u2019s main tools include:\n\nContour \u2013 enables exploration of large-scale data. Users can filter, join, and visualize datasets to answer analytical questions and publish the results as a report or new dataset that will automatically update with the underlying datasets.\n\nObject Explorer \u2013 allows users to interact with data represented as objects \u2013 like customers, equipment, or plants \u2013 rather than rows in a table.\n\nAs we know, Palantir started in the defence and intelligence space. This required Palantir to have elite-level security from the start. Their software had to be secure enough to handle national secrets and transparent enough to ensure that the data could be monitored and traced. This was no easy feat, however, Palantir managed to achieve this, which is why they have been renewing their contracts with several government agencies.\n\nThis is important when trying to sell their products to their commercial clients because they need something safe and reliable to protect themselves and their data. Furthermore, Palantir currently has IL-5 clearance with the Department of Defense, which makes them 1 of 4 software companies with this level of clearance, alongside Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP (Google and Snowflake have IL-2 clearance). It has also been rumoured that Palantir may achieve IL-6 clearance, which has never been done before as it is the storage/processing of classified information.\n\nThis level of clearance should speak volumes to how safe and secure Palantir\u2019s technology is and should provide ease of mind to companies that they are in business with.",

        "selftext": "**Valuation: Undervalued**\n\n***$PLTR \u2013 Palantir Technologies Inc Investment Summary:***\n\n\u00b7 Recently, there has been a lot of excitement around Palantir, however, very few people actually understand what they do and how they operate. As a result of this I have decided to take on the task of trying explain exactly what Palantir does and why they could be the best undervalued stock to buy now.\n\no I am no data engineer, so this article contains my interpretations of what Palantir does, some of my interpretations may be off, so I would appreciate any helpful comments to clear some things up that I may have got wrong.\n\n\u00b7 Based on the comparable analyses that I underwent, Palantir is currently an undervalued stock and represents a great opportunity for a long-term hold.\n\no The length of time that I plan on holding is subject to change due to their future financial reports, and any news that may come out.\n\n\u00b7 It is very hard to say what the upside potential of an investment into Palantir is, which is why my investment plan (found in the \u201cplan\u201d section) is different than usual.\n\no There are various risks to this investment (like there are to every investment), these risks are highlighted near the end of this report under the \u201crisks\u201d section.\n\no Additionally, there are also multiple different catalysts that can help Palantir\u2019s share price, both in the short and long term(s). These catalysts are listed at the end of this report.\n\n***Overview of Palantir as a Company:***\n\n[$PLTR - Palantir Technologies Inc.](https://utradea.com/stocks/PLTR) was founded in 2003 (after their fear/anger after the events observed through 9/11) and started building their software primarily for government institutions and intelligence to assist in counterterrorism by any means possible. At this point in time, Palantir\u2019s only source of revenue was through secretive government contracts.\n\nHowever, since that point in time, Palantir has expanded their operations into commercial enterprises, as they noticed a lot of similarities and overlaps with their applications. Now, Palantir\u2019s revenue comes from both Government Contracts and Commercial Enterprise Contracts.\n\n*Palantir has 2 main software platforms, Palantir \u201cGotham\u201d, and Palantir \u201cFoundry\u201d.*\n\n[**Palantir Gotham**](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/) was their first software platform and was designed for defense/intelligence use cases. Palantir has stated that this kind of platform helps agencies find \u201cneedles in thousands of haystacks\u201d. They also noted that [Gotham helped soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan](https://www.palantir.com/wp-assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Impact-Study-Palantir-Defense-During-Drawdown.pdf) to map networks of bomb makers and insurgents through deep/hidden patterns and datasets, helping the army save time and lives. Since this mission, Gotham has expanded into defense operations and mission planning. During this time, Palantir found that Gotham could also be applied in Airbus\u2019 business, as their planes require millions of parts, assembled in multiple factories in different countries. However, Palantir decided to make another software platform that is better tailored to commercial enterprises, this platform was labelled \u201cPalantir Foundry\u201d.\n\n[**Palantir Foundry**](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/) transforms the way in which organizations interact with their information by creating a central operating system for their data. Palantir enables their customers to construct their own models quickly and easily from countless sets of data points.\n\nPalantir software is used by their 139 Government and Commercial Institutions/enterprises, in over 40 industries, ranging over 150 countries. Palantir works with the US Government and their several allies abroad, as well as the worlds most important/reliable companies.\n\nLastly, Palantir has stated \u201cWe are not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. We build the software that enable our customers to integrate their own data that they already have.\u201d\n\n***Everything you need to know about Palantir and $PLTR:***\n\n*Palantir Foundry:*\n\nFoundry is essentially a [data warehouse](https://panoply.io/data-warehouse-guide/the-difference-between-a-database-and-a-data-warehouse/) that helps their commercial customers to collect and analyze their data. Foundry\u2019s platform includes a [graphical data interface](https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/graphical-user-interface) that is extremely user friendly allowing their customers to get the most out of their data. Furthermore, Foundry provides statistical analyses through the use of their [AI machine learning](https://www.palantir.com/solutions/ai-ml/) networks that are able to consistently deliver efficient and accurate results.\n\nFoundry helps to enables all of their users, regardless of their technical abilities, to work meaningfully and act with the data that they collect. Foundry provides a suite of applications that help combine data analytics and business logic, helping them to deliver superior data integration.\n\nFoundry\u2019s front-end (what the user sees) enables their users to take advantage of all of the data collected by their organization to make informed decisions. Foundry also has a fantastic application for inter-organizational collaboration, this helps a team to build on each others work.\n\n*Foundry brings all of an enterprises data together onto their platform, however there are access controls in place to define what individuals get control over which dataset(s). From there, Foundry is able to deliver advanced analytics through their machine learning and AI systems to get the most value out of a company\u2019s data, make quality insights, so that their clients can gain a competitive advantage.*\n\n**Foundries potential use cases are almost infinite.**\n\n*Palantir Gotham:*\n\nDubbed \u201cThe Operating System for Government Decision Making\u201d, Gotham helps to improve and accelerate decisions across all levels of Government operations.\n\nGotham is primarily used by the defense and intelligence sections of the Government, to help them find what they are looking for. Gotham collects data from millions of different sources and combines it all into one platform to identify hidden patterns and bring all of this data to life. This allows their users to access this data and manage their operations to execute real-world responses to threats that Gotham identifies. Gotham is becoming a main data solution across various different government agencies.\n\nThere is not too much information that is publicly known about the actual uses of Gotham, which makes sense due to the secretive nature of the organizations that they are in business with. However, what we do know is that these organizations have re-signed contracts with Palantir, which helps us to be confident that this platform is truly \u201cthe real deal\u201d.\n\nLastly, Gotham is also offered to select commercial customers, primarily the companies that are investigating fraud in financial service industries. Furthermore, [Palantir has been credited](https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/news/2015/01/12/leaked-documents-bernie-madoff-convicted-thanks-to.html) with assisting in finding the largest Ponzi scheme ever (Bernie Madoff\u2019s Ponzi Scheme).\n\n*Gotham helps the Defense and Intelligence sectors of the Government to pool their incomprehensible amounts of data into one place. Palantir uses machine learning to quickly locate hidden pieces of data, and key patterns, so that these institutions can take swift action to the threats/problems they face in real-time.*\n\n*Palantir\u2019s Approach:*\n\nPalantir believes that every large institution in the world has a problem in their approach to mass data analysis, and Palantir believes that their platforms are best suited to help companies address this problem and make the most out of their data.\n\nPalantir recognises that other companies sell features, tools, applications, and/or dashboards, however these products are not built to maintain optimal performance in the long run (if at all). Palantir prides themselves on having the best all around software/platform to have sustainable, reliable, and safe data solutions.\n\nPalantir also groups their Foundry data from all of their companies into one large system of several large \u201cfarms\u201d of data provided by each of their client companies. By doing this, Palantir is able to feed more data/information into their machine learning, AI, and algorithms so that they can continue to be more reliable and efficient. This also enables [cross-industry data pools](https://youtu.be/7zqE8J4WKOU), that can be used by their companies when they look to expand or for opportunities in other verticals.\n\n*Palantir Success Stories:*\n\n**BP:**\n\nPerhaps the most notable success story that has come from Palantir is their partnership with [$BP \u2013 British Petroleum](https://utradea.com/stocks/BP)\n\nBP and Palantir have been partners since 2014, and recently (February 2021) [BP and Palantir have extended their partnership](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/05/palantir-deepens-ties-with-bp-with-new-5-year-deal/) for 5 more years. Palantir has helped BP to transform their business into a more digital one, and this extension of their partnership will ensure a further acceleration of their strategic digitization of their business.\n\nPalantir\u2019s Foundry has already helped BP by streamlining and enhancing their hydrocarbon-based workflows. Palantir helped BP to analyze their drilling data and has helped them to [increase their oil production in the North Sea by over 10%.](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/palantir-the-tech-spooks-who-found-bin-laden-are-helping-bp-find-oil-9qddfpv2r)\n\nThis increase in production helps us to visualize just how useful Palantir\u2019s software can be. This is why their Foundry has been credited as a \u201ccompetitive advantage\u201d. Other oil producing companies most likely would not have been able to uncover the data, patterns, and relationships that were uncovered by Palantir, thus the companies that are not using Palantir may be losing out.\n\nThis type of publicity is fantastic for Palantir, as companies may see this, and contact Palantir because they too want a competitive advantage. Palantir\u2019s best chance at becoming the next \u201ctech giant\u201d comes through the commercial applications/contracts. This is because there are infinite uses for Palantir, so theoretically, they can get it in the hands of every business (which would help revenues to soar).\n\n**National Institute of Health (NIH) and Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS):**\n\nPalantir has historically been a rather controversial company through their help in government agencies like ICE. However, recently Palantir has been getting good press, which has helped their company image. Since the start of the pandemic some institutions like the NIH and NHS have signed contracts with Palantir, for Palantir\u2019s assistance with their fights against COVID-19, and their vaccine distributions. This is good for Palantir as it shows them in a good light and shows that they can help provide the world with help and safety during a crisis like COVID-19.\n\nThe NIH agreed to a [$36M contract](https://www.palantir.com/pt_media/nih-palantir-contract/) to gain a partnership with Palantir. Their (NIH\u2019s), mission is to build the largest centralized COVID-19 patient database in the world, and Palantir has helped them to do this with massive success.\n\nPalantir was able to assist the NIH in building their [N3C data platform](https://covid.cd2h.org/). This platform has come a long way since they teamed up with Palantir, and now has over 7.1B rows of data from 6.5M patients, from 57 different databases. Without the assistance of Palantir, analyzing this amount of data would have been no easy feat, however Palantir has provided the NIH with advanced analytics in the matter of minutes thank to their machine learning capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, in December of 2020, Palantir signed a [2-year $31.5M deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201223005018/en/Palantir-Continues-Vital-NHS-Work-With-31.5M-Contract) with the Brittan\u2019s NHS. This partnership requires Foundry to provide a secure, reliable, and timely platform to process data, while protecting patient privacy, to ultimately improve patient care.\n\nBoth of these partnerships highlight the need for Palantir during a crisis and having these large Government Health Institutes choosing Palantir as their first options is a great deal, and shows their confidence in Palantir\u2019s software.\n\n*Sources:*\n\n[The power of data in a pandemic - Technology in the NHS (blog.gov.uk)](https://healthtech.blog.gov.uk/2020/03/28/the-power-of-data-in-a-pandemic/)\n\n*Strengths:*\n\n**Built-in Privacy Controls:**\n\nBy having [privacy controls](https://youtu.be/7zqE8J4WKOU) in place, Palantir is able to operate in places that other data companies cannot go. This is especially true for Foundry, where companies/individuals can request cross-industry data from other Palantir clients to help them in a variety of ways. This request for external data needs to be accepted by a representative of the other company to be allowed. This helps Palantir leverage all of the data that they have on their \u201cOperating System\u201d, which essentially makes their platform a cross-company/cross-country collaborative workspace for all. As Palantir attains more clients, the more attractive/extensive their database is for potential clients. This should help Palantir to expand quickly once they get the ball rolling.\n\nPalantir truly values this privacy and has integrated data legibility, audit logs, access controls, quality checks and requirements to attain external data.\n\n**Government Grade Security:**\n\nAs we know, Palantir started out in just the defense and intelligence spaces. This required Palantir to have elite-level security from the get-go. Their software had to be secure enough to handle national secrets and transparent enough to ensure that the data could be monitored and traced. This is no easy feat, however Palantir managed to achieve this, which is why they have been renewing their contracts with several government agencies.\n\nThis is important when trying to sell their products to their commercial clients, because they need something safe and reliable to protect themselves and their data. Furthermore, Palantir currently has [IL-5 clearance](https://simplemoneylyfe.com/palantir-stock-analysis/) with the Department of Defense (DoD), which makes them 1 of 4 software companies with this level of clearance (alongside Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP). However, it has also been rumoured that Palantir may achieve IL-6 clearance, which has never been done before as it is the storage/processing of **classified information.**\n\nThis level of clearance should speak volumes to how safe and secure Palantir\u2019s technology truly is and should provide ease of mind to companies that they are in business with.\n\n**Expansion into the Commercial Sector:**\n\nPalantir currently has a huge opportunity ahead of them as they continue to increase their presence in the commercial sector, partnering with some of the largest enterprises in the world. Palantir plans to provide these businesses with the software that they need to do their jobs as efficient as possible and sees large growth potential in this industry.\n\nPalantir has said that they are focusing on building partnerships with enterprises that are willing to undergo structural changes within the organization/operations. Palantir has a huge market ahead of themselves in the commercial sector, and their stock should do well on the news breaking of new partnerships between Palantir and commercial enterprises.\n\n*Government Contracts:*\n\nDo you remember what I said earlier about what happens once Palantir gets the ball rolling? If so, you will know where I am headed with this section.\n\nBetween 2008-2018 (10 years), Palantir was able to generate $51.9M in revenue from government contracts. However, in the 2 years following this they earned $179.9M in Government contracts (this can be found under the \u201cUS Government\u201d section of their [SEC 10-K report](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1)). Once Palantir was able to get the ball rolling with these agencies, Palantir was able to both expand and renew existing contracts to earn more revenue. I believe that the same thing will happen with Palantir\u2019s commercial operations. Once they start to get a large number of big enterprises renewing their contracts for \u201cbigger bucks\u201d, I believe that Palantir will start to grow their revenues extremely quick and attract new clients \u201cleft, right, and center\u201d.\n\nThese contract renewals are so important because essentially, they mean that Palantir met and/or exceeded expectations, and these companies now believe that Palantir is vital to their business/operations, so look out for news around renewals.\n\n*Business Model:*\n\nPalantir has developed a business model that focuses on acquiring contracts and expanding their services and has 3 main phases.\n\n1. **Acquire Customers:** Palantir has expanded their sales force largely over the past couple of years, and actively purse negotiations with companies that they can provide long-term value to. To acquire these companies, Palantir gives them a short demo to see how effective and user friendly their software is, Palantir provides this service for a loss. However, they are willing to incur these (proportionately) small losses to potentially acquire large contracts with these companies. This phase runs at a loss but helps Palantir set up clients for the next phase.\n2. **Expand:** Once Palantir has a potential customer on the hook, they move them along to the expand phase. Palantir installs their software in these enterprises and teaches them the ropes, of course this requires a large investment from Palantir to incorporate it. These customers often sign a short contract with Palantir for a cheap cost (Palantir takes a loss on this phase as well), however clients are able to truly unlock Palantir\u2019s software during this phase and see what it has to offer. If they like their software, they will be moved along to the next phase (scale) which is Palantir\u2019s bread and butter.\n3. **Scale:** These clients tend to sign longer-term deals with Palantir for their software after they have got a \u201cgood feel\u201d for their software. The companies in this stage are also generally \u201chands-off\u201d meaning that they can operate the software without much help. Companies tend to find the most value in this stage, and Palantir makes the best margins on this stage. In 2020, Palantir made $613.4M in this stage with a margin of 70%\n\n*Financial information:*\n\nAll of this information can be found in their [SEC 10-K filing.](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1)\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, Palantir increased their gross profit by 47.97% and increased their gross margin to 81% (from 71%), Palantir reported their first net income (excluding stock-based compensation) ever and increase their net revenues by 47.15%.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, Palantir\u2019s loss from operations increased by 103.61%, their stock-based compensation increased by 425.15%, their General and Admin expenses increased by 108.59%, and their net loss increased by 101.22%. Their biggest problem in 2020 was their large stock-based compensation, which will be addressed later.\n\n\u00b7 **Convertible Preferred Stock:** In 2020, Palantir issued a total of 797,771,675 shares of common stock through conversion of their previous \u201cconvertible referred shares\u201d. This one factor of dilution caused an estimated dilutionary effect of Palantir\u2019s stock of 137.19%. This is a huge form of dilution, and I have never seen anything like this before, however I have an explanation for this so stay tuned for that.\n\n\u00b7 **Repurchase of Common Stock:** In 2020, Palantir repurchased 808,201 shares back. This is a measly amount compared to the amount of dilution from preferred stock, however any buyback is good to see as an investor. This buyback caused an inflationary effect on existing shares of 0.14%, which is not much, but we will still take it.\n\n\u00b7 **Stock Warrants:** In 2020, Palantir experienced an additional 7,631,329 shares on the market through the exercising of warrants. The exercising of these warrant had a dilutionary effect on Palantir\u2019s stock of 1.31%.\n\n\u00b7 **Common Stock (Net of Issuance Costs):** In 2020, Palantir unloaded 206,500,523 common shares onto the market from issuance of common stock net of issuance costs. I believe that this means that, Palantir had to fork out additional shares to cover the investment needed to take their shares public. I could very well be wrong on that, and if anyone can pitch in and explain this to me that would be great! Anyways, this caused a dilutionary effect of Palantir\u2019s common stock of roughly 35.51%. This is a large portion of dilution, however it does not even factor in other factors of dilution which is worrying.\n\n\u00b7 **Stock Options:** In 2020, Palantir added 120,617,527 common shares to their shares outstanding through the exercise of options. These options were exercised and thus converted into these common shares and had a dilutionary effect of 20.72%. Once again, this is a large amount of dilution and should be considered by investors.\n\n\u00b7 **RSU\u2019s:** In 2020, Palantir issued 82,429,575 shares through their vesting of \u201cRestricted Stock Units\u201d (RSU\u2019s). This had a dilutionary effect on their stock of 14.18% (which is a lot of dilution).\n\n\u00b7 **Modification to Stock Options:** In 2020, Palantir technically bought back 3,500,0000 shares through modifications to stock options (for the settlement of employee loans accounted for as modifications to stock options). Confusing, right? This technical buyback resulted in a share inflation of 0.6%.\n\n\u00b7 **Total Share Dilution in 2020:** In 2020, Palantir experience an overall share dilution of 208.19%. This is the most dilution I have ever seen in a stock that I have analyzed, however there are some potential answers as to why there was so much dilution in 2020.\n\n*Explanation of Share Dilution:*\n\nOnce again, all of the below information can be found in Palantir\u2019s [SEC 10-K filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1).\n\nOn September 30th, 2020, Palantir completed their Direct Listing of their Class A common shares on the public markets on the NYSE. Part of this listing involved the redemption of all of Palantir\u2019s convertible share into common shares. This was the largest single source of dilution in Palantir (137%). Additionally, this Direct Listing involved the exercise of al outstanding warrants, which resulted in dilution of 1.31%. Another part of their Direct Listing was the common stocks issued, net of issuance price to complete the direct listing, which had a dilutionary effect of 35.51%. Lastly, Palantir was forced to create new common shares that would hold the place of the unvested RSU\u2019s, which cause a dilutionary effect of 14.18%.\n\nWithout these factors of dilution, Palantir would have only experienced an overall dilution of 20%. This means that due to the Direct listing, Palantir had to increase their shares outstanding by 188.19% to meet the requirements to be eligible for the listing.\n\n*Overall Thoughts on Dilution:*\n\nPalantir is a very weird stock in terms of their dilution, and I have not seen anything quite like this before. Their overall level of dilution is unprecedented and very worrying for investors. However, we know that these levels of dilution were inflated due to the requirements of undergoing a Direct Listing. However, how does Palantir dilution (excluding the effects caused by their Direct Listing compared to their dilution in previous years?\n\nFor starters, Palantir exhibited a 20% share dilution in 2020 when eluding the dilution caused by the Direct Listing. However, historically Palantir has experienced an average share dilution of 5.18% between 2017-2019. So even excluding the effects caused through the Direct Listing, Palantir still experienced a comparably high level of share dilution. However, 20% of dilution is significantly different than the 208.19% of dilution (which would be crazily high). This 20% is relatively normal for an undervalued growth stock, such as Palantir, so currently I would not be too worried. However, investors should keep up with their financial reports and look for their dilution in 2021, because ultimately that will tell us more about Palantir\u2019s dilution after going public, than their past share dilution as a private company.\n\n*Competition:*\n\nIn order to undergo my comparable analyses (which will be discussed later on) I needed to select 4 companies, that I can compare to Palantir.\n\n[**$ZS \u2013 Zscaler Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/ZS)**:** ZScaler is a security as a service company that helps company adapt to cloud technologies and provides their cybersecurity services through the cloud. ZScaler provides their services to both commercial enterprises and governments, similar to that of Palantir. Furthermore, ZScaler offers their service primarily in the USA, but also has smaller international operations (again like Palantir).\n\n[**$SNOW \u2013 Snowflake Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/SNOW)**:** Snowflake (like Palantir) is a software and technology company that primarily focuses on data. Snowflake provides data cloud services such as data engineering, data science, data applications, data sharing, and data warehouse. This is very similar to the applications and functions available on Palantir, however Palantir offers other functions that differentiate themselves. Snowflake also provides services for both commercial enterprises and government organizations, similar to that of Palantir.\n\n[**$SPLK \u2013 Splunk Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/SPLK)**:** Splunk provide software platforms that deliver insights derived from their clients\u2019 data in the USA and internationally. Splunk offers their Ecosystem solutions that consist of data inputs, workflows, reports, dashboards, data visualizations, actions, and methods, and help their clients/customers to make the best out of their data. All of this sounds eerily familiar to the description of Palantir, making it one of the closer competitors. Splunk also offers their services to the public sector as well as the government, making their business model resemble that of Palantir so much more.\n\n[**$TYL \u2013 Tyler technologies Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/TYL)**:** Tyler technologies is probably the company in this list that least resembles that of Palantir, this is because they provide management solutions, accounting systems, billing systems and other solutions geared toward the public sector. Tyler technologies works primarily with governments of all types (Federal, State, and Municipal), and education institutions. However, the one thing that Tyler has that makes them comparable to Palantir is their data and insight solutions. Their data insights software enables collaboration, displays data visualizations/measurements, and generates insights for their human operators to act on.\n\n*Q1 2021 Updates:*\n\nAll of the below information can be found in [Palantir\u2019s Q1 Investor Presentation](https://investors.palantir.com/files/Palantir%20Q1%202021%20Business%20Update.pdf).\n\nRecently, on May 11th, 2021, Palantir released their Q1 earnings report. When looking at Palantir\u2019s financial performance I did not take this into account, which means that this section will be packed with new information that will help us to understand Palantir\u2019s trajectory even more.\n\nFirst and foremost, this quarter was the first quarter in which Palantir has reported positive earnings. This is a big milestone for Palantir as a public company, and it helps to gets investors excited about the potentially profitable future of Palantir. In Q1, Palantir reported a free cash flow of $151M (was -$290M in Q1 2020) with a 44% adjusted FCF margin, they grew revenues by 49% YoY ($341M), and they grew billings by 248% YoY ($362M) which means that Palantir is acquiring new customers and negotiating higher contracts. These financials are great and show a promising future ahead for Palantir, which should excite their investors.\n\nFurthermore, during this quarter they also disclosed their investment in a SPAC. This SPAC is [$QELL \u2013 Qell Acquisition Corp.](https://utradea.com/stocks/QELL) which merging with Lilium. Lilium is an eVTOL transportation company, with this investment they also came to a deal with Lilium to use Foundry for design, engineering, testing, production, quality, logistics, and operations. A while back I looked at another eVTOL SPAC Archer ([$ACIC \u2013 Atlas Crest Investment Corp.](https://utradea.com/stocks/ACIC)), which has great upside and has a similar business model to Lilium, so if you want to read that to be more informed about Liliums potential performance, [click here.](https://utradea.com/positions/Take_a_SHOT_at_Archers_SPAC_ACIC)\n\nIn Q1, Palantir was also awarded with a [5-year $90M contract](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210405005238/en/Palantir-Selected-by-the-National-Nuclear-Security-Administration-for-5-year-89.9M-Contract-for-SAFER-Project) from the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), in which Palantir will provide the operational platform for their SAFER (Safety Analytics, Forecasting, and Evaluation Reporting) project. This is big news as this is one of Palantir\u2019s bigger contracts, and it shows the level of confidence of the NNSA in Palantir\u2019s software and their cross-enterprise data integration capabilities. On the topic of Palantir and Government Organizations, the DoD used Palantir\u2019s software in all 11 of their Combatant Commands for globally integrated intelligence. This high level of usage from the DoD definitely means that Palantir is doing something right, and if the DoD likes it so much, then it should be more than enough for commercial enterprises.\n\nLastly, in Q1, Palantir won 15 contracts worth over $5M, and 6 contracts worth over $10M with an average duration of 3.7 years (4.6 for commercial customers). This is fantastic for the company as they gained an additional 11 new commercial customers from this, and I will be keeping up to date with these contracts and others as they come up for renewal/negotiations. Additionally, Palantir was able to grow their gross margin to 83% (from 75% Q1 2020), and their contribution margin to 60% (from 41% in Q1 2020). This shows that Palantir business partners are maturing into their 3rd phase, the scale phase, which enables Palantir to grow their margins.\n\n***$PLTR \u2013 Palantir Investment Valuation:***\n\n*Comparable Analyses:*\n\nI decided to undergo 2 different comparable analyses in order to get a variety of valuations (or opinions if you will). Preferably, I would like both of these results to be consistent in terms of their fair value estimate, however, if they are not consistent, I will take the average result. I was only able to find 2 multiples/ratios that I could actually analyze due to the nature of these businesses and their lack of positive financial ratios/multiples.\n\n*EV/Revenue:*\n\nThis is a very common multiple among companies that are not profitable in their operations yet, like Palantir and some of these other comparable companies. By comparing Palantir\u2019s EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors (listed above on the \u201ccompetitors\u201d section of this report), I found that Palantir has a fair value of $32.85/share, which implies an upside to this investment of 23.31%. This implies that given Palantir\u2019s current price, they are undervalued, and the upside is very reasonable, however, I decided to undergo the next comparable to see if this result maintains.\n\n*P/B:*\n\nBy comparing Palantir\u2019s P/B ratio to that of their competitors, I found that Palantir has a fair value of $24.87/share, which implies that there is a downside risk of 6.64% to such an investment. As you have probably noticed, these results are not consistent, therefore I have decided to take the average result to get one, final price target.\n\n*Average Comparable:*\n\nBy taking the average result from the 2 comparable analyses underwent, I found that Palantir has a fair value of $28.86/share, which implies an overall upside of 8.36% to this investment. This also implies that Palantir, is in fact an undervalued growth stock, that has the potential to be one of the best undervalued stocks on the market.\n\n***My Plan for Investing into Palantir:***\n\nMy plan for this investment is a little different from usual.\n\nI see anything between $24.87/share (Fair Value of P/B ratio) and $28.86/share (average comparable) as a good chance to buy Palantir at (or below) its fair value. This helps to limit our downside risk of this investment.\n\nHowever, I think the best way to play an investment in Palantir is over the long-run 3+ years. I would attempt to buy in at the above prices and hold for these 3+ years. During this time, I would re-evaluate my investment with every new financial report and piece of news to decide if it is still worth holding.\n\n***Potential Risks to Palantir\u2019s Stock - $PLTR:***\n\n\u00b7 **Dilution:** Over the past year Palantir has experienced a lot of dilution, however, we have already attributed a great deal of this dilution to their Direct Listing. However, the 20% of dilution that was not derived from the direct listing is still quite high. As investors, we should keep an eye on their future levels of dilution to recognize any patterns/increases that we should be weary of. If these levels of dilution persist, potential investors may be scares off and current investor might sell their positions, which will hurt the share price.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance:** This year\u2019s financial performance was not one to be overly happy about. Although they were able to increase some pretty important aspects of their balance sheet, Palantir was still yet to make a profit, and increased their net losses by over 100%. If this poor financial performance continues, and they keep digging themselves into a bigger and bigger hole, investors will run away from this stock and never look back. However, the Q1 financial performance gives investors hope for a more profitable future, which will be discussed later.\n\n\u00b7 **Bad Press:** Historically, Palantir has not been looked at through a positive lens by many people investors and non-investors alike. Their first public backlash came through their involvement in deporting immigrants through [Palantir\u2019s partnership with ICE](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54348456). Palantir quicky spoke out against this backlash by saying ICE took advantage of their software without proper oversight, and that they are looking into the issues, furthermore they have since declined some potential partnerships with other border agencies to avoid further backlash. There have also been numerous smaller controversies and protests that have damaged Palantir\u2019s reputation, and if there are more large controversies Palantir\u2019s stock could get hurt as a result of it.\n\n***Potential Catalysts that can Help Palantir\u2019s Stock Price:***\n\n\u00b7 **Share Buybacks:** Over the past year, Palantir has bought back (both directly and indirectly, in a sense) over 4,300,000 of their common shares. This is good to see as an investor, especially this early in the company (and not too long after their Direct Listing). This gives me hope that Palantir will continue to repurchase more shares in the future. This will be good for the share price as it will increase the value of existing shares, and it will be especially good for the stock price if they continue to buyback more shares each year.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance:** Palantir\u2019s 2020 financial report was not favourable (as discussed previously), however there were definitely some good to take out of it. Palantir increased their revenue, gross profit, and margins by a hefty amount, which is good to see as an investor, however, there was bad aspects of this report as well that made the report unfavourable. However, their newly released Q1 2021 financial report has so much more to offer in terms of good aspects of a financial report.\n\n\u00b7 **Positive Press:** As previously mentioned, Palantir has had their fair share of bad press that has had a small effect on their share price. However, recently Palantir has been getting better press through helping organizations like the NIH and NHS in their fight against COVID-19, and their vaccine distribution efforts. Partnerships like this help to display the positive impacts that can be derived from Palantir\u2019s technology. Future events where Palantir can use their software for a good cause can help to combat the negative stigma around Palantir and attract more people to invest in their company. This should help their share price in the short term after these articles are released.\n\n\u00b7 **Success Stories:** Since Palantir have gone public, they have had a few success stories come out, I mentioned some of these stories throughout the article. These success stories show how impactful Palantir\u2019s software can be and can show companies that they can increase revenues, production etc. just by using Palantir\u2019s software. Any future stories like this that come out, highlighting the benefits of Palantir can help the stock soar, and potential clients to reach out and start business/inquiries with Palantir.\n\n\u00b7 **Renewing Contracts:** I have mentioned that the renewal of contracts can help Palantir\u2019s share price a couple times throughout this article but why is this the case? This is because these companies that are renewing have already been through Palantir\u2019s 3 stage business model and have experienced their software firsthand for numerous years. After their time with Palantir\u2019s software expires they decide to renew the contract. This is good because it shows that Palantir\u2019s software was effective enough to their business in the time they had it that it is worth these $5-15M+ contract renewals. Furthermore, these companies that are renewing already have underwent Palantir\u2019s installation, and these clients will provide Palantir with the highest margins, which will reflect well on Palantir\u2019s future financial reports.\n\n\u00b7 **New Partnerships/Contracts (and the expansion of commercial enterprise segment):** Every time that Palantir, or its partners release news that they have entered into a contract/agreement, this will help Palantir\u2019s stock. This is because Palantir needs to keep expanding their software into new companies in order to meet their expected growth projections. Furthermore, as more commercial enterprises try Palantir\u2019s software (and hopefully enjoy it), the more willing other companies might be to give Palantir a shot. I see their biggest potential for growth and to become a large company in their expansion of their commercial enterprise segment through Foundry. Every time Palantir gets more new clients on board it is fantastic and shows the feasibility of this segment, and as more contracts role in, more enterprises will take an interest. Furthermore, when Palantir signs these enterprises to a contract, it will help to increase their revenues, which will show up on their financial reports and hopefully help the, to beat estimates.\n\n*This analysis took a long time, and is one of the most comprehensive that I have seen, so I would greatly appreciate if you followed me* [*here*](https://utradea.com/member-portfolio/BeatingTheVTI?utm_source=R&amp;utm_medium=B&amp;utm_campaign=PLTR)*, and commented on my original post!*",

        "selftext": "1. Increased Salesforce - they reported 50 new sales people in Q1 with $5.4B of contracted award value. Palantir was had not invested heavily in sales until now. That has allowed them to focus on making a quality product. Now that their product is tits, they are looking to expand and the Sales team is the best way to do that (think servicenow).\n3. Commercial growth: as of 1Q21 commercial growth increased 19% from the prior year and 4% from the last quarter. Commercial growth is going to be the moneymaker for Palantir.\n4. SPAC investment: palantir has been using its substantial cash investing to strategically invest in SPACs, at least 6 that I am aware of.  The goal being that those companies could make use of it's software to the benefit of Palantir and the SPAC. \n5. $151M in cash flow which is an increase of $441 from the prior Q ($290M).\n6. Revenues remain strong Q1 $341.2M $48.8% growth $800M annualized run rate. \n7. The growth of adoption within the government remains strong, and that pipeline is continuing to grow. Congress recently approved a new appropriation pilot for procurement of IT which can be used for RDTE, Procurement and Operating and Maintenance. This provides opportunity to decrease the duration of the government Procurement cycle and will absolutely result in additional RFQ/Procurement contracts (I believe it will take a year to see the RFQ's hit the streets). This will benefit palantir with their new, bigger and hungry sales team.  \n\n\nI'm long palantir, this is not investment advice and I don't recommend anyone listen to anything I say. \n\nPositions\nhttps://imgur.com/a/yQRMXij",

        "selftext": "# The Company\n\nAvePoint went public via a merger on Friday, the 2nd of July 2021. The company runs over 1,300 employees in 29 global offices and is one of the largest Strategic Cloud Partners of **Microsoft**. It\u00b4s all about migrating businesses to the cloud under the aspects of cyber security, compliance and so on. AvePoint had been the global **Microsoft partner of the year** 5 times and runs over 7 Million cloud users already as of today.

Ok, ok. $194 Million - you say *'thats not a lot!'* \\- take 35% Growth rate for the next 6 years: You'll end up with over $1 Billion in revenue by 2027 - SaaS will grow potentially, as we all know, so I don't think we will only have 35% growth.

I am convinced that this is not just another SPAC and that numbers are clearly speaking for its business. Having a partner like Microsoft and growing with over 30% into a cloud-based business is almost a no-brainer for me. Time will tell. Compare it with OKTA in 2017, going public at a $6 Billion valuation, which is not so much far away from AvePoint today.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe contents on this site are for informational and entertainment purposes only and does not constitute financial, accounting, or legal advice.

        "selftext": "Palantir is an American software company that specializes in big data analytics, with a market cap of 43 billion. They started building software for the intelligence community in the US to assist in counterterrorism investigations by helping them identify patterns hidden deep within large data sets. Later, they realized that similarly to the intelligence community, commercial institutions did not have the most effective tools to manage and make sense of the data involved in large projects. \n\nAny large scale company or business will always collect a ton of data most often stored in texts such as spreadsheets or databases (which requires programming knowledge to navigate through). A common issue large companies have is simply having too much data. Palantir creates software that consolidates a company's data and displays it in a comprehensible, easily digestible user interface for the company to use. This allows Palantir to work with companies/organizations like the CDC for medicine, the military for national security, etc. \n\nWith Palantir, a normal non-technical operator can click their computer to pull up an order, or an issue that Palanrie detected, make any changes and or notify whoever needs the attention. Let's take the CDC for example. When the vaccine rolled out, Palantir had a huge hand in this. Palantir gives a visual display of where the vaccine is going, how many, and any issues that have risen (if any), allowing for fast response time. For example, Palantir could display a map with the various routes to different deployment sites with pictures of a little truck representing the shipments being routed to their destination. An operator could click one of these shipments/routes and pull up any data of that specific point. With data being displayed and organized in this way it makes it easy to analyze data, where things are going, and what kind of picture the data represents, rather than staring at a spreadsheet of numbers. This is just one example, Palantir is customizable enough where it can represent any business/organization's structure.\n\nPalantir\u2019s revenue streams consist of their two main software: [Gotham](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/), which was designed primarily for the defence and intelligence sector, and [Foundry](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/) for the commercial sector. However, the platforms are not exclusive to either sector. For example, Gotham is also offered to commercial customers in the financial services industry. The two platforms can either be used separately or bundled together as a single ecosystem. Currently, revenue is more or less evenly split between the government and commercial sectors. \n\nGotham\u2019s main tools include:\n\nGaia \u2013 lets users plan, execute, and report on operations via a shared live map. Live maps track real-time data and users drag and drop objects from other Gotham applications directly into Gaia.\n\nDossier \u2013 is a live collaboration document editor to share analysis and discover intelligence. Users can collaborate across teams and organizations to create a living, interactive, and up-to-date document.\n\nVideo \u2013 an application designed to interact with both streaming and historical video data. Users can review video footage in the platform as well as enhance raw footage with geospatial information and overlays based on other data sources.\n\nFoundry\u2019s main tools include:\n\nContour \u2013 enables exploration of large-scale data. Users can filter, join, and visualize datasets to answer analytical questions and publish the results as a report or new dataset that will automatically update with the underlying datasets.\n\nObject Explorer \u2013 allows users to interact with data represented as objects \u2013 like customers, equipment, or plants \u2013 rather than rows in a table.\n\nAs we know, Palantir started in the defence and intelligence space. This required Palantir to have elite-level security from the start. Their software had to be secure enough to handle national secrets and transparent enough to ensure that the data could be monitored and traced. This was no easy feat, however, Palantir managed to achieve this, which is why they have been renewing their contracts with several government agencies.\n\nThis is important when trying to sell their products to their commercial clients because they need something safe and reliable to protect themselves and their data. Furthermore, Palantir currently has IL-5 clearance with the Department of Defense, which makes them 1 of 4 software companies with this level of clearance, alongside Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP (Google and Snowflake have IL-2 clearance). It has also been rumoured that Palantir may achieve IL-6 clearance, which has never been done before as it is the storage/processing of classified information.\n\nThis level of clearance should speak volumes to how safe and secure Palantir\u2019s technology is and should provide ease of mind to companies that they are in business with.",

        "selftext": "I've been struggling these past few months at settling on a portfolio that I was happy with. I am young (23), so I wanted my investments to take advantage of that by being more aggressive with growth. At the same time, I realize that the current market is overextended, and a lot of the companies I really like are trading with a lot of that growth priced in. So, I wanted to put together a portfolio that would satisfy my risk/reward tolerance without having to pay a hefty premium.\n\nThe two pieces of advice that I greatly resonate with are:\n\n1. Invest in a great company at a good price &gt; good company at a great price\n2. concentration builds wealth, diversification preserves it\n\nSo I wanted to keep the number of stocks low (&lt;10) and put my money in companies for which I have high conviction. I started out by first creating a list of sectors that I think are best set up for hyper-growth in the next 10-20 years. For me, those are:\n\n* Tech &gt; Information &amp; Communications / AI, AR, and Automation / Cyber Security\n* Financial Services &gt; FinTech\n* Healthcare &gt; Health Tech &amp; Genomics\n* Consumer Cyclicals &gt; Internet Retail / Gambling\n* EVs\n\nObviously, that list is not exhaustive, but those are the areas I feel the most comfortable with and in which I can see the long-term potential. I used that list as a starting point to look into companies and solidify the ones that will make up my portfolio. Some of the positions are more speculative than others, but I have found to have a compelling enough business model for me to invest in. If you have any criticism or suggestions, please comment below! I'm always looking to learn and discover great companies!\n\n# Portfolio Holdings:\n\n**FB**\n\nFor me, this was a no-brainer. The fundamentals are absurdly strong; pretty much no debt with a boatload of free cash. Consistent share buybacks (although not much) and increase in revenue. Outside of the main platform, it owns Instagram and Whatsapp which are incredibly sticky apps. Not to mention all the other projects they have going on (Occulus, FB Watch, etc.). What appealed to me the most was the fact that their ROIC is one of the best compared to the other FAANG stocks. There's also still room for ARPU to grow, especially on the international level. Instagram is also getting reworked to increase monetization. This stock is still undervalued/fairly valued and has, in my opinion, a lot more growth compared to some of the other FAANG companies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SOFI**\n\nI wanted a piece of the fintech space, but the industry leaders PYPL and SQ are way too expensive for me to justify starting a position now. Comparatively, SOFI is trading way below their multiples and there's a lot to like about this company. With SPACs, a lot of the time the fundamentals do not match up to the hype they receive. However, SOFI's Q1 report showed tremendous YOY growth with promising guidance. They also show an increase in the number of users that use more than one of their services, which is an extremely important part of their identity. Now bears may say that this company lacks a moat because traditional banks can just enter the space easily, however, that's not considering one of the most compelling parts of this company, which is their acquisition of Galileo, a payment processor that is integrated with over 90% digital banks in North America and over 70 of the top 100 FinTech companies. So, even as more competitors enter the space, SOFI stands to benefit from that.\n\nNot to mention their management team is stacked with talent. What really sealed the deal for me was the vision of CEO Anthony Noto. In a recent interview, Noto states that the reason SOFI hasn't gone international, despite the interest, is that they wanted to keep refining the product and make sure it can suit the user as best as it can before expanding overseas. This is a CEO that really cares about what they're building and the people who use it.\n\nThere's a lot of tailwinds for this company, and even if the fed does increase interest rates in 2022/23, they only stand to benefit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DKNG**\n\nThis position hinges on political policy, but I'm optimistic about it given how smooth the process of legalizing online betting in the US has been so far. The balance sheet may not be the cleanest, but companies like these typically spend a lot upfront in the form of CACs, and they've done an amazing job in that regard at making this company a household brand. Q1 2021 reports that monthly unique payers (MUPs) increased 114% yoy.\n\nThere's so much growth ahead in the short and long term. Over half the country has legalized betting (in some shape) in 3 years. The gambling market size is predicted to undergo hyper-growth in the next 10 years. Furthermore, DKNG has expressed interest in the esports scene, which is also something that has and will see explosive growth.\n\nWith that all said, I don't think the stock is cheap, and there are definitely a lot of risks here, but I believe in what they've done so far and can see a lot of upside in the long term.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ABBV**\n\nI was between this and BMY, and I might end up just going 50/50 in both. Great fundamentals, a lot to like. Strong top-line revenue growth yoy and a lot of free cash flow. Share buybacks every year, except for the most recent when they issued shares to raise money for their acquisition. There's some concern that HUMIRA, their most popular drug which makes up about 50% of their revenue, has its exclusivity period ending 2023, but their recent acquisition of Allergen positions them well for the future. ABBV is certainly not a crazy hypergrowth stock, but they still have room for growth and their dividend is king. Especially now, when it's trading at a very reasonable valuation, it's a great time to buy in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BABA**\n\nI'm sure this stock needs no explanation on this sub. I really think this stock, or the likes of TENCHY, belongs in every portfolio that's focused on long-term growth at a reasonable price. So unless you're extremely against Chinese companies and the risk they may present, this is an absolute steal at these prices. In fact, right now most U.S companies are overvalued whereas almost every Chinese stock is undervalued.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COIN**\n\nI stayed far away from buying into this company when it IPO'd. Now it has fallen to a pretty reasonable valuation, so I decided to start a small position. I hold a small crypto portfolio myself and although I don't think crypto will replace fiat money, I still see a lot of potential in it long term for a variety of uses. If you don't believe in crypto at all, then it's a lot harder to justify buying into this company.\n\nCOIN itself is one of the most popular crypto exchanges and they posted blistering numbers in their 2021 Q1 report. Granted, a lot of that was tied to the initial explosion of crypto in mainstream media, but the conservative projections for the full year of 2021 are still great. Crypto is still in its infancy in terms of mainstream support and use and the potential TAM is massive.\n\nThat said in the short term, there will be a lot of volatility with this stock. That's why I'm starting with a very small position, with the intention to add if the numbers and guidance continue to impress. Bear cases made of COIN usually rests on the fact that there is nothing proprietary about COIN or that they depend too heavily on transaction fees, which I fully acknowledge, but they have the name recognition and the biggest userbase, and it'll be up to their management team to make the right moves and continue to innovate. I'm still learning about the crypto space, but there's a lot more than just a means of exchange.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CLF**\n\nAmerican steel. Steel futures have been unstoppable lately, with the re-opening and word that an infrastructure deal is in the works, there's a lot to like about steel. News of China pulling back from steel exports also allows American steel to be more competitive in the marketplace. Yet, despite all these catalysts, the prices of companies like CLF are still lagging behind. This is not your typical growth play, and I personally see this as a short-term (6-12 months) position, due to steel's cyclical nature. I'll also admit I got into this a few months before when CLF was sitting at 18 a share. Still, CLF is poised to gain a lot, and quite a lot to like about this company. The management team under Lourenco Goncalves has revitalized CLF, making big acquisitions of AK Steel and ArcelorMittal USA. He's also recently gone and raised Q2 2021 guidance, and there's reason to believe that even that was conservative for how hot the industry is currently. \n\nIf you're interested in learning more about the thesis behind steel, I'd suggest checking out r/Vitards. Anyways, I don't know if I'm going to hold this position for say 10+ years, so I'll be looking to capitalize on some short-term gains and use those profits to either open up a new position or fuel my current investments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TDOC**\n\nThis is also a very speculative position, similar to COIN. After the major pullback, I believe TDOC is at a very fair evaluation. Despite posting another quarter without profit, there's a lot to like about this company. They have one of the highest NPS scores, significantly greater than AMZN and APPL, which is something that's very compelling and which is something the balance sheet doesn't reflect. Combine that with the fact that they have captured a big chunk of the market, with healthcare professionals and big institutions, makes the company very, very sticky. Even if it only is the \"Zoom for healthcare,\" the quality is strong enough that users won't just drop it for just any other substitute. \n\nBut it's not just the \"Zoom for healthcare\". The acquisitions it has made, both BetterHelp and Livongo, have amazing implications and have yet to show their full potential on TDOC's balance sheet. There's still so much of the healthcare space that can be innovated, and TDOC is primed to take over.\n\nFor right now, I'm OK with TDOC being unprofitable even with the pandemic pushing it along so well. That tells me they're funneling their revenue back into research and development to continue to build up its services and revenue streams.\n\nI also believe that telehealth is still in its infancy, and even though it was massively adopted during COVID, that only accelerates its long-term use and adoption by a little bit. It's going to take a while before it becomes sophisticated enough for people to see the value. This is a long-term play to which I will be consistently adding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BARK**\n\nBarkbox features in delivering monthly care packages for dogs on a subscription basis. This is something that's not as hyped as EVs, but pet care is a fast-growing market that sees more spending each year. In fact, quarantine boosted the number of pet owners in the US dramatically. Barkbox has seen tremendous yoy growth in revenue and subscriptions, with a CAGR, gross margins, and a returning customer rate that beats the industry leader CHWY as well as other popular brands. BARK has made a lot of partnerships with the likes of AMZN, WMT, TGT, etc., and looks to continue to expand vertically in the space of dog hygiene/medicine/food. All of this while trading at a much lower multiple than the other big pet care brands. \n\nThe management team is fantastic. Manish Joneja, CEO of BARK, has 2 decades of experience as director of Amazon global exports and expansion and 5+ years on eBay as product lead. Carly Strife and Henrik Werdelin have been featured in Forbes 30 under 30 and Top 100 Most Creative/Top 100 people in tech, respectively. \n\nThe bear case of this company is that they have no moat, but their customer retention speaks a lot to brand loyalty and satisfaction. CHWY also has a box subscription service for dogs, however, it's nowhere close to as popular as BARK. BARK is also expanding internationally, starting first with Australia.\n\nWill it get to where CHWY is? That part isn't clear and it depends on how well BARK is able to build on what it has and expand what it has to offer.

        "selftext": " **Overview**\n\nWhat is exactly is Global-E? They are a company that integrates with e-commerce platforms to remove complexity with international transactions and provide localized solutions that improve the online shopping experience. The core of the services revolve around the following (from the S-1):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201cThe vast capabilities of our end-to-end platform include interaction with shoppers in their native languages, market-adjusted pricing, payment options tailored to local market preferences, compliance with local consumer regulations and requirements such as customs duties and taxes, shipping services, after-sales support and returns management. These elements are unified under the Global-e platform to enhance the shopper experience and enable merchants to capture the cross-border opportunity.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey are the \u201cplug and play\u201d of making e-commerce international. Their vast network of APIs allow a customer to simply integrate their platform and seamlessly begin selling across different borders and languages. Here\u2019s what they do.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iu033n8ylzb71.png?width=1446&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80b6e7ff09081d8ec26559daaba269f34c0a742e\n\nCurrently, Global-E supports:\n\n* Local messaging in over 25 languages\n* Purchases in over 100 currencies\n* Accepts over 150 payment methods\n* A multitude of competitively-priced shipping options\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Business Model**\n\nGlobal-E generates revenues by charging a fee (\u201cservice fee\u201d) for the integration of their platform into a merchant\u2019s services. Service fees are highly variable based on transaction volume, destination markets, level of customer service provided, etc, and are generated as a percentage of the Gross Merchandise Value (\u201cGMV\u201d) that flows through the platform. Global-E mandatorily bundles certain components of their integrated platform solutions that they believe are essential for achieving improved sales conversions from international traffic. However, their fulfillment services are offered on an optional basis and merchants can choose to utilize those services or cancel at any time. Think of it as bundling service A and B to have the greatest effect, while offering service C as an add-on component. Service fees make up for approximately 35% of revenue while fulfillment services are currently accounting for roughly 65%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Partnerships &amp; why they use Global-E**\n\nGlobal-E has formed many key technological as well as service partnerships. These third-party e-commerce platforms include: Salesforce Commerce Cloud, Shopify, BigCommerce, Magento Commerce, SAP, WooCommerce, PrestaShop, and others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What they do for merchants?*\n\nSome of the key benefits they provide for merchants are:\n\n* increased sales conversions: converting international traffic\n* offloading complexities: handling local pricing, payment collection, import duties, fraud, etc \n* reduction of risk: reduce legal complexity, manage import duties and taxes, handle compliance\n* enabling growth to new markets: allowing merchants flexibility to expand to cross-border opportunities\n\nAll while emphasizing merchant branding. The customer always faces the digital store-front and never leaves the brand page to check-out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What they do for shoppers?*\n\nGlobal-E\u2019s goal is to offer a frictionless shopping journey, regardless of the origin of the customer. This means:\n\n* Localized languages\n* Re-pricing in local currencies\n* Handling cross-border payments\n* Accurately pre-price import duties and taxes and include them in the final cost of the product\n* Delivery: using an extensive network of over 20 shipping carriers they are able to offer multiple shipping modes at attractive rates.\n* After-sale support and returns\n\nMerchants integrating Global-E into their platform generally experience a significantly higher international traffic conversion rate (often exceeding 60%). The Global-E platform removes many complexities involved with international expansion. They already have more than 400 merchants, from small companies to globally-recognized retailers, on the platform across various diversified verticals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Shopify Deal**\n\nAs mentioned above, one of Global-E most lucrative partners lies with Shopify making them the exclusive third-party and cross-border solution across the large network of Shopify merchants. Shopify knows what kind of business that will bring for Global-E and thus Shopify has bought 7.75 million shares and acquired a **6.5% stake** in the company. As Shopify grows Global-E grows and Shopify knows this, hence the stake in a company that reflects their own revenues by proxy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TAM, &amp; CAGR**\n\nFirst came the transition to domestic e-commerce as well as sourcing and reselling products from China (aka Dropshipping). Next is going to be the transition of global e-commerce and cross-border sales. According to this 225 page **research by GlobeNewsWire**, the global cross-border B2C e-commerce market was 780 billion in 2019 and expected to grow at a CAGR of 27% through 2026 where it will become a 4.82 trillion market.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/96veafozlzb71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d3fc8afcb51b413dbdbb3deb95b24fadf89d313\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Global-E\u2019s Smart Insights**\n\nOne of the company\u2019s strengths lies within sophisticated \u201cSmart Insights\u201d they use to scale their applications. Smart Insights is a \u201cbig data\u201d network that uses various metrics such as country, price-point, and shopper behaviors allowing Global-E to provide highly-optimized experience for shoppers. This ends up driving increased conversion rates and revenues for the merchant and a better overall experience for the shopper. The company has noted by integrating big-data into their platform they can experience \u201ceconomies of scale\u201d as well as \u201ceconomies of skill\u201d enabling them to optimize merchants\u2019 cross-border sales. These insights are continuously expanding as they collect additional data points along the purchasing journey.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Competitive Advantage &amp; Growth Opportunities**\n\nWhat seems to be becoming more of a trend since 2020 and even more so now in 2021 are corporation\u2019s use of big data. I\u2019m not talking about basic user data such as age, gender, location, but more on the lines of vastly large information networks. These networks can utilize things such as time spent on page, scrolls, and clicks all in one massive database. Global-E differentiates themselves through their main data asset (\u201cSmart Insights\u201d) that informs them on certain decisions and is able to optimize how merchants sell their product across different borders. They integrate this data network into a flywheel effect, for example: their current analytics drives more sales to merchants, which then feeds new data back into the system, which then allows for higher optimization and better conversions. They feed into each other back and forth getting smarter with each website visitor and purchase. This aligns perfectly for their products \u201cNet Dollar Retention Rate\u201d of 134% and 172% in 2019 and 2020, respectively.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGlobal-E attributes much of their growth to being a first mover (and doing it right) in the cross-border e-commerce space. Their success has been accelerated by several key factors, such as:\n\n* Accelerated shift towards e-commerce outpacing traditional retail\n* Cross-border e-commerce growing faster than domestic e-commerce\n* Their merchant\u2019s strategic focus on D2C sales, maintaining relationship with shoppers globally\n* The complexity and limitations of leaving the merchant responsible for implementing what Global-E offers. This doesn\u2019t come down to just a cost, but also time-intensive as well as being difficult to maintain and scale\n* Covid-19 tailwinds\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a result of the above and other market factors, the cross-borders e-commerce market is expected to continue the surge in growth. I previously mentioned the forecast in TAM however, Forrester, a research company, also expects the cross-border e-commerce markets to reach $736 billion by 2023.\n\nGlobal-E has several opportunities to expand on existing channels and capture new markets. This can be done with:\n\n* Growth through existing portfolio of merchants and strengthening relationships\n* Acquiring new merchants in existing geographies\n* Expanding in new geographies that they don\u2019t have exposure to\n* Continue to expand and innovate their platform\n* Continue to develop strategic partnerships (with key brands and players)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Risks**\n\nMany of Global-E\u2019s risks fall under the category of general business risks. Some of these include: retaining old merchants and attracting new ones, failing to enhance the platform as well as successfully competing against new and existing competition, failing to manage growth, pricing pressures from competition, and being highly dependent on cross-border regulations, sales, and operations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Revenues, Scale, &amp; Profitability**\n\nIn FY 2020 Global-E helped process 4.6 million orders for their merchants generating $136.4 million. Their Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) also grew to 774 million for the same period. Other impressive metrics were their net dollar retention rate and gross profit as % of revenue both of which continue to climb at 172% and 31.9%, respectively. Stellar!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2quy1ct0mzb71.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf2d87fbd8f20317fe7d69d27c639fcf6132c5f9\n\nSome key growth metrics the company has seen in 2019 and 2020.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o25hb862mzb71.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acb11f768d6c2f19dae64fdbaa43d4be321e92bb\n\nAlthough the company has recently turned a profit while growing top-line revenue and GMV at a high pace. The company suggested that short-term profitability might be sacrificed due to the expansions they are making to cover larger markets. As noted from the S-1:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201cWe expect our operating expenses to significantly increase over the next several years as we hire additional personnel, expand into new geographies, expand our partnerships, operations, and infrastructure, continue to enhance our platform, develop and expand its features, integrations and capabilities, expand and improve our service offering and increase our spending on sales and marketing. We intend to continue to build and enhance our platform through internal research and development and we may also selectively pursue acquisitions.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick peak at their consolidated statement of operations. Note the revenue growth and total operating expenses that *decreas*e, as a percentage of total revenue, as revenues increase (almost doubles YoY).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tsq4hmx3mzb71.png?width=1656&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=caa3a9af7e659b3e3721817a5dad8e06495dba72\n\n**Valuation**\n\nLooking at GLBE\u2019s valuation it is clear that you pay a premium when owning this company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The Good*\n\nGLBE is growing revenue at 134% YoY.\n\nGross margins are improving while the company continues to scale.\n\nMany tech and services partnerships they can piggy back on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The Bad*\n\nConsistent profitability could be years away as the company is investing heavily into their own expansion of current and new markets.\n\nGLBE is currently trading at roughly 50x price to sales and 260 forward P/E.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Up for Debate*\n\nGlobal-E has almost no long-term debt, but current liabilities are stacking up while the company is not generating much FCF. I wouldn\u2019t expect them to be generating this much FCF this early in the game after their IPO.\n\nLock-up expiration on August 11, 2021.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nIn my opinion Global-E is top of the class when it comes to their business. They are growing extremely fast while improving margins and this is the premium you would pay versus investing in a \u201cstable\u201d company generating tons of FCF, but not much growth. Due to the nature of being a high-growth stock there will naturally be more volatility around the trade. While it\u2019s currently trading at 50x price/sales I am more likely to shy away from entering a new position. We could see this stock swing to 40x p/s and potentially enter on the dips.\n\nThis is somewhat of a chicken or the egg situation because there might not be any dips to buy with this kind of growth. For example, at current growth rates (100-135% YoY) if stock price is maintained it would only be trading at less than half it\u2019s price/sales valuation only one year from now. This is definitely a stock to monitor closely if you are wanting to find the right entry point for a long-term hold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;**\n\n1. Global-E is an \u201cenabler\u201d that allows e-commerce and digital stores to seamlessly integrate international transactions. They deal with tasks from translations, currency re-pricing, international shipping &amp; returns, compliance &amp; tax regulations, etc.\n2. GLBE integrates their proprietary \u201cSmart Insights\u201d application that analyses customer shopping and transaction data to continuously improve on sales conversions. The feedback loop is always learning as it collects more and more data along each customer\u2019s purchase journey.\n3. GLBE is trading at a rich valuation given their total revenue was $136 million in 2020. However, they are growing top-line revenues and Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) over 130% Y.o.Y. Shopify holds a 6.5% stake in Global-E as GLBE facilitates a large amount of transactions on the Shopify network. As Shopify grows, GLBE grows.\n4. GLBE is growing through many tailwinds such as those from covid lockdowns and accelerated shift toward e-commerce outpacing traditional retail. They\u2019ve got an opportunity to expand into more international regions, strengthen relationships with existing merchants, while continuing to expand and improve their platform.",

        "selftext": "This is a DAMN GOOD start for the week. For everyone who asked \u00abwhere can I get it\u00bb and \u00abCan\u2019t see it on my app\u00bb and so on:\n\n**Quote** [**https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-applies-to-trade-on-otcqb/**](https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-applies-to-trade-on-otcqb/)\n\n&gt;Xigem Technologies Corporation (CSE:XIGM) (FSE:2C1), a technology provider for the emerging remote economy, announced that it has filed an application with the OTC Markets Group for its common shares to trade on the OTCQB.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cTrading on the OTCQB would be a meaningful step in enhancing shareholder value,\u201d said Brian Kalish, co-founder and CEO of Xigem.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Xigem looks forward to working with these parties to complete the Company\u2019s OTCQB application process during the third quarter of 2021.\n\nSo Q3 as you probably know is July-September. If you have Questrade or some other magic broker that has $XIGM (spoiler: almost nobody has it at this moment), here are the reasons I'm loading more:\n\n* Uplisting means a new market, more people, more money, price growth. Morningstar reported that it\u2019s fair price is over 1$ and today\u2019s 0,3 price is a joke. Now maybe it will look more realistic;\n* They\u2019re developing and feel confident enough to face all the US SE bureaucracy - it means that they will close the deals, like promised, before August. [https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-provides-update-on-proposed-acquisitions/](https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-provides-update-on-proposed-acquisitions/) \n\nIt enters the US market in a good shape tho:\n\n* FinTech FOOi P2P app complete acquisition loi;\n* 21% shipping industry trackers ShipitTo acquisition loi;\n* iAgent CRM and workforce management platform developed and waiting for tests;\n* Bunch of clients for the platform, like Baketree, FluBusters and ISI, already signed to pay Xigem for it.\n\nTo the theories that they\u2019re leaving CSE - they don't, now it's obvious why they needed the US pr advisors. Things stay the same, just more people will be able to buy it. No reinventing things under a new name. I\u2019m not really experienced in it, but uplisting is supposed to be a sensitive process and you\u2019re screwed HARD if you try to play tricks in the middle of it. No way back for them, just growth and more money.\n\n**tl;dr:** Xigem $XIGM, Canadian tech company with its own all-in-one solution for business management and a portfolio of remote economy companies, goes to OTC. Previously it was only on CSE and FSE so most people couldn\u2019t buy it, I checked some old threads on it here and remember mine. Now people will be able to get it when the uplisting is done. Looks like some good gains are coming this summer.",

        "selftext": "Palantir is an American software company that specializes in big data analytics, with a market cap of 43 billion. They started building software for the intelligence community in the US to assist in counterterrorism investigations by helping them identify patterns hidden deep within large data sets. Later, they realized that similarly to the intelligence community, commercial institutions did not have the most effective tools to manage and make sense of the data involved in large projects. \n\nAny large scale company or business will always collect a ton of data most often stored in texts such as spreadsheets or databases (which requires programming knowledge to navigate through). A common issue large companies have is simply having too much data. Palantir creates software that consolidates a company's data and displays it in a comprehensible, easily digestible user interface for the company to use. This allows Palantir to work with companies/organizations like the CDC for medicine, the military for national security, etc. \n\nWith Palantir, a normal non-technical operator can click their computer to pull up an order, or an issue that Palanrie detected, make any changes and or notify whoever needs the attention. Let's take the CDC for example. When the vaccine rolled out, Palantir had a huge hand in this. Palantir gives a visual display of where the vaccine is going, how many, and any issues that have risen (if any), allowing for fast response time. For example, Palantir could display a map with the various routes to different deployment sites with pictures of a little truck representing the shipments being routed to their destination. An operator could click one of these shipments/routes and pull up any data of that specific point. With data being displayed and organized in this way it makes it easy to analyze data, where things are going, and what kind of picture the data represents, rather than staring at a spreadsheet of numbers. This is just one example, Palantir is customizable enough where it can represent any business/organization's structure.\n\nPalantir\u2019s revenue streams consist of their two main software: [Gotham](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/), which was designed primarily for the defence and intelligence sector, and [Foundry](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/) for the commercial sector. However, the platforms are not exclusive to either sector. For example, Gotham is also offered to commercial customers in the financial services industry. The two platforms can either be used separately or bundled together as a single ecosystem. Currently, revenue is more or less evenly split between the government and commercial sectors. \n\nGotham\u2019s main tools include:\n\nGaia \u2013 lets users plan, execute, and report on operations via a shared live map. Live maps track real-time data and users drag and drop objects from other Gotham applications directly into Gaia.\n\nDossier \u2013 is a live collaboration document editor to share analysis and discover intelligence. Users can collaborate across teams and organizations to create a living, interactive, and up-to-date document.\n\nVideo \u2013 an application designed to interact with both streaming and historical video data. Users can review video footage in the platform as well as enhance raw footage with geospatial information and overlays based on other data sources.\n\nFoundry\u2019s main tools include:\n\nContour \u2013 enables exploration of large-scale data. Users can filter, join, and visualize datasets to answer analytical questions and publish the results as a report or new dataset that will automatically update with the underlying datasets.\n\nObject Explorer \u2013 allows users to interact with data represented as objects \u2013 like customers, equipment, or plants \u2013 rather than rows in a table.\n\nAs we know, Palantir started in the defence and intelligence space. This required Palantir to have elite-level security from the start. Their software had to be secure enough to handle national secrets and transparent enough to ensure that the data could be monitored and traced. This was no easy feat, however, Palantir managed to achieve this, which is why they have been renewing their contracts with several government agencies.\n\nThis is important when trying to sell their products to their commercial clients because they need something safe and reliable to protect themselves and their data. Furthermore, Palantir currently has IL-5 clearance with the Department of Defense, which makes them 1 of 4 software companies with this level of clearance, alongside Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP (Google and Snowflake have IL-2 clearance). It has also been rumoured that Palantir may achieve IL-6 clearance, which has never been done before as it is the storage/processing of classified information.\n\nThis level of clearance should speak volumes to how safe and secure Palantir\u2019s technology is and should provide ease of mind to companies that they are in business with.",

A business looking to carry out an advertising campaign would go to OMC and OMC would spread marketing content across many content providers.  \n\nTheir operations can be generalized into three categories: Advertising, Public relations, healthcare, and CRM stuff.  Here is the list of the distinct different services that they offer:\n\nadvertising, investor relations, branding, graphic arts/digital imaging, \n\nmarketing research, content marketing, media planning and buying,\n\ncorporate social responsibility consulting, merchandising and point of sale,\n\ncrisis communications, mobile marketing, custom publishing , non-profit marketing,\n\nmulti-cultural marketing, data analytics, database management, organizational communications,  \n\npackage design, digital transformation, product placement, digital/direct marketing ,\n\nentertainment marketing, promotional marketing, experiential marketing,  \n\npublic affairs, field marketing, public relations, sales support,\n\nfinancial/corporate business-to-business advertising, retail marketing,\n\nhealthcare marketing and communications, search engine marketing, instore design,  \n\nshopper marketing, interactive marketing, social media marketing, sports and event marketing\n\nManagement overview:\n\nFrom glassdoor, 95% of employees approve of the CEO.  Most reviews say that management encourages discussion and recommendations, but there are a few bad reviews related to the personal relationships between management and employees.  The CEO seems average. CFO and CEO do not have much info about them online.  The CIO seems like he knows what he\u2019s doing, and has a lot of experience.  \n\n## Company history\n\nOMC was created from a three way merger in 1986.  The current CEO has been in his position since 1999.  The three way merger involved BBDO, DDB, and NHW.  BBDO was rated the world's most creative agency, DDB was one of the largest advertising networks in the world, and TBWA was ranked in the top ten agencies that utilize disruption to develop business changing ideas.  These companies all exist under OMC as subsidies where OMC acts as the holding company.  The three subsidies act independently of each other.\n\nBBDO was formed in 1919 in NYC.  Bruice Barton (the BB) was a philosopher and eventually a congressman and then almost a senator.  He has admitted that he was not a good match for the advertising industry.  Roy Durstine (the D) was more involved in the actual business.  He eventually became a workaholic, lost his wife, became an alcoholic and got fired in 1939.  Alex Osbor (the O) is a mystery.  BBDOs business then started to boom and they picked up some large clients in the early 40s.  There was a lot of turmoil in the company in the 50s and 60s as the old guys were replaced, and new clients were slowly being acquired as old ones were lost or went out of business.  They became very involved in advertising for the republicans during this time.  They did not do well in the 70s during the recession, which should not be forgotten today, but they managed to get by much better than other companies.    In 1976, a CEO started an 8 year tenure and managed to keep the company stable by employing special cost management measures so as not to waste the spoils of growth.  At the time of the merger, BBDO was the only of the three that was not experiencing financial difficulties.  BBDO agreed to the merger because the other companies had consistent international growth, which was apparently lacking in BBDO.\n\nDDB was formed in 1949 by three men all of whom had previous industry experience.  They had tremendous success early on, focusing on hiring the most creative people they could find and taking the road not traveled.  At the time, Polaroid was an unknown company.  They were one of the first four to be clients of DDB In the 60s they did work for Avis rentals and Volkswagen.  At the time, nobody wanted Volkswagens in America.  DDB was instrumental in changing this with their campaigns for the VW beetle, making the vehicle a major success in America. Following this success they won over many major clients such as Heinz, American Airlines, Mobil oil, and Gillette to name a few.  In 1982, William Bernbach (the B) died.  This caused earnings to plummet, and financial difficulty closely followed.  By 1986, they had lost some of their most important clients, including polaroid, which was probably their biggest success.  The merger was a no-brainer for them with the resources of BBDO.\n\nTBWA started in 1924.  They had a strong presence in the middle east.  They provided a lot of services to smaller companies that otherwise felt neglected by larger advertising agencies.  I cannot find anything interesting about them between 1924 and 1970.  In the 70s, they found it difficult to find investment interest, so they decided to become private.  They had by now acquired many blue chip clients such as xerox, mcdonalds, honda, and sears on top of their many smaller clients.  They lost mcdonalds and xerox leading up to the 198 6 merger, and there were some conflicts in the merger such as campbells soup threatening to leave TBWA because Heinz would be a client of the parent OMC after the merger.  \n\nProfits for OMC after the merger were low.  In the 90s, OMC grew revenues, and at the end of the decade, a new CEO was put in place and the company had begun to diversify into digital marketing.  In 1997, they were fortune's most respected advertising group.  In 1997, they won back McDonalds.  All throughout this period, they have been acquiring companies worldwide.  \n\nIn the 2000s, OMC lost its position as the world's largest advertiser to WPP.  OMC bought 19 companies in 2000. OMC was hurt by 9/11, but managed to rebuild with the rest of the country.  OMC aggressively pursued goals in hollywood.  When the Enron scandal happened, 7 of OMCs board members were ousted and OMC decided to commit to better corporate governance. By 2002, OMC was in good shape while rivals were restructuring and laying off employees.  \n\nGrowth afterwards was much more predictable.  OMC took on many blue chip companies as clients, and saw great client retention for the next two decades.   \n\n## Revenue Breakdown / Company segments\n\nTheir 100 largest clients represent 54% of revenue, and their largest client represents 3.4%.  They lost 11.7% of revenue in the past year, but given that the events last year are not typical, this is not expected to be a long term trend.\n\nTotal revenue is 13.171 billion.\n\n1. The Americas accounted for 8.752B of this.  North America had 7.577B and latin America had 0.275 B.\n2. Europe, Middle East, And Asia Accounted for 5.317 Billion.  Europe had 3.607B, Middle East/Africa had 0.207B, and Asia had 1.503B\n\nBecause this is an American company, the implications make sense.  Revenue is most concentrated in places that the company understands - westernized countries, leaving a lot of room for growth in emerging markets.  This growth may not be desired by the company due to the instability and tendency to default on debts in emerging countries.  \n\nRevenue streams:\n\nAdvertising: 7.369 B (56%)\n\nCRM: 3.308 B (25.1%)\n\nPR: 1.301 B ( 9.9%)\n\nHealthcare: 1.191 B (9.0%)\n\n## Industry position\n\nThey are the largest public advertising company, which brings pros and cons for any industry.  They will be missing out on a lot of revenue because they will be focusing on larger clients, while letting a lot of smaller ones slip by.  At the same time, they will get the largest contracts in the industry, and as a result they have been able to sustain the highest margins in the industry.\n\nTheir payout ratio (57%) is much higher than other dividend paying advertising agencies.  This has dual implications.  They are not retaining as much earnings, and they are not spending as much on internal investments.  It also means that they have reached a point where growth is organic and the company has a stable capital structure so they can and do pay out earnings that are not needed.\n\n## Company base statistics\n\nMarket Cap: 17.42B\n\nTotal Debt: 5.81B\n\nCash &amp; Liquid assets: 5.6B\n\nEnterprise Value:  20.01B\n\nEquity: 3.084B\n\nShares Outstanding: 217M\n\nEV/Sales: 1.517x\n\nEarnings: 0.975B\n\nROE: 34.4%\n\nEmployees: 64100, 20800 in the US, 27100 in north america, 25800 in europe and 11200 in asia\n\n## Overview/Growth and Developments\n\nGrowth: \n\n* There has been slow revenue growth over the last 15 years.  Recently it has decreased from what it was in 2014-2018.  Based on past data, it is likely to stay stable, and in the long term slowly grow.\n* Earnings have been positive for every quarter 15 years straight.  Growth is better than revenue with the last year being much lower than proceeding years.  This is expected for a large company, where they are slowly finding ways to increase profitability.\n* FCF is constantly at around 10% of the market cap.  It has not been growing, but rather fluctuating around 1.5-2 billion for the past 15 years.  This implies operational stability, but stunted growth.\n\nBased on the growth indicators above, OMC is not a growth stock.  It does have the characteristics of a classic value stock.\n\nMargins:\n\n* Profit margins have been quite low, and show slow growth.  Never negative (See earnings).\n* Gross margin is at around 17%.  It has been around this since 2013.  In 2013, there was a drop from 26% to 17%.  Before 2013 GM was above 22% every year.\n* Ebitda margin follows profit margin with +3%.\n\nNet reinvestment:\n\n* OMC has very little net reinvestment.  The nature of the business does not require much, but it would be something nice to see, especially if they decide to diversify into other industries.  \n\nShare buybacks:\n\n* OMC has consistently bought back shares every year for 15 years.  This and dividends are how they maximize shareholder value.  They have consistently bought back under 15 million shares per year, averaging around 10 million per year.  This is another indicator of their status as a traditional value stock.\n* They stated that they do not plan on any repurchase in the recent future.  This is a very smart move given the economic conditions.  This shows that management is willing to temporarily stunt shareholder value in order to preserve it in the long run.  This isn't something they have to disclose, so it is meaningful that they elected to do so \n\nCost of capital:\n\n* D/E has steady growth, and is at 1.6.  This is not very concerning because the company has capital reserves that can easily cover over 90% of debt, and most debt is long term.\n* Moodys assigned a baa1 credit rating with a stable outlook.  Meaning they have adequate ability to meet debt obligations.  \n* S&amp;P gave them BBB+ credit ratings on commercial paper.\n\nCosts:\n\n* Interest expenses are at 184M\n* Cogs represent almost all expenses\n* No R&amp;D ever - See reinvestment\n\nDebts: \n\n* Lots of LTD, covered by cash\n* 1.25B due 2022 - easily covered\n* 750 M due 2024- \\^\\^\n* Next 5y interest payments are 684.1 Million, manageable\n* Lease payments next 5y - 1.2B, manageable.  \n* Almost negligible pension plan payments.  309m obligation over time, 164m liability\n* 71.9 M earn out, 31.1M payable in 2021 (Where a company has an obligation to pay out earnings to the seller of a business they acquired - usually a condition of lower purchase price)\n* 101.6M foreign tax transition obligations, 11.6M payable in 2021.\n* Recently issued 600M debt, paid off older debt issues with the new issuance.  This is a standard practice.\n* Another issuance of longer term debt provided 600M to general corporate expenses including working capital expenditures, fixed asset expenditures and repayment of debt issues (They used the debt issue to finance general operating activities)\n* The terms of any debt that is issues is not subject to change in the event that credit ratings change\n\nThe capital obligations are manageable, and OCF currently covers and has in the past aptly covered obligations.\n\nAssets\n\n* Most cash coming from OCF.\n* Cash is managed daily internally.  A company treasury receives excess cash from operations and provides cash to operations when there is a need for it.  Great for keeping track of cash and also overseeing operations.\n* Company treasuries invest excess cash they have in short term maturity securities (1-90 day expiry on average)\n* 2.3 out of 5.6 B of cash is held by foreign subsidies.\n* Net debt decreased by 624M (Total debt - total cash)\n\nWACC: 10.6-.8%\n\nLong term growth rate: 3%\n\nLegal: Nothing large worth noting\n\nRecent/expected developments: Nothing worth noting\n\n## Valuation\n\nOMCs DCF Valuation is between $120-140.  Seeing that the company is experiencing slow growth and is not a well known company, this figure may not be an accurate price prediction but is nonetheless a devent valuation providing an adequate margin of safety.\n\nNote 1. Their use of EBITDA in their analysis is slightly reckless.  Not realizing interest expenses is not recommended in the industry.  Interest expenses are very real, as are taxes, and so they should be considered by a company when they are performing an internal audit.\n\nSources:\n\nTheir 10-K (This is where you really get to understand the capital and debt structure): [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/29989/000002998921000004/omc-20201231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/29989/000002998921000004/omc-20201231.htm)\n\nMacrotrends (Better than SEC for fast long term data, sometimes inaccurate): https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/OMC/omnicom-group/stock-price-history\n\nGlassdoor: https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Omnicom-Reviews-E1734.htm\n\nCIO Linkedin: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/chadi-farhat-2b421a76/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chadi-farhat-2b421a76/)\n\nYahoo finance: [https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/OMC/profile?p=OMC](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/OMC/profile?p=OMC)\n\nFinviz: [https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&amp;f=ind\\_advertisingagencies](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&amp;f=ind_advertisingagencies)\n\nHistory: https://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/69/Omnicom-Group-Inc.html",

Say goodbye to formal paper agreements. DocuSign makes it easy to sign agreements. No more going into the office to sign a contract. No more losing your documents. All the documents are stored in the cloud making your agreements easy to find. Some of the top-performing fortune 500 companies use DocuSign. If they back them, why shouldn't you? COVID-19 has had a positive effect on DOCU. DOCU has been able to capitalize on all the people working from home during the pandemic. This can be proven by the massive increase in market cap. This can also be proven by the PE, PS, and PB ratios. I believe those who have transitioned to DOCU during the pandemic have no reason to switch back to paper. I believe we're going to see more companies make the switch from paper to the cloud whether or not they choose DocuSign. The digital era requires digital solutions. I believe DOCU is a good long-term investment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice\\*\\**\n\n*\\*\\*Do your own research\\*\\**",

        "selftext": "Hi guys!! Former wall street analyst here... I'm sharing what I've learned from 10 years of experience. \n\n(I wrote a [book](https://henrychien.com/investing-book/)!) Here's an excerpt on business models - which is a HUGE part of investing and picking stocks. It's a way to simplify a business so you can get a sense of how the big the company can get (i.e. its growth) and how much cash flows it can create  (i.e. its profits). \n\nThen you have an idea (i.e. your thesis) and can estimate where the price of a stock can go. \n\nI'll use $DMTK, which is a popular stock on Fintwit (and also very limited research), of how you research the company to learn its business model, to then estimate its finances. \n\n## What is a \u201cbusiness model\u201d?\n\nThis is a way to simplify how business works into a \u201cmodel\u201d. With a model you can estimate the change of a company\u2019s growth and cash flows to reach a value of a stock.\n\n***You start by describing the basic business model (here with DermTech):***\n\n* **A business provides a product or a service.** DermTech ($DMTK) provides a test for dermatologists to test people for melanoma. Each test costs a certain $ amount which is charged to either patients or insurers. \n* **This provides some value to its customers.** The test is an alternative to biopsies which are painful and leave scars. It is also more accurate which means less biopsies, which also means less overall costs for insurers. \n* **It operates in a \u201cmarket\u201d which is its current or potential customers.** $DMTK\u2019s target market is U.S. dermatologists that test and monitor their patients for melanoma. \n* **Management has a vision for the business.** CEO John Dobak wants to build DermTech into a leading platform of genetic testing for dermatology practices. \n\n***And then the business strategy\\*:***\n\n* **The business has a strategy to grow or \u201cscale\u201d to a certain level.** Management plans to expand sales to the majority of testing dermatology clinicians and expand reimbursement to most commercial insurance plans.\n* **Business has a future potential source of profits or \u201cmargin.\u201d** The cost of the facility and equipment is largely fixed so higher prices should support gross margin. Sales and marketing should also grow slower than revenues to create operating margin and profits over time. \n\n*\\*This fits directly into the valuation framework of growth and cash flows.*\n\nOnce you do this, you build a \u201csense\u201d of a company and what is the critical factor that will drive earnings and the value of the company. This is super important to build an investment thesis.\n\n* **Simplify a company into a business model to estimate change.** \n\n## Where to find information to describe a business model?\n\nUse these key sources of information to use when looking at a company. \n\n**SEC Filings** \\- The 10K and / or the S1 prospectus has the most detailed information on the business model, its financials and the market it operates in. 10Qs provide quarterly updates.These are all accessible on SEC [EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml). \n\nPay attention to these sections in the 10K and S1 for the most valuable information.\n\n* ***\u201cBusiness\u201d*** and ***\u201cManagement Discussion and Analysis\u201d*** sections typically describe the businesses\u2019 products or services, the value to customers, the market it operates in. The discussion usually describes the company\u2019s growth strategy.\n* ***\u201cRisk factors''*** section is where you get a sense of the risk of the business. This is also a good area to look for the critical factor for the value of the business. \n\n**Investor presentation** \\- Use this to get more information on the market and the business model. Here is where management will often highlight the growth strategy.\n\nThis is helpful for building the upside of an investment thesis (expected growth and earnings).\n\n* **Videos of management or Q&amp;A** \\- Use these videos to get a sense of the business model and growth strategy from management. Here they will usually outline the company\u2019s vision, the growth strategy and sometimes targets for scale and margin. \n\n**Transcript of earnings calls (Q&amp;A)** \\- Look at the prepared commentary for a business update (focus on the critical factors) and then search the Q&amp;A for additional details to help understand the financial model or change in the business. \n\n**Earnings releases** \\-  Look at these for the metrics for business updates. These are posted on investor relations pages and in 8K filings on EDGAR. Pay attention to guidance. \n\n* *Later, you will learn how to quickly analyze these releases.*  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Here\u2019s a sample business model overview from $DMTK***\n\n$DMTK provides a non-invasive diagnostic for melanoma that uses genomic analysis (pigmented lesion assay). There are three sources of value:\n\n* The value to customers is fewer biopsies to diagnose melanoma (requires 2.5 to 1 vs. 25 to 1 for biopsies)\n* Clinical value also lowers probability of missing melanoma (&lt;1%) and higher predictive value (3-4% from 18.7%)\n* Economic value to payers from lower cost to $760 vs. $947 for visual assessment, fewer biopsies and earlier detection of melanoma.\n\nManagement\u2019s vision is to incorporate genomic testing into dermatology with this platform.\n\n* The \u201cmarket\u201d for this product is the 4m surgical biopsies performed every year for early stage melanoma (which translates to about 207K / year).\n* The plan to expand commercial insurance reimbursement coverage to increase sales price to $760 per test, which will raise gross margins to 60-70%. \n* The growth strategy is to target the 5,000 clinicians that perform the majority of biopsies and plan to increase their salesforce to 50 people. \n\nThe critical factor (and risk) is getting commercial reimbursement coverage in order to raise the price point. Another risk is the ability to generate profits and scale its salesforce.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith those assumptions you can estimate the future finances of the company, which you can then use to estimate the future price of the stock! (That will require another post!).\n\nFeel free to DM me (or follow me on twitter - henrychien4 ). And here's the [book link](https://henrychien.com/investing-book/) if you are interested.

Say goodbye to formal paper agreements. DocuSign makes it easy to sign agreements. No more going into the office to sign a contract. No more losing your documents. All the documents are stored in the cloud making your agreements easy to find. Some of the top-performing fortune 500 companies use DocuSign. If they back them, why shouldn't you? COVID-19 has had a positive effect on DOCU. DOCU has been able to capitalize on all the people working from home during the pandemic. This can be proven by the massive increase in market cap. This can also be proven by the PE, PS, and PB ratios. I believe those who have transitioned to DOCU during the pandemic have no reason to switch back to paper. I believe we're going to see more companies make the switch from paper to the cloud whether or not they choose DocuSign. The digital era requires digital solutions. I believe DOCU is a good long-term investment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice\\*\\**\n\n*\\*\\*Do your own research\\*\\**",

Ex-VC @ Eight Roads Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, Ex-drone @ LEK Consulting. Cambridge and LSE alum. @lillianmli\n\n\n\n630 views\n\n1) Given the amount of panic I've seen on Twitter over Chinese stocks. I'm once again, asking you to consider some fundamental framings of the rules and objectives of Chinese governance. \n\nIt might be interesting. But it is better than being mired in FUD.\n\n$TAL $TCHY $BABA\n\n2) It makes great sense to pay attention to the rules of the game that the players are playing in. \n\nThe implicit rules of China are that the government sets goals for the country and invert back to to key objectives that the country should be attaining. \n\nThey don't hide this\n\n3) It's literally called the Five Year Plan, it's the blueprint for the next five years and beyond for the Chinese economy. \n\nThere is a bit of reading the tea leaves but it's not impenetrable. \nLiterally. Every. Investor. I know in China pores over this.\n\n4) In terms of China's biggest woes in the future - it's aging demographic and lack of children \nIt's in the targets for 5YP, China didn't list a GDP growth figure but said they needed to increase population. This is basically them laying down the law\n6) You know the kind of stress Chinese kids and parents are under these days? \nPrimary kids here in China are literally carrying rolling baggages of books to school, they are so heavy they can't even carry them. Their days are packed with going to school, then cram schools.\n\n7) Advertisement selling status anxieties to get kids into after schools are rife. Whenever I chat to parents they all tell me they can't afford kids given the cost of schooling and and tutoring. \nThis is also just the tier one cities\n\n8) This kind of resources isn't even available to tier 3 and lower cities. If continued this will increase inequality in education attainment and therefore income in China going forward. \nLowering inequality - another key OKR for China\n\n9) An eagle eye journalist told me that out of all the sessions Xi decided to chair the one on education for Lianghui and chaired another high-level political discussion on education on May 21. \n\nThat kind of attention matters and shows priority of the top leaders.\n\n10) Also given the lagging regulatory environment in China, education is a public good and shouldn't be overtly privitised. That's also coming into play here as well. \nThis is overdue catch-up\n11) As for $BABA, $TCHY and $DIDI - look man, the focus on technology in the 5YP is on hard tech and not e-commerce or taxis. These players have moved into value extraction and are taking up valuable innovation air from more worthy causes in the party's eyes.\n\n12) I'm not asking people to pass their value judgement here on whether that's a right way or wrong way to govern. That's beside the point. \n\nAs an investor, first and foremost our job is to understand the game that is being played and the rules of the game.\n\n13) China plays with its own set of rules and it's understandable. People in China don't get rich purely on dumb luck. They understand the rules of the game very well. \nAsk Hillhouse or Himalaya. \nIf an investor wants to invest in China. Learn the rules.\n\n14) To make this a bit concrete - yes the education players are in trouble for the foreseeable future. Once the first regulations came out about limiting hours, it was just a matter of when it could get harsher. (Chinese investors already sold during that time)\n\n15) The next thing on this list to make having children more affordable - housing. \n\nI would be very wary of players in that space which props up high housing prices. Pricey houses is a hurdle to having kids. Why is a longer cultural discussion, but it is true.\n\n16) This is not a blanket kill all order for all Chinese tech. But everyone worth their salt during this year is going lay low. Why attract adding attention, unless you're $Didi. \nI'm very comfortable in seeing a great future for Chinese tech players.\n\nShould make clear this is just one pseudo-intellectual\u2019s personal opinion and not definitive by any means.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022",

        "selftext": "**Valuation: Undervalued**\n\n***$PLTR \u2013 Palantir Technologies Inc Investment Summary:***\n\n\u00b7 Recently, there has been a lot of buzz around Palantir, however, very few people actually understand what they do and how they operate. As a result of this I have decided to take on the task of trying explain exactlywhat Palantir does and why they could be the best undervalued stock to buy now.\n\no I am no data engineer, so this article contains my interpretations of what Palantir does, some of my interpretations may be off, so I would appreciate any helpful comments to clear some things up that I may have got wrong.\n\n\u00b7 Based on the comparable analyses that I underwent, Palantir is currently an undervalued stock and represents a great opportunity for a long-term hold.\n\no The length of time that I plan on holding is subject to change due to their future financial reports, and any news that may come out.\n\n\u00b7 It is very hard to say what the upside potential of an investment into Palantir is, which is why my investment plan (found in the \u201cplan\u201d section) is different than usual.\n\no There are various risks to this investment (like there are to every investment), these risks are highlighted near the end of this report under the \u201crisks\u201d section.\n\no Additionally, there are also multiple different catalysts that can help Palantir\u2019s share price, both in the short and long term(s). These catalysts are listed at the end of this report.\n\n***Overview of Palantir as a Company:***\n\n[$PLTR - Palantir Technologies Inc.](https://utradea.com/stocks/PLTR) was founded in 2003 (after their fear/anger after the events observed through 9/11) and started building their software primarily for government institutions and intelligence to assist in counterterrorism by any means possible. At this point in time, Palantir\u2019s only source of revenue was through secretive government contracts.\n\nHowever, since that point in time, Palantir has expanded their operations into commercial enterprises, as they noticed a lot of similarities and overlaps with their applications. Now, Palantir\u2019s revenue comes from both Government Contracts and Commercial Enterprise Contracts.\n\n*Palantir has 2 main software platforms, Palantir \u201cGotham\u201d, and Palantir \u201cFoundry\u201d.*\n\n[**Palantir Gotham**](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/) was their first software platform and was designed for defense/intelligence use cases. Palantir has stated that this kind of platform helps agencies find \u201cneedles in thousands of haystacks\u201d. They also noted that [Gotham helped soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan](https://www.palantir.com/wp-assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Impact-Study-Palantir-Defense-During-Drawdown.pdf) to map networks of bomb makers and insurgents through deep/hidden patterns and datasets, helping the army save time and lives. Since this mission, Gotham has expanded into defense operations and mission planning. During this time, Palantir found that Gotham could also be applied in Airbus\u2019 business, as their planes require millions of parts, assembled in multiple factories in different countries. However, Palantir decided to make another software platform that is better tailored to commercial enterprises, this platform was labelled \u201cPalantir Foundry\u201d.\n\n[**Palantir Foundry**](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/) transforms the way in which organizations interact with their information by creating a central operating system for their data. Palantir enables their customers to construct their own models quickly and easily from countless sets of data points.\n\nPalantir software is used by their 139 Government and Commercial Institutions/enterprises, in over 40 industries, ranging over 150 countries. Palantir works with the US Government and their several allies abroad, as well as the worlds most important/reliable companies.\n\nLastly, Palantir has stated \u201cWe are not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. We build the software that enable our customers to integrate their own data that they already have.\u201d\n\n***Everything you need to know about Palantir and $PLTR:***\n\n*Palantir Foundry:*\n\nFoundry is essentially a [data warehouse](https://panoply.io/data-warehouse-guide/the-difference-between-a-database-and-a-data-warehouse/) that helps their commercial customers to collect and analyze their data. Foundry\u2019s platform includes a [graphical data interface](https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/graphical-user-interface) that is extremely user friendly allowing their customers to get the most out of their data. Furthermore, Foundry provides statistical analyses through the use of their [AI machine learning](https://www.palantir.com/solutions/ai-ml/) networks that are able to consistently deliver efficient and accurate results.\n\nFoundry helps to enables all of their users, regardless of their technical abilities, to work meaningfully and act with the data that they collect. Foundry provides a suite of applications that help combine data analytics and business logic, helping them to deliver superior data integration.\n\nFoundry\u2019s front-end (what the user sees) enables their users to take advantage of all of the data collected by their organization to make informed decisions. Foundry also has a fantastic application for inter-organizational collaboration, this helps a team to build on each others work.\n\n*Foundry brings all of an enterprises data together onto their platform, however there are access controls in place to define what individuals get control over which dataset(s). From there, Foundry is able to deliver advanced analytics through their machine learning and AI systems to get the most value out of a company\u2019s data, make quality insights, so that their clients can gain a competitive advantage.*\n\n**Foundries potential use cases are almost infinite.**\n\n*Palantir Gotham:*\n\nDubbed \u201cThe Operating System for Government Decision Making\u201d, Gotham helps to improve and accelerate decisions across all levels of Government operations.\n\nGotham is primarily used by the defense and intelligence sections of the Government, to help them find what they are looking for. Gotham collects data from millions of different sources and combines it all into one platform to identify hidden patterns and bring all of this data to life. This allows their users to access this data and manage their operations to execute real-world responses to threats that Gotham identifies. Gotham is becoming a main data solution across various different government agencies.\n\nThere is not too much information that is publicly known about the actual uses of Gotham, which makes sense due to the secretive nature of the organizations that they are in business with. However, what we do know is that these organizations have re-signed contracts with Palantir, which helps us to be confident that this platform is truly \u201cthe real deal\u201d.\n\nLastly, Gotham is also offered to select commercial customers, primarily the companies that are investigating fraud in financial service industries. Furthermore, [Palantir has been credited](https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/news/2015/01/12/leaked-documents-bernie-madoff-convicted-thanks-to.html) with assisting in finding the largest Ponzi scheme ever (Bernie Madoff\u2019s Ponzi Scheme).\n\n*Gotham helps the Defense and Intelligence sectors of the Government to pool their incomprehensible amounts of data into one place. Palantir uses machine learning to quickly locate hidden pieces of data, and key patterns, so that these institutions can take swift action to the threats/problems they face in real-time.*\n\n*Palantir\u2019s Approach:*\n\nPalantir believes that every large institution in the world has a problem in their approach to mass data analysis, and Palantir believes that their platforms are best suited to help companies address this problem and make the most out of their data.\n\nPalantir recognises that other companies sell features, tools, applications, and/or dashboards, however these products are not built to maintain optimal performance in the long run (if at all). Palantir prides themselves on having the best all around software/platform to have sustainable, reliable, and safe data solutions.\n\nPalantir also groups their Foundry data from all of their companies into one large system of several large \u201cfarms\u201d of data provided by each of their client companies. By doing this, Palantir is able to feed more data/information into their machine learning, AI, and algorithms so that they can continue to be more reliable and efficient. This also enables [cross-industry data pools](https://youtu.be/7zqE8J4WKOU), that can be used by their companies when they look to expand or for opportunities in other verticals.\n\n*Palantir Success Stories:*\n\n**BP:**\n\nPerhaps the most notable success story that has come from Palantir is their partnership with [$BP \u2013 British Petroleum](https://utradea.com/stocks/BP)\n\nBP and Palantir have been partners since 2014, and recently (February 2021) [BP and Palantir have extended their partnership](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/05/palantir-deepens-ties-with-bp-with-new-5-year-deal/) for 5 more years. Palantir has helped BP to transform their business into a more digital one, and this extension of their partnership will ensure a further acceleration of their strategic digitization of their business.\n\nPalantir\u2019s Foundry has already helped BP by streamlining and enhancing their hydrocarbon-based workflows. Palantir helped BP to analyze their drilling data and has helped them to [increase their oil production in the North Sea by over 10%.](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/palantir-the-tech-spooks-who-found-bin-laden-are-helping-bp-find-oil-9qddfpv2r)\n\nThis increase in production helps us to visualize just how useful Palantir\u2019s software can be. This is why their Foundry has been credited as a \u201ccompetitive advantage\u201d. Other oil producing companies most likely would not have been able to uncover the data, patterns, and relationships that were uncovered by Palantir, thus the companies that are not using Palantir may be losing out.\n\nThis type of publicity is fantastic for Palantir, as companies may see this, and contact Palantir because they too want a competitive advantage. Palantir\u2019s best chance at becoming the next \u201ctech giant\u201d comes through the commercial applications/contracts. This is because there are infinite uses for Palantir, so theoretically, they can get it in the hands of every business (which would help revenues to soar).\n\n**National Institute of Health (NIH) and Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS):**\n\nPalantir has historically been a rather controversial company through their help in government agencies like ICE. However, recently Palantir has been getting good press, which has helped their company image. Since the start of the pandemic some institutions like the NIH and NHS have signed contracts with Palantir, for Palantir\u2019s assistance with their fights against COVID-19, and their vaccine distributions. This is good for Palantir as it shows them in a good light and shows that they can help provide the world with help and safety during a crisis like COVID-19.\n\nThe NIH agreed to a [$36M contract](https://www.palantir.com/pt_media/nih-palantir-contract/) to gain a partnership with Palantir. Their (NIH\u2019s), mission is to build the largest centralized COVID-19 patient database in the world, and Palantir has helped them to do this with massive success.\n\nPalantir was able to assist the NIH in building their [N3C data platform](https://covid.cd2h.org/). This platform has come a long way since they teamed up with Palantir, and now has over 7.1B rows of data from 6.5M patients, from 57 different databases. Without the assistance of Palantir, analyzing this amount of data would have been no easy feat, however Palantir has provided the NIH with advanced analytics in the matter of minutes thank to their machine learning capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, in December of 2020, Palantir signed a [2-year $31.5M deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201223005018/en/Palantir-Continues-Vital-NHS-Work-With-31.5M-Contract) with the Brittan\u2019s NHS. This partnership requires Foundry to provide a secure, reliable, and timely platform to process data, while protecting patient privacy, to ultimately improve patient care.\n\nBoth of these partnerships highlight the need for Palantir during a crisis and having these large Government Health Institutes choosing Palantir as their first options is a great deal, and shows their confidence in Palantir\u2019s software.\n\n*Sources:*\n\n[The power of data in a pandemic - Technology in the NHS (blog.gov.uk)](https://healthtech.blog.gov.uk/2020/03/28/the-power-of-data-in-a-pandemic/)\n\n*Strengths:*\n\n**Built-in Privacy Controls:**\n\nBy having [privacy controls](https://youtu.be/7zqE8J4WKOU) in place, Palantir is able to operate in places that other data companies cannot go. This is especially true for Foundry, where companies/individuals can request cross-industry data from other Palantir clients to help them in a variety of ways. This request for external data needs to be accepted by a representative of the other company to be allowed. This helps Palantir leverage all of the data that they have on their \u201cOperating System\u201d, which essentially makes their platform a cross-company/cross-country collaborative workspace for all. As Palantir attains more clients, the more attractive/extensive their database is for potential clients. This should help Palantir to expand quickly once they get the ball rolling.\n\nPalantir truly values this privacy and has integrated data legibility, audit logs, access controls, quality checks and requirements to attain external data.\n\n**Government Grade Security:**\n\nAs we know, Palantir started out in just the defense and intelligence spaces. This required Palantir to have elite-level security from the get-go. Their software had to be secure enough to handle national secrets and transparent enough to ensure that the data could be monitored and traced. This is no easy feat, however Palantir managed to achieve this, which is why they have been renewing their contracts with several government agencies.\n\nThis is important when trying to sell their products to their commercial clients, because they need something safe and reliable to protect themselves and their data. Furthermore, Palantir currently has [IL-5 clearance](https://simplemoneylyfe.com/palantir-stock-analysis/) with the Department of Defense (DoD), which makes them 1 of 4 software companies with this level of clearance (alongside Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP). However, it has also been rumoured that Palantir may achieve IL-6 clearance, which has never been done before as it is the storage/processing of **classified information.**\n\nThis level of clearance should speak volumes to how safe and secure Palantir\u2019s technology truly is and should provide ease of mind to companies that they are in business with.\n\n**Expansion into the Commercial Sector:**\n\nPalantir currently has a huge opportunity ahead of them as they continue to increase their presence in the commercial sector, partnering with some of the largest enterprises in the world. Palantir plans to provide these businesses with the software that they need to do their jobs as efficient as possible and sees large growth potential in this industry.\n\nPalantir has said that they are focusing on building partnerships with enterprises that are willing to undergo structural changes within the organization/operations. Palantir has a huge market ahead of themselves in the commercial sector, and their stock should do well on the news breaking of new partnerships between Palantir and commercial enterprises.\n\n*Government Contracts:*\n\nDo you remember what I said earlier about what happens once Palantir gets the ball rolling? If so, you will know where I am headed with this section.\n\nBetween 2008-2018 (10 years), Palantir was able to generate $51.9M in revenue from government contracts. However, in the 2 years following this they earned $179.9M in Government contracts (this can be found under the \u201cUS Government\u201d section of their [SEC 10-K report](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1)). Once Palantir was able to get the ball rolling with these agencies, Palantir was able to both expand and renew existing contracts to earn more revenue. I believe that the same thing will happen with Palantir\u2019s commercial operations. Once they start to get a large number of big enterprises renewing their contracts for \u201cbigger bucks\u201d, I believe that Palantir will start to grow their revenues extremely quick and attract new clients \u201cleft, right, and center\u201d.\n\nThese contract renewals are so important because essentially, they mean that Palantir met and/or exceeded expectations, and these companies now believe that Palantir is vital to their business/operations, so look out for news around renewals.\n\n*Business Model:*\n\nPalantir has developed a business model that focuses on acquiring contracts and expanding their services and has 3 main phases.\n\n1. **Acquire Customers:** Palantir has expanded their sales force largely over the past couple of years, and actively purse negotiations with companies that they can provide long-term value to. To acquire these companies, Palantir gives them a short demo to see how effective and user friendly their software is, Palantir provides this service for a loss. However, they are willing to incur these (proportionately) small losses to potentially acquire large contracts with these companies. This phase runs at a loss but helps Palantir set up clients for the next phase.\n2. **Expand:** Once Palantir has a potential customer on the hook, they move them along to the expand phase. Palantir installs their software in these enterprises and teaches them the ropes, of course this requires a large investment from Palantir to incorporate it. These customers often sign a short contract with Palantir for a cheap cost (Palantir takes a loss on this phase as well), however clients are able to truly unlock Palantir\u2019s software during this phase and see what it has to offer. If they like their software, they will be moved along to the next phase (scale) which is Palantir\u2019s bread and butter.\n3. **Scale:** These clients tend to sign longer-term deals with Palantir for their software after they have got a \u201cgood feel\u201d for their software. The companies in this stage are also generally \u201chands-off\u201d meaning that they can operate the software without much help. Companies tend to find the most value in this stage, and Palantir makes the best margins on this stage. In 2020, Palantir made $613.4M in this stage with a margin of 70%\n\n*Financial information:*\n\nAll of this information can be found in their [SEC 10-K filing.](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1)\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, Palantir increased their gross profit by 47.97% and increased their gross margin to 81% (from 71%), Palantir reported their first net income (excluding stock-based compensation) ever and increase their net revenues by 47.15%.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, Palantir\u2019s loss from operations increased by 103.61%, their stock-based compensation increased by 425.15%, their General and Admin expenses increased by 108.59%, and their net loss increased by 101.22%. Their biggest problem in 2020 was their large stock-based compensation, which will be addressed later.\n\n\u00b7 **Convertible Preferred Stock:** In 2020, Palantir issued a total of 797,771,675 shares of common stock through conversion of their previous \u201cconvertible referred shares\u201d. This one factor of dilution caused an estimated dilutionary effect of Palantir\u2019s stock of 137.19%. This is a huge form of dilution, and I have never seen anything like this before, however I have an explanation for this so stay tuned for that.\n\n\u00b7 **Repurchase of Common Stock:** In 2020, Palantir repurchased 808,201 shares back. This is a measly amount compared to the amount of dilution from preferred stock, however any buyback is good to see as an investor. This buyback caused an inflationary effect on existing shares of 0.14%, which is not much, but we will still take it.\n\n\u00b7 **Stock Warrants:** In 2020, Palantir experienced an additional 7,631,329 shares on the market through the exercising of warrants. The exercising of these warrant had a dilutionary effect on Palantir\u2019s stock of 1.31%.\n\n\u00b7 **Common Stock (Net of Issuance Costs):** In 2020, Palantir unloaded 206,500,523 common shares onto the market from issuance of common stock net of issuance costs. I believe that this means that, Palantir had to fork out additional shares to cover the investment needed to take their shares public. I could very well be wrong on that, and if anyone can pitch in and explain this to me that would be great! Anyways, this caused a dilutionary effect of Palantir\u2019s common stock of roughly 35.51%. This is a large portion of dilution, however it does not even factor in other factors of dilution which is worrying.\n\n\u00b7 **Stock Options:** In 2020, Palantir added 120,617,527 common shares to their shares outstanding through the exercise of options. These options were exercised and thus converted into these common shares and had a dilutionary effect of 20.72%. Once again, this is a large amount of dilution and should be considered by investors.\n\n\u00b7 **RSU\u2019s:** In 2020, Palantir issued 82,429,575 shares through their vesting of \u201cRestricted Stock Units\u201d (RSU\u2019s). This had a dilutionary effect on their stock of 14.18% (which is a lot of dilution).\n\n\u00b7 **Modification to Stock Options:** In 2020, Palantir technically bought back 3,500,0000 shares through modifications to stock options (for the settlement of employee loans accounted for as modifications to stock options). Confusing, right? This technical buyback resulted in a share inflation of 0.6%.\n\n\u00b7 **Total Share Dilution in 2020:** In 2020, Palantir experience an overall share dilution of 208.19%. This is the most dilution I have ever seen in a stock that I have analyzed, however there are some potential answers as to why there was so much dilution in 2020.\n\n*Explanation of Share Dilution:*\n\nOnce again, all of the below information can be found in Palantir\u2019s [SEC 10-K filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1).\n\nOn September 30th, 2020, Palantir completed their Direct Listing of their Class A common shares on the public markets on the NYSE. Part of this listing involved the redemption of all of Palantir\u2019s convertible share into common shares. This was the largest single source of dilution in Palantir (137%). Additionally, this Direct Listing involved the exercise of al outstanding warrants, which resulted in dilution of 1.31%. Another part of their Direct Listing was the common stocks issued, net of issuance price to complete the direct listing, which had a dilutionary effect of 35.51%. Lastly, Palantir was forced to create new common shares that would hold the place of the unvested RSU\u2019s, which cause a dilutionary effect of 14.18%.\n\nWithout these factors of dilution, Palantir would have only experienced an overall dilution of 20%. This means that due to the Direct listing, Palantir had to increase their shares outstanding by 188.19% to meet the requirements to be eligible for the listing.\n\n*Overall Thoughts on Dilution:*\n\nPalantir is a very weird stock in terms of their dilution, and I have not seen anything quite like this before. Their overall level of dilution is unprecedented and very worrying for investors. However, we know that these levels of dilution were inflated due to the requirements of undergoing a Direct Listing. However, how does Palantir dilution (excluding the effects caused by their Direct Listing compared to their dilution in previous years?\n\nFor starters, Palantir exhibited a 20% share dilution in 2020 when eluding the dilution caused by the Direct Listing. However, historically Palantir has experienced an average share dilution of 5.18% between 2017-2019. So even excluding the effects caused through the Direct Listing, Palantir still experienced a comparably high level of share dilution. However, 20% of dilution is significantly different than the 208.19% of dilution (which would be crazily high). This 20% is relatively normal for an undervalued growth stock, such as Palantir, so currently I would not be too worried. However, investors should keep up with their financial reports and look for their dilution in 2021, because ultimately that will tell us more about Palantir\u2019s dilution after going public, than their past share dilution as a private company.\n\n*Competition:*\n\nIn order to undergo my comparable analyses (which will be discussed later on) I needed to select 4 companies, that I can compare to Palantir.\n\n[**$ZS \u2013 Zscaler Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/ZS)**:** ZScaler is a security as a service company that helps company adapt to cloud technologies and provides their cybersecurity services through the cloud. ZScaler provides their services to both commercial enterprises and governments, similar to that of Palantir. Furthermore, ZScaler offers their service primarily in the USA, but also has smaller international operations (again like Palantir).\n\n[**$SNOW \u2013 Snowflake Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/SNOW)**:** Snowflake (like Palantir) is a software and technology company that primarily focuses on data. Snowflake provides data cloud services such as data engineering, data science, data applications, data sharing, and data warehouse. This is very similar to the applications and functions available on Palantir, however Palantir offers other functions that differentiate themselves. Snowflake also provides services for both commercial enterprises and government organizations, similar to that of Palantir.\n\n[**$SPLK \u2013 Splunk Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/SPLK)**:** Splunk provide software platforms that deliver insights derived from their clients\u2019 data in the USA and internationally. Splunk offers their Ecosystem solutions that consist of data inputs, workflows, reports, dashboards, data visualizations, actions, and methods, and help their clients/customers to make the best out of their data. All of this sounds eerily familiar to the description of Palantir, making it one of the closer competitors. Splunk also offers their services to the public sector as well as the government, making their business model resemble that of Palantir so much more.\n\n[**$TYL \u2013 Tyler technologies Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/TYL)**:** Tyler technologies is probably the company in this list that least resembles that of Palantir, this is because they provide management solutions, accounting systems, billing systems and other solutions geared toward the public sector. Tyler technologies works primarily with governments of all types (Federal, State, and Municipal), and education institutions. However, the one thing that Tyler has that makes them comparable to Palantir is their data and insight solutions. Their data insights software enables collaboration, displays data visualizations/measurements, and generates insights for their human operators to act on.\n\n*Q1 2021 Updates:*\n\nAll of the below information can be found in [Palantir\u2019s Q1 Investor Presentation](https://investors.palantir.com/files/Palantir%20Q1%202021%20Business%20Update.pdf).\n\nRecently, on May 11th, 2021, Palantir released their Q1 earnings report. When looking at Palantir\u2019s financial performance I did not take this into account, which means that this section will be packed with new information that will help us to understand Palantir\u2019s trajectory even more.\n\nFirst and foremost, this quarter was the first quarter in which Palantir has reported positive earnings. This is a big milestone for Palantir as a public company, and it helps to gets investors excited about the potentially profitable future of Palantir. In Q1, Palantir reported a free cash flow of $151M (was -$290M in Q1 2020) with a 44% adjusted FCF margin, they grew revenues by 49% YoY ($341M), and they grew billings by 248% YoY ($362M) which means that Palantir is acquiring new customers and negotiating higher contracts. These financials are great and show a promising future ahead for Palantir, which should excite their investors.\n\nFurthermore, during this quarter they also disclosed their investment in a SPAC. This SPAC is [$QELL \u2013 Qell Acquisition Corp.](https://utradea.com/stocks/QELL) which merging with Lilium. Lilium is an eVTOL transportation company, with this investment they also came to a deal with Lilium to use Foundry for design, engineering, testing, production, quality, logistics, and operations. A while back I looked at another eVTOL SPAC Archer ([$ACIC \u2013 Atlas Crest Investment Corp.](https://utradea.com/stocks/ACIC)), which has great upside and has a similar business model to Lilium, so if you want to read that to be more informed about Liliums potential performance, [click here.](https://utradea.com/positions/Take_a_SHOT_at_Archers_SPAC_ACIC)\n\nIn Q1, Palantir was also awarded with a [5-year $90M contract](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210405005238/en/Palantir-Selected-by-the-National-Nuclear-Security-Administration-for-5-year-89.9M-Contract-for-SAFER-Project) from the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), in which Palantir will provide the operational platform for their SAFER (Safety Analytics, Forecasting, and Evaluation Reporting) project. This is big news as this is one of Palantir\u2019s bigger contracts, and it shows the level of confidence of the NNSA in Palantir\u2019s software and their cross-enterprise data integration capabilities. On the topic of Palantir and Government Organizations, the DoD used Palantir\u2019s software in all 11 of their Combatant Commands for globally integrated intelligence. This high level of usage from the DoD definitely means that Palantir is doing something right, and if the DoD likes it so much, then it should be more than enough for commercial enterprises.\n\nLastly, in Q1, Palantir won 15 contracts worth over $5M, and 6 contracts worth over $10M with an average duration of 3.7 years (4.6 for commercial customers). This is fantastic for the company as they gained an additional 11 new commercial customers from this, and I will be keeping up to date with these contracts and others as they come up for renewal/negotiations. Additionally, Palantir was able to grow their gross margin to 83% (from 75% Q1 2020), and their contribution margin to 60% (from 41% in Q1 2020). This shows that Palantir business partners are maturing into their 3rd phase, the scale phase, which enables Palantir to grow their margins.\n\n***$PLTR \u2013 Palantir Investment Valuation:***\n\n*Comparable Analyses:*\n\nI decided to undergo 2 different comparable analyses in order to get a variety of valuations (or opinions if you will). Preferably, I would like both of these results to be consistent in terms of their fair value estimate, however, if they are not consistent, I will take the average result. I was only able to find 2 multiples/ratios that I could actually analyze due to the nature of these businesses and their lack of positive financial ratios/multiples.\n\n*EV/Revenue:*\n\nThis is a very common multiple among companies that are not profitable in their operations yet, like Palantir and some of these other comparable companies. By comparing Palantir\u2019s EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors (listed above on the \u201ccompetitors\u201d section of this report), I found that Palantir has a fair value of $32.85/share, which implies an upside to this investment of 23.31%. This implies that given Palantir\u2019s current price, they are undervalued, and the upside is very reasonable, however, I decided to undergo the next comparable to see if this result maintains.\n\n*P/B:*\n\nBy comparing Palantir\u2019s P/B ratio to that of their competitors, I found that Palantir has a fair value of $24.87/share, which implies that there is a downside risk of 6.64% to such an investment. As you have probably noticed, these results are not consistent, therefore I have decided to take the average result to get one, final price target.\n\n*Average Comparable:*\n\nBy taking the average result from the 2 comparable analyses underwent, I found that Palantir has a fair value of $28.86/share, which implies an overall upside of 8.36% to this investment. This also implies that Palantir, is in fact an undervalued growth stock, that has the potential to be one of the best undervalued stocks on the market.\n\n***My Plan for Investing into Palantir:***\n\nMy plan for this investment is a little different from usual.\n\nI see anything between $24.87/share (Fair Value of P/B ratio) and $28.86/share (average comparable) as a good chance to buy Palantir at (or below) its fair value. This helps to limit our downside risk of this investment.\n\nHowever, I think the best way to play an investment in Palantir is over the long-run 3+ years. I would attempt to buy in at the above prices and hold for these 3+ years. During this time, I would re-evaluate my investment with every new financial report and piece of news to decide if it is still worth holding.\n\n***Potential Risks to Palantir\u2019s Stock - $PLTR:***\n\n\u00b7 **Dilution:** Over the past year Palantir has experienced a lot of dilution, however, we have already attributed a great deal of this dilution to their Direct Listing. However, the 20% of dilution that was not derived from the direct listing is still quite high. As investors, we should keep an eye on their future levels of dilution to recognize any patterns/increases that we should be weary of. If these levels of dilution persist, potential investors may be scares off and current investor might sell their positions, which will hurt the share price.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance:** This year\u2019s financial performance was not one to be overly happy about. Although they were able to increase some pretty important aspects of their balance sheet, Palantir was still yet to make a profit, and increased their net losses by over 100%. If this poor financial performance continues, and they keep digging themselves into a bigger and bigger hole, investors will run away from this stock and never look back. However, the Q1 financial performance gives investors hope for a more profitable future, which will be discussed later.\n\n\u00b7 **Bad Press:** Historically, Palantir has not been looked at through a positive lens by many people investors and non-investors alike. Their first public backlash came through their involvement in deporting immigrants through [Palantir\u2019s partnership with ICE](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54348456). Palantir quicky spoke out against this backlash by saying ICE took advantage of their software without proper oversight, and that they are looking into the issues, furthermore they have since declined some potential partnerships with other border agencies to avoid further backlash. There have also been numerous smaller controversies and protests that have damaged Palantir\u2019s reputation, and if there are more large controversies Palantir\u2019s stock could get hurt as a result of it.\n\n***Potential Catalysts that can Help Palantir\u2019s Stock Price:***\n\n\u00b7 **Share Buybacks:** Over the past year, Palantir has bought back (both directly and indirectly, in a sense) over 4,300,000 of their common shares. This is good to see as an investor, especially this early in the company (and not too long after their Direct Listing). This gives me hope that Palantir will continue to repurchase more shares in the future. This will be good for the share price as it will increase the value of existing shares, and it will be especially good for the stock price if they continue to buyback more shares each year.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance:** Palantir\u2019s 2020 financial report was not favourable (as discussed previously), however there were definitely some good to take out of it. Palantir increased their revenue, gross profit, and margins by a hefty amount, which is good to see as an investor, however, there was bad aspects of this report as well that made the report unfavourable. However, their newly released Q1 2021 financial report has so much more to offer in terms of good aspects of a financial report.\n\n\u00b7 **Positive Press:** As previously mentioned, Palantir has had their fair share of bad press that has had a small effect on their share price. However, recently Palantir has been getting better press through helping organizations like the NIH and NHS in their fight against COVID-19, and their vaccine distribution efforts. Partnerships like this help to display the positive impacts that can be derived from Palantir\u2019s technology. Future events where Palantir can use their software for a good cause can help to combat the negative stigma around Palantir and attract more people to invest in their company. This should help their share price in the short term after these articles are released.\n\n\u00b7 **Success Stories:** Since Palantir have gone public, they have had a few success stories come out, I mentioned some of these stories throughout the article. These success stories show how impactful Palantir\u2019s software can be and can show companies that they can increase revenues, production etc. just by using Palantir\u2019s software. Any future stories like this that come out, highlighting the benefits of Palantir can help the stock soar, and potential clients to reach out and start business/inquiries with Palantir.\n\n\u00b7 **Renewing Contracts:** I have mentioned that the renewal of contracts can help Palantir\u2019s share price a couple times throughout this article but why is this the case? This is because these companies that are renewing have already been through Palantir\u2019s 3 stage business model and have experienced their software firsthand for numerous years. After their time with Palantir\u2019s software expires they decide to renew the contract. This is good because it shows that Palantir\u2019s software was effective enough to their business in the time they had it that it is worth these $5-15M+ contract renewals. Furthermore, these companies that are renewing already have underwent Palantir\u2019s installation, and these clients will provide Palantir with the highest margins, which will reflect well on Palantir\u2019s future financial reports.\n\n\u00b7 **New Partnerships/Contracts (and the expansion of commercial enterprise segment):** Every time that Palantir, or its partners release news that they have entered into a contract/agreement, this will help Palantir\u2019s stock. This is because Palantir needs to keep expanding their software into new companies in order to meet their expected growth projections. Furthermore, as more commercial enterprises try Palantir\u2019s software (and hopefully enjoy it), the more willing other companies might be to give Palantir a shot. I see their biggest potential for growth and to become a large company in their expansion of their commercial enterprise segment through Foundry. Every time Palantir gets more new clients on board it is fantastic and shows the feasibility of this segment, and as more contracts role in, more enterprises will take an interest. Furthermore, when Palantir signs these enterprises to a contract, it will help to increase their revenues, which will show up on their financial reports and hopefully help the, to beat estimates.\n\n*This analysis took a long time, and is one of the most comprehensive that I have seen, so I would greatly appreciate if you followed me* [*here*](https://utradea.com/member-portfolio/BeatingTheVTI?utm_source=R&amp;utm_medium=B&amp;utm_campaign=PLTR)*, and commented on my original post!*",

        "selftext": "# The Company\n\nAvePoint went public via a merger with $APXT on Friday, the 2nd of July 2021. The company runs over 1,300 employees in 29 global offices and is one of the largest Strategic Cloud Partners of **Microsoft**. It\u00b4s all about migrating businesses to the cloud under the aspects of cyber security, compliance and so on. AvePoint had been the global **Microsoft partner of the year** 5 times and runs over 7 Million cloud users already as of today.

Ok, ok. $194 Million - you say *'thats not a lot!'* \\- take 35% Growth rate for the next 6 years: You'll end up with over $1 Billion in revenue by 2027 - SaaS will grow potentially, as we all know, so I don't think we will only have 35% growth.

I am convinced that this is not just another SPAC and that numbers are clearly speaking for its business. Having a partner like Microsoft and growing with over 30% into a cloud-based business is almost a no-brainer for me. Time will tell.

        "selftext": "So I read this article by Angela Harmantas from Proactive Investors today and it made me question things. Here\u2019s a quote: \n\n&gt;**It has been said that the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated the remote economy, but is that really true?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Before the pandemic hit in 2020, around 5% of Americans worked out of the home, but by the spring of that year\u00a0that number had **skyrocketed to 60%.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Kalish estimates that the remote economy is a \u201c**multi-trillion-dollar global marketplace**\u201d that has room for multiple players, many of which are just starting out. \u201cIt may seem like this is a mature economy, but I believe we\u2019re on the ground floor of opportunities in this tech space.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cAdopting any kind of flexibility to function in a remote world is going to be the new normal,\u201d Kalish said. **\u201cYou can be a doctor without an office, or a professor without a lecture room.\u201d**\n\nThe article you can see here [Xigem Technologies sees multiple opportunities to help companies make the shift to the remote economy](https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/954785/xigem-technologies-sees-multiple-opportunities-to-help-companies-make-the-shift-to-the-remote-economy-954785.html)\n\nThe first question, I can\u2019t find a direct definition for the \"remote economy\". I'm somewhat new to it, I know gig economy, sharing economy, but not remote economy. **What is it?** \n\nI get the general idea, but my best description is \u201cyou know, all this sh#t that started in 2019\u201d. I know that it will most likely bring me gains, i FEEL what it is, but I don\u2019t want to invest in \u201call this sh#t\u201d. it would be hard to explain lol. Some better words are needed. \n\nThey don't give the definition, mention the options: \n\n**$XIGM Xigem** \\- the subject of the article, so hard to be unbiased here for them, I guess. I already bought 700 shares a week ago in case of a shot anyway, revenue is promised in Q3, but so far it\u2019s a high risk - high win. And most importantly - it\u2019s just one stock;  \n\n**$CRM SalesForce** \\- it\u2019s growing, it looks promising, I like it, but it costs damn $246,3 per share. It\u2019s not a penny; \n\n**$ORCL Oracle** \\- 44% in the last 6 months, real \u00abremote economy\u00bb stock, but not a penny, it\u2019s $87,5 for share. \n\nI\u2019m a good-ol\u2019 rebel, so I tried to come up with **other ideas**. My best guesses, NOTE - before the DD on each of them: \n\n**$XELA - Exela tech**, business solutions, transactions management, and all that stuff. The stock that actually made me do the 2+2 with Xigem article, because it shot 48% up today, and it\u2019s 236% up in the last 6 months. No idea why and I wish I noticed it before. Guess I\u2019m late here. \n\n**$PIXY - ShiftPixy**, looks good and fits in the article, especially in the \u00abprofessor without a classroom\u00bb part, just for anyone. Basically a remote gig economy stock. Cheapie as well: $2,14 for share. Falling, but don\u2019t know yet whether any catalysts will be in the nearest future. \n\nI\u2019ve had a good, professional and in-depth discussion with my imaginary friends this whole morning, and now I invite you to join. **The main question:** \n\nWhat exactly is Remote Economy and what companies should shoot up on this train? Any other companies position themselves as providers for this this multi-trillion-dollar thing like Xigem, or they\u2019re the first ones in it? Given that the whole remote thing is not going anywhere, how to make money on it? \n\nBonus question for those in $XELA or $PIXY - am I late?",

        "selftext": "Palantir is an American software company that specializes in big data analytics, with a market cap of 43 billion. They started building software for the intelligence community in the US to assist in counterterrorism investigations by helping them identify patterns hidden deep within large data sets. Later, they realized that similarly to the intelligence community, commercial institutions did not have the most effective tools to manage and make sense of the data involved in large projects. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2sunzi3x1tc71.png?width=1236&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68fa49140d7b85732881dce430169202ab36885e\n\nAny large scale company or business will always collect a ton of data most often stored in texts such as spreadsheets or databases (which requires programming knowledge to navigate through). A common issue large companies have is simply having too much data. Palantir creates software that consolidates a company's data and displays it in a comprehensible, easily digestible user interface for the company to use. This allows Palantir to work with companies/organizations like the CDC for medicine, the military for national security, etc. \n\nWith Palantir, a normal non-technical operator can click their computer to pull up an order, or an issue that Palanrie detected, make any changes and or notify whoever needs the attention. Let's take the CDC for example. When the vaccine rolled out, Palantir had a huge hand in this. Palantir gives a visual display of where the vaccine is going, how many, and any issues that have risen (if any), allowing for fast response time. For example, Palantir could display a map with the various routes to different deployment sites with pictures of a little truck representing the shipments being routed to their destination. An operator could click one of these shipments/routes and pull up any data of that specific point. With data being displayed and organized in this way it makes it easy to analyze data, where things are going, and what kind of picture the data represents, rather than staring at a spreadsheet of numbers. This is just one example, Palantir is customizable enough where it can represent any business/organization's structure.\n\nPalantir\u2019s revenue streams consist of their two main software: [Gotham](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/), which was designed primarily for the defence and intelligence sector, and [Foundry](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/) for the commercial sector. However, the platforms are not exclusive to either sector. For example, Gotham is also offered to commercial customers in the financial services industry. The two platforms can either be used separately or bundled together as a single ecosystem. Currently, revenue is more or less evenly split between the government and commercial sectors. \n\nGotham\u2019s main tools include:\n\nGaia \u2013 lets users plan, execute, and report on operations via a shared live map. Live maps track real-time data and users drag and drop objects from other Gotham applications directly into Gaia.\n\nDossier \u2013 is a live collaboration document editor to share analysis and discover intelligence. Users can collaborate across teams and organizations to create a living, interactive, and up-to-date document.\n\nVideo \u2013 an application designed to interact with both streaming and historical video data. Users can review video footage in the platform as well as enhance raw footage with geospatial information and overlays based on other data sources.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w2ck45zx1tc71.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e562521338e3b912c19a1a47e17e4013ad9b5e61\n\nFoundry\u2019s main tools include:\n\nContour \u2013 enables exploration of large-scale data. Users can filter, join, and visualize datasets to answer analytical questions and publish the results as a report or new dataset that will automatically update with the underlying datasets.\n\nObject Explorer \u2013 allows users to interact with data represented as objects \u2013 like customers, equipment, or plants \u2013 rather than rows in a table.\n\nAs we know, Palantir started in the defence and intelligence space. This required Palantir to have elite-level security from the start. Their software had to be secure enough to handle national secrets and transparent enough to ensure that the data could be monitored and traced. This was no easy feat, however, Palantir managed to achieve this, which is why they have been renewing their contracts with several government agencies.\n\nThis is important when trying to sell their products to their commercial clients because they need something safe and reliable to protect themselves and their data. Furthermore, Palantir currently has IL-5 clearance with the Department of Defense, which makes them 1 of 4 software companies with this level of clearance, alongside Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP (Google and Snowflake have IL-2 clearance). It has also been rumoured that Palantir may achieve IL-6 clearance, which has never been done before as it is the storage/processing of classified information.\n\nThis level of clearance should speak volumes to how safe and secure Palantir\u2019s technology is and should provide ease of mind to companies that they are in business with.",

        "selftext": "Payoneer is a payment platform that offers a way for businesses to pay and receive money, for a low fee. Payoneer believes that the total addressable market (defined as global e-commerce volume) is $26 trillion a year. Payoneer processed over $44 billion in 2020 alone.\n\nPayoneer works with 9 of the top 20 most valuable companies. Alongside these big names, Payoneer also has 5 million+ marketplaces and businesses, across over 190 countries.\n\nPayoneer also offers:\n\n* Accounting integrations\n* Capital to small businesses\n* Regulatory and compliance infrastructure\n* Physical debit cards\n* Tax solutions\n\nSo, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business\u2019 needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins and no doubt they will be offering that soon, if anything they should make that a major priority.\n\n**Management Team**\n\nScott Galit - CEO of Payoneer, previously a senior VP at MasterCard. Serious financial services pedigree.\n\nMichael G Levine - CFO of Payoneer, ex-City VP and ex-CFO of Maler Technologies. MBA from Wharton.\n\nBetsy Cohen - Tons of finance related experience, including founding Bancorp. Should be able to give Payoneer great advice for future growth.\n\n**Customers**\n\nPayoneer has some big name clients, including but not limited to:\n\n* Amazon Europe\n* Google\n* eBay\n* Walmart\n* Upwork\n* Fiverr\n* AirBnB\n* Booking.com\n\nWeird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too. This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypal\u2019s or banks are NOT willing to take the risk. Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access.\n\n**Switching Costs**\n\nIntegrating, setting up, and teaching staff how to use a new payment platform can be time-consuming and expensive for businesses. Therefore, when a client is set up on Payoneer, it is unlikely that they will switch to another provider. This is best seen by the &gt;100% volume retention that Payoneer has (i.e. customers stay and increase their payment volume).\n\n**Brand**\n\nPayoneer, from what I have seen, has a strong brand (though this is obviously a subjective factor). This idea is reinforced by the presence of their big name clients. Branding is really important in FinTech, businesses need 100% confidence when money and payments are involved. This offers not only stops entrants into their market, but should also facilitate future growth and customer acquisition.\n\n**Network Effect**\n\nImagine company A is on Payoneer and wants to pay company B. Company A suggests payment through their usual payment processor, Payoneer. Company B now signs up to Payoneer and decides to do all their payments through it etc. This is the network effect that Payoneer enjoys. This is a very powerful barrier to entry - very difficult to overcome, while also hard to create yourself.\n\n**Geographies**\n\nUNSUBSTANTIATED: Conversations on Reddit leads me to believe that Payoneer has a strong presence in Asia. If anyone has evidence, please put it in the comments.\n\nIf this is true, it should give Payoneer an edge in capitalising on the future growth of the emerging markets.\n\nSome evidence:\n\n* The CEO has gone on record saying Korea is one of their big market focuses.\n* Achieved triple digit growth each year in the asian markets from 2012-2016.\n\n# Valuation and Financials\n\n# Enterprise Value: $3.29 billion\n\n# Projected 2021 revenue: $432 million\n\n# EV/2021 revenue multiple: 7.6x\n\n# 2019-2020 revenue growth: 8.8%\n\n**Institutional Ownership**\n\nPayoneer has some institutional giants already invested, including Wellington Management, Dragoneer Investment Group, Fidelity Management and Research, Temasek, and Franklin Templeton.\n\n**What do I think the future holds for Payoneer? I actually think there are several exits for this company.**\n\n1. **Growth**: The company continues to grow and eventually reach billions of revenue within 5 to 10  years.\n2. **Consolidation**: Large international payments processer buys them. Could be Paypal, Square,      Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I  think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company. Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed. Before you had 100,000 banks then it was 50,000 banks, then 10,000 banks, and now like 5,000 banks but the top 10 banks make up a large % of the business/volume.\n3. **Wildcard**: CRM business buys them. What many people do not realize is that CRM\u2019s have been changing the game. First, it was to help you sell with marketing tools, then it is to improve communication within the team, then it will be stored, and legal transactions then it will be a financial transaction.      They are literally going to control the beginning to the end of the customer relationship and all of that data they possess is very valuable to help their customers grow.\n\nPersonal Note\n\n**Price Target**\n\nBull Case: $26\n\nMain Case: $21\n\nBear Case: $16\n\nHow did I get these numbers? Just educated guesses.\n\nDisclosure I am long on the company  (LEAP's and Shares)",

        "selftext": "# The Company\n\nAvePoint went public via a merger with $APXT on Friday, the 2nd of July 2021. The company runs over 1,300 employees in 29 global offices and is one of the largest Strategic Cloud Partners of **Microsoft**. **Folks, get ready for a new SaaS company that will pull your trousers up, up and above**. It\u00b4s all about migrating businesses to the cloud under the aspects of cyber security, compliance and so on. AvePoint had been the global **Microsoft partner of the year** 5 times already and runs over 7 Million cloud users already as of today. It aims to add 40,000 managed service provider partners by 2022.\n\nJust a short extract from their customer list:\n\n*Porsche \u2013 NBC \u2013 Verizon \u2013 Rolex \u2013 Fiat \u2013 Roche \u2013 Siemens \u2013 Symantec \u2013 Disney  -  NHS \u2013 iTV \u2013 Sainsburry \u2013 really a lot more, but I am lazy.*\n\n**Huge Growth Potential**\n\nExpected revenue of $194 Million in 2021 growing with a high rate of &gt;30% YOY and an EBIT Margin of 14% in 2020. Ok, ok. $194 Million - you say *'thats not a lot!'* \\- take 35% Growth rate for the next 6 years: You'll end up with over $1 Billion in revenue by 2027 - SaaS will grow potentially, as we all know, so I don't think we will only have 35% growth. This company is growing and it won't stop - thats for sure. To show you how much I think this is undervalued I created a comparison between AvePoint, Okta and Salesforce. Lets get this in depth:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$AVPT vs $OKTA vs $CRM](https://preview.redd.it/msir6zet2v971.png?width=2068&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7da6e311a97fa6761f96ce9f6262952d26cc9874)\n\n# AvePoint Announces $20.0 million APXT Share Purchase Program\n\n$AVPT is down almost 50% from its ATH of 16.55 in January. The SPAC sell-off made it more than difficult and even managements announcement to purchase over **$20 Million** didn\u2019t help to keep it uptrend. I am convinced that this is not just another SPAC and that numbers are clearly speaking for its business. Having a partner like Microsoft and growing with over 30% into a cloud-based business is almost a no-brainer for me. Time will tell. Compare it with OKTA in 2017, going public at a $6 Billion valuation, which is not so much far away from AvePoint today. \n\n**It\u00b4s not that Eppstein, youre thinking of**\n\nJeff Eppstein - yes, you read it correctly - but its not THAT Jeff Eppstein you're thinking of. **This** Jeff brought already companies like booking $BKNG from a $1 Billion valuation up to $80 Billion on the NASDAQ. But also the NYSE knows Jeff pretty good: He brought $TWLO in 2017 from $4 Billion to $48 Billion. Folks, get in or stay out - buckle up: this is going to be HOT HOT HOT, isn't it?\n\nDisclaimer \n\nThe contents on this site are for informational and entertainment purposes only and does not constitute financial, accounting, or legal advice.

        "selftext": " **Overview**\n\nWhat is exactly is Global-E? They are a company that integrates with e-commerce platforms to remove complexity with international transactions and provide localized solutions that improve the online shopping experience. The core of the services revolve around the following (from the S-1):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201cThe vast capabilities of our end-to-end platform include interaction with shoppers in their native languages, market-adjusted pricing, payment options tailored to local market preferences, compliance with local consumer regulations and requirements such as customs duties and taxes, shipping services, after-sales support and returns management. These elements are unified under the Global-e platform to enhance the shopper experience and enable merchants to capture the cross-border opportunity.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey are the \u201cplug and play\u201d of making e-commerce international. Their vast network of APIs allow a customer to simply integrate their platform and seamlessly begin selling across different borders and languages. Here\u2019s what they do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrently, Global-E supports:\n\n* Local messaging in over 25 languages\n* Purchases in over 100 currencies\n* Accepts over 150 payment methods\n* A multitude of competitively-priced shipping options\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Business Model**\n\nGlobal-E generates revenues by charging a fee (\u201cservice fee\u201d) for the integration of their platform into a merchant\u2019s services. Service fees are highly variable based on transaction volume, destination markets, level of customer service provided, etc, and are generated as a percentage of the Gross Merchandise Value (\u201cGMV\u201d) that flows through the platform. Global-E mandatorily bundles certain components of their integrated platform solutions that they believe are essential for achieving improved sales conversions from international traffic. However, their fulfillment services are offered on an optional basis and merchants can choose to utilize those services or cancel at any time. Think of it as bundling service A and B to have the greatest effect, while offering service C as an add-on component. Service fees make up for approximately 35% of revenue while fulfillment services are currently accounting for roughly 65%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Partnerships &amp; why they use Global-E**\n\nGlobal-E has formed many key technological as well as service partnerships. These third-party e-commerce platforms include: Salesforce Commerce Cloud, Shopify, BigCommerce, Magento Commerce, SAP, WooCommerce, PrestaShop, and others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What they do for merchants?*\n\nSome of the key benefits they provide for merchants are:\n\n* increased sales conversions: converting international traffic\n* offloading complexities: handling local pricing, payment collection, import duties, fraud, etc \n* reduction of risk: reduce legal complexity, manage import duties and taxes, handle compliance\n* enabling growth to new markets: allowing merchants flexibility to expand to cross-border opportunities\n\nAll while emphasizing merchant branding. The customer always faces the digital store-front and never leaves the brand page to check-out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What they do for shoppers?*\n\nGlobal-E\u2019s goal is to offer a frictionless shopping journey, regardless of the origin of the customer. This means:\n\n* Localized languages\n* Re-pricing in local currencies\n* Handling cross-border payments\n* Accurately pre-price import duties and taxes and include them in the final cost of the product\n* Delivery: using an extensive network of over 20 shipping carriers they are able to offer multiple shipping modes at attractive rates.\n* After-sale support and returns\n\nMerchants integrating Global-E into their platform generally experience a significantly higher international traffic conversion rate (often exceeding 60%). The Global-E platform removes many complexities involved with international expansion. They already have more than 400 merchants, from small companies to globally-recognized retailers, on the platform across various diversified verticals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Shopify Deal**\n\nAs mentioned above, one of Global-E most lucrative partners lies with Shopify making them the exclusive third-party and cross-border solution across the large network of Shopify merchants. Shopify knows what kind of business that will bring for Global-E and thus Shopify has bought 7.75 million shares and acquired a **6.5% stake** in the company. As Shopify grows Global-E grows and Shopify knows this, hence the stake in a company that reflects their own revenues by proxy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TAM, &amp; CAGR**\n\nFirst came the transition to domestic e-commerce as well as sourcing and reselling products from China (aka Dropshipping). Next is going to be the transition of global e-commerce and cross-border sales. According to this 225 page **research by GlobeNewsWire**, the global cross-border B2C e-commerce market was 780 billion in 2019 and expected to grow at a CAGR of 27% through 2026 where it will become a 4.82 trillion market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Global-E\u2019s Smart Insights**\n\nOne of the company\u2019s strengths lies within sophisticated \u201cSmart Insights\u201d they use to scale their applications. Smart Insights is a \u201cbig data\u201d network that uses various metrics such as country, price-point, and shopper behaviors allowing Global-E to provide highly-optimized experience for shoppers. This ends up driving increased conversion rates and revenues for the merchant and a better overall experience for the shopper. The company has noted by integrating big-data into their platform they can experience \u201ceconomies of scale\u201d as well as \u201ceconomies of skill\u201d enabling them to optimize merchants\u2019 cross-border sales. These insights are continuously expanding as they collect additional data points along the purchasing journey.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Competitive Advantage &amp; Growth Opportunities**\n\nWhat seems to be becoming more of a trend since 2020 and even more so now in 2021 are corporation\u2019s use of big data. I\u2019m not talking about basic user data such as age, gender, location, but more on the lines of vastly large information networks. These networks can utilize things such as time spent on page, scrolls, and clicks all in one massive database. Global-E differentiates themselves through their main data asset (\u201cSmart Insights\u201d) that informs them on certain decisions and is able to optimize how merchants sell their product across different borders. They integrate this data network into a flywheel effect, for example: their current analytics drives more sales to merchants, which then feeds new data back into the system, which then allows for higher optimization and better conversions. They feed into each other back and forth getting smarter with each website visitor and purchase. This aligns perfectly for their products \u201cNet Dollar Retention Rate\u201d of 134% and 172% in 2019 and 2020, respectively.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGlobal-E attributes much of their growth to being a first mover (and doing it right) in the cross-border e-commerce space. Their success has been accelerated by several key factors, such as:\n\n* Accelerated shift towards e-commerce outpacing traditional retail\n* Cross-border e-commerce growing faster than domestic e-commerce\n* Their merchant\u2019s strategic focus on D2C sales, maintaining relationship with shoppers globally\n* The complexity and limitations of leaving the merchant responsible for implementing what Global-E offers. This doesn\u2019t come down to just a cost, but also time-intensive as well as being difficult to maintain and scale\n* Covid-19 tailwinds\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a result of the above and other market factors, the cross-borders e-commerce market is expected to continue the surge in growth. I previously mentioned the forecast in TAM however, Forrester, a research company, also expects the cross-border e-commerce markets to reach $736 billion by 2023.\n\nGlobal-E has several opportunities to expand on existing channels and capture new markets. This can be done with:\n\n* Growth through existing portfolio of merchants and strengthening relationships\n* Acquiring new merchants in existing geographies\n* Expanding in new geographies that they don\u2019t have exposure to\n* Continue to expand and innovate their platform\n* Continue to develop strategic partnerships (with key brands and players)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Risks**\n\nMany of Global-E\u2019s risks fall under the category of general business risks. Some of these include: retaining old merchants and attracting new ones, failing to enhance the platform as well as successfully competing against new and existing competition, failing to manage growth, pricing pressures from competition, and being highly dependent on cross-border regulations, sales, and operations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Revenues, Scale, &amp; Profitability**\n\nIn FY 2020 Global-E helped process 4.6 million orders for their merchants generating $136.4 million. Their Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) also grew to 774 million for the same period. Other impressive metrics were their net dollar retention rate and gross profit as % of revenue both of which continue to climb at 172% and 31.9%, respectively. Stellar!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough the company has recently turned a profit while growing top-line revenue and GMV at a high pace. The company suggested that short-term profitability might be sacrificed due to the expansions they are making to cover larger markets. As noted from the S-1:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201cWe expect our operating expenses to significantly increase over the next several years as we hire additional personnel, expand into new geographies, expand our partnerships, operations, and infrastructure, continue to enhance our platform, develop and expand its features, integrations and capabilities, expand and improve our service offering and increase our spending on sales and marketing. We intend to continue to build and enhance our platform through internal research and development and we may also selectively pursue acquisitions.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick peak at their consolidated statement of operations. Note the revenue growth and total operating expenses that *decreas*e, as a percentage of total revenue, as revenues increase (almost doubles YoY).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation**\n\nLooking at GLBE\u2019s valuation it is clear that you pay a premium when owning this company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The Good*\n\nGLBE is growing revenue at 134% YoY.\n\nGross margins are improving while the company continues to scale.\n\nMany tech and services partnerships they can piggy back on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The Bad*\n\nConsistent profitability could be years away as the company is investing heavily into their own expansion of current and new markets.\n\nGLBE is currently trading at roughly 50x price to sales and 260 forward P/E.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Up for Debate*\n\nGlobal-E has almost no long-term debt, but current liabilities are stacking up while the company is not generating much FCF. I wouldn\u2019t expect them to be generating this much FCF this early in the game after their IPO.\n\nLock-up expiration on August 11, 2021.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nIn my opinion Global-E is top of the class when it comes to their business. They are growing extremely fast while improving margins and this is the premium you would pay versus investing in a \u201cstable\u201d company generating tons of FCF, but not much growth. Due to the nature of being a high-growth stock there will naturally be more volatility around the trade. While it\u2019s currently trading at 50x price/sales I am more likely to shy away from entering a new position. We could see this stock swing to 40x p/s and potentially enter on the dips.\n\nThis is somewhat of a chicken or the egg situation because there might not be any dips to buy with this kind of growth. For example, at current growth rates (100-135% YoY) if stock price is maintained it would only be trading at less than half it\u2019s price/sales valuation only one year from now. This is definitely a stock to monitor closely if you are wanting to find the right entry point for a long-term hold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;**\n\n1. Global-E is an \u201cenabler\u201d that allows e-commerce and digital stores to seamlessly integrate international transactions. They deal with tasks from translations, currency re-pricing, international shipping &amp; returns, compliance &amp; tax regulations, etc.\n2. GLBE integrates their proprietary \u201cSmart Insights\u201d application that analyses customer shopping and transaction data to continuously improve on sales conversions. The feedback loop is always learning as it collects more and more data along each customer\u2019s purchase journey.\n3. GLBE is trading at a rich valuation given their total revenue was $136 million in 2020. However, they are growing top-line revenues and Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) over 130% Y.o.Y. Shopify holds a 6.5% stake in Global-E as GLBE facilitates a large amount of transactions on the Shopify network. As Shopify grows, GLBE grows.\n4. GLBE is growing through many tailwinds such as those from covid lockdowns and accelerated shift toward e-commerce outpacing traditional retail. They\u2019ve got an opportunity to expand into more international regions, strengthen relationships with existing merchants, while continuing to expand and improve their platform.",

        "selftext": " Company Summary\n\nOmnicom is an advertising agency that specializes in advertising, marketing and business communications services.  In a world of increasingly fragmented information streams (Different social media platforms, more and more places to list ads ...), OMC may find difficulty in growing their business and competing with large content providers for diversified revenue.  Since they are solely an advertising agency, they are not a direct competitor with facebook / twitter, but they will have to, and have been changing their approach to how they carry out their operations.  OMC can act as a middleman in advertising.  A business looking to carry out an advertising campaign would go to OMC and OMC would spread marketing content across many content providers.  \n\nTheir operations can be generalized into three categories: Advertising, Public relations, healthcare, and CRM stuff.  Here is the list of the distinct different services that they offer:\n\nadvertising, investor relations, branding, graphic arts/digital imaging, \n\nmarketing research, content marketing, media planning and buying,\n\ncorporate social responsibility consulting, merchandising and point of sale,\n\ncrisis communications, mobile marketing, custom publishing , non-profit marketing,\n\nmulti-cultural marketing, data analytics, database management, organizational communications,  \n\npackage design, digital transformation, product placement, digital/direct marketing ,\n\nentertainment marketing, promotional marketing, experiential marketing,  \n\npublic affairs, field marketing, public relations, sales support,\n\nfinancial/corporate business-to-business advertising, retail marketing,\n\nhealthcare marketing and communications, search engine marketing, instore design,  \n\nshopper marketing, interactive marketing, social media marketing, sports and event marketing\n\nManagement overview:\n\nFrom glassdoor, 95% of employees approve of the CEO.  Most reviews say that management encourages discussion and recommendations, but there are a few bad reviews related to the personal relationships between management and employees.  The CEO seems average. CFO and CEO do not have much info about them online.  The CIO seems like he knows what he\u2019s doing, and has a lot of experience.  \n\n## Company history\n\nOMC was created from a three way merger in 1986.  The current CEO has been in his position since 1999.  The three way merger involved BBDO, DDB, and NHW.  BBDO was rated the world's most creative agency, DDB was one of the largest advertising networks in the world, and TBWA was ranked in the top ten agencies that utilize disruption to develop business changing ideas.  These companies all exist under OMC as subsidies where OMC acts as the holding company.  The three subsidies act independently of each other.\n\nBBDO was formed in 1919 in NYC.  Bruice Barton (the BB) was a philosopher and eventually a congressman and then almost a senator.  He has admitted that he was not a good match for the advertising industry.  Roy Durstine (the D) was more involved in the actual business.  He eventually became a workaholic, lost his wife, became an alcoholic and got fired in 1939.  Alex Osbor (the O) is a mystery.  BBDOs business then started to boom and they picked up some large clients in the early 40s.  There was a lot of turmoil in the company in the 50s and 60s as the old guys were replaced, and new clients were slowly being acquired as old ones were lost or went out of business.  They became very involved in advertising for the republicans during this time.  They did not do well in the 70s during the recession, which should not be forgotten today, but they managed to get by much better than other companies.    In 1976, a CEO started an 8 year tenure and managed to keep the company stable by employing special cost management measures so as not to waste the spoils of growth.  At the time of the merger, BBDO was the only of the three that was not experiencing financial difficulties.  BBDO agreed to the merger because the other companies had consistent international growth, which was apparently lacking in BBDO.\n\nDDB was formed in 1949 by three men all of whom had previous industry experience.  They had tremendous success early on, focusing on hiring the most creative people they could find and taking the road not traveled.  At the time, Polaroid was an unknown company.  They were one of the first four to be clients of DDB In the 60s they did work for Avis rentals and Volkswagen.  At the time, nobody wanted Volkswagens in America.  DDB was instrumental in changing this with their campaigns for the VW beetle, making the vehicle a major success in America. Following this success they won over many major clients such as Heinz, American Airlines, Mobil oil, and Gillette to name a few.  In 1982, William Bernbach (the B) died.  This caused earnings to plummet, and financial difficulty closely followed.  By 1986, they had lost some of their most important clients, including polaroid, which was probably their biggest success.  The merger was a no-brainer for them with the resources of BBDO.\n\nTBWA started in 1924.  They had a strong presence in the middle east.  They provided a lot of services to smaller companies that otherwise felt neglected by larger advertising agencies.  I cannot find anything interesting about them between 1924 and 1970.  In the 70s, they found it difficult to find investment interest, so they decided to become private.  They had by now acquired many blue chip clients such as xerox, mcdonalds, honda, and sears on top of their many smaller clients.  They lost mcdonalds and xerox leading up to the 198 6 merger, and there were some conflicts in the merger such as campbells soup threatening to leave TBWA because Heinz would be a client of the parent OMC after the merger.  \n\nProfits for OMC after the merger were low.  In the 90s, OMC grew revenues, and at the end of the decade, a new CEO was put in place and the company had begun to diversify into digital marketing.  In 1997, they were fortune's most respected advertising group.  In 1997, they won back McDonalds.  All throughout this period, they have been acquiring companies worldwide.  \n\nIn the 2000s, OMC lost its position as the world's largest advertiser to WPP.  OMC bought 19 companies in 2000. OMC was hurt by 9/11, but managed to rebuild with the rest of the country.  OMC aggressively pursued goals in hollywood.  When the Enron scandal happened, 7 of OMCs board members were ousted and OMC decided to commit to better corporate governance. By 2002, OMC was in good shape while rivals were restructuring and laying off employees.  \n\nGrowth afterwards was much more predictable.  OMC took on many blue chip companies as clients, and saw great client retention for the next two decades.   \n\n## Revenue Breakdown / Company segments\n\nTheir 100 largest clients represent 54% of revenue, and their largest client represents 3.4%.  They lost 11.7% of revenue in the past year, but given that the events last year are not typical, this is not expected to be a long term trend.\n\nTotal revenue is 13.171 billion.\n\n1. The Americas accounted for 8.752B of this.  North America had 7.577B and latin America had 0.275 B.\n2. Europe, Middle East, And Asia Accounted for 5.317 Billion.  Europe had 3.607B, Middle East/Africa had 0.207B, and Asia had 1.503B\n\nBecause this is an American company, the implications make sense.  Revenue is most concentrated in places that the company understands - westernized countries, leaving a lot of room for growth in emerging markets.  This growth may not be desired by the company due to the instability and tendency to default on debts in emerging countries.  \n\nRevenue streams:\n\nAdvertising: 7.369 B (56%)\n\nCRM: 3.308 B (25.1%)\n\nPR: 1.301 B ( 9.9%)\n\nHealthcare: 1.191 B (9.0%)\n\n## Industry position\n\nThey are the largest public advertising company, which brings pros and cons for any industry.  They will be missing out on a lot of revenue because they will be focusing on larger clients, while letting a lot of smaller ones slip by.  At the same time, they will get the largest contracts in the industry, and as a result they have been able to sustain the highest margins in the industry.\n\nTheir payout ratio (57%) is much higher than other dividend paying advertising agencies.  This has dual implications.  They are not retaining as much earnings, and they are not spending as much on internal investments.  It also means that they have reached a point where growth is organic and the company has a stable capital structure so they can and do pay out earnings that are not needed.\n\n## Company base statistics\n\nMarket Cap: 17.42B\n\nTotal Debt: 5.81B\n\nCash &amp; Liquid assets: 5.6B\n\nEnterprise Value:  20.01B\n\nEquity: 3.084B\n\nShares Outstanding: 217M\n\nEV/Sales: 1.517x\n\nEarnings: 0.975B\n\nROE: 34.4%\n\nEmployees: 64100, 20800 in the US, 27100 in north america, 25800 in europe and 11200 in asia\n\n## Overview/Growth and Developments\n\nGrowth: \n\n* There has been slow revenue growth over the last 15 years.  Recently it has decreased from what it was in 2014-2018.  Based on past data, it is likely to stay stable, and in the long term slowly grow.\n* Earnings have been positive for every quarter 15 years straight.  Growth is better than revenue with the last year being much lower than proceeding years.  This is expected for a large company, where they are slowly finding ways to increase profitability.\n* FCF is constantly at around 10% of the market cap.  It has not been growing, but rather fluctuating around 1.5-2 billion for the past 15 years.  This implies operational stability, but stunted growth.\n\nBased on the growth indicators above, OMC is not a growth stock.  It does have the characteristics of a classic value stock.\n\nMargins:\n\n* Profit margins have been quite low, and show slow growth.  Never negative (See earnings).\n* Gross margin is at around 17%.  It has been around this since 2013.  In 2013, there was a drop from 26% to 17%.  Before 2013 GM was above 22% every year.\n* Ebitda margin follows profit margin with +3%.\n\nNet reinvestment:\n\n* OMC has very little net reinvestment.  The nature of the business does not require much, but it would be something nice to see, especially if they decide to diversify into other industries.  \n\nShare buybacks:\n\n* OMC has consistently bought back shares every year for 15 years.  This and dividends are how they maximize shareholder value.  They have consistently bought back under 15 million shares per year, averaging around 10 million per year.  This is another indicator of their status as a traditional value stock.\n* They stated that they do not plan on any repurchase in the recent future.  This is a very smart move given the economic conditions.  This shows that management is willing to temporarily stunt shareholder value in order to preserve it in the long run.  This isn't something they have to disclose, so it is meaningful that they elected to do so \n\nCost of capital:\n\n* D/E has steady growth, and is at 1.6.  This is not very concerning because the company has capital reserves that can easily cover over 90% of debt, and most debt is long term.\n* Moodys assigned a baa1 credit rating with a stable outlook.  Meaning they have adequate ability to meet debt obligations.  \n* S&amp;P gave them BBB+ credit ratings on commercial paper.\n\nCosts:\n\n* Interest expenses are at 184M\n* Cogs represent almost all expenses\n* No R&amp;D ever - See reinvestment\n\nDebts: \n\n* Lots of LTD, covered by cash\n* 1.25B due 2022 - easily covered\n* 750 M due 2024- \\^\\^\n* Next 5y interest payments are 684.1 Million, manageable\n* Lease payments next 5y - 1.2B, manageable.  \n* Almost negligible pension plan payments.  309m obligation over time, 164m liability\n* 71.9 M earn out, 31.1M payable in 2021 (Where a company has an obligation to pay out earnings to the seller of a business they acquired - usually a condition of lower purchase price)\n* 101.6M foreign tax transition obligations, 11.6M payable in 2021.\n* Recently issued 600M debt, paid off older debt issues with the new issuance.  This is a standard practice.\n* Another issuance of longer term debt provided 600M to general corporate expenses including working capital expenditures, fixed asset expenditures and repayment of debt issues (They used the debt issue to finance general operating activities)\n* The terms of any debt that is issues is not subject to change in the event that credit ratings change\n\nThe capital obligations are manageable, and OCF currently covers and has in the past aptly covered obligations.\n\nAssets\n\n* Most cash coming from OCF.\n* Cash is managed daily internally.  A company treasury receives excess cash from operations and provides cash to operations when there is a need for it.  Great for keeping track of cash and also overseeing operations.\n* Company treasuries invest excess cash they have in short term maturity securities (1-90 day expiry on average)\n* 2.3 out of 5.6 B of cash is held by foreign subsidies.\n* Net debt decreased by 624M (Total debt - total cash)\n\nWACC: 10.6-.8%\n\nLong term growth rate: 3%\n\nLegal: Nothing large worth noting\n\nRecent/expected developments: Nothing worth noting\n\n## Valuation\n\nOMCs DCF Valuation is between $120-140.  Seeing that the company is experiencing slow growth and is not a well known company, this figure may not be an accurate price prediction but is nonetheless a devent valuation providing an adequate margin of safety.\n\n## Opinion\n\nBased on this analysis, I would give OMC a weak buy rating.  They have some value, but their growth is stunted.\n\nNote 1. Their use of EBITDA in their analysis is slightly reckless.  Not realizing interest expenses is not recommended in the industry.  Interest expenses are very real, as are taxes, and so they should be considered by a company when they are performing an internal audit.\n\nSources:\n\nTheir 10-K (This is where you really get to understand the capital and debt structure): [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/29989/000002998921000004/omc-20201231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/29989/000002998921000004/omc-20201231.htm)\n\nMacrotrends (Better than SEC for fast long term data, sometimes inaccurate): https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/OMC/omnicom-group/stock-price-history\n\nGlassdoor: https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Omnicom-Reviews-E1734.htm\n\nCIO Linkedin: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/chadi-farhat-2b421a76/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chadi-farhat-2b421a76/)\n\nYahoo finance: [https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/OMC/profile?p=OMC](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/OMC/profile?p=OMC)\n\nFinviz: [https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&amp;f=ind\\_advertisingagencies](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&amp;f=ind_advertisingagencies)\n\nHistory: https://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/69/Omnicom-Group-Inc.html",

Here\u2019s what they do.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uwy75emnlzb71.png?width=1446&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe55001708d8baa9ce43a356fc1fd05223c723c6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrently, Global-E supports:\n\n* Local messaging in over 25 languages\n* Purchases in over 100 currencies\n* Accepts over 150 payment methods\n* A multitude of competitively-priced shipping options\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Business Model**\n\nGlobal-E generates revenues by charging a fee (\u201cservice fee\u201d) for the integration of their platform into a merchant\u2019s services. Service fees are highly variable based on transaction volume, destination markets, level of customer service provided, etc, and are generated as a percentage of the Gross Merchandise Value (\u201cGMV\u201d) that flows through the platform. Global-E mandatorily bundles certain components of their integrated platform solutions that they believe are essential for achieving improved sales conversions from international traffic. However, their fulfillment services are offered on an optional basis and merchants can choose to utilize those services or cancel at any time. Think of it as bundling service A and B to have the greatest effect, while offering service C as an add-on component. Service fees make up for approximately 35% of revenue while fulfillment services are currently accounting for roughly 65%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Partnerships &amp; why they use Global-E**\n\nGlobal-E has formed many key technological as well as service partnerships. These third-party e-commerce platforms include: Salesforce Commerce Cloud, Shopify, BigCommerce, Magento Commerce, SAP, WooCommerce, PrestaShop, and others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What they do for merchants?*\n\nSome of the key benefits they provide for merchants are:\n\n* increased sales conversions: converting international traffic\n* offloading complexities: handling local pricing, payment collection, import duties, fraud, etc \n* reduction of risk: reduce legal complexity, manage import duties and taxes, handle compliance\n* enabling growth to new markets: allowing merchants flexibility to expand to cross-border opportunities\n\nAll while emphasizing merchant branding. The customer always faces the digital store-front and never leaves the brand page to check-out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What they do for shoppers?*\n\nGlobal-E\u2019s goal is to offer a frictionless shopping journey, regardless of the origin of the customer. This means:\n\n* Localized languages\n* Re-pricing in local currencies\n* Handling cross-border payments\n* Accurately pre-price import duties and taxes and include them in the final cost of the product\n* Delivery: using an extensive network of over 20 shipping carriers they are able to offer multiple shipping modes at attractive rates.\n* After-sale support and returns\n\nMerchants integrating Global-E into their platform generally experience a significantly higher international traffic conversion rate (often exceeding 60%). The Global-E platform removes many complexities involved with international expansion. They already have more than 400 merchants, from small companies to globally-recognized retailers, on the platform across various diversified verticals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Shopify Deal**\n\nAs mentioned above, one of Global-E most lucrative partners lies with Shopify making them the exclusive third-party and cross-border solution across the large network of Shopify merchants. Shopify knows what kind of business that will bring for Global-E and thus Shopify has bought 7.75 million shares and acquired a **6.5% stake** in the company. As Shopify grows Global-E grows and Shopify knows this, hence the stake in a company that reflects their own revenues by proxy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TAM, &amp; CAGR**\n\nFirst came the transition to domestic e-commerce as well as sourcing and reselling products from China (aka Dropshipping). Next is going to be the transition of global e-commerce and cross-border sales. According to this 225 page **research by GlobeNewsWire**, the global cross-border B2C e-commerce market was 780 billion in 2019 and expected to grow at a CAGR of 27% through 2026 where it will become a 4.82 trillion market.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/inyhcsiplzb71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b34faf468998be77cce529a3ba10fa5bc995acbf\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Global-E\u2019s Smart Insights**\n\nOne of the company\u2019s strengths lies within sophisticated \u201cSmart Insights\u201d they use to scale their applications. Smart Insights is a \u201cbig data\u201d network that uses various metrics such as country, price-point, and shopper behaviors allowing Global-E to provide highly-optimized experience for shoppers. This ends up driving increased conversion rates and revenues for the merchant and a better overall experience for the shopper. The company has noted by integrating big-data into their platform they can experience \u201ceconomies of scale\u201d as well as \u201ceconomies of skill\u201d enabling them to optimize merchants\u2019 cross-border sales. These insights are continuously expanding as they collect additional data points along the purchasing journey.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Competitive Advantage &amp; Growth Opportunities**\n\nWhat seems to be becoming more of a trend since 2020 and even more so now in 2021 are corporation\u2019s use of big data. I\u2019m not talking about basic user data such as age, gender, location, but more on the lines of vastly large information networks. These networks can utilize things such as time spent on page, scrolls, and clicks all in one massive database. Global-E differentiates themselves through their main data asset (\u201cSmart Insights\u201d) that informs them on certain decisions and is able to optimize how merchants sell their product across different borders. They integrate this data network into a flywheel effect, for example: their current analytics drives more sales to merchants, which then feeds new data back into the system, which then allows for higher optimization and better conversions. They feed into each other back and forth getting smarter with each website visitor and purchase. This aligns perfectly for their products \u201cNet Dollar Retention Rate\u201d of 134% and 172% in 2019 and 2020, respectively.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGlobal-E attributes much of their growth to being a first mover (and doing it right) in the cross-border e-commerce space. Their success has been accelerated by several key factors, such as:\n\n* Accelerated shift towards e-commerce outpacing traditional retail\n* Cross-border e-commerce growing faster than domestic e-commerce\n* Their merchant\u2019s strategic focus on D2C sales, maintaining relationship with shoppers globally\n* The complexity and limitations of leaving the merchant responsible for implementing what Global-E offers. This doesn\u2019t come down to just a cost, but also time-intensive as well as being difficult to maintain and scale\n* Covid-19 tailwinds\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a result of the above and other market factors, the cross-borders e-commerce market is expected to continue the surge in growth. I previously mentioned the forecast in TAM however, Forrester, a research company, also expects the cross-border e-commerce markets to reach $736 billion by 2023.\n\nGlobal-E has several opportunities to expand on existing channels and capture new markets. This can be done with:\n\n* Growth through existing portfolio of merchants and strengthening relationships\n* Acquiring new merchants in existing geographies\n* Expanding in new geographies that they don\u2019t have exposure to\n* Continue to expand and innovate their platform\n* Continue to develop strategic partnerships (with key brands and players)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Risks**\n\nMany of Global-E\u2019s risks fall under the category of general business risks. Some of these include: retaining old merchants and attracting new ones, failing to enhance the platform as well as successfully competing against new and existing competition, failing to manage growth, pricing pressures from competition, and being highly dependent on cross-border regulations, sales, and operations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Revenues, Scale, &amp; Profitability**\n\nIn FY 2020 Global-E helped process 4.6 million orders for their merchants generating $136.4 million. Their Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) also grew to 774 million for the same period. Other impressive metrics were their net dollar retention rate and gross profit as % of revenue both of which continue to climb at 172% and 31.9%, respectively. Stellar!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d0znsk3rlzb71.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86a85e8ca385840bc628dc9c4e571920db0da764\n\nSome key growth metrics the company has seen in 2019 and 2020.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mieawv2slzb71.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63878409148360ba2d9cf60dc271726d3fbe84e0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough the company has recently turned a profit while growing top-line revenue and GMV at a high pace. The company suggested that short-term profitability might be sacrificed due to the expansions they are making to cover larger markets. As noted from the S-1:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201cWe expect our operating expenses to significantly increase over the next several years as we hire additional personnel, expand into new geographies, expand our partnerships, operations, and infrastructure, continue to enhance our platform, develop and expand its features, integrations and capabilities, expand and improve our service offering and increase our spending on sales and marketing. We intend to continue to build and enhance our platform through internal research and development and we may also selectively pursue acquisitions.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick peak at their consolidated statement of operations. Note the revenue growth and total operating expenses that *decreas*e, as a percentage of total revenue, as revenues increase (almost doubles YoY).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4hi5pdtlzb71.png?width=1656&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38673b72baccef59379b9448939f4a7bb89fbfbf\n\n**Valuation**\n\nLooking at GLBE\u2019s valuation it is clear that you pay a premium when owning this company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The Good*\n\nGLBE is growing revenue at 134% YoY.\n\nGross margins are improving while the company continues to scale.\n\nMany tech and services partnerships they can piggy back on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The Bad*\n\nConsistent profitability could be years away as the company is investing heavily into their own expansion of current and new markets.\n\nGLBE is currently trading at roughly 50x price to sales and 260 forward P/E.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Up for Debate*\n\nGlobal-E has almost no long-term debt, but current liabilities are stacking up while the company is not generating much FCF. I wouldn\u2019t expect them to be generating this much FCF this early in the game after their IPO.\n\nLock-up expiration on August 11, 2021.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nIn my opinion Global-E is top of the class when it comes to their business. They are growing extremely fast while improving margins and this is the premium you would pay versus investing in a \u201cstable\u201d company generating tons of FCF, but not much growth. Due to the nature of being a high-growth stock there will naturally be more volatility around the trade. While it\u2019s currently trading at 50x price/sales I am more likely to shy away from entering a new position. We could see this stock swing to 40x p/s and potentially enter on the dips.\n\nThis is somewhat of a chicken or the egg situation because there might not be any dips to buy with this kind of growth. For example, at current growth rates (100-135% YoY) if stock price is maintained it would only be trading at less than half it\u2019s price/sales valuation only one year from now. This is definitely a stock to monitor closely if you are wanting to find the right entry point for a long-term hold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;**\n\n1. Global-E is an \u201cenabler\u201d that allows e-commerce and digital stores to seamlessly integrate international transactions. They deal with tasks from translations, currency re-pricing, international shipping &amp; returns, compliance &amp; tax regulations, etc.\n2. GLBE integrates their proprietary \u201cSmart Insights\u201d application that analyses customer shopping and transaction data to continuously improve on sales conversions. The feedback loop is always learning as it collects more and more data along each customer\u2019s purchase journey.\n3. GLBE is trading at a rich valuation given their total revenue was $136 million in 2020. However, they are growing top-line revenues and Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) over 130% Y.o.Y. Shopify holds a 6.5% stake in Global-E as GLBE facilitates a large amount of transactions on the Shopify network. As Shopify grows, GLBE grows.\n4. GLBE is growing through many tailwinds such as those from covid lockdowns and accelerated shift toward e-commerce outpacing traditional retail. They\u2019ve got an opportunity to expand into more international regions, strengthen relationships with existing merchants, while continuing to expand and improve their platform.",

        "selftext": "Had shares of (US-listed) Slack (WORK) in my Canadian margin account. Slack was acquired by (US-listed) Salesforce (CRM) in a cash and stock deal: \"for one share of Slack, Slack shareholders will receive $26.79 a share and .0776 shares of Salesforce.\"\n\nSeems like the deal has closed as I now have some USD and some CRM shares in my margin account instead of WORK shares.  \n\n\nMy question is, will I need to pay capital gains tax to the CRA on one or both of the cash or stock portions of the deal? I assume I will on the cash portion, but am unsure if it is also considered a taxable event when the WORK shares are exchanged for CRM shares.  \n\n\nThanks!",

The shares will vest over a period of ten years.\n\nThe grant represents a financial acknowledgment of a high-priority leadership change for one of the world\u2019s top technology companies.\n\nBezos founded Amazon in 1994 and is today the world\u2019s richest person, with a net worth of nearly $200 billion, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/). Now he is handing over the entire company to a trusted executive who led Amazon Web Services since its inception, helping Amazon expand beyond commerce and making the company more profitable.\n\nAfter serving as Bezos\u2019 shadow, Jassy led the company\u2019s push into technology that companies could use to run computing workloads and store data in Amazon\u2019s data centers, with the first services arriving in 2006. Now the company leads the market, with Microsoft, Google and other companies trying to catch up.\n\nThe additional shares are worth $214 million at Amazon\u2019s Friday closing price of $3.510.98 per share. In addition to the award, Jassy owns 0.02% of Amazon stock, worth more than $300 million, according to FactSet.\n\nJassy\u2019s successor as AWS chief is [Adam Selipsky](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/27/how-adam-selipsky-could-make-aws-even-bigger.html), who rejoined Amazon from Salesforce earlier this year.",

        "selftext": "Hi guys!! Former wall street analyst here... I'm sharing what I've learned from 10 years of experience. \n\n(I wrote a [book](https://henrychien.com/investing-book/)!) Here's an excerpt on business models - which is a HUGE part of investing and picking stocks. It's a way to simplify a business so you can get a sense of how the big the company can get (i.e. its growth) and how much cash flows it can create  (i.e. its profits). \n\nThen you have an idea (i.e. your thesis) and can estimate where the price of a stock can go. \n\nI'll use $DMTK, which is a popular stock on Fintwit (and also very limited research), of how you research the company to learn its business model, to then estimate its finances. \n\n## What is a \u201cbusiness model\u201d?\n\nThis is a way to simplify how business works into a \u201cmodel\u201d. With a model you can estimate the change of a company\u2019s growth and cash flows to reach a value of a stock.\n\n***You start by describing the basic business model (here with DermTech):***\n\n* **A business provides a product or a service.** DermTech ($DMTK) provides a test for dermatologists to test people for melanoma. Each test costs a certain $ amount which is charged to either patients or insurers. \n* **This provides some value to its customers.** The test is an alternative to biopsies which are painful and leave scars. It is also more accurate which means less biopsies, which also means less overall costs for insurers. \n* **It operates in a \u201cmarket\u201d which is its current or potential customers.** $DMTK\u2019s target market is U.S. dermatologists that test and monitor their patients for melanoma. \n* **Management has a vision for the business.** CEO John Dobak wants to build DermTech into a leading platform of genetic testing for dermatology practices. \n\n***And then the business strategy\\*:***\n\n* **The business has a strategy to grow or \u201cscale\u201d to a certain level.** Management plans to expand sales to the majority of testing dermatology clinicians and expand reimbursement to most commercial insurance plans.\n* **Business has a future potential source of profits or \u201cmargin.\u201d** The cost of the facility and equipment is largely fixed so higher prices should support gross margin. Sales and marketing should also grow slower than revenues to create operating margin and profits over time. \n\n*\\*This fits directly into the valuation framework of growth and cash flows.*\n\nOnce you do this, you build a \u201csense\u201d of a company and what is the critical factor that will drive earnings and the value of the company. This is super important to build an investment thesis.\n\n* **Simplify a company into a business model to estimate change.** \n\n## Where to find information to describe a business model?\n\nUse these key sources of information to use when looking at a company. \n\n**SEC Filings** \\- The 10K and / or the S1 prospectus has the most detailed information on the business model, its financials and the market it operates in. 10Qs provide quarterly updates.These are all accessible on SEC [EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml). \n\nPay attention to these sections in the 10K and S1 for the most valuable information.\n\n* ***\u201cBusiness\u201d*** and ***\u201cManagement Discussion and Analysis\u201d*** sections typically describe the businesses\u2019 products or services, the value to customers, the market it operates in. The discussion usually describes the company\u2019s growth strategy.\n* ***\u201cRisk factors''*** section is where you get a sense of the risk of the business. This is also a good area to look for the critical factor for the value of the business. \n\n**Investor presentation** \\- Use this to get more information on the market and the business model. Here is where management will often highlight the growth strategy.\n\nThis is helpful for building the upside of an investment thesis (expected growth and earnings).\n\n* **Videos of management or Q&amp;A** \\- Use these videos to get a sense of the business model and growth strategy from management. Here they will usually outline the company\u2019s vision, the growth strategy and sometimes targets for scale and margin. \n\n**Transcript of earnings calls (Q&amp;A)** \\- Look at the prepared commentary for a business update (focus on the critical factors) and then search the Q&amp;A for additional details to help understand the financial model or change in the business. \n\n**Earnings releases** \\-  Look at these for the metrics for business updates. These are posted on investor relations pages and in 8K filings on EDGAR. Pay attention to guidance. \n\n* *Later, you will learn how to quickly analyze these releases.*  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Here\u2019s a sample business model overview from $DMTK***\n\n$DMTK provides a non-invasive diagnostic for melanoma that uses genomic analysis (pigmented lesion assay). There are three sources of value:\n\n* The value to customers is fewer biopsies to diagnose melanoma (requires 2.5 to 1 vs. 25 to 1 for biopsies)\n* Clinical value also lowers probability of missing melanoma (&lt;1%) and higher predictive value (3-4% from 18.7%)\n* Economic value to payers from lower cost to $760 vs. $947 for visual assessment, fewer biopsies and earlier detection of melanoma.\n\nManagement\u2019s vision is to incorporate genomic testing into dermatology with this platform.\n\n* The \u201cmarket\u201d for this product is the 4m surgical biopsies performed every year for early stage melanoma (which translates to about 207K / year).\n* The plan to expand commercial insurance reimbursement coverage to increase sales price to $760 per test, which will raise gross margins to 60-70%. \n* The growth strategy is to target the 5,000 clinicians that perform the majority of biopsies and plan to increase their salesforce to 50 people. \n\nThe critical factor (and risk) is getting commercial reimbursement coverage in order to raise the price point. Another risk is the ability to generate profits and scale its salesforce.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith those assumptions you can estimate the future finances of the company, which you can then use to estimate the future price of the stock! (That will require another post!).\n\nFeel free to DM me (or follow me on twitter - henrychien4 ). And here's the [book link](https://henrychien.com/investing-book/) if you are interested.

Say goodbye to formal paper agreements. DocuSign makes it easy to sign agreements. No more going into the office to sign a contract. No more losing your documents. All the documents are stored in the cloud making your agreements easy to find. Some of the top-performing fortune 500 companies use DocuSign. If they back them, why shouldn't you? COVID-19 has had a positive effect on DOCU. DOCU has been able to capitalize on all the people working from home during the pandemic. This can be proven by the massive increase in market cap. This can also be proven by the PE, PS, and PB ratios. I believe those who have transitioned to DOCU during the pandemic have no reason to switch back to paper. I believe we're going to see more companies make the switch from paper to the cloud whether or not they choose DocuSign. The digital era requires digital solutions. I believe DOCU is a good long-term investment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice\\*\\**\n\n*\\*\\*Do your own research\\*\\**",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 152.82 points to close at 34,786.35. The S&amp;P 500 has now risen for seven consecutive sessions, its longest winning streak since August.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Solid moves by major tech stocks helped support the overall market on Friday, with shares of Apple and Salesforce rising by nearly 2% and 1.3%, respectively. Microsoft jumped 2.2%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For the week, the Nasdaq Composite rose nearly 2%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Dow climbed 1.7% and 1%, respectively. Several sectors closed at record levels on Friday, including tech and health care.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The strong week on Wall Street was spurred by a string of solid economic reports, capped by a better-than-expected jobs report on Friday morning.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The economy [added 850,000 jobs last month](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/jobs-report-june-2021.html), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting an addition of 706,000. The print topped the revised 583,000 jobs created in May.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThis is a strong report and should be taken as a sign of things to come for an accelerating labor market,\u201d Aberdeen Standard Investments deputy chief economist James McCann said in a note.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Angelo Kourkafas, an investment strategist at Edward Jones, said that the report showed solid growth but wouldn\u2019t change the Fed\u2019s policy path, hitting a sweet spot for markets.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cI think it was one of these goldilocks-type of reports, because hiring accelerated -- which is a positive sign for the second half and the recovery -- but not so much that it would trigger a reaction of an accelerated timeline for the Federal Reserve to start tapering,\u201d Kourkafas said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In addition to the job gains, average hourly wages rose 0.3% for the month and are up 3.6% year over year, matching expectations.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said that the report eased concerns about a labor shortage.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cI think we also learned that the explanations for the weaker numbers from April and May -- namely that seasonal probably weighing on job growth and probably some impact from the unemployment benefits on labor supply -- that those were pretty good explanations. So I think it was reassuring, in that sense,\u201d Hatzius said on CNBC\u2019s \u201c[Squawk on the Street](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-on-the-street/),\u201d adding that the unemployment rate coming in higher than expected showed that the recovery still had a long way to go.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The S&amp;P 500 has now risen in five of the past six weeks, while the Nasdaq has gained in six of the past seven weeks.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Even with the recent strength for stocks, market strategists say that uncertainty about the future of the Fed\u2019s asset purchases and the upcoming earnings season could keep stocks from making major gains in the near term.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThe market is still very much concerned about the Fed\u2019s reaction function,\u201d said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors, adding that he thought there was still a lot of slack in the labor market.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One weak spot for the markets this week was small caps, as the Russell 2000 slipped 1% on Friday to finish negative for the week.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On Friday, shares of Boeing fell 1.3%, weighing on the Dow, after a 737 cargo plane made an [emergency landing off the coast of Honolulu](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/boeing-cargo-plane-makes-emergency-landing-in-ocean-off-honolulu-coast-faa-says.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_content=Main&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1625234441).

I always wanted to invest in a quantum computing company, but the public market didn't provide me with any opportunity that seemed worth it. Then IonQ came along. Initially I was a bit sceptical because I never heard of them before, but I was intrigued nevertheless. The more I got into the stock, the more I wanted to find out. This DD is the result.     \nYou might have noticed my username, therefore caution is advised. I'm pretty much hit or miss with my trades, which brought my account from 8K to 1.3M, back down to 10K back up to 130K. As you might have guessed, I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise. Do your own DD. I religiously tried to source everything I write here, therefore you can take your own trip down into the rabbit hole. Some things I write are speculation and I hope this is clear from the context. I'm not an expert in quantum physics, nor a computer scientist (even though I studied it for half a year). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n LIFE STORY OVER, LETS GET TO IT \n\n The only thing which is key to understand quantum computing in my DD is seen in this picture: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: \\(1\\)](https://preview.redd.it/46wo0wvm77971.png?width=1273&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c11dfb115cbc995886a312f2454b5727c14e2db)\n\nThis is how you can envision a quantum circuit. What matters here and what is the number one thing quantum computing is trying to achieve, is getting a program through the circuit. The problem with QC is that those \u201cqubits\u201d (which comes from bits), have errors when doing computation on them. Therefore if you give them 5 things to do (5 gates), they might end up somewhere you didn't intend them to end up at. With every step they make, the error gets bigger. Getting this faultiness out of them is the end goal of quantum computing. Unfortunately, this is really hard.   \n\nNow let's look closer at what a quantum computing circuit consists off: We have qubit number, 1 gate fidelity, 2 gate fidelity and connectivity. We have the number of qubits on the left. You can perform gates on those qubits. Those usually involve 1 or 2 qubits. If you want to know how \u201cprecise\u201d a operation on 1 qubit is, you check the single gate fidelity. If you want to know how precise a operation on 2 qubits is, you check 2 gate fidelity (they move together due to entanglement). The higher the fidelity, the more operations you can do on a qubit until the result becomes too faulty. What isn't visible in the picture is connectivity between qubits. If you have all to all connectivity, you can perform 2 qubit gates with no additional steps. If you don't have all to all connectivity, you need to \u201cmove\u201d the  information of the qubits in order for them to be next to each other, which requires additional gates.     \n    \nQuantum Volume: I will talk about quantum volume in the DD a lot, therefore a short explanation of this benchmark is necessary. For some time, the number one thing a quantum computing company touted as a success was the number of qubits. The number of qubits alone doesn't really matter for a quantum algorithm, since they are faulty. This brings us back to the quantum circuit picture. What quantum volume tells you is, how many 2 qubit gate operations you can make until its becomes too noisy. For example, you have 8 qubits that you randomly perform 2 qubit gates on. If you can do this 4 times in a circuit, you have a circuit depth of 4. Each depth means that you randomly paired up the qubits and made a 2 qubit gate. 8 times and you have 8 depth and so on (2).   In order to not let depth or qubit number become dominant, the smaller of those two is counted. E.g. if you have 10 qubits and a depth of 8, you pretend that you only have 8 qubits and vice versa. (3) If you get an 8 for example, the quantum volume is 2\\^8= 256. If you get a 12 the quantum volume is 2\\^12 = 4069 This number you put after the \u201c\\^ \u201c is what IonQ calls \u201calgorithmic qubit\u201d. You get the number by taking the log2(quantum volume) (4). In our example this would be an 8 for 2\\^8 and a 12 for 2\\^12. The number in quantum volume that IonQ will reach in the future becomes too big, therefore they made this adjustment.   \n    \n    \n(1) https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5160469/Quantum-Computation-Primer-Part-2 \n\n(2) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD-JCi0lcLo \n\n(3) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\\_volume \n\n(4) https://www.zdnet.com/article/ionq-introduces-algorithmic-qubits-to-counter-quantum-volume-in-quantum-computing/ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1) IonQ is 5 years ahead of the competition, in a race that will take 10 years**. \n\nThe Quantum Volume benchmark is the industry standard and was developed by IBM. IonQ is the leader: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: \\(1\\)](https://preview.redd.it/zb1d3fgo87971.png?width=1511&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54616ec9550c90ac3ff1bd92a7eec747a22c3572)\n\nIonQ issued a press release claiming a quantum volume above 4 million. As of right now, they didn't publish those results in a scientific paper, which earned them some criticism. The reasons for not publishing those results in a scientific paper are twofold. For once, they are waiting for the merger to get closer. Once they publish those results, they should see a good amount of press coverage. The second reason why they don't rush to publish the results is that they want to get their quantum computer to a point where it can reliably hit this benchmark. It is one thing to fine tune your quantum computer to get a benchmark and another thing to have this benchmark be met reliably.     \nWhat IonQ did already publish was a paper that used the new quantum computer. The numbers in that paper make it clear that IonQ can hit the benchmark, so there is nothing to worry here.   \nTo claim leadership based on this benchmark is done  by Honeywell right now: \u201cThrough performance upgrades, System Model H1 achieved a quantum volume of 512, the highest measured on a commercial quantum computer to date.\u201d -Honeywell (3) Once IonQ's quantum computer is measured, the word \u201cmeasured\u201d goes away. Once it is reliable, the word \u201c commercial quantum computer\u201d goes away.     \n    \n  \n\nHere is how the next 5 years will most likely look like: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33da3ijz87971.png?width=952&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8568b8ac9c78cd5719586c0cad91700169df56c8\n\nIn this graph I'm not using quantum volume, I use algorithmic qubits. If I would use quantum volume, IonQ would be of the charts. They express the same thing, just in smaller numbers.   \nI use IBM's roadmap to get an implied roadmap for Google. IBM and Google use the same architecture and are at a similar level right now, so I think this is fair.  Honeywell already published their roadmap using quantum volume. Those not included, didn't publish a roadmap yet that is applicable within the next 5 years. Quantum Volume gives you a good idea of how well one can perform error correction (How small the overhead will be). Unfortunately, it is hard to make a performance roadmap right now, once you include error correction. I will talk about the other player in the markets in a latter paragraph.     \nWhat is important to note is that, without error correction, the other players can't catch up to IonQ, even if they push their physical limit. I think it is no coincidence that IonQ hit this specific mark. They just wanted to make sure that they remain number one and are able to focus on the other parts of the puzzle. \n\nWhat this graph shows is that due to the limit in gate fidelities, even with an increase in qubits, there is a limit to the QV one can achieve without error correction. IonQ just happens to hit the limit of superconducting qubits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: \\(1\\)](https://preview.redd.it/bk9oz91d97971.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5204a5ca389ce0162df010ed7341785b0f9ee9e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is no coincidence that IonQ is in the lead right now, since they used to be in the lead, when their 4th generation QC was introduced ,2 years ago.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source \\(7\\) min 10:38](https://preview.redd.it/wiw912mk97971.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf328daf959702a91bb78b759595a7816173ac2b)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(1) https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521114527/d138876d425.htm \n\n(2) https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11482 \n\n(3) https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/news/2021/03/honeywell-sets-new-record-for-quantum-computing-performance  \n\n(4) https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521114527/d138876d425.htm  \n\n(5) https://www.hpcwire.com/2020/04/07/honeywells-big-bet-on-trapped-ion-quantum-computing/  \n\n(6) https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2020/01/quantum-volume-32/ (7) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Lg1nSd6Y \n\n**2)** **IonQ is the only quantum startup backed by the who is who in tech.**   \nIn this part, there are four things I want to stress.   \n\n\\-One thing is that IonQ has a unheard of backing from tech companies. We all know the headlines \u201cX company backed by Y goes public\u201d. That will be a long list for IonQ.  \n\n \\-The second thing is that this is not normal for quantum computing companies. The IonQ investors didn't diversify into many companies. They all went for IonQ.  \n\n\\-The third thing is that those tech investors are capable of running the business numbers that I will later lay out. I don't have the precise numbers, but they do. I assume they did the same thing that I did and came to a similar conclusion.   \n\n\\-The last thing is that some people claim that the former \u201cstealth company\u201d PsiQuantum has some tricks up their sleeves. Yet the investor base does not drastically indicate this, even though they should have non public informations. I think in the case of Rigetti, the lack of industry support can be seen as foreshadowing for what happened to them. I only use company investors and founders, since they have the technical expertise. I think Wall Street money isn't really expressing much.   \nThose are the company investors: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source \\(1\\) \\(2\\)](https://preview.redd.it/1radnmwga7971.png?width=982&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2d20e282455b4f5d145997a9d5e2aaa0cf76694)\n\n Those are the \"founder of company\" investors: There are 2 ideas for the 65$ provision. Either this is based on expectations for hype. The other is the expectation of a bidding war. The bidding war thesis builds on the fact that there are no founder shares, the possible buyers already have a postion and have them on their cloud plus the buyers can't buy right now because they would have to file with the SEC, which would indicate that they are accumlating. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source \\(1\\) \\(2\\)](https://preview.redd.it/s2307etja7971.png?width=986&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8e10c93ed848f53b848e2d6e6067c2a31423ee0)\n\nHere is PsiQuantum:   \n\nThey moved into Silicon Valley to get better access to funding (3).\n\nHere is the story about Microsoft's quantum paper getting retracted from Nature for having \"unnecessarily corrected\" some of the data, making it part of the 79 papers in the history of Nature that got retracted (4). \n\nMicrosoft is also diversifying their effort pretty heavily (5). \n\nThem having the Founders Fund as an investor is pretty noteworthy nevertheless.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: \\(6\\)](https://preview.redd.it/34k7cg1nc7971.png?width=1418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d594ffcaae0c456420bbb950874384232e9e12f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is Rigetti: They suffered a massive down round in their latest funding round (7) and had an exodus of employees (8). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: \\(9\\)](https://preview.redd.it/2usbmirqc7971.png?width=981&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=623a28df1f6949950d2c1110444a25a327b97db3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(1) https://ionq.com/company\n\n(2) https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521098621/d70340ds4.htm\n\n(3) https://www.ft.com/content/a5af3039-abbf-4b25-92e2-c40e5957c8cd\n\n(4) https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56328980\n\n(5) https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/quantum-computing/network/#customers\n\n(6) https://psiquantum.com/\n\n(7) https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/rigetti-computing-took-a-71-million-down-round-because-quantum-computing-is-hard/\n\n(8) https://www.wsj.com/articles/quantum-computing-remains-a-challenge-for-tech-firms-11578345473\n\n(9) https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/65891-35#signals\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3)** **IonQ got three dollar in government money for every dollar spend in private money****.**   \n\nUp until now, IonQ received more then 160 million dollar from government funds, while receiving \\~80 million from private investors. This made it possible that they created 5 generations of Ion-Trap quantum computers while only spending 50 million dollars, leaving 30 million on the balance sheet. (1) And those are just the research grants. Now throw in the unpaid work of PhD students, the facilities provided by the universities, the wages paid for the professors, the research done at other universities and we are getting a good bang for our bug. (2)   \nSome claim that China might have an advantage, since they are investing heavily into quantum computing,but the existing funding is likely to increase. China spends about $2.5 billion on quantum research annually, more than 10 times what the U.S. Spends (3). President Biden said in his first press conference that the USA will increase spending in future technology's from 0.7% of GDP closer to 2% of GDP and explicitly mentioned quantum computing (4).     \nIonQ will have great access to this additional funding, since they are the only entity that got 2 seats on the New National Quantum Initiative Advisory Committee (NQIAC) (5).     \nAdditionally, the ex-CEO lead multiple quantum initiatives in Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) before coming to IonQ. (6) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: \\(7\\)](https://preview.redd.it/6g6hwvlmg7971.png?width=1149&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c34639967cfa7b540c90e11a9f08e47571174c69)\n\nA nice thing about IonQ is that they are extremely transparent about their progress, instead of choosing the stealth way.     \nIonQ is the number one quantum company to publish articles in the journal *Nature.* Up until now, they published 8 Nature articles and 3 Nature Communications articles. They have a total of 19 journal articles. (8) Besides being prestiges, those articles lead to additional government funding. (9) \n\nTo get some comparison:   \nHoneywell got 1 Nature article and a total of 4 journal articles. (10)                                                                IBM has 1 Science*,* 1 Nature Communications and a total of 3 journal articles. (11)   \nAlpine Quantum Technologies has 1 journal article. (12) \n\nKeep in mind that most big tech companies hire university teams to push their quantum effort. The only company that kinda build their own effort that I know off are Honeywell and IBM. They most likely recruited out of universities as well, but they don't seem to haven taken a whole team. Google hired John Martinis and his team at the University of California Santa Barbara for example. (13) We have a saying in Germany which goes like: \u201cThey only cook with water as well.\u201d This basically means they can't use magic to be better then someone else.   \n \n\nTo conclude this part, IonQ is expected to receive a bigger share of a growing pod of funding while simultaneously being the most achieving quantum research group there is. This research can pay stockholder handsomely.     \n\n\n(1) https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2021/05/28/ionqs-virtual-financial-analyst-day\u2014an-inside-look-part-one/ \n\n(2) https://ionq.com/news/october-29-2020-ionq-unveils-new-quantum-data-center \n\n(3) https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-quantum-computing-threat-to-american-security-11573411715 \n\n(4) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oYjSwJSomc .Min 45:47 \n\n(5) https://www.energy.gov/articles/white-house-office-science-and-technology-policy-and-us-department-energy-announces (6) http://trajectorymagazine.com/quantum-leaps/   \n\n(7) Koller.

Either because they invented the stuff or massively contributed to the development. If you take a look at the employees at IonQ you see some who are directly hired and some who serve as advisors. The reason that a lot of them serve as advisors is their involvement with the universities. They are part of the IonQ effort nevertheless.   \nI started mapping the people to the roadmap:     \nYou can divide the path to a complete QC in 3 parts: Architecture, Error-Correction, Scaling.

On the university side, Duke and Maryland are at the centre. They are putting in a big effort to juice up their quantum effort with talent and funding. Some way or the other, they will contribute to the IonQ mission, since IonQ is at the forefront of quantum computing.    \n    \n     \n (1) https://www.nist.gov/nist-and-nobel/dave-wineland/nobel-moments-dave-wineland  \n\n(2) https://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/chris-monroe-profile#.Xz4HSjv3RS0.twitter  \n\n(3) https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/12/scientists-are-close-building-quantum-computer-can-beat-conventional-one  \n\n(4) https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/26/916744/quantum-computer-race-ibm-google/  \n\n(5) https://scholars.duke.edu/person/robert.calderbank  \n\n(6) https://www.nature.com/articles/npjqi201634  \n\n(7) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umesh\\_Vazirani  \n\n(8)  https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/news/2020/10/get-to-know-honeywell-s-latest-quantum-computer-system-model-h1  \n\n(9) https://www.jstor.org/stable/26046953 \n\n(10) https://www.nanalyze.com/2021/03/ionq-quantum-computing-stock/  \n\n(11) https://www.f6s.com/jungsangkim  \n\n(12) https://blog.executivebiz.com/2020/06/quantum-computer-maker-ionq-raises-additional-funds-adds-four-members-to-advisory-board/  \n\n(13) https://cmns.umd.edu/news-events/features/3940 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **5) The TAM of quantum computing is estimated at 65 Billion by 2030 and the gross profit margins of 90% are only rivalled by Software**   \n\n\nConcerning the TAM:   There are two main areas of uses for quantum computers. One is simulating nature, the other is running algorithms.   In nature, many processes are depended on quantum physics. Quantum physics is really hard to simulate on a normal computer. Faced with this problem, the initial idea behind quantum computers was to simulate quantum physics (1).   It is pretty uncontroversial that quantum computers will create value here. Therefore the expected TAM coming for this is predictable, especially since modern supercomputers are already used for that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Stolen from Kenneth Brown's twitter account, who took it from the Department of Energy ASCR programs especially INCITE. ](https://preview.redd.it/yu8s49chj7971.png?width=1130&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0e47a5ad642cbade00e85db2b2f33db20d2b3fe)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other area is doing complicated math. Artificial Intelligence, Monte-Carlo-Simulations in finance, searching a database and cracking encryption based on factoring all fall into this category. How useful quantum computing is in those areas is still being researched, but early results are promising.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Boston Consulting Group YouTube Q2B](https://preview.redd.it/45j0z5qlj7971.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c4f2108c9f5c8a8331a2ab37c2322d7803b5fd2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n What is noteworthy in this regard is that we starting to see a slow down in Moore's Law. Therefore the reduction of costs for computation is slowly starting to decrease less, while the need for computational power is steadily increasing. Therefore the chip industry will start to see problems when it comes to meeting the ever increasing demand (2).   \n\n\nBy 2023, 20% of organizations intend to budget for quantum-computing projects, compared to less than 1% in 2018 (3).     \n\n\nConcerning the sales strategy, IonQ is the only company that is available on all 3 major cloud providers. Once QC are sufficiently strong to be commercially interesting, the customers will come based on a cost/benefit calculation. Therefore what matters most here is creating the access.    \n    \n    \n*Concerning the gross profit margins:* \n\nLet's talk about how quantum computers create value for shareholders. There are certain problems where normal computer needs exponentially more resources to solve a problem as the problem increases. Quantum computers don't. Mentally you can picture it like this: If faced by a applicable problem, you need to double the computing power every time the problem gets harder, while you only need one more qubit with a quantum computer. This can make quantum computing extremely profitable.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/38068uyxj7971.png?width=1914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81ed98718227fe645b982e6df24afef4308f26ca\n\n Each additional n in this scenario, would double the cost in supercomputer time!

The market has a high cost of entry, a high level of specialised knowledge and a very long time from research to having a prototype to eventually having a working quantum computer. Therefore the market in and off itself looks like it will only be ruled by a few players.   \n\nMore specifics: Those are my  bear case bullet points concerning the specific companies and not the technology they are employing.   \n\nHoneywell: Honeywell initially tried to sell a subscription service for their Ion Trap Quantum Computer. They promised the subscribers access to increasingly strong QC (1). Since IonQ made a massive leap, those subscribers have no reason to stay subscribed. Therefore the funding dried out and Honeywell is selling part of their Quantum Business to cut losses. No one gives away their golden goose. They are not even planning on catching up to where IonQ is now in the next 5 years. \n\nRigetti: Rigetti had a massive valuation cut in their last round (2). They also had a mass exodus of employees (3). They do the same thing that IBM does, but perform worse.   \n\nPsiQuantum: Not much information available to the public, due to their history of being \u201cstealth\u201d. Based on their investor base, what they say in private isn't mindblowing. Microsoft is among the worst to get as an investor in this space to get credibility. Again the Founder Fund is really what keeps them on the map, appart from their claims concerning the future.\n\nGoogle: Googles lead Software went to IonQ, while their Lead Hardware went to another company as well (4). I don't think this is a huge indicator, but it's not great either. Both of them didn't see a future in the Google quantum effort.   \n\nIBM: I have nothing \u201cbad\u201d to say about IBM. Their business strategy seems to be working, but they are giving a good chunk of QC time away for free (5). It is no surprise that they have a huge developer base. Once the QC become commercially interesting, the customers will come to the person supplying the best QC.    \n\n(1) https://www.zdnet.com/article/honeywell-introduces-quantum-computing-as-a-service-with-subscription-offering/ \n\n(2) https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/rigetti-computing-took-a-71-million-down-round-because-quantum-computing-is-hard/  \n\n(3) https://www.wsj.com/articles/quantum-computing-remains-a-challenge-for-tech-firms-11578345473 \n\n(4) https://www.wired.com/story/googles-head-quantum-computing-hardware-resigns/ \n\n(5) https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/quantum-computing-at-ibm/ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**7) Ion Traps have a cost advantage against other types of quantum computers.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/im04sahov7971.png?width=1466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d5adecb79dc5b94fcce8fe585ba4c6c0a676ac8\n\nI will go a bit into detail for Superconducting Qubits and Photonic Qubits. I group the rest. \n\nThe main case against superconducting qubits is the cost to keep them at a temperature close to the absolute minimum (-270 celsius or 0 kelvins). The fridge itself costs about 300.000 thousand dollar for the systems used to day, which doesn't include the electricity costs of running them (1).  The other factor is that everything that goes on in the fridge needs to be able to work at those temperatures, which is no easy task. Additionally they have a naturally higher error rate, which creates an bigger overhead. Therefore they need more physical qubits to build a error corrected qubit (2).   \n\n\nPhotonic qubits are also sometimes mentioned. The biggest problem for them is the extremely high overhead. They claim that they will use about 10.000 physical qubit to build a error corrected qubit (3). Additionaly they need some refrigiation aswell, but it's not extremly cold. \n\nAnother factor which is important here, is that IonQ's chips aren't \u201cquantum\u201d in a sense. The only thing quantum about them are the Ions (4). The rest of the chip uses technology that is already being produced, therefore if you compare the cost of a single qubit, IonQ won't be that expensive, while IonQ's physical qubits can do a magnitude more of work.   \n\n\nFor both competing systems, if you look at the performance to costs metric (not per phsical qubit, but cost for performance) IonQ will most likely beat them! Comparing them directly right now is pretty hard, because IonQ is to far ahead. Right now, IonQ pays about 2 million in parts and capitalized labour to build a system, not including a sales mark-up and service fees (5). That's hard to beat. Rough estimates put a price tag to IBM's system at \\~15 million, while those are significantly less useful (6).   \n  \n\nConcerning the other technologies:   \n\n\nTheir are about 7 different methods as of right now, but some are still at the early ages.   My main reason why I\u00b4m not concerned for now goes back to costs. Let's assume the other technologies get their first prototype in 10 years. At that point, if we compare the costs of qubits, the early scalers will already see a massive increase in cost savings. It is probably wise to stay informed about new developments, but I didn't stumbled into something that made me seriously worry yet. IonQ expects the per qubit cost to decrease by 90% over the next 5 years (7). Therefore as time goes on, new competing technologies will have a increasingly hard time to keep up. Time is on IonQ's side.     \n\n\nThe main question that arises here is: Why isn't everyone doing Trapped Ions then? The main idea is that Google and IBM went with superconducting qubits, because the manufacturing process is close to conventional chips. Ion Traps just wasn't their circle of expertise. Another question is, why didn't they buy IonQ? I think they tried, but IonQ said no. The founders where initially hesitant to even take private money.   \n    \n    \n(1) https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:199846-2018:TEXT:EN:HTML \n\n(2) Quantum Computing: Progress and Prospects (2019)   \n\n(3) https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.4612 \n\n(4) https://www.hpcwire.com/2019/06/05/quantum-upstart-ionq-sets-sights-on-challenging-ibm-rigetti-others/ \n\n(5) https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521114527/d138876d425.htm \n\n(6) https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/03/ibm-q-50-qubit-quantum-computer/ \n\n(7) https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521114527/d138876d425.htm \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **8) Smart money is taking notice of IonQ**   \n\n\nI intensively check for the awareness curve when it comes to IonQ. Therefore I compiled a list of FinTwit accounts who are recognising IonQ. The most important part here is that they aren't SPAC investors, but regular investors. I intentinally excluded SPAC investors, to get a sense of how normal investor look at IonQ. One part of them is \u201cSmart Money\u201d, e.g. Wall Street. They need to use burner accounts in order to get compliance of their back. The other part are FinTwit accounts with a following above 5K, e.g. \u201cInfluencers\u201d. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI included cramer here to show that he is \"aware\" of QC. I think he will say something like \"I was always interested in quantum computing\", when I invites a member of IonQ on his show.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zujg2mfxv7971.png?width=1428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59eb21352fb8e1ea7e5c5873a1a70c4d24760914\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **9) IonQ is cheap compared to similar tech companys** \n\nThis part is dedicated to the valuation of IonQ. First of all, in 2018 their was this thing called \u201cQuantum Winter\u201d. For some time, the whole industry struggled to get funding. This suppressed valuations. Without quantum winter, I think we would already see IonQ at atleast double the price, which is nice.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wu1ws1t1w7971.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07e036f926eb04704099ac35f9887cfd840606cd\n\nThe question is as to who you compare IonQ's valuation to.   You can either do it by checking for unprofitable hyper growth stocks or you can try and use forward multiples. The big thing about IonQ is that there doesn't exist a public company yet to compare them directly to. Therefore we will have to see how the public prices them.     \nIf you compare IonQ to other hyper growth stocks, we should see a valuation somewhere between 5-10B. I think this is justified by the story. Right now the EV is at 1.4B. There is no other company that can carry the title \u201cleader in quantum computing\u201d for the next 5 years. The story is there. What I really like about IonQ is that there is also a very good businesses case to make. Some of the meme stocks definitely have a great story. Unfortunately some of them lack the margins, the competitive position and a few other variables that turn a great story into a great business. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to value IonQ on forward multiples, the closest thing we have are Nvidia and AMD. The problem I have with this notion is a quote from the nobel prize winner William Phillips: \u201cA quantum computer differs more from a classical computer than a classical computer differs from an abacus\u201d.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8ut2ig4w7971.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=139681528809538488567dccdc97ddd13ae32ea1\n\nAdditionally Nvidia and AMD are in a different product cycle right now, therefore even assuming that those are comparable, still makes it hard to compare them. If you want to do it nevertheless here is the slide:   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9air9lk7w7971.png?width=1520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf288f11ca3471ce32ed338191f827afe7e6b3ca\n\nTwo things concerning the slide: For one, after using the multiples and discounting them, IonQ is trading at a \\~40% discount . Second, just having time passing should generate a return of 20% a year. Therefore, you get paid for waiting until IonQ develops balance sheet momentum. I will talk more about the ability of IonQ to hit milestones in \u201cPredictions\u201d part.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/upmmi82cw7971.png?width=1520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3a5eccb4150f30c3f11ad96b3f9a42e5fab46e8\n\n Two things concerning the slide: For one, after using the multiples and discounting them, IonQ is trading at a \\~40% discount .

I will talk more about the ability of IonQ to hit milestones in \u201cPredictions\u201d part.   \n    \n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**10) IonQ will only have a float of \\~ 250 million after the merger.**   \n\n\nThe PIPE and insiders are all locked out (1). Therefore if the merger creates enough hype in the beginning, this thing will trade like a 250 million market cap company. Why does this matter?   \nThere is a fun trick one can use to price stocks in the short term. We all know the \u201cmarginal buyer and marginal seller\u201d story, but this is kinda hard to quantify. What is really easy to quantify is to ask: \u201cHow much money will people put into this stock\u201d. In our case, I ask: \u201cHow much money will people put into the stock in the first month\u201d We have a float right now of 250 million at 10 per stock. If people collectively decide to put 1B into the stock, we get a stock price of 40. At 2B, we get a price of 80 and so on. Therefore if IonQ gets the meme/hype status that I assume it will get, it can be very profitable to get in early.     \n\n\n(1) https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1824920/000119312521193217/d70340ds4a.htm \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**11) IonQ is a high performance team**   \n\n\nI wanted to include this paragraph because I was checking if I can find any bad blood ex-employees. Anything that indicates that they have internal problems. Therefore I collected what I could find on the internet. What I found was that the  people who work at IonQ seem to have a great collegial connection. Mentally I always kinda connected IonQ to Quantumscape, therefore I wanted to find out if there is anything that indicates that the leadership runs a one man show, is not engaged with the team or anything like this. (Basically to make sure that there is no ammo for a short report)   \nMy two main points I found:  \n\nLeaders in IonQ having a their own secret language going. (Or whatever that is) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/do4vu6agw7971.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae083f7e136a47c8b01a755feb7120e5ef08d77f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ba1ynkkhw7971.png?width=1182&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dec696482c89ae173fa00109cc82749faf660990\n\nI'm pretty sure that the hiring of Dave Bacon went like this: Kenneth if there is own person in the world you want to work with, who would that be?   Kenneth Brown, Jungsang Kim and Monroe are the authors of the initial white paper that got IonQ started \n\nEmployees getting matching vanity plates with one of their bosses:   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cf4wnqimw7971.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d82dccb0071cf8be639745a43e30c3326a0a5a06\n\nAnother intern talking about the good time at IonQ:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/46uq2s0ow7971.png?width=729&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7685b63214ac862784eda9289e68887baa7afc5\n\n I could show some other chatter with people who are not working for IonQ but are working on Ion-Traps, but I want to keep it short.   \n\n  \nI checked glass door as well (1). They have a total of 5 reviews, in a company with about \\~70 employees. Two are positive and 3 are negative. They are all from this year, even though IonQ existed for \\~5 years now. The most common complaint is that they are overworked, followed by underpaid, followed by bad management.  \n\nI think overworked should get better, since they are hiring. At the same time, the past year was probably extremely hard, since they wanted to hit their QV target. Underpaid should get fixed by the capital raise plus they can easily pay people in equity now, which was mentioned by the CEO. Concerning the management, I can see Chapman (CEO) being very ambitious when it comes to timelines. He is a software guy and not a hardware guy, so it is hard for him to judge how long stuff takes. Keep in mind that the founders are the science guys and the \u201cmanagement\u201d is external. I have this idea that Chapman came into the company and saw that it was too easy for IonQ. I think that made him push harder. It's like a soccer team winning all the championships without hard practice.     \n\n\nThe only person that where I once found a non glassdoor complaint was the contractor who put together the slides for a investor presentation. He said he didn't get paid. IonQ immediately messaged him to figure it out. I think this was more or less one of those problems that just occur. IonQ didn't have a CFO nor the classical company structure at that time and I can see that just being victim of the special organisational structure that IonQ used to have.   \n    \nAnother thing I wanted to check was to find out why people left IonQ. My main idea is that they simply didn't have anything new to contribute. The science part is mostly done for IonQ. Pure scientists are not needed anymore. I think about John Preskill (big deal in the QC world) for example, who used to be an advisor. He now works for Amazon, who is still doing the \u201cfundamental work\u201d Another one is the ex-president of Bell Labs, who served on the board. IonQ needs engineers now. Ex CEO founded his own company. (He wasn't part of the original team, IonQ just needed a \u201cmanager\u201d). I couldn't find any movement of ex key employees that I considered suspicious. \n\nOne journalist wrote: \u201cIonQ does the right things at the right time\u201d(2) This also includes getting the right people onboard.      \nAt some point, the fact that IonQ behaves like a high performance team is no surprise. I think this is a necessary condition to constantly hit those results. Therefore this is no coincidence. It's fun to watch nevertheless.      \n  \n\n(1) https://www.glassdoor.de/Overview/Working-at-IonQ-EI\\_IE2421266.11,15.htm?countryRedirect=true \n\n(2)  https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2021/03/23/ionq-takes-quantum-computing-public-with-a-2-billion-deal/ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **12) The bull case is easy to understand and to follow.**   \n\n  \nSome tech companies that are going public right now or that have been public for a while have tech that is not easy to put in a nutshell. Therefore following their progress can be extremely difficult for someone who is not in the industry. In the case of IonQ, even a normal person can follow! There is 1 gate fidelity, 2 gate fidelity and qubit count. You put them together by checking for connectivity, which gives you the performance. You do the same thing once we are in the phase of error-correction. There is one technical breakthrough on the horizon, which can also be quantified by checking 2 gate fidelity (photonic network). At last, you need to check if the clock speed is fast enough so that the qubits stay in superposition long enough. (This is more or less a yes or no question). Once you have an intuitive understanding what those things are, you are good to go! Just check where they are at and you know the progress.   \nKnowing those few things will allow you to do a rudimentary \u201cBayesian updating\u201d (ascribing a new probability to outcomes based on the result of past outcomes) when it comes to checking the progress of IonQ and the rest of the industry.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **13) The IonQ meme has not been meme'd**   \n\n\nFor those of you who didn't here about quantum computing before: This one of the most hyped technologies on the horizon. It stands next  to fusion energy, strong AI, full self driving, blockchain, you name it. Their is also a good chunk of commentary on the hype itself. In order to get an idea where it stands, I used Google trends as a proxy for the hype.   \n\n\nWhat I try to capitalize on with my call options is the disconnect between the quantum computing hype and the knowledge about IonQ. Once those two things converge, we should see the price action.   \n\n\nLet's try to gauge the hype! \n\nFirst I compare quantum computer to solid state battery.\n\nSecond I compare Quantumscape to solid state battery. \n\nThird I compare IonQ to quantum computer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSolid state battery to quantum computer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fr15a49tw7971.png?width=1452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95b926cc9d31f2b8f826beef5c7e7412a00d8f5e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuantumscape to solid state battery. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6jvnytfuw7971.png?width=1430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c0b1c38b0f1cfa120389520444203e72a4640b0\n\nIonQ to quantum computer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0u0hkpfvw7971.png?width=1445&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9a2d2ab73eb97d9b70fc1f36296ad7cac0c8641\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hype:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/plcp37y2x7971.png?width=1356&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbcccd0929df12a75b19c6f20d0293e66cb7bceb\n\nFurther evidence of the disconnect between the quantum computing hype and IonQ can be seen if you google something like: \u201cWhat companies are doing quantum computing stuff\u201d. Some of those companies mentioned in those articles don't even have a serious quantum effort, while IonQ is unmentioned. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**14) IonQ's predictions are reliable as long as they are useful** \n\nIn this section, I will look at two sources of predictions. One is based on press releases, one is based on a video. \n\nFirst press releases: They don't make many prediction here, but the few they made are:   \n(July 2017) IonQ plans to bring general-purpose quantum computers to market by late 2018. (1) \n\n(July 2017) Within a year, IonQ expects to have quantum computing systems available for commercial use via the cloud with about 30 reliable, scalable qubits to start, Dr. Moehring said. (2)   \n  \n\n\u2192 IonQ breaks records for quantum computing performance. (December 2018)                                  (They don't have an announcement when it went on the cloud)   \n  \n\n(June 2019) IonQ plans to double its qubit count roughly every year. (3)   \u2192\n\n(To be seen) They will demonstrate their optical network this year(4):   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe original roadmap. A victim of the great benchmarking shift. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bj6dnp5ex7971.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87312bcbb90cdf0bd75e4a7b70fb3d5e16f02159\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see in the above picture, the roadmap used to consist of physical qubit number and single gate fidelity. The number of gates referred to single qubit gates. The \u201cobjective\u201d used to be Quantum Supremacy. \n\nThen the benchmarking shift happened. Quantum Volume was introduced. Therefore, now what mattered was the interplay between 2 qubit gate fidelity, number of qubits and connectivity. In order for IonQ to go with the time, they needed to present their success based on slightly different metrics. They didn't need a huge amount of qubits anymore, and the single qubit gate fidelity doesn't matter at all for quantum volume. Therefore they pushed quality over quantity, to show their competitiveness. The new objective for them is quantum advantage, which means that you rather use a quantum computer for certain tasks. Quantum Supremacy is nice for academic purposes, while Quantum Advantage makes you money. This is what ultimately allowed them to make the claim today to have the best quantum computer. They need funding after-all, so they need to go with the time.     \n\n\nIf we then my ask, well what would they have done differently if quantum volume never came along? They would have focused on ion shuttling and the optical network, in order to get more qubits connected. They will demonstrate the optical network in a industrial setting this year. I have no information when it comes to Ion Shuttling.   \n\n\nIn the end, they will need the full kid anyway. What changed was the order in which they achieve the different kinds of objectives.   \n\n\n(1) https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ionq-raises-20m-series-b-round-led-by-nea-gv-to-advance-quantum-computing-for-commercial-applications-300494456.html \n\n(2) https://www.wsj.com/articles/startups-trapped-ions-could-lead-to-better-quantum-performance-1501074264?tesla=y \n\n(3) https://www.hpcwire.com/2019/06/05/quantum-upstart-ionq-sets-sights-on-challenging-ibm-rigetti-others/ \n\n(4) https://www.zdnet.com/article/ionq-ceo-peter-chapman-on-quantum-computing-adoption-innovation-and-whats-next/ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**15) This is not just a liquidity event for investors, since IonQ is in need of the IPO money and the investors have a strategic interest** \n\n  \nTo be clear, I can see some of the investors taking profit. The ownership on IonQ is split between tech companies and Wall Street. Wall Street might be looking to take profits, but the strategic investors like Google, Amazon, Samsung etc. have a strategic interest in staying involved. IonQ is their ticket to Ion-Tap quantum computers. For those tech companies that have their own quantum program, IonQ is the way to diversify. I think it is unlikely that they will be quick to take a profit as long as the story doesn't change or the price becomes unreasonable. Tech companies can not afford to be not invested.   \n\n\nNow let's look at the need for money for IonQ.   \nYou can split this up into 4 areas where they need to have a big war chest.   \n\n\n1) They are hiring right now. Since IonQ is starting to scale, they need employees with a vast amount of experience and a specialised skill set. Those people aren't cheap and need job security. If you are a 50 year old engineer, you don't want to work for a startup that promisses you pay by giving out stock option. You need job security. IonQ can guarantee that by having the war chest ready. This is especially important if you look at other places like Google, who are also hiring. The cash increase levels the playing field.   \n\n\n2) Brute forcing results. There are two ways of getting stuff done. One is to think it through and find the best solution for a problem using brain power. The other way is simply trying it out until you find the right way. The trial and error method is costly. Not having enough resources to use this method puts you at a disadvantage. At the same time, telling a potential employee that he can \u201clet loose\u201d is a dream for those people.   \n\n3) Suppliers need security. Once IonQ starts mass production, they will outsource the chips. The suppliers building those need to be sure that IonQ has the cash to pay them. This way the suppliers can comfortably free resources for this task.   \n\n\n4) IonQ will most likely consolidate the industry. As you might imagine, IonQ is not the only company involved. At the same time, being in the lead gives them two advantages. People have an incentive to join them, since other quantum computing companies might not survive. The other advantage is that they stand ready to buy their patents or the whole company, once they give up. In order to flexible here, they need cash.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Finnaly:**\n\n**Bear Case of the internet**   \n    \nIn this part, I will start with the strongest bear case I have read so far. The next part will be a more more of a collection of criticism that I came along.   \nThis bear case was brought forth by Fernando Brandao on twitter. He is the Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology and the Head of Quantum Algorithms at Amazon Web Services. Smart guy but also part of the competition. \n\n I will just copy the thread here: Since those are well ordered, I will go over my counter argument step by step   \n(0) IonQ latest announcement with their roadmap is out: https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ionq-plans-to-launch-a-rack-mounted-quantum-computer-for-data-centers-in-2023/. Also check Peter Chapman talk on Q2B 2020 for similar content. The thread below hopefully will foster more discussion by the community. Disclaimer: all I write reflects only my personal opinion 1/20     \n\n\nIonQ claims to have today 22 qubits, all-to-all coupling, and 2-qubit error rates of 0.4% (achieving quantum volume of 4 millions). It\u2019s a big improvement over their latest published result of 11 qubits with 2.5% error rate (https://nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13534-2). 2/20   \n\n\n*My part: The qubit 2-qubit error rates they are claiming is 0.1% and they say they will achieve 0.04% in the future. 0.04% would add 3 zeros to the quantum volume claim. I think he messed up the zeros after the comma as well. It's 0.1% now resulting in a quantum volume above 4 million. I think this was an honest mistake in the heat of the moment.* (1)   \n\n\nIn their previous PR on October 2020, Chapman also said: \"In a single generation of hardware, we went from 11 to 32 qubits, and more importantly, improved the fidelity required to use all 32 qubits,\". I look forward seeing data on the experiments, which is not available yet. 3/20     \n\n\n*My part: They will publish the data, but they say it's more important right now to make the QC constantly hit those numbers. (Remember me talking about Honeywell in the beginning).* *They already published a paper that indicates that they can hit those numbers.(2)*   \n\n\nHere's a plot of their roadmap. \u201cAlgorithmic qubits\u201d in their plot means log\\_2(q. vol). By 2028, depth 1014 circuits on 1014 qubits. That would be amazing progress, but does it get us to useful applications of quantum computing? 4/20     \nChapman says: \u201cAs soon as you hit about 40 algorithmic qubits (...), you\u2019ll start to see quantum advantage probably in machine learning\u201d. Unlikely! QML is far into the future if ever. Also one can still easily simulate circuits on 40 qubits classically. 5/20     \nChapman also says: \u201cAnd then, I think it\u2019s pretty well accepted that at 72 qubits is roughly when you start to do quantum advantage fairly broadly\u201d. Not true! There are a few known applications for qubit counts close to 72, but one needs circuits of depth &gt;&gt;100k for that. 6/20     \nWith 72 \u201calgorithm qubits\u201d we can only run circuits of depth 72. You might hope for early advantage with variational/hybrid methods, but that\u2019s just a hope from today's facts. Depth 72 seems pretty small even assuming variational methods will eventually work. 7/20     \nHe continues: \u201cSo that would be in 2025. When you start to get into 2027, you\u2019re now getting into hundreds of qubits if not early 1000s of qubits in \\[2028\\]. And now you\u2019re starting to get into full-scale fault tolerance\u201d. 8/20     \nDepth-1000 circuits on 1000 qubits would be awesome progress, but far from what we believe is required for applications and what full-scale fault-tolerance would give. Ultimately we want a good number of qubits that we can run very, very!, long circuits on. 9/20     \n\n\n*My part: All those points refer to the question: \u201cWhen do quantum computers become useful?\u201d. Initially I assumed that someone can just tell me a number of qubits that they need to run an algorithm and I know. Unfortunately, this is not the case.(3)* \n\n*There are 2 ways of determining when QC will create value when it comes to algorithms. One is theoretical, one is practical. Theoretically you can \u201cmath out\u201d at what point a quantum computer can do useful things. Just check the equation and you know how many qubits you need for an idealised problem. People who are bearish can quote those numbers and say: QC will take forever and is useless for most problems.* *One guy in this camp is him: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEgBdWQdvfk. (min 43:22)* *He says: Don't believe anyone who claims that quantum computers can solve the travelling salesman problem\u201d*   *Theoretical this is most likely true, IF you choose to talk about the hardest possible instance.*   \n\n*Practically, the world doesn't create the hardest instances of problems. At the same time, we use \u201capproximations\u201d for those problems today, that aren't \u201cclear cut\u201d in their mathematics.*   *People who actually work with those real life instances will tell you that real life instances are solvable by Quantum computers and we can get an advantage of using them.*   *This guy is one of them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmtVNuAQMM0 (min 11:30)* *My argument is basically his argument. He is a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley working with Umesh Vazirani (who is an advisor for IonQ). He completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science at MIT under the guidance of Scott Aaronson (Who is a authority in the field).*     \n\n\nIonQ plans to get 64 \u201calg. qubits\u201d using 16 physical qubits to encode 1 logical qubit. I assume they plan to use Bacon-Shor codes, building on the beautiful recent paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11482). But details of their scheme for FT computation are not available yet. 10/20     \nsays: \u201cother technologies, because of their poor gate fidelity and qubit connectivity, might need 1,000, 10,000 or even 1,000,000 qubits to create a single error-corrected qubit.\u201d 11/20     \n100-1,000 overhead is the estimated number required to get very small error rates (&lt; 10\\^-10), capable of running useful algorithms. 12/20     \n\n\n*My part: All of this concerns error correction. \u201c100-1,000 overhead is the estimated number required to get very small error rates\u201d IF you have a very low (if not the minimum) of physical errors. IonQ doesn't calculate their overhead using the minimal physical error rate, so if they compare themselves to others, why should they assume the minimum for others and not themselves?*     \n\n\nIons are not different! If their physical 2-qubit error rate is &gt;0.1%, they will also require similar overheads. Right now, with IonQ current 2-qubit error rates of &gt;1.5%, error correction is not possible even with unbounded overhead. 13/20     \n\n\n*My part: 1.4% is the biggest gate they have (the worst gate so to speak) and they are predicting their overhead based on the 99.6% average 2 gate fidelity. Fernando later says that he was quoting the numbers from their older system (Gen 4)?. Ok. We need to keep in mind that IonQ has some of the best experts on error correction in their company. I think they know when error correction is possible and when it is not possible.*   \n    \nIonQ has long argued that scaling its technology doesn\u2019t necessitate any technological breakthroughs\u201d. To scale &gt;30 qubits, IonQ plans to use optical interconnects between different ions traps. That is an old idea, but has shown to be very challenging to get it right. 14/20     \nSeems IonQ is giving itself 5 years to figure it out. Experts have been trying to do it for at least 10 years. While I hope IonQ will pull it off in the fullness of time, functional optical interconnects are a major tech breakthrough required for ions scalability. 15/20     \n \n\n*My part: It has been demonstrated in the lab already and IonQ will demonstrate it this year in a industrial setting.(4)*   \n\n\nIt would be great if IonQ was upfront about it and reported on their progress towards optical interconnects. If anyone can do it, I believe it's them! 16/20   \n\n*My part: Yes, they will do it this year.(4)*   \n\n\nI have deep respect for IonQ scientists and I think they have the right to be excited about their approach as much as anyone else. It\u2019s still early days for everyone and all different platforms have to circumvent major technical challenges for scalability. 17/20     \n\n\n*My Part: Those technical challenges are not similarly hard. There is a difference between a white paper and the best performing prototype*.   \n\n\nBut I question if the over-the-top, never-ending, PR campaign of the company in recent years is the right approach to give value to its customers and help the world realize the dream of scalable quantum computers. 18/20     \n\n\n*My part: What PR campaign? Never heard about them before the IPO. They didn't publicly claim quantum supremacy even though they say they did it before Google. (5) (I know that this a a touchy subject, but Google didn't care that it was disputable when they came out with it). It's not in their press releases either. Their last QC did beat all the others QC on the benchmarks, when it came out.(6) I think it's fine to put that on the website. First quantum simulation of a water molecule?(7) They did that. Nature articles? (8)*     \n\n\nTo all our community (and unrelated to my comments on IonQ): we should be very grateful of all the investment our field is getting. But we have the responsibility of keeping hype down. 19/20     \nThe focus must be on tech and science development, not on vanity and greed. We owe it to the future generations of quantum scientists, investors and end-users. 20/20     \n\n\n*My part: (Unrelated to what he said in the last part) Monroe doesn't have any stock and pays himself close to nothing. (9) He himself was initially hesitant to take investor money, because he didn't want to be an \u201cindustry sell out\u201d (I here this term a lot on Quantum Twitter). I think allocating money to IonQ is probably not the worse use for money in general. I'm well aware that this will eventually lead to other groups receiving less money, since IonQ is setting the bar pretty high, but that's not IonQ's fault.* *I think Kenneth Brown doesn't even get a salary. Jungsang Kim and Peter Chapman are the only once that have classical stock. (9)They didn't yet publish what the stock based compensation looks like.*     \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n**Now I will focus on the three biggest criticisms brought forth**: Number one is their quantum volume claim, number two is the roadmap, number three is the clock speed.   \n    \nQuantum Volume Claim: \u201cthe statement fails basic sanity checking\u201d an editor wrote on Wikipedia, referring to the QV claim by IonQ (13). I think this just shows how far IonQ got in a short amount of time and how unlikely it is that people will catch up to them soon. The other paper they published indicates that they can hit the QV    \n\n\nRoadmap: I'm not sure why people complain about the roadmap, since Google and PsiQuantum have basically the same roadmap. I'm not saying they can do it, I'm just saying they are claiming it.   \u201cGood guy Google, presenting a timeline that is realistic and devoid of hyperboles, crazy made-up numbers, and extrapolated plots. \u201c (14)  Dude, it's the same roadmap. Google is even more optimistic than IonQ. Concerning the plausibility of the roadmap of IonQ. Their are 2 things that need to happen and IonQ is done. One is miniaturisation, the other is the optical network. They already have the right amount of numbers of qubits that allow for error correction on the chip. The miniaturisation will decrease the physical error further, since the laser doesn't need to travel that far anymore. They need an increase of 0.06% of 2 gate fidelity. Keep in mind that they went from 97.5% to 99.9% in \\~ 2 years while increasing the number of qubits(15). Now they want to get to 99.96 with the same number of qubits.  Additionally, the miniaturisation has already been demonstrated. This is not that hard.  The other thing is the optical network. They will demonstrate it this year in a industrial setting (16). This has also been show in the lab already.   Once they got those 2 things done, they will start mass production and are done. Mass producing those things is not that hard, since nothing about them is \u201cquantum\u201d.    \n\n\nClock speed: Clock speed refers to how fast you can do gates. Their are two things to consider here: One is the \u201cgeneral speed\u201d. I don't really care how fast the QC is, as long as it can perform. QC are already really fast. The second, more interesting point is that you need to perform the Gate fast enough, so that the qubits stay in superposition. This could be a problem, but up until it wasn't the limiting factor. I have heard no one make an argument that this will limit the capabilities in the future.      \n    \n\n\n(1) https://ionq.com/algorithmic-qubit-calculator/  and https://ionq.com/news/october-01-2020-most-powerful-quantum-computer \n\n(2) https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11482 \n\n(3) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmtVNuAQMM0 (4) https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10841 and https://www.zdnet.com/article/ionq-ceo-peter-chapman-on-quantum-computing-adoption-innovation-and-whats-next/ \n\n(5) https://www.afr.com/technology/why-google-wasn-t-really-the-first-to-achieve-quantum-supremacy-20190927-p52vg6 \n\n(6) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Lg1nSd6Y min 10:50 \n\n(7) https://ionq.com/news/february-26-2019 \n\n(8) https://ionq.com/resources/publications \n\n(9) https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521098621/d70340ds4.htm \n\n(10) https://jqi.umd.edu/news/quantum-bit/2013/11/25/coherence-time-survival-quantum-state \n\n(11) https://www.nature.com/articles/npjqi201634 \n\n(12) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a00GwjvFhw&amp;t=420s (min 3:53) \n\n(13) https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum\\_volume&amp;action=history \n\n(14) https://twitter.com/anuragsaharoy/status/1394745248799023105 \n\n(15) https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13534-2 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If you want to discuss anything I wrote, go for it!** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: I'm long 6200 commons, 1360 of the 20c 10/15 and 400 of the 15c 10/15.",

        "selftext": "I want to share the story of Netlist and the real value of its patents (patent 912 is perhaps one of the inventions of the century as it was used / stolen by google and as it allowed it to become so big and important in the world).\n\nHow did Google rise to the top of the search engine wars? Simple. Google cheated. A small company called Netlist in California developed some leading edge computer memory technology. That technology would let computers and servers of the day access 4 times more RAM (Random Access Memory) than the computer could normally access. Netlist met with Google regarding this technology. They showed the technology to Google in order that Google might license the technology from Netlist. Google didn't license it. Google stole it. Google copied it, had it manufactured, and used it in their servers. Google was caught with Netlist IP in their servers when the court ordered a random check of Google servers that were in operation at that time. Google, with Netlist IP, now had the fastest search engine on the Internet, and went on to leverage that speed and savings to become the giant, powerful company they are today.\n\nNetlist has battled Google for over 10 years to reclaim their intellectual property, and regain the value that their IP should have provided their bottom line and shareholders for many years. Google continued to try and run out the clock, hoping that Netlist would go out of business, or abandon the costly litigation. Netlist has abandoned nothing. Now the tables have turned and the clock is running out on Google. Google lost their latest appeal of the '912 patent at the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals (Federal Circuit), which upheld the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) affirmation of the patent's validity. Google did not appeal this ruling to the United States Supreme Court, and now the patent has been recertified by the US Patent Office. The trial in the Northern Disctrict of Califonia to determine the level of infingement, and the damages owed to Netlist by Google, has been reopened.\n\n\"For ten years Netlist has steadfastly opposed Google's misguided campaign to invalidate the \u2018912 patent,\" said Netlist's CEO, C.K. Hong. \"We are very pleased that in the end the appellate court made it clear that the claims of this seminal patent are indeed valid and in so doing, further vindicate our decade-long defense of the company's strategic intellectual property. We will now move to lift the stay in the patent infringement lawsuit against Google in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of CA., in order to recover current and past damages related to the \u2018912 patent.\"\n\nThere are currently two other legal battles with Samsung and micron.\nThis company could become very large within a few years.\nIs it the next qualcomm?\n\n\nA little over a year ago it was worth less than $ 30 million, to date it has exceeded the one and a half billion market cap and the shares have gone from a low of 10 cents to a current high of $ 7.3\n\n\u201cRoth Confidence Report -- $10 target with Buy Rating. \u201c[Here](http://googlecheatednetlist.com)",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 22, 2021**\n\nStocks edged higher today in a very volatile session, with the three main indexes (S&amp;P 500 (SPY), Nasdaq (QQQ), Dow Jones (DIA) falling at open before reversing to the upside mid-session, a sign that market participants remain eager to buy up any dip. On the other hand, the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, broke its two day rally, trading 1.75% lower at the time of writing. Market participants continue to weight a variety of factors, including but not limited to: (1) faster-than-expected pace of economic recovery, (2) surging corporate earnings, (3) potential inflationary pressures, (4) labor market imbalances, and (5) concerns surrounding the coronavirus delta variant. Basically, the market is balancing between expectations for rapid economic expansion moving forward and concerns surrounding inflation and the delta variant.\n\nToday, the Labor Department released the Weekly Unemployment report, which unfortunately, showed an unexpected rise in new jobless claims filed. New jobless claims jumped to 419,000, well above consensus estimates of 360,000 and a sharp jump from the previous week, which showed pandemic-era lows in claims filed. Since the beginning of the pandemic, market participants have closely tracked these numbers in order to gauge the health of the labor market. However, with rising infections threatening to trigger new restrictions, labor market reports have taken on more importance than usual.\n\nIn the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 32,300 on July 18, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, as I said yesterday, it is important to understand that the rising infections are broadly concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, \u201cThere is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.\u201d Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.\n\nIn other news, Q2 earnings season continues full steam ahead, with the quarter shaping up to be another record-setting one. Earnings are expected to be super-charged by higher than expected demand from savings-laden consumers as the economy reopens. While concerns around the delta variant have put a damper on sentiment, reports by companies have not reflected any slowdown in growth. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data \u2013 an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be \"need to be revised higher.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Twitter (TWTR) skyrocketed after-hours after the company reported better than expected earnings and raised guidance moving forward.\n* Shares of Domino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ) skyrocketed after smashing earnings estimates and announcing a new share buyback program\n* US Senators introduced a bill that would amend Section 230, the well-known law that gives social media companies immunity from what users post on their platform, to hold companies liable for health-related misinformation.\n* Websites of several airlines, banks and technology companies, including Amazon's AWS, Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Express (AXP), were facing outages, according to DownDetector. So far, I\u2019ve been unable to find the cause.\n* Bank of America (BAC) on Wednesday said its board approved a 17% increase to the company's quarterly cash dividend.\n* U antitrust regulators are set to give unconditional approval to Irish aircraft leasing company AerCap's (AER) $30 billion bid for General Electric's (GE) aircraft leasing business, three people familiar with the matter said.\n* Ford (F), startup Argo AI, and Lyft (LYFT) are reportedly working together to launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in Miami, Florida and Austin, Texas later this year.

        "selftext": " I entered a large long position on October 20, 2019, based on momentum, their flashy NASA 5G contract, US government 5G cybersecurity contract, and NOK\u2019s growing 5G market share. In February of 2021, I furnished a little DD of $NOK with a one-year to 18-month, price target of $14 (possibly with an OTT exuberance at that time). Afterwards, I dug deeper into Nokia, and it continues to be one of the most interesting stocks on the market. (Being an Autistic Silverback looking to buy more crayons to eat, since my wife is too busy with her boyfriend and has no time to make me dinner, I bought in with another large long position in April of 2021 \\[Previously posted on the $NOK subs\\]). I probably have more silver in my hair than the average Redditt Autistic Ape, hence I prefer to be titled Silverback, but I have equal exuberance and love of our communities here.\n\nThere is a lot to look into. . . \"Nokia Bell Labs (formerly named **Bell Labs Innovations** \\- 1996\u20132007) is an American industrial research and scientific development company now owned by the Finnish company Nokia $NOK which itself was established in 1865. Nokia Bell Labs\u2019 headquarters is located in Murray Hill, New Jersey, the company operates several laboratories in the United States and around the world.\" \n\n\u00b7 9 Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories, as well as 4 Turing Awards.\n\n\u00b7 The C Programming Language, as well as Unix was developed at Bell.\n\nWith the 5G/6G arms race heating up, it is time for the 100-year-old Nokia Bell Labs think-tank and 155-year-old $NOK, to be leveraged once more.\n\n(Hard) SPECULATION:\n\n\u00b7 \"Big tech trades human futures\" - Zuboff, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\n\n\u00b7 IMO, modern institutions are very cunning... Everything they do has purpose.\n\n\u00b7 From certain notorious figures in the cryptocurrency community in the previous bull market, I have learned this, and scaled it into larger markets... The behaviors are the same, but even more predictable due to the dominance of algorithmic trading. Just trade \"whale\" for \"institution\".\n\n\u00b7 Nokia is seen in a negative light by retail, and the whole WSB push on January 27, 2021, further weekend $NOK\u2019s image to traditional retail investors. Many investors instantly rejected the notion of learning about this company.\n\n\u00b7 Forgive me if you have disdain for WSB and the \"Robinhood\" investors, but I believe that there is big money behind them... BlackRock , JPM , etc... They are a vehicle for change, and a perfect fall guy for market manipulation.\n\n\u00b7 Some of the DD are likely released by BlackRock themselves... I've seen some of the account's post histories. \"Robinhooders\" are looked down upon, yet under the guise of anonymity, Hedgie\u2019s can release red-herring DD that far exceeds any big-name analyst report? It smells fishy!\n\n\u00b7 Don\u2019t forget what RH did with blocking purchases of BB, GME, AMC and NOK on January 27, 2021. \n\n\u00b7 Announced on July 16, 2021, Robinhood traders who held Gamestop, AMC, Nokia, BlackBerry, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Naked Brands, Koss, or Express stock on January 27, 2021, are encouraged to sign up at [https://clientconnect.labaton.com/case/robinhood-trading-restrictions/](https://pr.report/G7VZYcWN). Labaton Sucharow can analyze your claim and your losses, negotiate with the company, and pursue your claim in arbitration if necessary.\n\n2 Possible threads of speculation:\n\n\u00b7 The outstanding shares of $NOK is 5.6B ... however, with a large float and a high percentage of short interest and public participation even $NOK can be manipulated.\n\n\u00b7 Impulse Wave 1 is often a test pump... To gauge the retail demand levels. Institutions love to do this, and only create a melt up when an ideal motive wave can be created.\n\n\u00b7  However, with $NOK short interest has been dropping, from nearly $300M in January to $150M this month, a 23% drop from last month. Accumulation of Institutional Ownership has ranged from about 4.0% in Q4 2020 to 6.44% in Q2 2021, (double that if one follows Fintel). The Institutional Ownership has increased because of the analyst upgrades and the added possibility of dividends being reinstated. \n\n\"Have you ever wondered how you can enter the world of IoT or meet the increased requirements of the emerging 5G use cases?

If we make a comparison to precious metals miners... this company is a first wave major, not a second wave junior. i.e. in the early stages CapEx is high, and that is why in October of 2019 $NOK suspended dividends to reserve cash for increased spending in RD. Since, 2019 $NOK has made major expenditures in RD.\n\n\u00b7 In November of 2020, Nokia , Elisa and Qualcomm together have achieved the fastest 5G speeds recorded in the world.

Completely independent self-driving. 5G/6G is part of the solution! Why is Elon Musk focusing on Starlink now? It is the solution for Tesla's biggest roadblock. Don\u2019t forget, the June 29, 2021 article about Musk and Starlink began \u201cDon Joyce, a **Nokia** manager working from home at a remote lake cottage in Canada, recently abandoned his painfully slow phone-line internet in favor of satellite broadband service Starlink, offered by Elon Musk's SpaceX.\u201d Moreover, Musk said \u201che was talking to possible partners as a number of countries require operators to provide rural coverage as conditions of their 5G licenses.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 5G infrastructures are the neurons for IoT!\n\n\u00b7 5G is huge. It is of UTMOST importance. Why would the US go to such lengths to cripple China's Huawei for YEARS? Huawei seems to be their number 1 target!\n\n**Key contracts and partnerships:**\n\n\u00b7 July 13, 2021: \u201cWe are progressing well with our three-phased plan to achieve sustainable, profitable growth and technology leadership laid out at our Capital Markets Day in March,\u201d said Pekka Lundmark, Nokia president and chief executive officer, in a statement.\n\n\u00b7 The FIRST company contracted to set up internet on the moon.

In October, Nokia was named a NASA partner for its Tipping Point technologies for the Moon program, receiving a $14 million contract to deploy the first LTE /4G communications system on the Moon.\n\n\u00b7 5G/6G will be essential for space travel... Sounds like ARKX will need to look into this one!\n\n\u00b7 Dec. 1, 2020 - Nokia and AT&amp;T extend Worldwide IoT Network Grid (WING) collaboration to deliver seamless IoT connectivity to enterprises around the world, and support upgrades to 5G \"As IoT networks transition to 5G and with Nokia WING also supporting 5G network slicing, AT&amp;T will be able to partition its 5G network into multiple networks that can deliver specific capabilities to its IoT customers and support various use cases.\"\n\n\u00b7 Jan.14, 2021 - Nokia selected for U.S. Federal 5G Cybersecurity Project.\n\n\u00b7 Main collaborator for the Hexa-X 6G European Union Project... \"Being a 2.5-year project within EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 ICT-52 program, Hexa-X is a consortium of 25 key players from adjacent industries and academia. **Nokia** has the overall lead and Ericsson the technical manager role in the project.

Ericsson - 14%, but for 2021, $NOK is targeting a 4G and 5G market share **between 25% to 27%** in FY21. On July 16, 2021 ERIC tanked over 11%, due to retaliation for Sweden\u2019s China ban, ERIC had a 28% market share in China, and due to the retaliation, ERIC lost 60% of its market share in China, amounting to $300M. While, NOK only has 1% market share in China, $NOK has no fear of retaliation and only what to gain, particularly since China needs $NOK for its cloud services.  \n\n**$NOK 5G Contracts in last 9-months have more than doubled:**\n\nMoreover, $NOK\u2019s contracts are growing by leaps and bounds. On October 5, 2020 $NOK had secured 100 5G Contracts, but as of today, $NOK\u2019s contracts and market share are way up, $NOK has 170 Commercial 5G Deals, 67 5G Live Operator Networks, 230 Commercial 5G Agreements.\n\n**Patents:**\n\n(The following figures of the following 5g players are very conservative as to $NOK). Investors accumulate shares, Research companies accumulate patents. Those who own the patents are the power brokers in the industry. According to a GreyB total 5G European patents owned and granted as a live-patents as of **June 20, 2020** and those limited to 5G and Standard Essential Patents \u201cSEP\u2019s\u201d:\n\n1. Huawei - 3,007 SEP\u2019s \u2013 530 - Essentiality Ratio: 32% \n\n2. Samsung \u2013 2,317 SEP\u2019s \u2013 374 - Essentiality Ratio: 23% \n\n3. LG \u2013 2,147 SEP\u2019s \u2013 323 - Essentiality Ratio: 20% \n\n4. Nokia - 2,047 SEP\u2019s \u2013 421 - Essentiality **Ratio: 27%** and the highest percentage of granted patents at 76%. \n\n5. Ericsson \u2013 1,678 SEP\u2019s \u2013 230 - Essentiality Ratio: 24% \n\n6. Qualcomm \u2013 1,125 SEP\u2019s \u2013 219 - Essentiality Ratio: 29% \n\n**$NOK is the leader in SEP\u2019s:**\n\nThe argument is that SEP ownership... materially, affects which patents actually matter, and as of **April 28, 2021**, and independent study by PA Consulting firms confined that Nokia owns over 3,500 patent families declared essential to 5G. As such, $NOK is now the leader in SEP\u2019s. \u201cNokia\u2019s industry-leading patent portfolio is built on more than \u20ac130 billion invested in R&amp;D since 2000 and is composed of around 20,000 patent families, including over 3,500 patent families declared essential to 5G.\u201d\n\n$NOK President and CEO Pekka Lundmark has been leading $NOK since August 1, 2021,he has been steady, understated and rather than exaggerate $NOK\u2019s position he has delivered an earnings beat for Q1 FY21 and is expected to do the same on Q2 FY21 on July 29, 2021. He has avoided money pits and has helped $NOK grab market share and profitable 5G contracts. \n\nCompare $NOK to Ericsson through March 21, 2021 and Market Cap and contracts to date:\n\n* **Nokia** revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2021      was **$6.120B**, a **12.91% increase** year-over-year.\n* **Nokia** revenue for the twelve      months ending March 31, 2021 was **$25.661B**, a **0.61% decline** year-over-year.\n* **Nokia** 5G Contracts: 170 Commercial 5G      Deals, 67 5G Live Operator Networks, 230 Commercial 5G Agreements.\n* **Nokia \u2013** MC 32.20B, price $5.56 up 26.25% over last year.\n* **Ericsson** revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2021      was **$5.934B**, a **15.12% increase** year-over-year.\n* **Ericsson** revenue for the twelve months ending March 31, 2021      was **$26.110B**, a **9.44% increase** year-over-year.\n* **Ericsson** 5G      Contracts: 143 Commercial 5G agreements, 93 Live 5G Networks, 81 Publicly announced 5G      contracts.\n* **Ericsson \u2013** MC 38.50B, price $11.61 up 4.52% over last year.\n\nClearly, $NOK and Ericsson are converging, $NOK is gaining market share, has more 5G contracts, SEP\u2019s, cash surplus and Ericson investors are jumping over to $NOK. Don\u2019t forget Ericsson settled with $NOK regarding patent litigation and has to pay $NOK damages. Ericsson said the settlement followed investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) into corruption, including the bribing of government officials. Ericsson settled with the DOJ in 2019 and agreed to pay over $1 billion in penalties.\n\n$NOK is successful in its Patent Litigation.\n\nOn April of 2021, after $NOK received several favorable rulings Nokia and Lenovo settled a patent dispute, in May of 2021 Ericson settled with $NOK and agreed to pay $NOK 97M Euro, in June of 2021 Daimler agreed to pay Nokia for using its patents and Nokia will license mobile telecommunications technology to Daimler, in July $NOK launched patent lawsuits against OnePlus Technology, throughout Europe and Asia.  \n\n**$NOK upgraded by analysts across the board:**\n\n\u00b7 On July 5, 2021, Exane BNP Paribas analyst Stefan Slowinski upgraded $NOK to Outperform from Neutral with a **$7.70** price target.\n\n\u00b7 On July 15, 2021, Goldman Sachs analyst Alexander Duval upgraded $NOK from neutral to buy and raised his price target from $4.90 to **$6.50**.\n\n\u00b7 On July 14, 2021, JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande, upgrading Nokia to Overweight, and a **$7.80** price target. That's 32% upside from the previous day\u2019s close of $5.88.\n\n\u00b7 Part of the analyst upgrade is because on July 13, 2021 $NOK updated its financial guidance for full year 2021. In the second quarter Nokia saw continued strength in the business, improving its expectations for the full year. Nokia now expects to revise upwards its prior outlook ranges for 2021. Nokia plans to provide full details on its second quarter and half-year financial performance and revised full year 2021 guidance on 29 July 2021.\n\n**A quick calculation of Value metrics from February 2021 to July 16, 2021:**\n\n\u00b7 Current Mcap: As of February, 23.35B as of today 32.4B.\n\n\u00b7 In February $NOK had a 16% market share, today $NOK has about a 25% market share, and using that figure (which will probably grow) 25% of 663B in 2027... market size refers to the maximum total number of sales or customers your business can see, often measured over the course of a year.\n\n\u00b7 663B x 0.25 = 165B Revenue, assuming Revenue = Sales for now, 165B/5B shares = 33 SPS. Assuming P/S Ratio of 1, Market Value per Share = $33.00 USD by 2027.\n\n\u00b7 Current price = $5.70, 33/5.7 = 5.80, so a 580% gain in 6 years based on a P/S Ratio of 1.00 (NOK\u2019s current P/S ratio is about 1.25).\n\n\u00b7 Tesla's current P/S ratio is 20.18, and Zoom is about 32.72.\n\nI**nstitutional Behavior:**\n\n\u00b7 Pursuant to Nasdaq, (Fintel\u2019s figures are double) which is conservative, in February $NOK had 442 institutional investors, at 4% ownership, and rising... today $NOK has 585 Institutional Holders, holding 6.44% an over 50% increase from February. Also, Nokia has a very high chance of reinstating dividends in 2022, and owning now would lower the cost basis. \n\n\u00b7 Institutional investors including mutual funds (now that $NOK has passed the $5 threshold) are increasing buys of Nokia, and are also anticipating the possibility of reinstated dividends. The mid-point for dividends of tech stocks is 4.75% however, if an investor bust NOK at $5.7 and the price is $11.50 by 2022 and Nokia is paying dividends of 4.75% than that investor is earning 54.6 cents per share, equaling a return of 9.5% on that investors cost basis of $5.7 per share.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Institutional Owners](https://preview.redd.it/3o6p34ugh8c71.jpg?width=1700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32722919c29c614dfa352894358dd0c523c73ec7)\n\n**Some - Highlights of $NOK 5G Contract Gains:**\n\n\u00b7 July 19, 2021: $NOK won its first 5G radio contract in China, securing a share in one of China Mobile's [(0941.HK)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/0941.HK) three new 5G contracts, while Nordic rival Ericsson lost market share after getting caught up in a political spat.\n\n**\u00b7** July 19, 2021: **Nokia extends 5G installed base with Taiwan Star Telecom expansion deal.**\n\n\u00b7 July 19, 2021: Openreach has been ramping up the delivery of ultra-high-speed broadband across the UK as part of the government\u2019s target to offer gigabit connectivity to 85% of the UK.

In February of 2021, I furnished a little DD of $NOK with a one-year to 18-month, price target of $14 (possibly with an OTT exuberance at that time). Afterwards, I dug deeper into Nokia, and it continues to be one of the most interesting stocks on the market. (Being an Autistic Silverback looking to buy more crayons to eat, since my wife is too busy with her boyfriend and has no time to make me dinner, I bought in with another large long position in April of 2021 \\[Previously posted on the $NOK subs\\]). I probably have more silver in my hair than the average Redditt Autistic Ape, hence I prefer to be titled Silverback, but I have equal exuberance and love of our communities here.\n\nThere is a lot to look into. . . \"Nokia Bell Labs (formerly named **Bell Labs Innovations** \\- 1996\u20132007) is an American industrial research and scientific development company now owned by the Finnish company Nokia $NOK which itself was established in 1865. Nokia Bell Labs\u2019 headquarters is located in Murray Hill, New Jersey, the company operates several laboratories in the United States and around the world.\" \n\n\u00b7 9 Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories, as well as 4 Turing Awards.\n\n\u00b7 The C Programming Language, as well as Unix was developed at Bell.\n\nWith the 5G/6G arms race heating up, it is time for the 100-year-old Nokia Bell Labs think-tank and 155-year-old $NOK, to be leveraged once more.\n\n(Hard) SPECULATION:\n\n\u00b7 \"Big tech trades human futures\" - Zuboff, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\n\n\u00b7 IMO, modern institutions are very cunning... Everything they do has purpose.\n\n\u00b7 From certain notorious figures in the cryptocurrency community in the previous bull market, I have learned this, and scaled it into larger markets... The behaviors are the same, but even more predictable due to the dominance of algorithmic trading. Just trade \"whale\" for \"institution\".\n\n\u00b7 Nokia is seen in a negative light by retail, and the whole WSB push on January 27, 2021, further weekend $NOK\u2019s image to traditional retail investors. Many investors instantly rejected the notion of learning about this company.\n\n\u00b7 Forgive me if you have disdain for WSB and the \"Robinhood\" investors, but I believe that there is big money behind them... BlackRock , JPM , etc... They are a vehicle for change, and a perfect fall guy for market manipulation.\n\n\u00b7 Some of the DD are likely released by BlackRock themselves... I've seen some of the account's post histories. \"Robinhooders\" are looked down upon, yet under the guise of anonymity, Hedgie\u2019s can release red-herring DD that far exceeds any big-name analyst report? It smells fishy!\n\n\u00b7 Don\u2019t forget what RH did with blocking purchases of BB, GME, AMC and NOK on January 27, 2021. \n\n\u00b7 Announced on July 16, 2021, Robinhood traders who held Gamestop, AMC, Nokia, BlackBerry, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Naked Brands, Koss, or Express stock on January 27, 2021, are encouraged to sign up at [https://clientconnect.labaton.com/case/robinhood-trading-restrictions/](https://pr.report/G7VZYcWN).

To gauge the retail demand levels. Institutions love to do this, and only create a melt up when an ideal motive wave can be created.\n\n\u00b7  However, with $NOK short interest has been dropping, from nearly $300M in January to $150M this month, a 23% drop from last month. Accumulation of Institutional Ownership has ranged from about 4.0% in Q4 2020 to 6.44% in Q2 2021, (double that if one follows Fintel). The Institutional Ownership has increased because of the analyst upgrades and the added possibility of dividends being reinstated. \n\n  \n\n\"Have you ever wondered how you can enter the world of IoT or meet the increased requirements of the emerging 5G use cases?

If we make a comparison to precious metals miners... this company is a first wave major, not a second wave junior. i.e. in the early stages CapEx is high, and that is why in October of 2019 $NOK suspended dividends to reserve cash for increased spending in RD.

As such, $NOK is now the leader in SEP\u2019s. \u201cNokia\u2019s industry-leading patent portfolio is built on more than \u20ac130 billion invested in R&amp;D since 2000 and is composed of around 20,000 patent families, including over 3,500 patent families declared essential to 5G.\u201d\n\n$NOK President and CEO Pekka Lundmark has been leading $NOK since August 1, 2021,he has been steady, understated and rather than exaggerate $NOK\u2019s position he has delivered an earnings beat for Q1 FY21 and is expected to do the same on Q2 FY21 on July 29, 2021. He has avoided money pits and has helped $NOK grab market share and profitable 5G contracts. \n\nCompare $NOK to Ericsson through March 21, 2021 and Market Cap and contracts to date:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Nokia** revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2021      was **$6.120B**, a **12.91% increase** year-over-year.\n* **Nokia** revenue for the twelve      months ending March 31, 2021 was **$25.661B**, a **0.61% decline** year-over-year.\n* **Nokia** 5G Contracts: 170 Commercial 5G      Deals, 67 5G Live Operator Networks, 230 Commercial 5G Agreements.\n* **Nokia \u2013** MC 32.20B, price $5.56 up 26.25% over last year.\n* **Ericsson** revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2021      was **$5.934B**, a **15.12% increase** year-over-year.\n* **Ericsson** revenue for the twelve months ending March 31, 2021      was **$26.110B**, a **9.44% increase** year-over-year.\n* **Ericsson** 5G      Contracts: 143 Commercial 5G agreements, 93 Live 5G Networks, 81 Publicly announced 5G      contracts.\n* **Ericsson \u2013** MC 38.50B, price $11.61 up 4.52% over last year.\n\nClearly, $NOK and Ericsson are converging, $NOK is gaining market share, has more 5G contracts, SEP\u2019s, cash surplus and Ericson investors are jumping over to $NOK. Don\u2019t forget Ericsson settled with $NOK regarding patent litigation and has to pay $NOK damages. Ericsson said the settlement followed investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) into corruption, including the bribing of government officials. Ericsson settled with the DOJ in 2019 and agreed to pay over $1 billion in penalties.\n\n$NOK is successful in its Patent Litigation.\n\nOn April of 2021, after $NOK received several favorable rulings Nokia and Lenovo settled a patent dispute, in May of 2021 Ericson settled with $NOK and agreed to pay $NOK 97M Euro, in June of 2021 Daimler agreed to pay Nokia for using its patents and Nokia will license mobile telecommunications technology to Daimler, in July $NOK launched patent lawsuits against OnePlus Technology, throughout Europe and Asia.  \n\n**$NOK upgraded by analysts across the board:**\n\n\u00b7 On July 5, 2021, Exane BNP Paribas analyst Stefan Slowinski upgraded $NOK to Outperform from Neutral with a **$7.70** price target.\n\n\u00b7 On July 15, 2021, Goldman Sachs analyst Alexander Duval upgraded $NOK from neutral to buy and raised his price target from $4.90 to **$6.50**.\n\n\u00b7 On July 14, 2021, JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande, upgrading Nokia to Overweight, and a **$7.80** price target. That's 32% upside from the previous day\u2019s close of $5.88.\n\n\u00b7 Part of the analyst upgrade is because on July 13, 2021 $NOK updated its financial guidance for full year 2021. In the second quarter Nokia saw continued strength in the business, improving its expectations for the full year. Nokia now expects to revise upwards its prior outlook ranges for 2021. Nokia plans to provide full details on its second quarter and half-year financial performance and revised full year 2021 guidance on 29 July 2021.\n\n**A quick calculation of Value metrics from February 2021 to July 16, 2021:**\n\n\u00b7 Current Mcap: As of February, 23.35B as of today 32.4B.\n\n\u00b7 In February $NOK had a 16% market share, today $NOK has about a 25% market share, and using that figure (which will probably grow) 25% of 663B in 2027... market size refers to the maximum total number of sales or customers your business can see, often measured over the course of a year.\n\n\u00b7 663B x 0.25 = 165B Revenue, assuming Revenue = Sales for now, 165B/5B shares = 33 SPS. Assuming P/S Ratio of 1, Market Value per Share = $33.00 USD by 2027.\n\n\u00b7 Current price = $5.70, 33/5.7 = 5.80, so a 580% gain in 6 years based on a P/S Ratio of 1.00 (NOK\u2019s current P/S ratio is about 1.25).\n\n\u00b7 Tesla's current P/S ratio is 20.18, and Zoom is about 32.72.\n\nI**nstitutional Behavior:**\n\n\u00b7 Pursuant to Nasdaq, (Fintel\u2019s figures are double) which is conservative, in February $NOK had 442 institutional investors, at 4% ownership, and rising... today $NOK has 585 Institutional Holders, holding 6.44% an over 50% increase from February. Also, Nokia has a very high chance of reinstating dividends in 2022, and owning now would lower the cost basis. \n\n\u00b7 Institutional investors including mutual funds (now that $NOK has passed the $5 threshold) are increasing buys of Nokia, and are also anticipating the possibility of reinstated dividends. The mid-point for dividends of tech stocks is 4.75% however, if an investor bust NOK at $5.7 and the price is $11.50 by 2022 and Nokia is paying dividends of 4.75% than that investor is earning 54.6 cents per share, equaling a return of 9.5% on that investors cost basis of $5.7 per share.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Top Institutional Owners](https://preview.redd.it/4whpmr4hy7c71.jpg?width=1700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91516a53368f4b1747d62a839a1846ca6d1fd1f0)\n\n**Some - Highlights of $NOK 5G Contract Gains:**\n\n\u00b7 July 19, 2021: $NOK won its first 5G radio contract in China, securing a share in one of China Mobile's [(0941.HK)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/0941.HK) three new 5G contracts, while Nordic rival Ericsson lost market share after getting caught up in a political spat.\n\n**\u00b7** July 19, 2021: **Nokia extends 5G installed base with Taiwan Star Telecom expansion deal.**\n\n\u00b7 July 19, 2021: Openreach has been ramping up the delivery of ultra-high-speed broadband across the UK as part of the government\u2019s target to offer gigabit connectivity to 85% of the UK.

Its partnership with Nokia and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a key part of this strategy, and has enabled Vodafone to rapidly operationalise use cases such as anomaly detection for efficient operations.\n\n\u00b7 July 16, 2021: The global market for network automation software topped $4.36 billion in 2020 according to a new [Appledore Research report](https://appledoreresearch.com/report/network-automation-software-market-share/). The $NOK ended the year with a 17% share of the market on $758 million in related revenue, followed by [Huawei](https://www.sdxcentral.com/directory/huawei/) with a 12% market share on $544 million in revenue. VMware, by grabbing $379 million in revenue and a 9% market share, indicates that a \u201cstructural transformation has taken place in this market,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\n\u00b7 July 7, 2021: **$**NOK recently announced that it will provide Red Electrica de Espana (REE) with an IP/MPLS network and Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM) optical transport network.\n\n\u00b7 July 1, 2021: Orange tapped Nokia to deploy network slicing in a live private network built for Schneider Electric in France, providing a commercial example of a technology operators expect can help them generate revenue from 5G.\n\nI always look for the big players, and what they are doing with their money.

Amon has helped spearhead Qualcomm's 5G strategy and global markets. Before working at Qualcomm, Amon was the CTO of V\u00e9sper (wireless operator in Brazil). He also worked for NEC and Velocom. Amon has a good track record. He's been in the industry for a long time while holding multiple leadership roles. Qualcomm might be his biggest leadership role yet. I have no doubt that Cristiano Amon will use his prior knowledge to help guide QCOM into a bright future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\tWe've seen tremendous growth across the semiconductor industry over the past two years. The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Disclaimer:*\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice\\*\\**\n\n*\\*\\*Do your own research\\*\\**",

In February of 2021, I furnished a little DD of $NOK with a one-year to 18-month, price target of $14 (possibly with an OTT exuberance at that time). Afterwards, I dug deeper into Nokia, and it continues to be one of the most interesting stocks on the market. (Being an Autistic Silverback looking to buy more crayons to eat, since my wife is too busy with her boyfriend and has no time to make me dinner, I bought in with another large long position in April of 2021 \\[Previously posted on the $NOK subs\\]). I probably have more silver in my hair than the average Redditt Autistic Ape, hence I prefer to be titled Silverback, but I have equal exuberance and love of our communities here.\n\nThere is a lot to look into. . . \"Nokia Bell Labs (formerly named **Bell Labs Innovations** \\- 1996\u20132007) is an American industrial research and scientific development company now owned by the Finnish company Nokia $NOK which itself was established in 1865. Nokia Bell Labs\u2019 headquarters is located in Murray Hill, New Jersey, the company operates several laboratories in the United States and around the world.\" \n\n\u00b7 9 Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories, as well as 4 Turing Awards.\n\n\u00b7 The C Programming Language, as well as Unix was developed at Bell.\n\nWith the 5G/6G arms race heating up, it is time for the 100-year-old Nokia Bell Labs think-tank and 155-year-old $NOK, to be leveraged once more.\n\n(Hard) SPECULATION:\n\n\u00b7 \"Big tech trades human futures\" - Zuboff, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\n\n\u00b7 IMO, modern institutions are very cunning... Everything they do has purpose.\n\n\u00b7 From certain notorious figures in the cryptocurrency community in the previous bull market, I have learned this, and scaled it into larger markets... The behaviors are the same, but even more predictable due to the dominance of algorithmic trading. Just trade \"whale\" for \"institution\".\n\n\u00b7 Nokia is seen in a negative light by retail, and the whole WSB push on January 27, 2021, further weekend $NOK\u2019s image to traditional retail investors. Many investors instantly rejected the notion of learning about this company.\n\n\u00b7 Forgive me if you have disdain for WSB and the \"Robinhood\" investors, but I believe that there is big money behind them... BlackRock , JPM , etc... They are a vehicle for change, and a perfect fall guy for market manipulation.\n\n\u00b7 Some of the DD are likely released by BlackRock themselves... I've seen some of the account's post histories. \"Robinhooders\" are looked down upon, yet under the guise of anonymity, Hedgie\u2019s can release red-herring DD that far exceeds any big-name analyst report? It smells fishy!\n\n\u00b7 Don\u2019t forget what RH did with blocking purchases of BB, GME, AMC and NOK on January 27, 2021. \n\n\u00b7 Announced on July 16, 2021, Robinhood traders who held Gamestop, AMC, Nokia, BlackBerry, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Naked Brands, Koss, or Express stock on January 27, 2021, are encouraged to sign up at [https://clientconnect.labaton.com/case/robinhood-trading-restrictions/](https://pr.report/G7VZYcWN). Labaton Sucharow can analyze your claim and your losses, negotiate with the company, and pursue your claim in arbitration if necessary.\n\n2 Possible threads of speculation:\n\n\u00b7 The outstanding shares of $NOK is 5.6B ... however, with a large float and a high percentage of short interest and public participation even $NOK can be manipulated.\n\n\u00b7 Impulse Wave 1 is often a test pump... To gauge the retail demand levels. Institutions love to do this, and only create a melt up when an ideal motive wave can be created.\n\n\u00b7  However, with $NOK short interest has been dropping, from nearly $300M in January to $150M this month, a 23% drop from last month. Accumulation of Institutional Ownership has ranged from about 4.0% in Q4 2020 to 6.44% in Q2 2021, (double that if one follows Fintel). The Institutional Ownership has increased because of the analyst upgrades and the added possibility of dividends being reinstated. \n\n\"Have you ever wondered how you can enter the world of IoT or meet the increased requirements of the emerging 5G use cases? Are you in need of tools to seize the opportunities of 5G?

It is live today with a truly global footprint but also prepared for the challenges of tomorrow \u2013 no matter what directions it is taking. There is nothing else like WING on the market.\" - Nokia website\n\n\u00b7 At the start of new bubbles, CapEx (Capital Expenditure) for juniors get filled very quickly. If we make a comparison to precious metals miners... this company is a first wave major, not a second wave junior. i.e. in the early stages CapEx is high, and that is why in October of 2019 $NOK suspended dividends to reserve cash for increased spending in RD. Since, 2019 $NOK has made major expenditures in RD.\n\n\u00b7 In November of 2020, Nokia , Elisa and Qualcomm together have achieved the fastest 5G speeds recorded in the world. However, in March of 2021 Nokia achieved a new record of over 4.5 Gbps speed for the first time during a trial on live commercial equipment.\n\n**5G Market:**\n\n5G Applications and Services Market value expected: USD 132B in 2020, to 663B in 2027: The global 5G Applications and Services Market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR ) of \u201c25.8% from 2020 to 2027\" (According to Digital Journal July 14, 2021 Article)\n\nA 25.8% CAGR sounds good to me...\n\nVerticals:\n\n\u00b7 Manufacturing\n\n\u00b7 Energy &amp; Utility\n\n\u00b7 Media &amp; Entertainment\n\n\u00b7 IT &amp; Telecom\n\n\u00b7 Transportation &amp; Logistics\n\n\u00b7 Healthcare\n\n\u00b7 Retail\n\n\u00b7 Agriculture\n\n\u00b7 O&amp;G and Mining\n\n\u00b7 BFSI\n\n\u00b7 Construction\n\n\u00b7 Real Estate\n\n$NOK is listed among in the Article among the 5G Industry Major Market Players.\n\n$NOK offers a service that has unlimited applications...

The technology reached 100 billion dollars in market revenue for the first time in 2017, and forecasts suggest that this figure will grow to around 1.6 trillion by 2025.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 5G/6G is the LIFEBLOOD of IoT .\n\n\u00b7 \"5G is much more than just fast downloads; its unique combination of high-speed connectivity, very low latency, and ubiquitous coverage will support smart vehicles and transport infrastructure such as connected cars, trucks, and buses, where a split-second delay could mean the difference between a smooth flow of traffic and a 4-way crash at an intersection.\"\n\n\u00b7 What is the number 1 problem that EV manufactures wish to solve right now? Completely independent self-driving. 5G/6G is part of the solution! Why is Elon Musk focusing on Starlink now? It is the solution for Tesla's biggest roadblock. Don\u2019t forget, the June 29, 2021 article about Musk and Starlink began \u201cDon Joyce, a **Nokia** manager working from home at a remote lake cottage in Canada, recently abandoned his painfully slow phone-line internet in favor of satellite broadband service Starlink, offered by Elon Musk's SpaceX.\u201d Moreover, Musk said \u201che was talking to possible partners as a number of countries require operators to provide rural coverage as conditions of their 5G licenses.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 5G infrastructures are the neurons for IoT!\n\n\u00b7 5G is huge. It is of UTMOST importance. Why would the US go to such lengths to cripple China's Huawei for YEARS? Huawei seems to be their number 1 target!\n\n**Key contracts and partnerships:**\n\n\u00b7 July 13, 2021: \u201cWe are progressing well with our three-phased plan to achieve sustainable, profitable growth and technology leadership laid out at our Capital Markets Day in March,\u201d said Pekka Lundmark, Nokia president and chief executive officer, in a statement.\n\n\u00b7 The FIRST company contracted to set up internet on the moon. Partnering with SpaceX. \u201cWhy would astronauts on Earth have access to 5G at home, but not have the same access to the same technologies when they are on the Moon?\u201d Thierry Klein, head of Enterprise and Industrial Automation Research Lab at Nokia Bell Labs, is addressing the gap between communication technology on the Moon and technology astronauts have access to on Earth. In October, Nokia was named a NASA partner for its Tipping Point technologies for the Moon program, receiving a $14 million contract to deploy the first LTE /4G communications system on the Moon.\n\n\u00b7 5G/6G will be essential for space travel... Sounds like ARKX will need to look into this one!\n\n\u00b7 Dec. 1, 2020 - Nokia and AT&amp;T extend Worldwide IoT Network Grid (WING) collaboration to deliver seamless IoT connectivity to enterprises around the world, and support upgrades to 5G \"As IoT networks transition to 5G and with Nokia WING also supporting 5G network slicing, AT&amp;T will be able to partition its 5G network into multiple networks that can deliver specific capabilities to its IoT customers and support various use cases.\"\n\n\u00b7 Jan.14, 2021 - Nokia selected for U.S. Federal 5G Cybersecurity Project.\n\n\u00b7 Main collaborator for the Hexa-X 6G European Union Project... \"Being a 2.5-year project within EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 ICT-52 program, Hexa-X is a consortium of 25 key players from adjacent industries and academia. **Nokia** has the overall lead and Ericsson the technical manager role in the project. Hexa-X is a broad collaborative initiative to frame the 6G research agenda and lay the groundwork for a long-term European investment in future wireless network technology.\" - Ericsson's website.\n\n\u00b7 \"Google Cloud and Finland\u2019s Nokia are teaming up to develop cloud-native 5G solutions for communications service providers and enterprise customers, the companies announced in a Thursday (Jan. 14) press release. The companies plan to develop solutions that combine Nokia\u2019s 5G operations and networking capabilities with Google Cloud\u2019s AI, ML and analytics technologies. The solutions will run on Google\u2019s Anthos platform.\" Yes. . . a Google partnership.\n\n**Market Share:**\n\nSources are varying and biased, and there needs to be more rigorous audits in this sector. However, you will get the idea: 5G Hardware Market Share 2020: 1. Huawei - 28%, 2. Nokia - 16%, 3. Ericsson - 14%, but for 2021, $NOK is targeting a 4G and 5G market share **between 25% to 27%** in FY21. On July 16, 2021 ERIC tanked over 11%, due to retaliation for Sweden\u2019s China ban, ERIC had a 28% market share in China, and due to the retaliation, ERIC lost 60% of its market share in China, amounting to $300M. While, NOK only has 1% market share in China, $NOK has no fear of retaliation and only what to gain, particularly since China needs $NOK for its cloud services.  \n\n**$NOK 5G Contracts in last 9-months have more than doubled:**\n\nMoreover, $NOK\u2019s contracts are growing by leaps and bounds. On October 5, 2020 $NOK had secured 100 5G Contracts, but as of today, $NOK\u2019s contracts and market share are way up, $NOK has 170 Commercial 5G Deals, 67 5G Live Operator Networks, 230 Commercial 5G Agreements.\n\n**Patents:**\n\n(The following figures of the following 5g players are very conservative as to $NOK). Investors accumulate shares, Research companies accumulate patents. Those who own the patents are the power brokers in the industry. According to a GreyB total 5G European patents owned and granted as a live-patents as of **June 20, 2020** and those limited to 5G and Standard Essential Patents \u201cSEP\u2019s\u201d:\n\n1. Huawei - 3,007 SEP\u2019s \u2013 530 - Essentiality Ratio: 32% \n\n2. Samsung \u2013 2,317 SEP\u2019s \u2013 374 - Essentiality Ratio: 23% \n\n3. LG \u2013 2,147 SEP\u2019s \u2013 323 - Essentiality Ratio: 20% \n\n4. Nokia - 2,047 SEP\u2019s \u2013 421 - Essentiality **Ratio: 27%** and the highest percentage of granted patents at 76%. \n\n5. Ericsson \u2013 1,678 SEP\u2019s \u2013 230 - Essentiality Ratio: 24% \n\n6. Qualcomm \u2013 1,125 SEP\u2019s \u2013 219 - Essentiality Ratio: 29% \n\n**$NOK is the leader in SEP\u2019s:**\n\nThe argument is that SEP ownership... materially, affects which patents actually matter, and as of **April 28, 2021**, and independent study by PA Consulting firms confined that Nokia owns over 3,500 patent families declared essential to 5G. As such, $NOK is now the leader in SEP\u2019s. \u201cNokia\u2019s industry-leading patent portfolio is built on more than \u20ac130 billion invested in R&amp;D since 2000 and is composed of around 20,000 patent families, including over 3,500 patent families declared essential to 5G.\u201d\n\n$NOK President and CEO Pekka Lundmark has been leading $NOK since August 1, 2021,he has been steady, understated and rather than exaggerate $NOK\u2019s position he has delivered an earnings beat for Q1 FY21 and is expected to do the same on Q2 FY21 on July 29, 2021. He has avoided money pits and has helped $NOK grab market share and profitable 5G contracts. \n\nCompare $NOK to Ericsson through March 21, 2021 and Market Cap and contracts to date:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Nokia** revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2021      was **$6.120B**, a **12.91% increase** year-over-year.\n* **Nokia** revenue for the twelve      months ending March 31, 2021 was **$25.661B**, a **0.61% decline** year-over-year.\n* **Nokia** 5G Contracts: 170 Commercial 5G      Deals, 67 5G Live Operator Networks, 230 Commercial 5G Agreements.\n* **Nokia \u2013** MC 32.20B, price $5.56 up 26.25% over last year.\n* **Ericsson** revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2021      was **$5.934B**, a **15.12% increase** year-over-year.\n* **Ericsson** revenue for the twelve months ending March 31, 2021      was **$26.110B**, a **9.44% increase** year-over-year.\n* **Ericsson** 5G      Contracts: 143 Commercial 5G agreements, 93 Live 5G Networks, 81 Publicly announced 5G      contracts.\n* **Ericsson \u2013** MC 38.50B, price $11.61 up 4.52% over last year.\n\nClearly, $NOK and Ericsson are converging, $NOK is gaining market share, has more 5G contracts, SEP\u2019s, cash surplus and Ericson investors are jumping over to $NOK. Don\u2019t forget Ericsson settled with $NOK regarding patent litigation and has to pay $NOK damages. Ericsson said the settlement followed investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) into corruption, including the bribing of government officials. Ericsson settled with the DOJ in 2019 and agreed to pay over $1 billion in penalties.\n\n$NOK is successful in its Patent Litigation.\n\nOn April of 2021, after $NOK received several favorable rulings Nokia and Lenovo settled a patent dispute, in May of 2021 Ericson settled with $NOK and agreed to pay $NOK 97M Euro, in June of 2021 Daimler agreed to pay Nokia for using its patents and Nokia will license mobile telecommunications technology to Daimler, in July $NOK launched patent lawsuits against OnePlus Technology, throughout Europe and Asia.  \n\n**$NOK upgraded by analysts across the board:**\n\n\u00b7 On July 5, 2021, Exane BNP Paribas analyst Stefan Slowinski upgraded $NOK to Outperform from Neutral with a **$7.70** price target.\n\n\u00b7 On July 15, 2021, Goldman Sachs analyst Alexander Duval upgraded $NOK from neutral to buy and raised his price target from $4.90 to **$6.50**.\n\n\u00b7 On July 14, 2021, JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande, upgrading Nokia to Overweight, and a **$7.80** price target. That's 32% upside from the previous day\u2019s close of $5.88.\n\n\u00b7 Part of the analyst upgrade is because on July 13, 2021 $NOK updated its financial guidance for full year 2021. In the second quarter Nokia saw continued strength in the business, improving its expectations for the full year. Nokia now expects to revise upwards its prior outlook ranges for 2021. Nokia plans to provide full details on its second quarter and half-year financial performance and revised full year 2021 guidance on 29 July 2021.\n\n**A quick calculation of Value metrics from February 2021 to July 16, 2021:**\n\n\u00b7 Current Mcap: As of February, 23.35B as of today 32.4B.\n\n\u00b7 In February $NOK had a 16% market share, today $NOK has about a 25% market share, and using that figure (which will probably grow) 25% of 663B in 2027... market size refers to the maximum total number of sales or customers your business can see, often measured over the course of a year.\n\n\u00b7 663B x 0.25 = 165B Revenue, assuming Revenue = Sales for now, 165B/5B shares = 33 SPS. Assuming P/S Ratio of 1, Market Value per Share = $33.00 USD by 2027.\n\n\u00b7 Current price = $5.70, 33/5.7 = 5.80, so a 580% gain in 6 years based on a P/S Ratio of 1.00 (NOK\u2019s current P/S ratio is about 1.25).\n\n\u00b7 Tesla's current P/S ratio is 20.18, and Zoom is about 32.72.\n\nI**nstitutional Behavior:**\n\n\u00b7 Pursuant to Nasdaq, (Fintel\u2019s figures are double) which is conservative, in February $NOK had 442 institutional investors, at 4% ownership, and rising... today $NOK has 585 Institutional Holders, holding 6.44% an over 50% increase from February. Also, Nokia has a very high chance of reinstating dividends in 2022, and owning now would lower the cost basis. \n\n\u00b7 Institutional investors including mutual funds (now that $NOK has passed the $5 threshold) are increasing buys of Nokia, and are also anticipating the possibility of reinstated dividends. The mid-point for dividends of tech stocks is 4.75% however, if an investor bust NOK at $5.7 and the price is $11.50 by 2022 and Nokia is paying dividends of 4.75% than that investor is earning 54.6 cents per share, equaling a return of 9.5% on that investors cost basis of $5.7 per share.  \n\n $NOK has gained many new Institutional Holders (that are not shorting).\n\n**Some - Highlights of $NOK 5G Contract Gains:**\n\n\u00b7 July 19, 2021: $NOK won its first 5G radio contract in China, securing a share in one of China Mobile's [(0941.HK)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/0941.HK) three new 5G contracts, while Nordic rival Ericsson lost market share after getting caught up in a political spat.\n\n**\u00b7** July 19, 2021: **Nokia extends 5G installed base with Taiwan Star Telecom expansion deal.**\n\n\u00b7 July 19, 2021: Openreach has been ramping up the delivery of ultra-high-speed broadband across the UK as part of the government\u2019s target to offer gigabit connectivity to 85% of the UK.

Its partnership with Nokia and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a key part of this strategy, and has enabled Vodafone to rapidly operationalise use cases such as anomaly detection for efficient operations.\n\n\u00b7 July 16, 2021: The global market for network automation software topped $4.36 billion in 2020 according to a new [Appledore Research report](https://appledoreresearch.com/report/network-automation-software-market-share/). The $NOK ended the year with a 17% share of the market on $758 million in related revenue, followed by [Huawei](https://www.sdxcentral.com/directory/huawei/) with a 12% market share on $544 million in revenue. VMware, by grabbing $379 million in revenue and a 9% market share, indicates that a \u201cstructural transformation has taken place in this market,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\n\u00b7 July 7, 2021: **$**NOK recently announced that it will provide Red Electrica de Espana (REE) with an IP/MPLS network and Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM) optical transport network.\n\n\u00b7 July 1, 2021: Orange tapped Nokia to deploy network slicing in a live private network built for Schneider Electric in France, providing a commercial example of a technology operators expect can help them generate revenue from 5G.\n\nI always look for the big players, and what they are doing with their money.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 22, 2021**\n\nStocks edged higher today in a very volatile session, with the three main indexes (S&amp;P 500 (SPY), Nasdaq (QQQ), Dow Jones (DIA) falling at open before reversing to the upside mid-session, a sign that market participants remain eager to buy up any dip. On the other hand, the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, broke its two day rally, trading 1.75% lower at the time of writing. Market participants continue to weight a variety of factors, including but not limited to: (1) faster-than-expected pace of economic recovery, (2) surging corporate earnings, (3) potential inflationary pressures, (4) labor market imbalances, and (5) concerns surrounding the coronavirus delta variant. Basically, the market is balancing between expectations for rapid economic expansion moving forward and concerns surrounding inflation and the delta variant.\n\nToday, the Labor Department released the Weekly Unemployment report, which unfortunately, showed an unexpected rise in new jobless claims filed. New jobless claims jumped to 419,000, well above consensus estimates of 360,000 and a sharp jump from the previous week, which showed pandemic-era lows in claims filed. Since the beginning of the pandemic, market participants have closely tracked these numbers in order to gauge the health of the labor market. However, with rising infections threatening to trigger new restrictions, labor market reports have taken on more importance than usual.\n\nIn the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 32,300 on July 18, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, as I said yesterday, it is important to understand that the rising infections are broadly concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, \u201cThere is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.\u201d Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.\n\nIn other news, Q2 earnings season continues full steam ahead, with the quarter shaping up to be another record-setting one. Earnings are expected to be super-charged by higher than expected demand from savings-laden consumers as the economy reopens. While concerns around the delta variant have put a damper on sentiment, reports by companies have not reflected any slowdown in growth. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data \u2013 an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be \"need to be revised higher.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Twitter (TWTR) skyrocketed after-hours after the company reported better than expected earnings and raised guidance moving forward.\n* Shares of Domino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ) skyrocketed after smashing earnings estimates and announcing a new share buyback program\n* US Senators introduced a bill that would amend Section 230, the well-known law that gives social media companies immunity from what users post on their platform, to hold companies liable for health-related misinformation.\n* Websites of several airlines, banks and technology companies, including Amazon's AWS, Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Express (AXP), were facing outages, according to DownDetector. So far, I\u2019ve been unable to find the cause.\n* Bank of America (BAC) on Wednesday said its board approved a 17% increase to the company's quarterly cash dividend.\n* U antitrust regulators are set to give unconditional approval to Irish aircraft leasing company AerCap's (AER) $30 billion bid for General Electric's (GE) aircraft leasing business, three people familiar with the matter said.\n* Ford (F), startup Argo AI, and Lyft (LYFT) are reportedly working together to launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in Miami, Florida and Austin, Texas later this year.

In February of 2021, I furnished a little DD of $NOK with a one-year to 18-month, price target of $14 (possibly with an OTT exuberance at that time). Afterwards, I dug deeper into Nokia, and it continues to be one of the most interesting stocks on the market. (Being an Autistic Silverback looking to buy more crayons to eat, since my wife is too busy with her boyfriend and has no time to make me dinner, I bought in with another large long position in April of 2021 \\[Previously posted on the $NOK subs\\]). I probably have more silver in my hair than the average Redditt Autistic Ape, hence I prefer to be titled Silverback, but I have equal exuberance and love of our communities here.\n\nThere is a lot to look into. . . \"Nokia Bell Labs (formerly named **Bell Labs Innovations** \\- 1996\u20132007) is an American industrial research and scientific development company now owned by the Finnish company Nokia $NOK which itself was established in 1865.

Everything they do has purpose.\n\n\u00b7 From certain notorious figures in the cryptocurrency community in the previous bull market, I have learned this, and scaled it into larger markets... The behaviors are the same, but even more predictable due to the dominance of algorithmic trading. Just trade \"whale\" for \"institution\".\n\n\u00b7 Nokia is seen in a negative light by retail, and the whole WSB push on January 27, 2021, further weekend $NOK\u2019s image to traditional retail investors. Many investors instantly rejected the notion of learning about this company.\n\n\u00b7 Forgive me if you have disdain for WSB and the \"Robinhood\" investors, but I believe that there is big money behind them... BlackRock , JPM , etc... They are a vehicle for change, and a perfect fall guy for market manipulation.\n\n\u00b7 Some of the DD are likely released by BlackRock themselves... I've seen some of the account's post histories. \"Robinhooders\" are looked down upon, yet under the guise of anonymity, Hedgie\u2019s can release red-herring DD that far exceeds any big-name analyst report? It smells fishy!\n\n\u00b7 Don\u2019t forget what RH did with blocking purchases of BB, GME, AMC and NOK on January 27, 2021. \n\n\u00b7 Announced on July 16, 2021, Robinhood traders who held Gamestop, AMC, Nokia, BlackBerry, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Naked Brands, Koss, or Express stock on January 27, 2021, are encouraged to sign up at [https://clientconnect.labaton.com/case/robinhood-trading-restrictions/](https://pr.report/G7VZYcWN). Labaton Sucharow can analyze your claim and your losses, negotiate with the company, and pursue your claim in arbitration if necessary.\n\n2 Possible threads of speculation:\n\n\u00b7 The outstanding shares of $NOK is 5.6B ... however, with a large float and a high percentage of short interest and public participation even $NOK can be manipulated.\n\n\u00b7 Impulse Wave 1 is often a test pump... To gauge the retail demand levels. Institutions love to do this, and only create a melt up when an ideal motive wave can be created.\n\n\u00b7  However, with $NOK short interest has been dropping, from nearly $300M in January to $150M this month, a 23% drop from last month. Accumulation of Institutional Ownership has ranged from about 4.0% in Q4 2020 to 6.44% in Q2 2021, (double that if one follows Fintel). The Institutional Ownership has increased because of the analyst upgrades and the added possibility of dividends being reinstated. \n\n  \n\n\"Have you ever wondered how you can enter the world of IoT or meet the increased requirements of the emerging 5G use cases? Are you in need of tools to seize the opportunities of 5G? Would you prefer to win new revenue with low risk and minimal investment, instead of spending CAPEX and time building an IoT network and developing new services?\u201d\n\n\u201cWelcome to Nokia WING, a managed service that offers operators the ability to support their enterprise customers with global IoT connectivity across borders and technologies. It is live today with a truly global footprint but also prepared for the challenges of tomorrow \u2013 no matter what directions it is taking. There is nothing else like WING on the market.\" - Nokia website\n\n\u00b7 At the start of new bubbles, CapEx (Capital Expenditure) for juniors get filled very quickly. If we make a comparison to precious metals miners... this company is a first wave major, not a second wave junior. i.e. in the early stages CapEx is high, and that is why in October of 2019 $NOK suspended dividends to reserve cash for increased spending in RD. Since, 2019 $NOK has made major expenditures in RD.\n\n\u00b7 In November of 2020, Nokia , Elisa and Qualcomm together have achieved the fastest 5G speeds recorded in the world. However, in March of 2021 Nokia achieved a new record of over 4.5 Gbps speed for the first time during a trial on live commercial equipment.\n\n**5G Market:**\n\n5G Applications and Services Market value expected: USD 132B in 2020, to 663B in 2027: The global 5G Applications and Services Market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR ) of \u201c25.8% from 2020 to 2027\" (According to Digital Journal July 14, 2021 Article)\n\nA 25.8% CAGR sounds good to me...\n\nVerticals:\n\n\u00b7 Manufacturing\n\n\u00b7 Energy &amp; Utility\n\n\u00b7 Media &amp; Entertainment\n\n\u00b7 IT &amp; Telecom\n\n\u00b7 Transportation &amp; Logistics\n\n\u00b7 Healthcare\n\n\u00b7 Retail\n\n\u00b7 Agriculture\n\n\u00b7 O&amp;G and Mining\n\n\u00b7 BFSI\n\n\u00b7 Construction\n\n\u00b7 Real Estate\n\n$NOK is listed among in the Article among the 5G Industry Major Market Players.\n\n$NOK offers a service that has unlimited applications... My favorite type of technology!\n\n\u00b7 According to Statista \u201cThe global market for Internet of things ( IoT ) end-user solutions is expected to grow to 212 billion U.S. dollars in size by the end of 2019. The technology reached 100 billion dollars in market revenue for the first time in 2017, and forecasts suggest that this figure will grow to around 1.6 trillion by 2025.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 5G/6G is the LIFEBLOOD of IoT .\n\n\u00b7 \"5G is much more than just fast downloads; its unique combination of high-speed connectivity, very low latency, and ubiquitous coverage will support smart vehicles and transport infrastructure such as connected cars, trucks, and buses, where a split-second delay could mean the difference between a smooth flow of traffic and a 4-way crash at an intersection.\"\n\n\u00b7 What is the number 1 problem that EV manufactures wish to solve right now? Completely independent self-driving. 5G/6G is part of the solution! Why is Elon Musk focusing on Starlink now? It is the solution for Tesla's biggest roadblock. Don\u2019t forget, the June 29, 2021 article about Musk and Starlink began \u201cDon Joyce, a **Nokia** manager working from home at a remote lake cottage in Canada, recently abandoned his painfully slow phone-line internet in favor of satellite broadband service Starlink, offered by Elon Musk's SpaceX.\u201d Moreover, Musk said \u201che was talking to possible partners as a number of countries require operators to provide rural coverage as conditions of their 5G licenses.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 5G infrastructures are the neurons for IoT!\n\n\u00b7 5G is huge. It is of UTMOST importance. Why would the US go to such lengths to cripple China's Huawei for YEARS? Huawei seems to be their number 1 target!\n\n**Key contracts and partnerships:**\n\n\u00b7 July 13, 2021: \u201cWe are progressing well with our three-phased plan to achieve sustainable, profitable growth and technology leadership laid out at our Capital Markets Day in March,\u201d said Pekka Lundmark, Nokia president and chief executive officer, in a statement.\n\n\u00b7 The FIRST company contracted to set up internet on the moon. Partnering with SpaceX. \u201cWhy would astronauts on Earth have access to 5G at home, but not have the same access to the same technologies when they are on the Moon?\u201d Thierry Klein, head of Enterprise and Industrial Automation Research Lab at Nokia Bell Labs, is addressing the gap between communication technology on the Moon and technology astronauts have access to on Earth. In October, Nokia was named a NASA partner for its Tipping Point technologies for the Moon program, receiving a $14 million contract to deploy the first LTE /4G communications system on the Moon.\n\n\u00b7 5G/6G will be essential for space travel... Sounds like ARKX will need to look into this one!\n\n\u00b7 Dec. 1, 2020 - Nokia and AT&amp;T extend Worldwide IoT Network Grid (WING) collaboration to deliver seamless IoT connectivity to enterprises around the world, and support upgrades to 5G \"As IoT networks transition to 5G and with Nokia WING also supporting 5G network slicing, AT&amp;T will be able to partition its 5G network into multiple networks that can deliver specific capabilities to its IoT customers and support various use cases.\"\n\n\u00b7 Jan.14, 2021 - Nokia selected for U.S. Federal 5G Cybersecurity Project.\n\n\u00b7 Main collaborator for the Hexa-X 6G European Union Project... \"Being a 2.5-year project within EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 ICT-52 program, Hexa-X is a consortium of 25 key players from adjacent industries and academia. **Nokia** has the overall lead and Ericsson the technical manager role in the project. Hexa-X is a broad collaborative initiative to frame the 6G research agenda and lay the groundwork for a long-term European investment in future wireless network technology.\" - Ericsson's website.\n\n\u00b7 \"Google Cloud and Finland\u2019s Nokia are teaming up to develop cloud-native 5G solutions for communications service providers and enterprise customers, the companies announced in a Thursday (Jan. 14) press release. The companies plan to develop solutions that combine Nokia\u2019s 5G operations and networking capabilities with Google Cloud\u2019s AI, ML and analytics technologies. The solutions will run on Google\u2019s Anthos platform.\" Yes. . . a Google partnership.\n\n**Market Share:**\n\nSources are varying and biased, and there needs to be more rigorous audits in this sector. However, you will get the idea: 5G Hardware Market Share 2020: 1. Huawei - 28%, 2. Nokia - 16%, 3. Ericsson - 14%, but for 2021, $NOK is targeting a 4G and 5G market share **between 25% to 27%** in FY21. On July 16, 2021 ERIC tanked over 11%, due to retaliation for Sweden\u2019s China ban, ERIC had a 28% market share in China, and due to the retaliation, ERIC lost 60% of its market share in China, amounting to $300M. While, NOK only has 1% market share in China, $NOK has no fear of retaliation and only what to gain, particularly since China needs $NOK for its cloud services.  \n\n**$NOK 5G Contracts in last 9-months have more than doubled:**\n\nMoreover, $NOK\u2019s contracts are growing by leaps and bounds. On October 5, 2020 $NOK had secured 100 5G Contracts, but as of today, $NOK\u2019s contracts and market share are way up, $NOK has 170 Commercial 5G Deals, 67 5G Live Operator Networks, 230 Commercial 5G Agreements.\n\n**Patents:**\n\n(The following figures of the following 5g players are very conservative as to $NOK). Investors accumulate shares, Research companies accumulate patents. Those who own the patents are the power brokers in the industry. According to a GreyB total 5G European patents owned and granted as a live-patents as of **June 20, 2020** and those limited to 5G and Standard Essential Patents \u201cSEP\u2019s\u201d:\n\n1. Huawei - 3,007 SEP\u2019s \u2013 530 - Essentiality Ratio: 32% \n\n2. Samsung \u2013 2,317 SEP\u2019s \u2013 374 - Essentiality Ratio: 23% \n\n3. LG \u2013 2,147 SEP\u2019s \u2013 323 - Essentiality Ratio: 20% \n\n4. Nokia - 2,047 SEP\u2019s \u2013 421 - Essentiality **Ratio: 27%** and the highest percentage of granted patents at 76%. \n\n5. Ericsson \u2013 1,678 SEP\u2019s \u2013 230 - Essentiality Ratio: 24% \n\n6. Qualcomm \u2013 1,125 SEP\u2019s \u2013 219 - Essentiality Ratio: 29% \n\n**$NOK is the leader in SEP\u2019s:**\n\nThe argument is that SEP ownership... materially, affects which patents actually matter, and as of **April 28, 2021**, and independent study by PA Consulting firms confined that Nokia owns over 3,500 patent families declared essential to 5G. As such, $NOK is now the leader in SEP\u2019s. \u201cNokia\u2019s industry-leading patent portfolio is built on more than \u20ac130 billion invested in R&amp;D since 2000 and is composed of around 20,000 patent families, including over 3,500 patent families declared essential to 5G.\u201d\n\n$NOK President and CEO Pekka Lundmark has been leading $NOK since August 1, 2021,he has been steady, understated and rather than exaggerate $NOK\u2019s position he has delivered an earnings beat for Q1 FY21 and is expected to do the same on Q2 FY21 on July 29, 2021. He has avoided money pits and has helped $NOK grab market share and profitable 5G contracts. \n\nCompare $NOK to Ericsson through March 21, 2021 and Market Cap and contracts to date:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Nokia** revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2021      was **$6.120B**, a **12.91% increase** year-over-year.\n* **Nokia** revenue for the twelve      months ending March 31, 2021 was **$25.661B**, a **0.61% decline** year-over-year.\n* **Nokia** 5G Contracts: 170 Commercial 5G      Deals, 67 5G Live Operator Networks, 230 Commercial 5G Agreements.\n* **Nokia \u2013** MC 32.20B, price $5.56 up 26.25% over last year.\n* **Ericsson** revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2021      was **$5.934B**, a **15.12% increase** year-over-year.\n* **Ericsson** revenue for the twelve months ending March 31, 2021      was **$26.110B**, a **9.44% increase** year-over-year.\n* **Ericsson** 5G      Contracts: 143 Commercial 5G agreements, 93 Live 5G Networks, 81 Publicly announced 5G      contracts.\n* **Ericsson \u2013** MC 38.50B, price $11.61 up 4.52% over last year.\n\nClearly, $NOK and Ericsson are converging, $NOK is gaining market share, has more 5G contracts, SEP\u2019s, cash surplus and Ericson investors are jumping over to $NOK. Don\u2019t forget Ericsson settled with $NOK regarding patent litigation and has to pay $NOK damages. Ericsson said the settlement followed investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) into corruption, including the bribing of government officials. Ericsson settled with the DOJ in 2019 and agreed to pay over $1 billion in penalties.\n\n$NOK is successful in its Patent Litigation.\n\nOn April of 2021, after $NOK received several favorable rulings Nokia and Lenovo settled a patent dispute, in May of 2021 Ericson settled with $NOK and agreed to pay $NOK 97M Euro, in June of 2021 Daimler agreed to pay Nokia for using its patents and Nokia will license mobile telecommunications technology to Daimler, in July $NOK launched patent lawsuits against OnePlus Technology, throughout Europe and Asia.  \n\n**$NOK upgraded by analysts across the board:**\n\n\u00b7 On July 5, 2021, Exane BNP Paribas analyst Stefan Slowinski upgraded $NOK to Outperform from Neutral with a **$7.70** price target.\n\n\u00b7 On July 15, 2021, Goldman Sachs analyst Alexander Duval upgraded $NOK from neutral to buy and raised his price target from $4.90 to **$6.50**.\n\n\u00b7 On July 14, 2021, JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande, upgrading Nokia to Overweight, and a **$7.80** price target. That's 32% upside from the previous day\u2019s close of $5.88.\n\n\u00b7 Part of the analyst upgrade is because on July 13, 2021 $NOK updated its financial guidance for full year 2021. In the second quarter Nokia saw continued strength in the business, improving its expectations for the full year. Nokia now expects to revise upwards its prior outlook ranges for 2021. Nokia plans to provide full details on its second quarter and half-year financial performance and revised full year 2021 guidance on 29 July 2021.\n\n**A quick calculation of Value metrics from February 2021 to July 16, 2021:**\n\n\u00b7 Current Mcap: As of February, 23.35B as of today 32.4B.\n\n\u00b7 In February $NOK had a 16% market share, today $NOK has about a 25% market share, and using that figure (which will probably grow) 25% of 663B in 2027... market size refers to the maximum total number of sales or customers your business can see, often measured over the course of a year.\n\n\u00b7 663B x 0.25 = 165B Revenue, assuming Revenue = Sales for now, 165B/5B shares = 33 SPS. Assuming P/S Ratio of 1, Market Value per Share = $33.00 USD by 2027.\n\n\u00b7 Current price = $5.70, 33/5.7 = 5.80, so a 580% gain in 6 years based on a P/S Ratio of 1.00 (NOK\u2019s current P/S ratio is about 1.25).\n\n\u00b7 Tesla's current P/S ratio is 20.18, and Zoom is about 32.72.\n\nI**nstitutional Behavior:**\n\n\u00b7 Pursuant to Nasdaq, (Fintel\u2019s figures are double) which is conservative, in February $NOK had 442 institutional investors, at 4% ownership, and rising... today $NOK has 585 Institutional Holders, holding 6.44% an over 50% increase from February. Also, Nokia has a very high chance of reinstating dividends in 2022, and owning now would lower the cost basis. \n\n\u00b7 Institutional investors including mutual funds (now that $NOK has passed the $5 threshold) are increasing buys of Nokia, and are also anticipating the possibility of reinstated dividends. The mid-point for dividends of tech stocks is 4.75% however, if an investor bust NOK at $5.7 and the price is $11.50 by 2022 and Nokia is paying dividends of 4.75% than that investor is earning 54.6 cents per share, equaling a return of 9.5% on that investors cost basis of $5.7 per share.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sxiwi5bkm7c71.jpg?width=1700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5892f2b8b6e9e8b0518c23b6df566b78be751e0e\n\n**Some - Highlights of $NOK 5G Contract Gains:**\n\n\u00b7 July 19, 2021: $NOK won its first 5G radio contract in China, securing a share in one of China Mobile's [(0941.HK)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/0941.HK) three new 5G contracts, while Nordic rival Ericsson lost market share after getting caught up in a political spat.\n\n**\u00b7** July 19, 2021: **Nokia extends 5G installed base with Taiwan Star Telecom expansion deal.**\n\n\u00b7 July 19, 2021: Openreach has been ramping up the delivery of ultra-high-speed broadband across the UK as part of the government\u2019s target to offer gigabit connectivity to 85% of the UK.

Its partnership with Nokia and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a key part of this strategy, and has enabled Vodafone to rapidly operationalise use cases such as anomaly detection for efficient operations.\n\n\u00b7 July 16, 2021: The global market for network automation software topped $4.36 billion in 2020 according to a new [Appledore Research report](https://appledoreresearch.com/report/network-automation-software-market-share/). The $NOK ended the year with a 17% share of the market on $758 million in related revenue, followed by [Huawei](https://www.sdxcentral.com/directory/huawei/) with a 12% market share on $544 million in revenue. VMware, by grabbing $379 million in revenue and a 9% market share, indicates that a \u201cstructural transformation has taken place in this market,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\n\u00b7 July 7, 2021: **$**NOK recently announced that it will provide Red Electrica de Espana (REE) with an IP/MPLS network and Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM) optical transport network.\n\n\u00b7 July 1, 2021: Orange tapped Nokia to deploy network slicing in a live private network built for Schneider Electric in France, providing a commercial example of a technology operators expect can help them generate revenue from 5G.\n\nI always look for the big players, and what they are doing with their money.

        "selftext": "  \n\nI entered a large long position on October 20, 2019, based on momentum, their flashy NASA 5G contract, US government 5G cybersecurity contract, and NOK\u2019s growing 5G market share. In February of 2021, I furnished a little DD of $NOK with a one-year to 18-month, price target of $14 (possibly with an OTT exuberance at that time). Afterwards, I dug deeper into Nokia, and it continues to be one of the most interesting stocks on the market. (Being an Autistic Silverback looking to buy more crayons to eat, since my wife is too busy with her boyfriend and has no time to make me dinner, I bought in with another large long position in April of 2021 \\[Previously posted on the $NOK subs\\]). I probably have more silver in my hair than the average Redditt Autistic Ape, hence I prefer to be titled Silverback, but I have equal exuberance and love of our communities here.\n\nThere is a lot to look into. . . \"Nokia Bell Labs (formerly named **Bell Labs Innovations** \\- 1996\u20132007) is an American industrial research and scientific development company now owned by the Finnish company Nokia $NOK which itself was established in 1865. Nokia Bell Labs\u2019 headquarters is located in Murray Hill, New Jersey, the company operates several laboratories in the United States and around the world.\" \n\n\u00b7 9 Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories, as well as 4 Turing Awards.\n\n\u00b7 The C Programming Language, as well as Unix was developed at Bell.\n\nWith the 5G/6G arms race heating up, it is time for the 100-year-old Nokia Bell Labs think-tank and 155-year-old $NOK, to be leveraged once more.\n\n(Hard) SPECULATION:\n\n\u00b7 \"Big tech trades human futures\" - Zuboff, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\n\n\u00b7 IMO, modern institutions are very cunning... Everything they do has purpose.\n\n\u00b7 From certain notorious figures in the cryptocurrency community in the previous bull market, I have learned this, and scaled it into larger markets... The behaviors are the same, but even more predictable due to the dominance of algorithmic trading. Just trade \"whale\" for \"institution\".\n\n\u00b7 Nokia is seen in a negative light by retail, and the whole WSB push on January 27, 2021, further weekend $NOK\u2019s image to traditional retail investors. Many investors instantly rejected the notion of learning about this company.\n\n\u00b7 Forgive me if you have disdain for WSB and the \"Robinhood\" investors, but I believe that there is big money behind them... BlackRock , JPM , etc... They are a vehicle for change, and a perfect fall guy for market manipulation.\n\n\u00b7 Some of the DD are likely released by BlackRock themselves... I've seen some of the account's post histories. \"Robinhooders\" are looked down upon, yet under the guise of anonymity, Hedgie\u2019s can release red-herring DD that far exceeds any big-name analyst report? It smells fishy!\n\n\u00b7 Don\u2019t forget what RH did with blocking purchases of BB, GME, AMC and NOK on January 27, 2021. \n\n\u00b7 Announced on July 16, 2021, Robinhood traders who held Gamestop, AMC, Nokia, BlackBerry, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Naked Brands, Koss, or Express stock on January 27, 2021, are encouraged to sign up at [https://clientconnect.labaton.com/case/robinhood-trading-restrictions/](https://pr.report/G7VZYcWN). Labaton Sucharow can analyze your claim and your losses, negotiate with the company, and pursue your claim in arbitration if necessary.\n\n2 Possible threads of speculation:\n\n\u00b7 The outstanding shares of $NOK is 5.6B ... however, with a large float and a high percentage of short interest and public participation even $NOK can be manipulated.\n\n\u00b7 Impulse Wave 1 is often a test pump... To gauge the retail demand levels. Institutions love to do this, and only create a melt up when an ideal motive wave can be created.\n\n\u00b7  However, with $NOK short interest has been dropping, from nearly $300M in January to $150M this month, a 23% drop from last month. Accumulation of Institutional Ownership has ranged from about 4.0% in Q4 2020 to 6.44% in Q2 2021, (double that if one follows Fintel). The Institutional Ownership has increased because of the analyst upgrades and the added possibility of dividends being reinstated. \n\n\"Have you ever wondered how you can enter the world of IoT or meet the increased requirements of the emerging 5G use cases? Are you in need of tools to seize the opportunities of 5G? Would you prefer to win new revenue with low risk and minimal investment, instead of spending CAPEX and time building an IoT network and developing new services?\u201d\n\n\u201cWelcome to Nokia WING, a managed service that offers operators the ability to support their enterprise customers with global IoT connectivity across borders and technologies. It is live today with a truly global footprint but also prepared for the challenges of tomorrow \u2013 no matter what directions it is taking. There is nothing else like WING on the market.\" - Nokia website\n\n\u00b7 At the start of new bubbles, CapEx (Capital Expenditure) for juniors get filled very quickly. If we make a comparison to precious metals miners... this company is a first wave major, not a second wave junior. i.e. in the early stages CapEx is high, and that is why in October of 2019 $NOK suspended dividends to reserve cash for increased spending in RD. Since, 2019 $NOK has made major expenditures in RD.\n\n\u00b7 In November of 2020, Nokia , Elisa and Qualcomm together have achieved the fastest 5G speeds recorded in the world. However, in March of 2021 Nokia achieved a new record of over 4.5 Gbps speed for the first time during a trial on live commercial equipment.\n\n**5G Market:**\n\n5G Applications and Services Market value expected: USD 132B in 2020, to 663B in 2027: The global 5G Applications and Services Market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR ) of \u201c25.8% from 2020 to 2027\" (According to Digital Journal July 14, 2021 Article)\n\nA 25.8% CAGR sounds good to me...\n\nVerticals:\n\n\u00b7 Manufacturing\n\n\u00b7 Energy &amp; Utility\n\n\u00b7 Media &amp; Entertainment\n\n\u00b7 IT &amp; Telecom\n\n\u00b7 Transportation &amp; Logistics\n\n\u00b7 Healthcare\n\n\u00b7 Retail\n\n\u00b7 Agriculture\n\n\u00b7 O&amp;G and Mining\n\n\u00b7 BFSI\n\n\u00b7 Construction\n\n\u00b7 Real Estate\n\n$NOK is listed among in the Article among the 5G Industry Major Market Players.\n\n$NOK offers a service that has unlimited applications... My favorite type of technology!\n\n\u00b7 According to Statista \u201cThe global market for Internet of things ( IoT ) end-user solutions is expected to grow to 212 billion U.S. dollars in size by the end of 2019. The technology reached 100 billion dollars in market revenue for the first time in 2017, and forecasts suggest that this figure will grow to around 1.6 trillion by 2025.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 5G/6G is the LIFEBLOOD of IoT .\n\n\u00b7 \"5G is much more than just fast downloads; its unique combination of high-speed connectivity, very low latency, and ubiquitous coverage will support smart vehicles and transport infrastructure such as connected cars, trucks, and buses, where a split-second delay could mean the difference between a smooth flow of traffic and a 4-way crash at an intersection.\"\n\n\u00b7 What is the number 1 problem that EV manufactures wish to solve right now? Completely independent self-driving. 5G/6G is part of the solution! Why is Elon Musk focusing on Starlink now? It is the solution for Tesla's biggest roadblock. Don\u2019t forget, the June 29, 2021 article about Musk and Starlink began \u201cDon Joyce, a **Nokia** manager working from home at a remote lake cottage in Canada, recently abandoned his painfully slow phone-line internet in favor of satellite broadband service Starlink, offered by Elon Musk's SpaceX.\u201d Moreover, Musk said \u201che was talking to possible partners as a number of countries require operators to provide rural coverage as conditions of their 5G licenses.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 5G infrastructures are the neurons for IoT!\n\n\u00b7 5G is huge. It is of UTMOST importance. Why would the US go to such lengths to cripple China's Huawei for YEARS? Huawei seems to be their number 1 target!\n\n**Key contracts and partnerships:**\n\n\u00b7 July 13, 2021: \u201cWe are progressing well with our three-phased plan to achieve sustainable, profitable growth and technology leadership laid out at our Capital Markets Day in March,\u201d said Pekka Lundmark, Nokia president and chief executive officer, in a statement.\n\n\u00b7 The FIRST company contracted to set up internet on the moon. Partnering with SpaceX. \u201cWhy would astronauts on Earth have access to 5G at home, but not have the same access to the same technologies when they are on the Moon?\u201d Thierry Klein, head of Enterprise and Industrial Automation Research Lab at Nokia Bell Labs, is addressing the gap between communication technology on the Moon and technology astronauts have access to on Earth. In October, Nokia was named a NASA partner for its Tipping Point technologies for the Moon program, receiving a $14 million contract to deploy the first LTE /4G communications system on the Moon.\n\n\u00b7 5G/6G will be essential for space travel... Sounds like ARKX will need to look into this one!\n\n\u00b7 Dec. 1, 2020 - Nokia and AT&amp;T extend Worldwide IoT Network Grid (WING) collaboration to deliver seamless IoT connectivity to enterprises around the world, and support upgrades to 5G \"As IoT networks transition to 5G and with Nokia WING also supporting 5G network slicing, AT&amp;T will be able to partition its 5G network into multiple networks that can deliver specific capabilities to its IoT customers and support various use cases.\"\n\n\u00b7 Jan.14, 2021 - Nokia selected for U.S. Federal 5G Cybersecurity Project.\n\n\u00b7 Main collaborator for the Hexa-X 6G European Union Project... \"Being a 2.5-year project within EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 ICT-52 program, Hexa-X is a consortium of 25 key players from adjacent industries and academia. **Nokia** has the overall lead and Ericsson the technical manager role in the project. Hexa-X is a broad collaborative initiative to frame the 6G research agenda and lay the groundwork for a long-term European investment in future wireless network technology.\" - Ericsson's website.\n\n\u00b7 \"Google Cloud and Finland\u2019s Nokia are teaming up to develop cloud-native 5G solutions for communications service providers and enterprise customers, the companies announced in a Thursday (Jan. 14) press release. The companies plan to develop solutions that combine Nokia\u2019s 5G operations and networking capabilities with Google Cloud\u2019s AI, ML and analytics technologies. The solutions will run on Google\u2019s Anthos platform.\" Yes. . . a Google partnership.\n\n**Market Share:**\n\nSources are varying and biased, and there needs to be more rigorous audits in this sector. However, you will get the idea: 5G Hardware Market Share 2020: 1. Huawei - 28%, 2. Nokia - 16%, 3. Ericsson - 14%, but for 2021, $NOK is targeting a 4G and 5G market share **between 25% to 27%** in FY21. On July 16, 2021 ERIC tanked over 11%, due to retaliation for Sweden\u2019s China ban, ERIC had a 28% market share in China, and due to the retaliation, ERIC lost 60% of its market share in China, amounting to $300M. While, NOK only has 1% market share in China, $NOK has no fear of retaliation and only what to gain, particularly since China needs $NOK for its cloud services.  \n\n**$NOK 5G Contracts in last 9-months have more than doubled:**\n\nMoreover, $NOK\u2019s contracts are growing by leaps and bounds. On October 5, 2020 $NOK had secured 100 5G Contracts, but as of today, $NOK\u2019s contracts and market share are way up, $NOK has 170 Commercial 5G Deals, 67 5G Live Operator Networks, 230 Commercial 5G Agreements.\n\n**Patents:**\n\n(The following figures of the following 5g players are very conservative as to $NOK). Investors accumulate shares, Research companies accumulate patents. Those who own the patents are the power brokers in the industry. According to a GreyB total 5G European patents owned and granted as a live-patents as of **June 20, 2020** and those limited to 5G and Standard Essential Patents \u201cSEP\u2019s\u201d:\n\n1. Huawei - 3,007 SEP\u2019s \u2013 530 - Essentiality Ratio: 32% \n\n2. Samsung \u2013 2,317 SEP\u2019s \u2013 374 - Essentiality Ratio: 23% \n\n3. LG \u2013 2,147 SEP\u2019s \u2013 323 - Essentiality Ratio: 20% \n\n4. Nokia - 2,047 SEP\u2019s \u2013 421 - Essentiality **Ratio: 27%** and the highest percentage of granted patents at 76%. \n\n5. Ericsson \u2013 1,678 SEP\u2019s \u2013 230 - Essentiality Ratio: 24% \n\n6. Qualcomm \u2013 1,125 SEP\u2019s \u2013 219 - Essentiality Ratio: 29% \n\n**$NOK is the leader in SEP\u2019s:**\n\nThe argument is that SEP ownership... materially, affects which patents actually matter, and as of **April 28, 2021**, and independent study by PA Consulting firms confined that Nokia owns over 3,500 patent families declared essential to 5G. As such, $NOK is now the leader in SEP\u2019s. \u201cNokia\u2019s industry-leading patent portfolio is built on more than \u20ac130 billion invested in R&amp;D since 2000 and is composed of around 20,000 patent families, including over 3,500 patent families declared essential to 5G.\u201d\n\n$NOK President and CEO Pekka Lundmark has been leading $NOK since August 1, 2021,he has been steady, understated and rather than exaggerate $NOK\u2019s position he has delivered an earnings beat for Q1 FY21 and is expected to do the same on Q2 FY21 on July 29, 2021. He has avoided money pits and has helped $NOK grab market share and profitable 5G contracts. \n\nCompare $NOK to Ericsson through March 21, 2021 and Market Cap and contracts to date:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Nokia** revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2021      was **$6.120B**, a **12.91% increase** year-over-year.\n* **Nokia** revenue for the twelve      months ending March 31, 2021 was **$25.661B**, a **0.61% decline** year-over-year.\n* **Nokia** 5G Contracts: 170 Commercial 5G      Deals, 67 5G Live Operator Networks, 230 Commercial 5G Agreements.\n* **Nokia \u2013** MC 32.20B, price $5.56 up 26.25% over last year.\n* **Ericsson** revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2021      was **$5.934B**, a **15.12% increase** year-over-year.\n* **Ericsson** revenue for the twelve months ending March 31, 2021      was **$26.110B**, a **9.44% increase** year-over-year.\n* **Ericsson** 5G      Contracts: 143 Commercial 5G agreements, 93 Live 5G Networks, 81 Publicly announced 5G      contracts.\n* **Ericsson \u2013** MC 38.50B, price $11.61 up 4.52% over last year.\n\nClearly, $NOK and Ericsson are converging, $NOK is gaining market share, has more 5G contracts, SEP\u2019s, cash surplus and Ericson investors are jumping over to $NOK. Don\u2019t forget Ericsson settled with $NOK regarding patent litigation and has to pay $NOK damages. Ericsson said the settlement followed investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) into corruption, including the bribing of government officials. Ericsson settled with the DOJ in 2019 and agreed to pay over $1 billion in penalties.\n\n$NOK is successful in its Patent Litigation.\n\nOn April of 2021, after $NOK received several favorable rulings Nokia and Lenovo settled a patent dispute, in May of 2021 Ericson settled with $NOK and agreed to pay $NOK 97M Euro, in June of 2021 Daimler agreed to pay Nokia for using its patents and Nokia will license mobile telecommunications technology to Daimler, in July $NOK launched patent lawsuits against OnePlus Technology, throughout Europe and Asia.  \n\n**$NOK upgraded by analysts across the board:**\n\n\u00b7 On July 5, 2021, Exane BNP Paribas analyst Stefan Slowinski upgraded $NOK to Outperform from Neutral with a **$7.70** price target.\n\n\u00b7 On July 15, 2021, Goldman Sachs analyst Alexander Duval upgraded $NOK from neutral to buy and raised his price target from $4.90 to **$6.50**.\n\n\u00b7 On July 14, 2021, JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande, upgrading Nokia to Overweight, and a **$7.80** price target. That's 32% upside from the previous day\u2019s close of $5.88.\n\n\u00b7 Part of the analyst upgrade is because on July 13, 2021 $NOK updated its financial guidance for full year 2021. In the second quarter Nokia saw continued strength in the business, improving its expectations for the full year. Nokia now expects to revise upwards its prior outlook ranges for 2021. Nokia plans to provide full details on its second quarter and half-year financial performance and revised full year 2021 guidance on 29 July 2021.\n\n**A quick calculation of Value metrics from February 2021 to July 16, 2021:**\n\n\u00b7 Current Mcap: As of February, 23.35B as of today 32.4B.\n\n\u00b7 In February $NOK had a 16% market share, today $NOK has about a 25% market share, and using that figure (which will probably grow) 25% of 663B in 2027... market size refers to the maximum total number of sales or customers your business can see, often measured over the course of a year.\n\n\u00b7 663B x 0.25 = 165B Revenue, assuming Revenue = Sales for now, 165B/5B shares = 33 SPS. Assuming P/S Ratio of 1, Market Value per Share = $33.00 USD by 2027.\n\n\u00b7 Current price = $5.70, 33/5.7 = 5.80, so a 580% gain in 6 years based on a P/S Ratio of 1.00 (NOK\u2019s current P/S ratio is about 1.25).\n\n\u00b7 Tesla's current P/S ratio is 20.18, and Zoom is about 32.72.\n\nI**nstitutional Behavior:**\n\n\u00b7 Pursuant to Nasdaq, (Fintel\u2019s figures are double) which is conservative, in February $NOK had 442 institutional investors, at 4% ownership, and rising... today $NOK has 585 Institutional Holders, holding 6.44% an over 50% increase from February. Also, Nokia has a very high chance of reinstating dividends in 2022, and owning now would lower the cost basis. \n\n\u00b7 Institutional investors including mutual funds (now that $NOK has passed the $5 threshold) are increasing buys of Nokia, and are also anticipating the possibility of reinstated dividends. The mid-point for dividends of tech stocks is 4.75% however, if an investor bust NOK at $5.7 and the price is $11.50 by 2022 and Nokia is paying dividends of 4.75% than that investor is earning 54.6 cents per share, equaling a return of 9.5% on that investors cost basis of $5.7 per share.  \n\n   \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jjwbmqc4o7c71.jpg?width=1700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=229d99bbad30b2998948abceedf7fc0080901015\n\n**Some - Highlights of $NOK 5G Contract Gains:**\n\n\u00b7 July 19, 2021: $NOK won its first 5G radio contract in China, securing a share in one of China Mobile's [(0941.HK)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/0941.HK) three new 5G contracts, while Nordic rival Ericsson lost market share after getting caught up in a political spat.\n\n**\u00b7** July 19, 2021: **Nokia extends 5G installed base with Taiwan Star Telecom expansion deal.**\n\n\u00b7 July 19, 2021: Openreach has been ramping up the delivery of ultra-high-speed broadband across the UK as part of the government\u2019s target to offer gigabit connectivity to 85% of the UK.

Its partnership with Nokia and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a key part of this strategy, and has enabled Vodafone to rapidly operationalise use cases such as anomaly detection for efficient operations.\n\n\u00b7 July 16, 2021: The global market for network automation software topped $4.36 billion in 2020 according to a new [Appledore Research report](https://appledoreresearch.com/report/network-automation-software-market-share/). The $NOK ended the year with a 17% share of the market on $758 million in related revenue, followed by [Huawei](https://www.sdxcentral.com/directory/huawei/) with a 12% market share on $544 million in revenue. VMware, by grabbing $379 million in revenue and a 9% market share, indicates that a \u201cstructural transformation has taken place in this market,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\n\u00b7 July 7, 2021: **$**NOK recently announced that it will provide Red Electrica de Espana (REE) with an IP/MPLS network and Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM) optical transport network.\n\n\u00b7 July 1, 2021: Orange tapped Nokia to deploy network slicing in a live private network built for Schneider Electric in France, providing a commercial example of a technology operators expect can help them generate revenue from 5G.\n\nI always look for the big players, and what they are doing with their money.

        "selftext": "  I entered a large long position on October 20, 2019, based on momentum, their flashy NASA 5G contract, US government 5G cybersecurity contract, and NOK\u2019s growing 5G market share. In February of 2021, I furnished a little DD of $NOK with a one-year to 18-month, price target of $14 (possibly with an OTT exuberance at that time). Afterwards, I dug deeper into Nokia, and it continues to be one of the most interesting stocks on the market. (Being an Autistic Silverback looking to buy more crayons to eat, since my wife is too busy with her boyfriend and has no time to make me dinner, I bought in with another large long position in April of 2021 \\[Previously posted on the $NOK subs\\]). I probably have more silver in my hair than the average Redditt Autistic Ape, hence I prefer to be titled Silverback, but I have equal exuberance and love of our communities here.\n\nThere is a lot to look into. . . \"Nokia Bell Labs (formerly named **Bell Labs Innovations** \\- 1996\u20132007) is an American industrial research and scientific development company now owned by the Finnish company Nokia $NOK which itself was established in 1865. Nokia Bell Labs\u2019 headquarters is located in Murray Hill, New Jersey, the company operates several laboratories in the United States and around the world.\" \n\n\u00b7 9 Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories, as well as 4 Turing Awards.\n\n\u00b7 The C Programming Language, as well as Unix was developed at Bell.\n\nWith the 5G/6G arms race heating up, it is time for the 100-year-old Nokia Bell Labs think-tank and 155-year-old $NOK, to be leveraged once more.\n\n(Hard) SPECULATION:\n\n\u00b7 \"Big tech trades human futures\" - Zuboff, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\n\n\u00b7 IMO, modern institutions are very cunning... Everything they do has purpose.\n\n\u00b7 From certain notorious figures in the cryptocurrency community in the previous bull market, I have learned this, and scaled it into larger markets... The behaviors are the same, but even more predictable due to the dominance of algorithmic trading. Just trade \"whale\" for \"institution\".\n\n\u00b7 Nokia is seen in a negative light by retail, and the whole WSB push on January 27, 2021, further weekend $NOK\u2019s image to traditional retail investors. Many investors instantly rejected the notion of learning about this company.\n\n\u00b7 Forgive me if you have disdain for WSB and the \"Robinhood\" investors, but I believe that there is big money behind them... BlackRock , JPM , etc... They are a vehicle for change, and a perfect fall guy for market manipulation.\n\n\u00b7 Some of the DD are likely released by BlackRock themselves... I've seen some of the account's post histories. \"Robinhooders\" are looked down upon, yet under the guise of anonymity, Hedgie\u2019s can release red-herring DD that far exceeds any big-name analyst report? It smells fishy!\n\n\u00b7 Don\u2019t forget what RH did with blocking purchases of BB, GME, AMC and NOK on January 27, 2021. \n\n\u00b7 Announced on July 16, 2021, Robinhood traders who held Gamestop, AMC, Nokia, BlackBerry, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Naked Brands, Koss, or Express stock on January 27, 2021, are encouraged to sign up at [https://clientconnect.labaton.com/case/robinhood-trading-restrictions/](https://pr.report/G7VZYcWN). Labaton Sucharow can analyze your claim and your losses, negotiate with the company, and pursue your claim in arbitration if necessary.\n\n2 Possible threads of speculation:\n\n\u00b7 The outstanding shares of $NOK is 5.6B ... however, with a large float and a high percentage of short interest and public participation even $NOK can be manipulated.\n\n\u00b7 Impulse Wave 1 is often a test pump... To gauge the retail demand levels. Institutions love to do this, and only create a melt up when an ideal motive wave can be created.\n\n\u00b7  However, with $NOK short interest has been dropping, from nearly $300M in January to $150M this month, a 23% drop from last month. Accumulation of Institutional Ownership has ranged from about 4.0% in Q4 2020 to 6.44% in Q2 2021, (double that if one follows Fintel). The Institutional Ownership has increased because of the analyst upgrades and the added possibility of dividends being reinstated. \n\n\"Have you ever wondered how you can enter the world of IoT or meet the increased requirements of the emerging 5G use cases? Are you in need of tools to seize the opportunities of 5G? Would you prefer to win new revenue with low risk and minimal investment, instead of spending CAPEX and time building an IoT network and developing new services?\u201d\n\n\u201cWelcome to Nokia WING, a managed service that offers operators the ability to support their enterprise customers with global IoT connectivity across borders and technologies. It is live today with a truly global footprint but also prepared for the challenges of tomorrow \u2013 no matter what directions it is taking. There is nothing else like WING on the market.\" - Nokia website\n\n\u00b7 At the start of new bubbles, CapEx (Capital Expenditure) for juniors get filled very quickly. If we make a comparison to precious metals miners... this company is a first wave major, not a second wave junior. i.e. in the early stages CapEx is high, and that is why in October of 2019 $NOK suspended dividends to reserve cash for increased spending in RD. Since, 2019 $NOK has made major expenditures in RD.\n\n\u00b7 In November of 2020, Nokia , Elisa and Qualcomm together have achieved the fastest 5G speeds recorded in the world. However, in March of 2021 Nokia achieved a new record of over 4.5 Gbps speed for the first time during a trial on live commercial equipment.\n\n**5G Market:**\n\n5G Applications and Services Market value expected: USD 132B in 2020, to 663B in 2027: The global 5G Applications and Services Market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR ) of \u201c25.8% from 2020 to 2027\" (According to Digital Journal July 14, 2021 Article)\n\nA 25.8% CAGR sounds good to me...\n\nVerticals:\n\n\u00b7 Manufacturing\n\n\u00b7 Energy &amp; Utility\n\n\u00b7 Media &amp; Entertainment\n\n\u00b7 IT &amp; Telecom\n\n\u00b7 Transportation &amp; Logistics\n\n\u00b7 Healthcare\n\n\u00b7 Retail\n\n\u00b7 Agriculture\n\n\u00b7 O&amp;G and Mining\n\n\u00b7 BFSI\n\n\u00b7 Construction\n\n\u00b7 Real Estate\n\n$NOK is listed among in the Article among the 5G Industry Major Market Players.\n\n$NOK offers a service that has unlimited applications... My favorite type of technology!\n\n\u00b7 According to Statista \u201cThe global market for Internet of things ( IoT ) end-user solutions is expected to grow to 212 billion U.S. dollars in size by the end of 2019. The technology reached 100 billion dollars in market revenue for the first time in 2017, and forecasts suggest that this figure will grow to around 1.6 trillion by 2025.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 5G/6G is the LIFEBLOOD of IoT .\n\n\u00b7 \"5G is much more than just fast downloads; its unique combination of high-speed connectivity, very low latency, and ubiquitous coverage will support smart vehicles and transport infrastructure such as connected cars, trucks, and buses, where a split-second delay could mean the difference between a smooth flow of traffic and a 4-way crash at an intersection.\"\n\n\u00b7 What is the number 1 problem that EV manufactures wish to solve right now? Completely independent self-driving. 5G/6G is part of the solution! Why is Elon Musk focusing on Starlink now? It is the solution for Tesla's biggest roadblock. Don\u2019t forget, the June 29, 2021 article about Musk and Starlink began \u201cDon Joyce, a **Nokia** manager working from home at a remote lake cottage in Canada, recently abandoned his painfully slow phone-line internet in favor of satellite broadband service Starlink, offered by Elon Musk's SpaceX.\u201d Moreover, Musk said \u201che was talking to possible partners as a number of countries require operators to provide rural coverage as conditions of their 5G licenses.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 5G infrastructures are the neurons for IoT!\n\n\u00b7 5G is huge. It is of UTMOST importance. Why would the US go to such lengths to cripple China's Huawei for YEARS? Huawei seems to be their number 1 target!\n\n**Key contracts and partnerships:**\n\n\u00b7 July 13, 2021: \u201cWe are progressing well with our three-phased plan to achieve sustainable, profitable growth and technology leadership laid out at our Capital Markets Day in March,\u201d said Pekka Lundmark, Nokia president and chief executive officer, in a statement.\n\n\u00b7 The FIRST company contracted to set up internet on the moon. Partnering with SpaceX. \u201cWhy would astronauts on Earth have access to 5G at home, but not have the same access to the same technologies when they are on the Moon?\u201d Thierry Klein, head of Enterprise and Industrial Automation Research Lab at Nokia Bell Labs, is addressing the gap between communication technology on the Moon and technology astronauts have access to on Earth. In October, Nokia was named a NASA partner for its Tipping Point technologies for the Moon program, receiving a $14 million contract to deploy the first LTE /4G communications system on the Moon.\n\n\u00b7 5G/6G will be essential for space travel... Sounds like ARKX will need to look into this one!\n\n\u00b7 Dec. 1, 2020 - Nokia and AT&amp;T extend Worldwide IoT Network Grid (WING) collaboration to deliver seamless IoT connectivity to enterprises around the world, and support upgrades to 5G \"As IoT networks transition to 5G and with Nokia WING also supporting 5G network slicing, AT&amp;T will be able to partition its 5G network into multiple networks that can deliver specific capabilities to its IoT customers and support various use cases.\"\n\n\u00b7 Jan.14, 2021 - Nokia selected for U.S. Federal 5G Cybersecurity Project.\n\n\u00b7 Main collaborator for the Hexa-X 6G European Union Project... \"Being a 2.5-year project within EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 ICT-52 program, Hexa-X is a consortium of 25 key players from adjacent industries and academia. **Nokia** has the overall lead and Ericsson the technical manager role in the project. Hexa-X is a broad collaborative initiative to frame the 6G research agenda and lay the groundwork for a long-term European investment in future wireless network technology.\" - Ericsson's website.\n\n\u00b7 \"Google Cloud and Finland\u2019s Nokia are teaming up to develop cloud-native 5G solutions for communications service providers and enterprise customers, the companies announced in a Thursday (Jan. 14) press release. The companies plan to develop solutions that combine Nokia\u2019s 5G operations and networking capabilities with Google Cloud\u2019s AI, ML and analytics technologies. The solutions will run on Google\u2019s Anthos platform.\" Yes. . . a Google partnership.\n\n**Market Share:**\n\nSources are varying and biased, and there needs to be more rigorous audits in this sector. However, you will get the idea: 5G Hardware Market Share 2020: 1. Huawei - 28%, 2. Nokia - 16%, 3. Ericsson - 14%, but for 2021, $NOK is targeting a 4G and 5G market share **between 25% to 27%** in FY21. On July 16, 2021 ERIC tanked over 11%, due to retaliation for Sweden\u2019s China ban, ERIC had a 28% market share in China, and due to the retaliation, ERIC lost 60% of its market share in China, amounting to $300M. While, NOK only has 1% market share in China, $NOK has no fear of retaliation and only what to gain, particularly since China needs $NOK for its cloud services.  \n\n**$NOK 5G Contracts in last 9-months have more than doubled:**\n\nMoreover, $NOK\u2019s contracts are growing by leaps and bounds. On October 5, 2020 $NOK had secured 100 5G Contracts, but as of today, $NOK\u2019s contracts and market share are way up, $NOK has 170 Commercial 5G Deals, 67 5G Live Operator Networks, 230 Commercial 5G Agreements.\n\n**Patents:**\n\n(The following figures of the following 5g players are very conservative as to $NOK). Investors accumulate shares, Research companies accumulate patents. Those who own the patents are the power brokers in the industry. According to a GreyB total 5G European patents owned and granted as a live-patents as of **June 20, 2020** and those limited to 5G and Standard Essential Patents \u201cSEP\u2019s\u201d:\n\n1. Huawei - 3,007 SEP\u2019s \u2013 530 - Essentiality Ratio: 32% \n\n2. Samsung \u2013 2,317 SEP\u2019s \u2013 374 - Essentiality Ratio: 23% \n\n3. LG \u2013 2,147 SEP\u2019s \u2013 323 - Essentiality Ratio: 20% \n\n4. Nokia - 2,047 SEP\u2019s \u2013 421 - Essentiality **Ratio: 27%** and the highest percentage of granted patents at 76%. \n\n5. Ericsson \u2013 1,678 SEP\u2019s \u2013 230 - Essentiality Ratio: 24% \n\n6. Qualcomm \u2013 1,125 SEP\u2019s \u2013 219 - Essentiality Ratio: 29% \n\n**$NOK is the leader in SEP\u2019s:**\n\nThe argument is that SEP ownership... materially, affects which patents actually matter, and as of **April 28, 2021**, and independent study by PA Consulting firms confined that Nokia owns over 3,500 patent families declared essential to 5G. As such, $NOK is now the leader in SEP\u2019s. \u201cNokia\u2019s industry-leading patent portfolio is built on more than \u20ac130 billion invested in R&amp;D since 2000 and is composed of around 20,000 patent families, including over 3,500 patent families declared essential to 5G.\u201d\n\n$NOK President and CEO Pekka Lundmark has been leading $NOK since August 1, 2021,he has been steady, understated and rather than exaggerate $NOK\u2019s position he has delivered an earnings beat for Q1 FY21 and is expected to do the same on Q2 FY21 on July 29, 2021. He has avoided money pits and has helped $NOK grab market share and profitable 5G contracts. \n\nCompare $NOK to Ericsson through March 21, 2021 and Market Cap and contracts to date:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Nokia** revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2021      was **$6.120B**, a **12.91% increase** year-over-year.\n* **Nokia** revenue for the twelve      months ending March 31, 2021 was **$25.661B**, a **0.61% decline** year-over-year.\n* **Nokia** 5G Contracts: 170 Commercial 5G      Deals, 67 5G Live Operator Networks, 230 Commercial 5G Agreements.\n* **Nokia \u2013** MC 32.20B, price $5.56 up 26.25% over last year.\n* **Ericsson** revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2021      was **$5.934B**, a **15.12% increase** year-over-year.\n* **Ericsson** revenue for the twelve months ending March 31, 2021      was **$26.110B**, a **9.44% increase** year-over-year.\n* **Ericsson** 5G      Contracts: 143 Commercial 5G agreements, 93 Live 5G Networks, 81 Publicly announced 5G      contracts.\n* **Ericsson \u2013** MC 38.50B, price $11.61 up 4.52% over last year.\n\nClearly, $NOK and Ericsson are converging, $NOK is gaining market share, has more 5G contracts, SEP\u2019s, cash surplus and Ericson investors are jumping over to $NOK. Don\u2019t forget Ericsson settled with $NOK regarding patent litigation and has to pay $NOK damages. Ericsson said the settlement followed investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) into corruption, including the bribing of government officials. Ericsson settled with the DOJ in 2019 and agreed to pay over $1 billion in penalties.\n\n$NOK is successful in its Patent Litigation.\n\nOn April of 2021, after $NOK received several favorable rulings Nokia and Lenovo settled a patent dispute, in May of 2021 Ericson settled with $NOK and agreed to pay $NOK 97M Euro, in June of 2021 Daimler agreed to pay Nokia for using its patents and Nokia will license mobile telecommunications technology to Daimler, in July $NOK launched patent lawsuits against OnePlus Technology, throughout Europe and Asia.  \n\n**$NOK upgraded by analysts across the board:**\n\n\u00b7 On July 5, 2021, Exane BNP Paribas analyst Stefan Slowinski upgraded $NOK to Outperform from Neutral with a **$7.70** price target.\n\n\u00b7 On July 15, 2021, Goldman Sachs analyst Alexander Duval upgraded $NOK from neutral to buy and raised his price target from $4.90 to **$6.50**.\n\n\u00b7 On July 14, 2021, JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande, upgrading Nokia to Overweight, and a **$7.80** price target. That's 32% upside from the previous day\u2019s close of $5.88.\n\n\u00b7 Part of the analyst upgrade is because on July 13, 2021 $NOK updated its financial guidance for full year 2021. In the second quarter Nokia saw continued strength in the business, improving its expectations for the full year. Nokia now expects to revise upwards its prior outlook ranges for 2021. Nokia plans to provide full details on its second quarter and half-year financial performance and revised full year 2021 guidance on 29 July 2021.\n\n**A quick calculation of Value metrics from February 2021 to July 16, 2021:**\n\n\u00b7 Current Mcap: As of February, 23.35B as of today 32.4B.\n\n\u00b7 In February $NOK had a 16% market share, today $NOK has about a 25% market share, and using that figure (which will probably grow) 25% of 663B in 2027... market size refers to the maximum total number of sales or customers your business can see, often measured over the course of a year.\n\n\u00b7 663B x 0.25 = 165B Revenue, assuming Revenue = Sales for now, 165B/5B shares = 33 SPS. Assuming P/S Ratio of 1, Market Value per Share = $33.00 USD by 2027.\n\n\u00b7 Current price = $5.70, 33/5.7 = 5.80, so a 580% gain in 6 years based on a P/S Ratio of 1.00 (NOK\u2019s current P/S ratio is about 1.25).\n\n\u00b7 Tesla's current P/S ratio is 20.18, and Zoom is about 32.72.\n\nI**nstitutional Behavior:**\n\n\u00b7 Pursuant to Nasdaq, (Fintel\u2019s figures are double) which is conservative, in February $NOK had 442 institutional investors, at 4% ownership, and rising... today $NOK has 585 Institutional Holders, holding 6.44% an over 50% increase from February. Also, Nokia has a very high chance of reinstating dividends in 2022, and owning now would lower the cost basis. \n\n\u00b7 Institutional investors including mutual funds (now that $NOK has passed the $5 threshold) are increasing buys of Nokia, and are also anticipating the possibility of reinstated dividends. The mid-point for dividends of tech stocks is 4.75% however, if an investor bust NOK at $5.7 and the price is $11.50 by 2022 and Nokia is paying dividends of 4.75% than that investor is earning 54.6 cents per share, equaling a return of 9.5% on that investors cost basis of $5.7 per share.  \n\n\n\n*Processing img kaed9w82l7c71...*\n\n**Some - Highlights of $NOK 5G Contract Gains:**\n\n\u00b7 July 19, 2021: $NOK won its first 5G radio contract in China, securing a share in one of China Mobile's [(0941.HK)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/0941.HK) three new 5G contracts, while Nordic rival Ericsson lost market share after getting caught up in a political spat.\n\n**\u00b7** July 19, 2021: **Nokia extends 5G installed base with Taiwan Star Telecom expansion deal.**\n\n\u00b7 July 19, 2021: Openreach has been ramping up the delivery of ultra-high-speed broadband across the UK as part of the government\u2019s target to offer gigabit connectivity to 85% of the UK.

Its partnership with Nokia and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a key part of this strategy, and has enabled Vodafone to rapidly operationalise use cases such as anomaly detection for efficient operations.\n\n\u00b7 July 16, 2021: The global market for network automation software topped $4.36 billion in 2020 according to a new [Appledore Research report](https://appledoreresearch.com/report/network-automation-software-market-share/). The $NOK ended the year with a 17% share of the market on $758 million in related revenue, followed by [Huawei](https://www.sdxcentral.com/directory/huawei/) with a 12% market share on $544 million in revenue. VMware, by grabbing $379 million in revenue and a 9% market share, indicates that a \u201cstructural transformation has taken place in this market,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\n\u00b7 July 7, 2021: **$**NOK recently announced that it will provide Red Electrica de Espana (REE) with an IP/MPLS network and Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM) optical transport network.\n\n\u00b7 July 1, 2021: Orange tapped Nokia to deploy network slicing in a live private network built for Schneider Electric in France, providing a commercial example of a technology operators expect can help them generate revenue from 5G.\n\nI always look for the big players, and what they are doing with their money.

        "selftext": "Posting here to offer a little perspective on what some apes saw as a quick hype play.\n\nIt was evident that PSFE had finally found bottom last week after months of daily short attacks.  For months, we saw all the tell-tale signs of market manipulators expertly shaking out retail shareholders with order flow, short volume, massive block trades and 13F\u2019s showing institutions steadily loading up.  In this context, just as PSFE was to be officially added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 indexes, it seemed a little suspicious that Paysafe was suddenly being hyped and trending on WallStreetBets.  I had to wonder if this was an engineered event to generate more liquidity since market makers were clearly running out of sellers right when they had to fill a lot more institutional orders.\n\nThat\u2019s all just monkey brain theory that ultimately doesn't matter because my plan is to hold PSFE long-term.  There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor, before all the rosy ER\u2019s come in.  With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and, despite recent reports, has similar growth to PayPal, it\u2019s no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de-risked from a long-term perspective.\n\nThe comprehensive DD below is for the diamond handed apes who may have been caught in the recent hype. Know that you\u2019re not alone. We saw the same thing right after CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer called Paysafe, \u201cthe ultimate stock for this moment\u201d and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to \u201c$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there.\u201d  After initial spikes, deep-pocketed short-sellers methodically crushed retail holders, eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week.\n\nBut informed short sellers knew they couldn't push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo\u2019s several funds (12 million shares) and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares.^(1)  Also, it\u2019s worth noting that, since they all decided to invest, Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, and Microsoft among others. ^(2)\n\nWith a presence in 120 countries, Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor: #1 global leader in iGaming, #2 global digital wallet, #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private, they\u2019ve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk, increase margins and profits. It's because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity. Here are a few key points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* In 2017, private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for $3.9 billion.^(3)  Blackstone says their typical investment term is \u201cupwards of 7-10 years\u201d ^(4) which aligns with the investment time-frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said, \u201cThere is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents\u2019 age,\u201d adding that the private equity firms \u201chave a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.\u201d ^(5)\n* Under Blackstone/CVC\u2019s stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their long-standing strategic decision to exit specific high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated.  This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth.  In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d  But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. ^(6,7)\n* A few months ago, Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity. The deal paid down $1.2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone/CVC about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.^(8)  The fact that Blackstone's recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares, combined with statements from them and Paysafe's board, indicates that they did this deal, not for a mere 44% gain on a four year investment, but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well-connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth.\n* Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward.  Bill Foley, now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder, is a proven M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena.  Foley took Fidelity National Financial from $3 million market cap to $10.8 billion. Yeah, that\u2019s and \u201cm\u201d and a \u201cb\u201d.  Over just the last five years, Foley grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).  Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion market cap. That\u2019s a 36x return.  He says  \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d ^(6,9)\n\n**Deleveraging, increasing margins and profit**\n\n* Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume.  Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.  Notably, their multi-year projections don\u2019t include growth from their \"active M&amp;A pipeline\" and their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR).\n* Q1's earnings disappointed some because, as part of their restructuring, they had $90 million in one-time non-recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. The company noted: \u201cResults included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.\"\n* Take away the $90 million in one-time expenses and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly net profit, thereby beating all analyst estimates. All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward, although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently.\n* In addition to paying down $1.2 billion in debt, an improved Moody\u2019s credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1.25% lower interest rate, with an option to reduce it another 25bp.^(10)  Foley says: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.\u201d  Notably, this Debt/EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers, and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still.\n* The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around $92 million annually.  This secures higher margins, increased cash for M&amp;A and higher profits which, in my view, will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.\n* As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins, Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud-based integration for easier migration between their platforms, easier cross-border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service, having identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\n**Highly competitve**\n\n* Unlike other payment processors, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.  Just today, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n* In various segments, Paysafe has recently expanded their partnerships with FOX bet, Roblox, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Draftkings, Spotify, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, and Pointsbet among many others.\n* \\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n* They are #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n* People are usually more likely to leave reviews when a payment platform doesn\u2019t meet their expectations. That said, Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11)\n   * By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1axvo1n3sl871.png?width=475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca4bb0678156d9737029ff6a3075728bd54e8940\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d**\n\n**\u201cIt\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"** \\- Bill Foley\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due to managing risk and a very complex regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT, as discussed below.  Paysafe is often an integrated back-end payment processor so most don\u2019t realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting.\n* Bill Foley says, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else\u2026we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n* In his letter to investors, fund manager Dan Loeb said, \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n* Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso, who initiated coverage with a $19 price target, noted, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d adding, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d ^(13)\n   * Recent headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n      * \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n      * \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n      * \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n      * \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n      * \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n      * \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n      * \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n      * \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n      * \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n      * \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n      * \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n      * \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n      * \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n      * \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n      * \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n      * \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Every analyst covering Paysafe rates it as a \"Buy\". A few quotes :\n   * RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d ^(14)\n   * BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" ^(15)\n   * Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(16)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MOAT:**  **\u201crobust risk management operation\u201d**\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1.7 billion globally who can't even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from transcript : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d ^(9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n* Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin,  mid to high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n* By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n* Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n* The group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their \"active M&amp;A pipeline.\"  Foley is apparently known for under-promising and over-performing.\n* As noted above, Paysafe was growing 28% CAGR pre-Covid, but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid-related business closures and strategic channel exits, it grew at 18% CAGR, a rate on par with PayPal's projected growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of peer multiples:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\nMore realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : **$50.75**\n* EV/Rev ratio : **$44.64**\n* EV/FCF ratio : **$44.18**\n\n**Average : $46.52**\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up.  While I don't necessarily agree with his time frame, market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources:**\n\n(1) see fintel or other source for institutional ownership.

        "selftext": "It was evident that PSFE had finally found bottom last week.  For months, we saw all the tell-tale signs of market manipulators expertly shaking out retail shareholders with order flow, short volume, massive block trades and 13F\u2019s showing institutions steadily loading up.  In this context, just as PSFE was to be officially added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 indexes, it seemed a little suspicious that Paysafe was suddenly being hyped and trending on WallStreetBets.  I had to wonder if this was an engineered event to generate more liquidity since market makers were clearly running out of sellers right when they had to fill a lot more institutional orders.\n\nThat\u2019s all just monkey brain theory that ultimately doesn't matter because my plan is to hold PSFE for a long time.  There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor, before all the rosy ER\u2019s come in.  With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and, despite recent reports, has similar growth to PayPal, it\u2019s no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de-risked from a long-term perspective.\n\nThe comprehensive DD below is for investors with a longer view who may have been caught in the recent hype. Know that you\u2019re not alone. We saw the same thing right after CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer called Paysafe, \u201cthe ultimate stock for this moment\u201d and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to \u201c$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there.\u201d  After initial spikes, deep-pocketed short-sellers methodically crushed retail holders, eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week.\n\nBut informed short sellers knew they couldn't push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo\u2019s several funds (12 million shares) and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares.^(1)  Also, it\u2019s worth noting that, since they all decided to invest, Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, and Microsoft among others. ^(2)\n\nWith a presence in 120 countries, Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor: #1 global leader in iGaming, #2 global digital wallet, #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private, they\u2019ve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk, increase margins and profits. It's because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity. Here are a few key points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* In 2017, private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for $3.9 billion.^(3)  Blackstone says their typical investment term is \u201cupwards of 7-10 years\u201d ^(4) which aligns with the investment time-frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said, \u201cThere is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents\u2019 age,\u201d adding that the private equity firms \u201chave a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.\u201d ^(5)\n* Under Blackstone/CVC\u2019s stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their long-standing strategic decision to exit specific high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated.  This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth.  In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d  But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. ^(6,7)\n* A few months ago, Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity. The deal paid down $1.2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone/CVC about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.^(8)  The fact that Blackstone's recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares, combined with statements from them and Paysafe's board, indicates that they did this deal, not for a mere 44% gain on a four year investment, but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well-connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth.\n* Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward.  Bill Foley, now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder, is a proven M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena.  Foley took Fidelity National Financial from $3 million market cap to $10.8 billion. Yeah, that\u2019s and \u201cm\u201d and a \u201cb\u201d.  Over just the last five years, Foley grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).  Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion market cap. That\u2019s a 36x return.  He says  \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d ^(6,9)\n\n**Deleveraging, increasing margins and profit**\n\n* Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume.  Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.  Notably, their multi-year projections don\u2019t include growth from their \"active M&amp;A pipeline\" and their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR).\n* Q1's earnings disappointed some because, as part of their restructuring, they had $90 million in one-time non-recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. The company noted: \u201cResults included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.\"\n* Take away the $90 million in one-time expenses and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly net profit, thereby beating all analyst estimates. All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward, although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently.\n* In addition to paying down $1.2 billion in debt, an improved Moody\u2019s credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1.25% lower interest rate, with an option to reduce it another 25bp.^(10)  Foley says: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.\u201d  Notably, this Debt/EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers, and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still.\n* The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around $92 million annually.  This secures higher margins, increased cash for M&amp;A and higher profits which, in my view, will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.\n* As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins, Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud-based integration for easier migration between their platforms, easier cross-border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service, having identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\n**Highly competitve**\n\n* Unlike other payment processors, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.  Just today, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n* In various segments, Paysafe has recently expanded their partnerships with FOX bet, Roblox, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Draftkings, Spotify, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, and Pointsbet among many others.\n* \\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n* They are #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n* People are usually more likely to leave reviews when a payment platform doesn\u2019t meet their expectations. That said, Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11)\n   * By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d**\n\n**\u201cIt\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"** \\- Bill Foley\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due to managing risk and a very complex regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT, as discussed below.  Paysafe is often an integrated back-end payment processor so most don\u2019t realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting.\n* Bill Foley says, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else\u2026we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n* In his letter to investors, fund manager Dan Loeb said, \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n* Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso, who initiated coverage with a $19 price target, noted, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d adding, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d ^(13)\n   * Recent headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n      * \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n      * \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n      * \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n      * \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n      * \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n      * \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n      * \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n      * \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n      * \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n      * \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n      * \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n      * \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n      * \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n      * \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n      * \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n      * \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Every analyst covering Paysafe rates it as a \"Buy\". A few quotes :\n   * RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d ^(14)\n   * BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" ^(15)\n   * Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(16)\n\n**MOAT:**  **\u201crobust risk management operation\u201d**\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1.7 billion globally who can't even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from transcript : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d ^(9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n* Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin,  mid to high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n* By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n* Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n* The group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their \"active M&amp;A pipeline.\"  Foley is apparently known for under-promising and over-performing.\n* As noted above, Paysafe was growing 28% CAGR pre-Covid, but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid-related business closures and strategic channel exits, it grew at 18% CAGR, a rate on par with PayPal's projected growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of peer multiples:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\nMore realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : **$50.75**\n* EV/Rev ratio : **$44.64**\n* EV/FCF ratio : **$44.18**\n\n**Average : $46.52**\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up.  While I don't necessarily agree with his time frame, market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources:**\n\n(1) [https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe](https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe).\n\n(2) [https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes\\_value\\_creation\\_trajectory\\_is\\_very\\_much/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/)\n\n(3) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827](https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827)\n\n(4) [https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the\\_life\\_cycle\\_of\\_private\\_equity\\_insights.pdf](https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the_life_cycle_of_private_equity_insights.pdf)\n\n(5) [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a-idUSKBN1AK0KN](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a-idUSKBN1AK0KN)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9)  [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10)  Global Capital link removed due to forbidden word in the url. \n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)\n\n(13)  [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(14) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(15) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(16) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)",

        "selftext": "Posting here to offer a little perspective on what some apes saw as a quick hype play.\n\nIt was evident that PSFE had finally found bottom last week after months of daily short attacks.  For months, we saw all the tell-tale signs of market manipulators expertly shaking out retail shareholders with order flow, short volume, massive block trades and 13F\u2019s showing institutions steadily loading up.  In this context, just as PSFE was to be officially added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 indexes, it seemed a little suspicious that Paysafe was suddenly being hyped and trending on WallStreetBets.  I had to wonder if this was an engineered event to generate more liquidity since market makers were clearly running out of sellers right when they had to fill a lot more institutional orders.\n\nThat\u2019s all just monkey brain theory that ultimately doesn't matter because my plan is to hold PSFE long-term.  There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor, before all the rosy ER\u2019s come in.  With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and, despite recent reports, has similar growth to PayPal, it\u2019s no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de-risked from a long-term perspective.\n\nThe comprehensive DD below is for the diamond handed apes who may have been caught in the recent hype. Know that you\u2019re not alone. We saw the same thing right after CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer called Paysafe, \u201cthe ultimate stock for this moment\u201d and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to \u201c$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there.\u201d  After initial spikes, deep-pocketed short-sellers methodically crushed retail holders, eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week.\n\nBut informed short sellers knew they couldn't push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo\u2019s several funds (12 million shares) and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares.^(1)  Also, it\u2019s worth noting that, since they all decided to invest, Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, and Microsoft among others. ^(2)\n\nWith a presence in 120 countries, Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor: #1 global leader in iGaming, #2 global digital wallet, #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private, they\u2019ve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk, increase margins and profits. It's because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity. Here are a few key points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* In 2017, private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for $3.9 billion.^(3)  Blackstone says their typical investment term is \u201cupwards of 7-10 years\u201d ^(4) which aligns with the investment time-frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said, \u201cThere is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents\u2019 age,\u201d adding that the private equity firms \u201chave a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.\u201d ^(5)\n* Under Blackstone/CVC\u2019s stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their long-standing strategic decision to exit specific high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated.  This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth.  In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d  But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. ^(6,7)\n* A few months ago, Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity. The deal paid down $1.2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone/CVC about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.^(8)  The fact that Blackstone's recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares, combined with statements from them and Paysafe's board, indicates that they did this deal, not for a mere 44% gain on a four year investment, but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well-connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth.\n* Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward.  Bill Foley, now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder, is a proven M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena.  Foley took Fidelity National Financial from $3 million market cap to $10.8 billion. Yeah, that\u2019s and \u201cm\u201d and a \u201cb\u201d.  Over just the last five years, Foley grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).  Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion market cap. That\u2019s a 36x return.  He says  \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d ^(6,9)\n\n**Deleveraging, increasing margins and profit**\n\n* Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume.  Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.  Notably, their multi-year projections don\u2019t include growth from their \"active M&amp;A pipeline\" and their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR).\n* Q1's earnings disappointed some because, as part of their restructuring, they had $90 million in one-time non-recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. The company noted: \u201cResults included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.\"\n* Take away the $90 million in one-time expenses and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly net profit, thereby beating all analyst estimates. All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward, although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently.\n* In addition to paying down $1.2 billion in debt, an improved Moody\u2019s credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1.25% lower interest rate, with an option to reduce it another 25bp.^(10)  Foley says: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.\u201d  Notably, this Debt/EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers, and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still.\n* The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around $92 million annually.  This secures higher margins, increased cash for M&amp;A and higher profits which, in my view, will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.\n* As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins, Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud-based integration for easier migration between their platforms, easier cross-border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service, having identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\n**Highly competitve**\n\n* Unlike other payment processors, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.  Just today, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n* In various segments, Paysafe has recently expanded their partnerships with FOX bet, Roblox, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Draftkings, Spotify, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, and Pointsbet among many others.\n* \\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n* They are #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n* People are usually more likely to leave reviews when a payment platform doesn\u2019t meet their expectations. That said, Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11)\n   * By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2tce80abpl871.png?width=475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32e78dde014d5edf387cd4f9f603fceb6ab6c4c7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d**\n\n**\u201cIt\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"** \\- Bill Foley\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due to managing risk and a very complex regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT, as discussed below.  Paysafe is often an integrated back-end payment processor so most don\u2019t realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting.\n* Bill Foley says, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else\u2026we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n* In his letter to investors, fund manager Dan Loeb said, \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n* Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso, who initiated coverage with a $19 price target, noted, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d adding, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d ^(13)\n   * Recent headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n      * \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n      * \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n      * \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n      * \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n      * \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n      * \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n      * \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n      * \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n      * \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n      * \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n      * \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n      * \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n      * \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n      * \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n      * \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n      * \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Every analyst covering Paysafe rates it as a \"Buy\". A few quotes :\n   * RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d ^(14)\n   * BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" ^(15)\n   * Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(16)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MOAT:**  **\u201crobust risk management operation\u201d**\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1.7 billion globally who can't even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from transcript : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d ^(9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n* Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin,  mid to high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n* By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n* Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n* The group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their \"active M&amp;A pipeline.\"  Foley is apparently known for under-promising and over-performing.\n* As noted above, Paysafe was growing 28% CAGR pre-Covid, but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid-related business closures and strategic channel exits, it grew at 18% CAGR, a rate on par with PayPal's projected growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of peer multiples:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\nMore realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : **$50.75**\n* EV/Rev ratio : **$44.64**\n* EV/FCF ratio : **$44.18**\n\n**Average : $46.52**\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up.  While I don't necessarily agree with his time frame, market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources:**\n\n(1) [https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe](https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe).\n\n(2) [https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes\\_value\\_creation\\_trajectory\\_is\\_very\\_much/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/)\n\n(3) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827](https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827)\n\n(4) [https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the\\_life\\_cycle\\_of\\_private\\_equity\\_insights.pdf](https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the_life_cycle_of_private_equity_insights.pdf)\n\n(5) [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a-idUSKBN1AK0KN](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a-idUSKBN1AK0KN)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9)  [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10)   [https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi](https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi)\n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)\n\n(13)  [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(14) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(15) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(16) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)",

        "selftext": "TLDR: Popular Inc. is a regional bank based out of Puerto Rico, they have great financials, I expect good earnings caused by the rise in prices of the housing market and the influx of wealth to the island within the last 14 months.\n\n# Basics\n\n Company Name: Popular, Inc. \n\nTicker Symbol: BPOP \n\nExchange: Nasdaq \n\nSector: Financial Services \n\nIndustry: Regional Banks \n\nStock Price\\*: $76.36\n\n USD Consensus Fair Value Estimate: $129.31 \n\n Headquarters: San Juan, Puerto Rico \n\nMarket Cap: $6.6 Billion (\u201cLarge Core\u201d with both growth and value characteristics) \n\n Company Description: Popular, Inc. is the leading financial institution by both assets and deposits in Puerto Rico and ranks among the top 50 U.S. bank holding companies by assets. Founded in 1893, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, Popular\u2019s principal subsidiary, provides retail, mortgage, and commercial banking services in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Popular also offers in Puerto Rico auto and equipment leasing and financing, investment banking, broker-dealer, and insurance services through specialized subsidiaries. In the mainland United States, Popular provides retail, mortgage and commercial banking services through its New York-chartered banking subsidiary, Popular Bank, with branches located in New York, New Jersey, and Florida. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#  Industry Overview &amp; Competitive Positioning \n\nBPOP Returns v. Industry Return: BPOP exceeded the US Banking industry, which returned 68.9% over the past year. BPOP returned 108.3% during the same timeframe. \n\nBPOP Returns v. Market Returns: BPOP exceeded the US Market which returned 45.5% over the past year. BPOP returned 108.3% during the same timeframe. \n\nVolatility: Over the past 5 years, BPOP (1.25 Beta) has been more volatile than the average market (1.0 Beta), and less volatile than the US Banking industry (1.38 Beta). \n\nCompetitors: Compared to competitors including OFG Bancorp (OFG), First Bancorp North Carolina (FBNC), Community Bank System Inc (CBU), and US Bancorp (USB), Popular, Inc. has a lower price to earnings ratio (P/E), indicating that BPOP may be underpriced in the short-term \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#  Valuation &amp; Financial Analysis \n\nShare Price v. Fair Value: Considering BPOP\u2019s current stock price of $76.36, BPOP may be undervalued based on the cashflows the company is expected to generate in the future. Trading below fair value indicates possible upside potential.\n\n Price to Earnings Ratio: Measuring the current share price relative to BPOP\u2019s earnings per share, the company\u2019s PE of approximately 8.61 is lower than the Industry (12) and Market (19.7), indicating BPOP is possibly undervalued. While not a measure of future performance, BPOP\u2019s earnings growth has exceeded both the overall industry and market over the past year. Factoring BPOP\u2019s forecasted annual earnings growth and forecasted annual revenue growth, both metrics may lag the overall industry and market over the next 3 years. \n\nDebt to Equity Analysis: With a Debt/Equity Ratio of 22.7% (as of March 30, 2021), there have been significant improvements since July 29, 2014 when BPOP had a Debt/Equity Ratio of 105.4%, indicating increased assets and reduced liabilities during that timeframe. Additionally, with an Assets to Equity Ratio of 11.3, BPOP is financing its operations through a moderate level of debt versus wholly-owned funds.\n\n Dividends: With an annual dividend amount of $1.80 per share and a dividend yield of 2.29%, BPOP\u2019s dividend yield is in line with the market median of 2.26%. While dividend payments have been stable and increased for 5 years in a row, BPOP has only  paid a dividend for 6 consecutive years. With a low payout ratio of approximately 18.4%, BPOP\u2019s dividend payments are well covered by earnings and future payouts to shareholders are forecasted to be well covered in the next 3 years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions:\n\n4 10/15/2021 100 C\n\n10 10/15/2021 110 C\n\n5 10/15/2021 120 C\n\n5 1/21/2022 125 C\n\n2 7/16/2021 85 C\n\n5 7/16/2021 90C\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny additional thoughts are appreciated, hope this helps someone out",

        "selftext": "Many investors incorporate analysts' ratings into their due diligence process. However, they can be a huge conflicts of interest, as the investment banks are allowed to give recommendations on investments they own. It's very easy for them to buy a position and then later go on news shows, like CNBC and Cramer, to tell the public that they should be buying the stock, too. The analysts' recommendations hold sway with the public since they are the \"experts\" who work at big, prestigious firms, like Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs.\n\n[Here is a clip from a Frontline documentary on the 2000 dot-com crash,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5iE-4JsUms&amp;t=1675s) where analysts admitted to going on the news to pump up and be \"cheerleaders\" for companies that paid their firm to handle their IPO's. As you recall, the dot-com crash was largely caused by people being euphoric about any company going IPO. This clip illustrates the investment banks' role in the euphoria and how they do not have your best interests in mind.\n\nPersonally, it shocks me that investment banks are able to provide recommendations and price targets without any kind of oversight or regulations, as they can easily just issue positive opinions to pump and dump their own investments.",
