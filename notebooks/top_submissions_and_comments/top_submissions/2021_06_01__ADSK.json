        "selftext": "Thing are looking up in SPAC land and there are still hundreds of SPACs' warrants under $1. It seems the appetite for risk is returning and prices have started appreciating rapidly. Fortunately there are still good warrants to be found at good prices.\n\n***DISCLAIMER:*** *I am not a financial advisor. I have 93 different warrants positions (80 still pre-DA) and have spent the past three months building out positions in as many good teams as I can as close to all-time lows, and I have positions in all the 12 of the warrants mentioned in this article. Warrant prices change rapidly, liquidity is still relatively low, and all are at risk of going to zero if the SPAC liquidates. Make sure a warrant-oriented approach matches your risk appetite and you understand the complexities of these instruments before buying.*\n\nThings I look for:\n\n* low splits in units = potential for better valuation/targets and an indicator of a better team\n* team quality\n* previous SPAC experience\n\n# ROCRW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.9725\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/4 \n\n**Previous/Related:** PCT, which has warrants currently trading at $9.31. Another current SPAC, ROCC, DA'd with Reservoir Media and the last trade on the warrants was 1.63 with a high of 2.90. \n\n**Sector:** Business Services, Consumer, Healthcare, Tech, Wellness, Sustainability\n\n**Team:** Byron Roth (Founder, Roth). \n\n# NVSAW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.91\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Aviation, Aerospace, Defense\n\n**Team:** This team is STACKED. If you are looking for a good aerospace SPAC it may well be the best:\n\n* Dennis A. Muilenburg, the former CEO of Boeing, \n* Marion Blakey, the former Administrator of the FAA, former CEO of the Aerospace Industries Association and former CEO of Rolls-Royce NA, \n* Howard Lance, the former CEO of Maxar and Harris, \n* Christopher Lofgren, Chairman of the US Chamber of Commerce and the CEO of Schneider National\n* Gen. Stephen Wilson, ret. 4 Star Air Force General and Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force\n* Top advisors include Paul Eremenko, fmr CTO at Airbus, Gur Kimchi, Co-Founder of Amazon Prime Air, Dr. John Tracy, VP of Engineering at Boeing, and more...\n\n# LCAH-WT \n\n**Last Trade:** $0.865 \n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/4\n\n**Sector:** Consumer, Dining, Hospitality, Entertainment, Gaming \n\n**Previous/Related:** GNOG. GNOG warrants were early redeemed and hit a high price of $10.56.\n\n**Team:** Tilman Fertitta (Houston Rockets owner, CEO of Landry's)\n\n**CLAA-WT** \\- Last Trade: $0.90 - 1/5 warrants in units, and one of the cheapest in that split. The team's previous SPAC was OUST, which successfully completed a merger and the warrants are currently at $3.35, with a high price of $4.57.\n\n# GLBLW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.69\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Not specified, but suggest \"proven business models as we do not intend to assume risks of unproven technologies \"\n\n**Team:** Very solid team for this price: Peter Yu (Managing Partner at Cartesian, former CEO of AIG Capital Partners, Former Director National Economic Council), Elias Dias Sese (President of Northern Europe Kraft Heinz, Former CEO of Tim Hortons), Daniel Karp (Former VP of Worldwide Business Development at Pfizer) \n\n# AGGRW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.78\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Tech - Software, HCIT, Fintech, robotics/automation, EdTech  \n\n**Team:** Jay Bhatt (Former CEO, Alfresco Software; Former CEO, Blackboard), John Newton (Founder/CTO, Alfresco Software), Steven Alesio (Former Chairman/CEO, Dun &amp; Bradstreet), Carol Bartz (Former CEO of Yahoo! and Autodesk), Carl Bass (Director and Fmr CEO of Autodesk; Fmr Director, Hewlett-Packard)   \n\n# DHBC-WT \n\n**Last Trade:** $0.73\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Financial Services\n\n**Team:** A very solid resumed team for warrants this cheap: Robert Hurst (Former Vice Chairman/ Head of Investment Banking Division, Goldman Sachs), Richard DeMartini (Former President of Asset Management, Bank of America, Former Chairman, Discover Card). \n\n# DTOC-WT \n\n**Last Trade:** $0.78\n\n**Warrants in Units**: 1/4. This is the cheapest 1/4 split warrant on the market as of last trade Friday.\n\n**Sector:** Healthcare Tech \n\n**The team:** Kevin Nazemi (Fmr Co-CEO, Oscar Health),Bradley Fluegel (Former Chief Strategy Officer, Walgreens &amp; Anthem), Jim Moffatt (Former Vice Chairman/Global CEO, Deloitte Consulting). \n\n# PCPC-WT\n\n**Last Trade:** $1.93\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/4. Remember when I said this post was about warrants under $1 and DTOC was the cheapest 1/4 split? Well, that was technically true, but PCPC-WT's $1.93 needs an asterisk: This SPAC is at 2.5x the scale of a normal SPAC, with a $25 per share baseline and a $28.75 strike. By that standard, these warrants at $1.93 would be worth .775 if it were a normal $10 base SPAC. \n\n**Team:** Led by Sahnjeev Mehra, founder and managing partner, Peripheras Capital. \n\n**Notable Feature:** It also has an investors-friendly CAPS incentive structure, where the founders get 6% on merger as opposed to the typical 20%, then provides payouts at certain price levels for sticking with the company long term.\n\n# BOAS-WT\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.67\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3. One of the cheapest in that warrant split. \n\n**Focus:** PropTech\n\n**Team:** Scott Seligman, Chairman of The Seligman Group (a real estate development company), David Glazer (CFO, Palantir), Shane Battier (Former NBA player and VP of Analytics and Basketball Development, Miami Heat)\n\n# SGAMW (DA: REDBOX)\n\n**Last Trade:** 0.84\n\n**Valuation:** $693M, with 2021E revenues of $569M (EV 1.2x estimated revenues).\n\n**Why it's a buy:** According to conventional wisdom, Redbox is a dying company. People are moving away from conventional media like disc videogames and DVDs to all streaming. However, I think that conventional wisdom is from the perspective of those of us who have the privilege to afford internet, smart TVs and streaming services. 70% of Redbox's customers are \"late adopters\" - largely the elderly and low income. To these people, a $2 DVD rental for the latest release is a cheaper night of entertainment than most other forms, and Amazon digital movie rentals for the blockbuster new releases not on Prime are often over $6. Additionally, Redbox is pivoting to digital and supposedly more affordable for the same movies than Amazon. \n\n# LIVKW (DA: AGILETHOUGHT)\n\n**Last Trade:** 0.85\n\n**Valuation:** $482M for $184M in 2021E revenue (EV 2.6x estimated revenues)\n\n**Why it's a buy:** This is a boring IT services company that SPAC investors don't care about, heavily based around consultants in Mexico (even though the corporate HQ is in Dallas). This has led to it becoming underrated for a valuation this good, and for a company that has a good reputation in their field. They trade at very favorable multiples compared to other stocks in their field. One doesn't have to be a groundbreaking product for a company to be a good stock.\n\nGood luck!",

        "selftext": "Over the past year I've really fallen in love with the process and maintenance of investing. It's something I've always wanted to do but never had the opportunity to do due to my income. I followed markets closely anyway and at the end of the day my favorite part about all of this is how much I simply enjoy reading.\n\nI'm currently considering Barron's, WSJ, The Economist, and Bloomberg based on my previous experiences. I would appreciate some guidance from anyone that already has experience with some of these platforms. What you liked, didn't like, or if it's worth combining subscriptions. Stuff like that.\n\nI appreciate general news but enjoy intensive discussions on particular companies. If it is of any importance, these are the companies that I currently invest in:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Over 1%**\n\nPinterest, Google,  Autodesk, Kansas City Southern, Square, and eventually Robinhood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Up to 1%**\n\nSPY, Pershing Square, Berkshire, Costco, Salesforce, Visa, Paypal, Rockwell Automation, Mettler-Toledo, Sherwin-Williams, Ecolab, Oatly, Roblox, Tesla, AMD, Fastly, AirBnB, Bitc\\*in (not sure if word is banned)",

        "selftext": "I  made some profit and sold on its early climb after IPO thinking the  growth isn't sustainable, which it was bc it crashed into 70s from $175. After the crash I kept buying here and there but now it seems like its gaining momentum again.\n\nI'm a big VR/AR bull so I naturally like Unity. Although I'm not exactly sure how I should grasp around 30B valuation. I tried to think the valuation should be somewhat similar to Autodesk(60B) since they both serve as a development/blueprint tool one for engineering and other for game/VR. \n\nAny thoughts on recent movement or company itself?\n\nMy position is 40 stocks cost average of $104.",
