        "selftext": " \n\nI fully expect PLTR to be the next trillion dollar market cap stock. It\u2019s got Peter Thiel (ROTH IRA gang) and Karp at the helm, two really smart and patriotic guys, who know what they\u2019re doing. The IBM partnership was huge in expanding the private sector growth, adding almost 3000 to the sales team. There\u2019s an ever growing log of government contracts meaning they have steady revenue.\n\nPalantir\u2019s retail investors are also a class of their own and Karp recognizes this as noted in one of his recent interviews. This I think is huge in cultivating an investor base that will buy, hold, and believe for years to come. It\u2019s currently my largest holding and I only expect to be that way for the foreseeable 5-10 years. I have no intention of letting a single share go no matter how long boomers keeps it down.\n\nEvery other day there\u2019s news of a new or renewed contract. One day it will be too much to ignore. Wall Street has either been too lazy to understand the company or, if they have done the research, they\u2019re too stupid to act on it. At least Cathie Woods knows what she sees, currently owning over $872M of it...This is going to be her next Tesla call. \n\nConstantly, being bashed by analysts but being scooped up by the same banks? Come on now, once these jamokes are done loading the boat and the upgrades come out its game over. \n\nKarp and Thiel added over $57m in gold and they are pro digital currencies so that's a plus. No debt and \\~2.4B cash on hand. \n\nThey are aiming to be Skynet...make of that what you will. \n\nOn the TA side of things, it's forming higher bases but bases none the less. The longer the base the longer the explosion to the upside. Once this gets hot the lid is coming off and this is gonna blow. \n\n**Partnerships/Customers include the following**:\n\n\\-\tAbbvie\n\n\\-\tAmazon\n\n\\-      Airbus\n\n\\-\tIBM\n\n\\-\tCIA\n\n\\-\tU.S. Navy\n\n\\-\tU.S. Army\n\n\\-\tSEC (Up for Bid)\n\n\\-\tDoD\n\n\\-\tMarines\n\n\\-\tNSA\n\n\\-\tDHS\n\n\\-\tAir Force\n\n\\-\tICE\n\n\\-\tBritish National Health Service\n\n\\-\tMerck\n\n\\-\tFerrari\n\n\\-\tCDC\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Recent Earnings Highlights**\n\n* Total revenue grew 49% year-over-year to $376 million\n* US commercial revenue grew 90% year-over-year\n* Closed 62 deals of $1 million or more, of which:\n   * 30 deals are $5 million or more\n   * 21 deals are $10 million or more\n* 20 net new customers added in Q2 2021, total customers up 13% quarter-over-quarter\n* Commercial customer count increased 32% quarter-over-quarter\n\n**H1 2021 Highlights**\n\n* Total revenue grew 49% year-over-year to $717 million\n* Commercial customer count increased 61% since December 31, 2020\n* Cash flow from operations of $140 million, representing a 19% margin\n* Adjusted free cash flow of $201 million, representing a 28% margin\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I'm stoned so was probably all over the place but Palantir is gonna be the next early Amazon or Apple or Tesla or Microsoft.

        "selftext": "What an awesome Earning reports for PLTR, kudos\u2026 it managed to close at around 24.70$, but I feel this is just the Tip of the Iceberg!!! Shorts and Hedgies have been playing around this stock for a long time and Every Retail\nInvestor was irritated by that, Good results - price down, new deals - price down, positive announcements - price down, how long this could go on\u2026 even last night many were skeptical with the expected Good Earnings report by saying - PLTR GOOD EARNINGS = Price Down\u2026 such was the mentality of frustrated investors for so long\u2026\n\nFinally, PLTR turned the tables, and the stock price started climbing up. Funny part is : just after the Good Earnings report - shorts were scared and started their bombardment of negative PLTR sentiments on Stockwits by trying to scare the bullish investors. Even when Palantir was at 24$ today - Bears tried to convince all to take the profit and run away \ud83d\ude02 but This time their trick didn\u2019t work\u2026\n\nCouple of months back, $PLTR had touched 40$ line, but then got pulled back, but now with another great earning report and easily achievable guidance value - Palantir is going to Shine on top of all and if retail\nInvestors realize it\u2019s worth and stay bullish behind it then it can easily cross 40$ again and may be even 50$+ \nRemember, $PLTR is not a meme stock (in a way it can be though, lol) - but a REAL COMPANY WITH AWESOME TRACK RCORD, Good Earnings, Incremental Focussed growth, great management team, Top of the Shelf software company which enables Private as well as Govt / Defense agencies, and it\u2019s a Pioneer in its domain. It\u2019s even considered as one of the top 12 AI companies in the world. So all I can see is Uphill for PLTR\n\nSo this is my personal view, and I know many here have similar opinion on it \ud83d\ude07 I\u2019m not against Shorts, but I\u2019m against their practice of scaremongering the retail investors for their own be if it\u2019s Even when the Company is doing Real Good, that\u2019s against the ethics of stocks investment. If a company is doing good then we want to invest there- and not to doom That company by shorting. That practice needs to stop. so I hope tomorrow PLTR  shoots up and teaches the lesson to shorties and it\u2019s price crosses moon, May be even Mars and Beyond \ud83d\ude07\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/12-best-artificial-intelligence-stocks-141203223.html\n\nPalantir Reports 49% Revenue Growth; US Commercial Revenue Up 90%\n\nQ2 2021 Highlights\n\nTotal revenue grew 49% year-over-year to $376 million\nUS commercial revenue grew 90% year-over-year\nClosed 62 deals of $1 million or more, of which:\n30 deals are $5 million or more\n21 deals are $10 million or more\n20 net new customers added in Q2 2021, total customers up 13% quarter-over-quarter\nCommercial customer count increased 32% quarter-over-quarter\nCash flow from operations of $23 million, representing a 6% margin\nAdjusted free cash flow of $50 million, representing a 13% margin\nGAAP net loss per share, diluted of ($0.07)\nAdjusted earnings per share, diluted of $0.04\nH1 2021 Highlights\n\nTotal revenue grew 49% year-over-year to $717 million\nCommercial customer count increased 61% since December 31, 2020\nCash flow from operations of $140 million, representing a 19% margin\nAdjusted free cash flow of $201 million, representing a 28% margin\n\n\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210812005243/en/Palantir-Reports-49-Revenue-Growth-US-Commercial-Revenue-Up-90-YY\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014*\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nCustomers:::::\n\nPalantir Metropolis is used by hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms\n\nPalantir Foundry clients include Merck KGaA, Airbus and Ferrari.\n\nPalantir partner Information Warfare Monitor used Palantir software to uncover both the Ghostnet and the Shadow Networks\n\nU.S. civil entities\nPalantir's software is used by the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board to detect and investigate fraud and abuse in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Specifically, the Recovery Operations Center (ROC) used Palantir to integrate transactional data with open-source and private data sets that describe the entities receiving stimulus funds. Other clients as of 2019 included Polaris Project, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children,the National Institutes of Health,Team Rubicon,and the United Nations World Food Programme.\n\nIn October 2020, Palantir began helping the federal government set up a system that will track the manufacture, distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines across the country.\n\nU.S. military, intelligence, and police\t\nPalantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the United States Intelligence Community and United States Department of Defense, fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, and cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor (responsible for the GhostNet and the Shadow Network investigation).\n\nOther clients as of 2013 included DHS, NSA, FBI, CDC, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, West Point, the Joint IED Defeat Organization and Allies. However, at the time the United States Army continued to use its own data analysis tool.Also, according to TechCrunch, \"The U.S. spy agencies also employed Palantir to connect databases across departments. Before this, most of the databases used by the CIA and FBI were siloed, forcing users to search each database individually. Now everything is linked together using Palantir.\"\n\nU.S. military intelligence used the Palantir product to improve their ability to predict locations of improvised explosive devices in its war in Afghanistan. A small number of practitioners reported it to be more useful than the United States Army's program of record, the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS-A). California Congressman Duncan D. Hunter complained of United States Department of Defense obstacles to its wider use in 2012.\n\nPalantir has also been reported to be working with various U.S. police departments, for example accepting a contract in 2013 to help the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center build a controversial license plates database for California. In 2012 New Orleans Police Department partnered with Palantir to create a predictive policing program.\n\nIn 2014, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) awarded Palantir a $41 million contract to build and maintain a new intelligence system called Investigative Case Management (ICM) to track personal and criminal records of legal and illegal immigrants. This application has originally been conceived by ICE's office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), allowing its users access to intelligence platforms maintained by other federal and private law enforcement entities. The system reached its \"final operation capacity\" under the Trump administration in September 2017.[71]\n\nPalantir took over the Pentagon's Project Maven contract in 2019 after Google decided not to continue developing AI unmanned drones used for bombings and intelligence.\n\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency\nPalantir was used by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify if Iran was in compliance with the 2015 agreement\n\nEurope\t\nThe firm has contracts relating to patient data from the British National Health Service. It was awarded an emergency, no-competition contract to mine COVID-19 patient data in 2019. In 2020 this was valued at more than \u00a323.5 million and was extended for two more years. The firm was encouraged by Liam Fox \u201cto expand their software business\u201d in Britain.\n\n\nPartnerships and Contracts::::\n\nInternational Business Machines\tEdit\nOn February 8, 2021, Palantir and IBM announced a new partnership that would use IBM's hybrid cloud data platform alongside Palantir's operations platform for building applications. The product, Palantir for IBM Cloud Pak for Data, is expected to simplify the process of building and deploying AI-integrated applications with IBM Watson. It will help businesses/users interpret and use large datasets without needing a strong technical background. Palantir for IBM Cloud Pak for Data will be available for general use in March of 2021\n\nAmazon (AWS)\tEdit\nOn March 5, 2021, Palantir announced its partnership with Amazon AWS. Palantir's ERP Suite is now optimized to run on Amazon Web Services. One of the first notable successes of the ERP suite was with BP, which was able to save about $50 million in working capital within two weeks of onboarding the system.\n\nBabylon Health\nPalantir took a stake in Babylon Health in June 2021. Ali Parsa told the Financial Times that \u201cnobody\u201d has brought some of the tech that Palantir owns \u201cinto the realm of biology and health care.\n\nPalantir Technologies is a public American software company that specializes in big data analytics. Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, it was founded by Peter Thiel, Nathan Gettings, Joe Lonsdale, Stephen Cohen, and Alex Karp in 2003. The company's name is derived from The Lord of the Rings where the magical palant\u00edri were \"seeing-stones,\" described as indestructible balls of crystal used for communication and to see events in other parts of the world.\n\nThe company is known for three projects in particular: Palantir Gotham, Palantir Metropolis, and Palantir Foundry. Palantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the United States Intelligence Community (USIC) and United States Department of Defense. In the past, Gotham was used by fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, a former US federal agency which operated from 2009 to 2015. Gotham was also used by cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor, a Canadian public-private venture which operated from 2003 to 2012. Palantir Metropolis is used by hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms. Palantir Foundry is used by corporate clients such as Morgan Stanley, Merck KGaA, Airbus, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV\n\nPalantir's original clients were federal agencies of the USIC. It has since expanded its customer base to serve state and local governments, as well as private companies in the financial and healthcare industries.",

        "selftext": "PLTR's bears main selling point is the fact that according to them, PLTR's software is too complex and expensive and requires people on site in order to be implemented. That would theoretically limit Palantir's growth and acquisition of new customers and might mean that PLTR will never grow into its valuation. However, I do not agree with them.\n\nHere is my take on this matter. First of all, the fact that PLTR's software is very complex and rather expensive has its benefits. For example, if company x spends a lot of resources and time to integrate PLTR's software into its business operations there will be a very low-chance that they will terminate their contract at least in the mid-term and that is even without taking into account the software's capabillities and the fact that it has the potential to completely transform a company's business. As the CEO himself said : \" We are trying to build the go to OS for the modern enterprise\". Also, it seems that it would be very hard for a PLTR's competitor to emerge, because the barriers for entry are very high. (Palantir spend nearly 20 years and billions of dollars developing their product). We can't say the same thing about other soft. companies that offer way simpler solutions.\n\nNow, let's talk about scalability. The main advantage that other generously valued companies like SNOW \"have over\" PLTR.  Well,. things are actually starting to change very fast. A lot of people do not know this, but everytime when PLTR enters a new industry it learns about the specific needs the companies in this industry have and that greatly helps with scalalbility. On the earnings call, they said that one of the largest european banks with over 10000 branches came to them with some problem related to money-laundering and they managed to solve it in just 2 days, while in the past it would have taken them months. Furthermore, they have recently started partnerships with other companies which will also help with the faster adoption of their software. They have put Foundry on the IBM and Amzn clouds and they have also successfully integrated BlackSky's software on top of Foundry for a government project related to geospatial intelligence. Last, but not least they have a started a new program pointed towards smaller innovative companies in which they are offering their software on a subscription-based model. That not only opens a completely new market for them, but the best thing is that on the earnings call thay have said that when implementing their software with those companies, they did not need to send forward deployed engineers and all the work was done remotely.\n\nTL:DR: Not only is Palantir trying to create a software that could be transcendental for any company, they are taking steps to make its adoption as easy and as fast as possible.",

Intel is securing its foothold in the semiconductor industry by building infrastructure, acquiring companies, and signing contracts. \n\n\tIntel wants to increase chip output and drive down its average costs to stay ahead of the competition. Intel is expanding into the automotive, consumer electronics, and foundries industry. Intel faces stiff competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung. All three companies have announced plans to increase research development by 2023-24.\n\n\tMoore's Law is key to understanding how the chip shortage occurred and how to prevent it from happening again. Intel, TSM, and Samsung have all announced multibillion-dollar research and development plans in the U.S. The market for semiconductor chips is increasing exponentially.\n\n\tThe U.S has been falling behind countries like Asia in the global semiconductor market. The U.S aims to secure global chip supply through its U.S $50B subsidy plan. The subsidy plan will boost the research and development of semiconductors in the U.S. Companies like Intel, TSM, and Samsung are now chomping at the bits.\n\n\tThe global market for semiconductors is growing exponentially. The recent semiconductor chip shortage is proof of Moore's law. The U.S plans to expand into the global market through a $50B subsidy plan to attract research development to the U.S. Chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water. You control the chips, you control the future.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. I am not an expert. Do your research.\\*\\**",

I like dividends but I'm also interested in diversifying a bit.\n\nI'm planning on getting AAPL, MSFT, IBM, ArcelorMittal, Lufthansa, WMT, KO, etc. I'd like help finding non-cyclicals (staples) and also good inflation resistant stocks. I am planning on leaving that there long-term, and I don't need to be rich, hence why I don't mind going into airlines, etc.\n\nI could also just dump it all into IWLE (Hedged MSCI All World distributing) and forget about it.

Intel is securing its foothold in the semiconductor industry by building infrastructure, acquiring companies, and signing contracts. \n\n\tIntel wants to increase chip output and drive down its average costs to stay ahead of the competition. Intel is expanding into the automotive, consumer electronics, and foundries industry. Intel faces stiff competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung. All three companies have announced plans to increase research development by 2023-24.\n\n\tMoore's Law is key to understanding how the chip shortage occurred and how to prevent it from happening again. Intel, TSM, and Samsung have all announced multibillion-dollar research and development plans in the U.S. The market for semiconductor chips is increasing exponentially.\n\n\tThe U.S has been falling behind countries like Asia in the global semiconductor market. The U.S aims to secure global chip supply through its U.S $50B subsidy plan. The subsidy plan will boost the research and development of semiconductors in the U.S. Companies like Intel, TSM, and Samsung are now chomping at the bits.\n\n\tThe global market for semiconductors is growing exponentially. The recent semiconductor chip shortage is proof of Moore's law. The U.S plans to expand into the global market through a $50B subsidy plan to attract research development to the U.S. Chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water. You control the chips, you control the future.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. I am not an expert. Do your research.\\*\\**",

They recently announced a contract with Ford. But also contracts with TESLA, IBM, General Electric and The US Navy (To mention just a few)\n\nProbility is an OTC company that actually has revenue, which is something so many of these microcaps do not...... AND they post a quite sizable Gross Profit of about \\~60%, which is phenomenal.\n\nNow they have posted very small Net losses of 200k for the past 2 years in their recent reports that have only been filed in the past few weeks. But this is due to a huge debt restructuring!!\n\nThey have cleared over $8.1m of debt in the past 2 years which amounts to over 55% of their overall debt. \n\nImpressively they have not just converted debt to shares to screw investors - They have fought to not only try to get debt write downs but have also sought debt forgiveness and when they have issued stock in place of debt it is in the form of Restricted shares! Very Clever and important!!\n\nTheir attorney has just submitted the letter to the OTC in respect of Pink Current just this week along with the last of the relevant disclosures so this will become Pink current very soon.\n\nThey have also just announced big Acquisitions and Partnerships - but too much information to go into in detail.

The original version can be found [here](https://babbl.substack.com/p/goodbye-summer-hello-all-time-high?justPublished=true).\n\n**TLDR:** Stock market news sentiment was significantly bullish (ie. optimistic into the future) driven by new all-time high S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ prices, Bitcoin eclipsing $50K benchmark, and regarding upcoming economic data to be released (jobs, housing, manufacturing reports next week). \n\n \n\n# 1. This Week\u2019s News Sentiment \ud83d\udcf0\n\nThis week\u2019s stock market news bounced back towards significantly bullish sentiment, with the average article recording an optimistic 0.30 sentiment score (which is *double* the average sentiment score posted last week) and impressive 0.67 time-sense score; this means approximately one third of all sentences written about the markets this week leaned optimistically, and an overlapping two thirds of all sentences were written in future-tense. **Both scores add up to indicate that market conversation remains highly bullish, expressing high degrees of optimism about the future.** \n\n# 2.

In their quarterly report, Best Buy announced earnings a sales increase of 20% over the past 90-days, exceeding the forecast of 17% set by management in their previous report. The consumer electronics retailer attributed much of this growth to charging higher prices for products across their computing and premium home appliance segments, citing heightened demand for technology upgrades as people are beginning to permanently embrace habits like working from home and streaming TV. The ability to raise their margins across segments has boded well, allowing the company to achieve its highest profitability rate ever of more than 6% operating margins (see [chart](https://media.ycharts.com/charts/9d766a7052b6ce9fca69af524780fd8c.png)).

Despite $CE stock bouncing back this period up 3.4% to $160.25 per share, the company saw more pessimism expressed in news articles than any other ticker this week, driven by a string of negatively connotated articles written in responses to poor performance over the previous week (during which the company\u2019s stock price fell for six consecutive days to more than 10% below its 52-week high from May). The company also announced this week that it would be offering up to \u20ac 300M towards the purchase of its outstanding 1.125% senior notes due in 2023. Compared to close competitors like Exxon Mobile Corp. ($XOM) and Eastman Chemical Co.($EMN), Celanese has underperformed its peers over the last 30 days as the earnings fervor subdues.

The company \u2014 which specializes in high-complexity pharmaceutical information services for cancer genetics diagnostic testing \u2014 has been one of the more volatile stocks on the market in recent months, as investors have shown increased interest in unproven biomedical companies of the like. While some analysts contend that such companies are worth a gamble for their potential to achieve huge profitability in a blossoming healthcare sector, others say that $NEO\u2019s balance sheet signals undue risk of permanent losses for investors. One major red flag is the company\u2019s seeming incapability of paying its lenders, as it currently sits on a thrown of more than $533.4M worth of debt (an increase of $170.9M over the previous year). While NeoGenomics reported more than $571.7M in cash during its most recent earnings report, the runway toward achieving substantial profitability is finite.

The strategic move could result in enhancements to the Creative Cloud software where Adobe derives a major part of its revenue (it includes the best-selling Premier Pro and After-Effects applications and accounted for more than 60% of the company\u2019s sales last quarter, an increase of 24% compared to last year). The move also signals the company\u2019s willingness to embrace collaboration-centric software, a trend we\u2019ve seen across many SaaS companies catalyzed by the COVID-19 work-from-home movement. The acquisition will set Adobe up nicely on the enterprise side of the pie as well, as Frame.io boasts an existing portfolio of many prominent media customers, including Netflix, Turner, and Vice.

Biggest Changes in Sentiment\n\n\ud83d\udcb1\u00a0**Cardano ($ADA) saw the largest increase in optimism expressed this week compared to last week.** The alt-coin, which now boasts the third-highest market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, made waves in news coverage this week after eclipsing the $2.00 price benchmark last week and reaching a new all-time high price of $2.39 on Wednesday on the back of [comments](https://ambcrypto.com/hoskinson-says-cardano-is-on-a-different-path-than-ethereum-bitcoin/) from its outspoken founder Charles Hoskinson.\n\n\ud83d\udc8a\u00a0**CVS Health ($CVS) recorded the largest increase in pessimism expressed this week** after announcing that it would be limiting purchases of over-the-counter rapid COVID-19 tests in the coming weeks due to excess demand. While this news draws questions about the robustness of CVS\u2019s supply chain, the main takeaway seems to be its implications about the current severity of the pandemic. Accordingly, $CVS stock price fell 1.97% on the week.\n\n\ud83d\udecd\ufe0f\u00a0**ContextLogic Inc. ($WISH) posted the biggest increase in speculative language expressed this week compared to last.** This comes a week after $WISH stock fell 9% on disappointing Q2 earnings. Throughout this week, the stock rallied back more than 5% to $6.94 on heavy volume from retail traders on r/WallStreetBets and the like, leaving [analysts](https://investorplace.com/2021/08/wish-stock-is-worth-sticking-with-even-after-its-dismal-earnings-report/) to wonder if the stock is worth sticking around for. Other highly speculative tickers in news this week include Intel ($INTC), Peloton ($PTON), Skyworks ($SKWS), and Applied Materials ($AMAT).\n\n\u2615\u00a0**Starbucks Inc. ($SBUX) received the biggest increase in reactive language expressed** driven by a multitude of articles written about its recent ability to capture consumer trends as a business \u2014 including this [piece](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/25/3-reasons-why-starbucks-could-win-as-students-retu/) which anticipates a bump in sales as college students return to in-person classes, and [social media buzz](https://twitter.com/uDontKnoDietz/status/1430589780799234059?s=20) driven by its early introduction of pumpkin spice-themed drinks -(before Labor Day? is that legal?). Other highly reactive tickers this week include Boeing ($BA), Walmart ($WMT), Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ), and IBM ($IBM).\n\n# 4. Market Mood Outlook \ud83c\udf21\ufe0f\ud83d\udd2d\n\nThis week\u2019s stock market news saw another boost in optimism back to its recent high levels as the markets peaked above new all-time high price points. Speculation in the news remains abound as we wrap up the month of August and transition into the final months of 2021. **While stocks have performed well in recent weeks on top of outstanding earnings reports across the board, inflationary pressures and economic uncertainty remain top of mind.**\n\nWe said it last week and we\u2019ll say it again: the heightened optimism in the news is a reassuring hand in today\u2019s market, but a signifcant shift in mood or economic catalysts (or some combination of the two, realistically) have the potential to bring the market back down to Earth. We will look ahead to vital economic reports (and their reactions) this week, including: housing data to be released Tuesday, manufacturing and service economy trends to be released Wednesday and Friday, and August\u2019s monthly job report due Friday.\n\nWith this in mind, good luck to all in this final week of trading before Labor Day. Stay tuned later this week for an extra newsletter about what we are reading heading into this Fall, and some in-depth analysis about what we saw in the news over the month of August.

Last week it wouldn't load Ford, today it's not loading IBM. Robinhood will immediately load any other ticker I type in. It only does this for a short amount of time though. Later in the day the option chain will load like normal. I recognize that it's still in the premarket, so maybe that has something to do with it. I don't know what Robinhood is gaining by limiting access to certain stocks, but I am wondering if anybody else is experience the same \"technical\" issue: [Option Chain Restriction](https://annotate.net/user/Payton-Cole/clips/SEC-Complaint?classid=-1&amp;checksum=db23461a7e6d9903a5cccc61c96f975f).",

The original version can be found [here](https://babbl.substack.com/p/goodbye-summer-hello-all-time-high?justPublished=true).\n\n**TLDR:** Stock market news sentiment was significantly bullish (ie. optimistic into the future) driven by new all-time high S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ prices, B!tcoin eclipsing $50K benchmark, and regarding upcoming economic data to be released (jobs, housing, manufacturing reports next week).\n\n# 1. This Week\u2019s News Sentiment \ud83d\udcf0\n\nThis week\u2019s stock market news bounced back towards significantly bullish sentiment, with the average article recording an optimistic 0.30 sentiment score (which is *double* the average sentiment score posted last week) and impressive 0.67 time-sense score; this means approximately one third of all sentences written about the markets this week leaned optimistically, and an overlapping two thirds of all sentences were written in future-tense. **Both scores add up to indicate that market conversation remains highly bullish, expressing high degrees of optimism about the future.**\n\n# 2. Most Mentioned Tickers \ud83d\udcca\n\n*Each week we analyze the number of headlines written about each stock and cryptocurrency. The most mentioned tickers in this week\u2019s news and the tickers with the biggest volume increase compared to last week are shown here:* [Most Mentioned Tickers Table 8/23-8/27](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4eeaf148-8cef-437e-b7fa-a4e10af08411_1231x1169.jpeg)\n\n\ud83c\udf4e\u00a0[**Apple Inc. ($AAPL)**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/)**: The most-mentioned ticker in stock market news coverage this week was $AAPL.** The company\u2019s stock finished the week at $148.60 per share, and showed moderate optimism expressed in news sentiment. Many of Apple\u2019s headlines this week centered on CEO Tim Cook as he celebrated his 10-year anniversary in the pilot\u2019s chair \u2014 per his contract with the company, he received 5-million shares of $AAPL stock this week to the tune of $750M, according to SEC filings. His influence on the company\u2019s trajectory over the past decade has been undeniable, as he is now responsible for creating more shareholder value than any CEO *ever* ( ($2.1 trillion dollars, shown [here](http://%20%28%242.1%20trillion%20dollars%29/)). Other headlines from Apple came this week in the form of Warren Buffett wisdom, as the billionaire Berkshire CEO stated he\u2019d be adding more shares of $AAPL to his portfolio as a hedge against rising inflation. Buffett \u2014 who himself ranks #7 on the list of all-time shareholder value produced \u2014 has been a long-time proponent of Apple, and [argues](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-stocks-buy-according-161829003.html) that now is a better time than ever to be purchasing the stock.

($RIOT)**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RIOT/)**: Riot Blockchain saw this week\u2019s biggest increase in news headlines compared to last week** after announcing its Q2 earnings report on Monday; average news sentiment expressed was moderately optimistic with a score of 0.32. The B!tcoin-mining company posted a quarterly earnings-per-share of $0.22, broadly eclipsing its consensus analyst estimates of $0.02 and signaling immense improvement from its -$0.31 EPS loss posted a year ago. In the report, Riot reported B!tcoin-mining revenues exceeding $31M, an astounding 1540% increase from last year, coupled with 70% increase in its mining revenue margins. The company attributed much of its mining capacity growth to its successful acquisition of Whinstone (an infrastructure provider), and to significant efforts related to de-risking its operational structure. With such encouraging numbers to report and with B!tcoin\u2019s price re-eclipsing the $50K benchmark, $RIOT stock price grew 5.17% to $38.57 per share \u2014 a 1,007% increase in price from the same time last year.

By our analysis, here\u2019s a look at which tickers scored the highest (and lowest) in terms of optimism, pessimism, speculation, and reaction expressed in last week\u2019s news:* [Ticker News Sentiment Chart 8/23-8/27](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed7ae131-4122-42a1-a212-303c0b9ce81a_2166x1290.png)\n\n\ud83c\udfec [**Best Buy Inc.

In their quarterly report, Best Buy announced earnings a sales increase of 20% over the past 90-days, exceeding the forecast of 17% set by management in their previous report. The consumer electronics retailer attributed much of this growth to charging higher prices for products across their computing and premium home appliance segments, citing heightened demand for technology upgrades as people are beginning to permanently embrace habits like working from home and streaming TV. The ability to raise their margins across segments has boded well, allowing the company to achieve its highest profitability rate ever of more than 6% operating margins (see [chart](https://media.ycharts.com/charts/9d766a7052b6ce9fca69af524780fd8c.png)). This renewed reassurance of strong business growth after a string of week quarters financially has raised eyebrows across Wall Street, with the likes of Jim Cramer saying that Best Buy\u2019s turnaround brings broader implications to the e-commerce landscape: \u201cBest Buy\u2019s basically replacing corporate tech support for remote works\u201d.

Despite $CE stock bouncing back this period up 3.4% to $160.25 per share, the company saw more pessimism expressed in news articles than any other ticker this week, driven by a string of negatively connotated articles written in responses to poor performance over the previous week (during which the company\u2019s stock price fell for six consecutive days to more than 10% below its 52-week high from May). The company also announced this week that it would be offering up to \u20ac 300M towards the purchase of its outstanding 1.125% senior notes due in 2023. Compared to close competitors like Exxon Mobile Corp. ($XOM) and Eastman Chemical Co.($EMN), Celanese has underperformed its peers over the last 30 days as the earnings fervor subdues.

Let's begin.\n\n**Introduction**\n\n\tHow did Intel's co-founder predict the semiconductor chip shortage of 2020-21? Intel has been making some big moves these past few months. CEO Patrick Gelsinger is doing everything from building infrastructure and acquiring companies to signing contracts and securing partnerships. Intel is on track to stay ahead of the competition.  \n\n**Moore's Law**\n\nMoore's Law states three things:\n\n* The number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years\n* Research and development increase the speed and capability of technology\n* The growth of microprocessors is exponential. \n\nWho created Moore's Law?

Intel is securing its foothold in the semiconductor industry by building infrastructure, acquiring companies, and signing contracts. \n\n\tIntel wants to increase chip output and drive down its average costs to stay ahead of the competition. Intel is expanding into the automotive, consumer electronics, and foundries industry. Intel faces stiff competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung. All three companies have announced plans to increase research development by 2023-24.\n\n\tMoore's Law is key to understanding how the chip shortage occurred and how to prevent it from happening again. Intel, TSM, and Samsung have all announced multibillion-dollar research and development plans in the U.S. The market for semiconductor chips is increasing exponentially.\n\n\tThe U.S has been falling behind countries like Asia in the global semiconductor market. The U.S aims to secure global chip supply through its U.S $50B subsidy plan. The subsidy plan will boost the research and development of semiconductors in the U.S. Companies like Intel, TSM, and Samsung are now chomping at the bits.\n\n\tThe global market for semiconductors is growing exponentially. The recent semiconductor chip shortage is proof of Moore's law. The U.S plans to expand into the global market through a $50B subsidy plan to attract research development to the U.S. Chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water. You control the chips, you control the future.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. I am not an expert. Do your research.\\*\\**",

        "selftext": "This is literally my first post ever. (so sorry if it's not a good quality DD)\n\nSo I have been working in McDonald's as a Trainee and now for a Shiftleader. You ask maybe yourself how comes McDonald's in the game?\n\nLet me explain it to you.\n\nOur IT \"partner\" was always IBM. They did ofc the IT things, like new updates, problem solvings etc..\nI always complain to my Boss about them, like waiting for 3 hours in a phone call bcs the systems are down and super laggy. The last weeks it was even terrible. We couldn't use our system now for almost 2 weeks. It means we can't even pay money in the bank bcs we can't transfer in the system.\nAfter a very long shift I was very angry and talking with my franchise manager about it. And he slipped something out very very important.\n\nHe told me, not to worry about it too much, bcs McDonald's just made a new contract with somebody. \n\nFirst of all, I didnt even realized what the fuck just happened. I went home, checked my positions, stocks as always. At this moment I was like wait a minute. Who the hell is even our new IT company?\nI immediately wrote to my Boss (Restraunt Manager) about it if he can told me. He was more surprised than me bcs it's not public yet. He sad, yes and asked me how the fuck did I get those informations.\nHe told me not to tell anyone. He knows that I trade a lot and talk a lot about it. And he just went straight, whatever, here is the Name Atos SE, find them and show me too so I can buy too.\n\nI live in Germany so I really don't know how big it is, since there is nothing public yet. He also told me that they canceled the Contract with IBM in January,2021.\nAnd they made a new contract with Atos SE. The contract goes public at September 1..\n\nI would love to hear some informations from another countrys if they also have the same situation.",

        "selftext": "In summary, I expect another wave of lockdowns to go into effect, but they will go into effect too late, and do too little to have any effect on containing the next COVID19 Delta Variant outbreak. \n\nUnfortunately, I also don't think there's any market play beyond building up 12 months of cash for rent/daily expenses, and to stockpile on toilet paper now before the next shopping spree starts.\n\nIn general, when dealing with disease, the public health options are development of a cure, development of vaccine, or implementation of quarantine. Remdesivir is the only available treatment, and requires IV application, and thus is not effective for widespread use. Regarding quarantine, I point you to the news.\n\nRegarding the vaccine, it seems that the recent mRNA vaccines only have \\~50% efficacy in preventing infection. The CDC tracked an outbreak in Massachusetts due to a July 4th party in Provincetown, MA\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm?s\\_cid=mm7031e2\\_w](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm?s_cid=mm7031e2_w)\n\nThe study shows a nearly 1:1 infection count of vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals. \n\nFor those of you not in the know, this is one of the biggest LGBTQ parties in the US, so is pretty left leaning. We can assume a pretty high vaccination rate. This is actually good for vaccine efficacy due to Simpson's paradox, but it does show that breakthrough infection is real, and not to be underestimated. The CDC did not estimate vaccine efficacy and warned not to do so due to small sample sizes.\n\nThe UK did.\n\n[http://hdl.handle.net/10044/1/90800](http://hdl.handle.net/10044/1/90800)\n\nBased on their REACT study, which randomly samples ALL UK residents, and not just sick people, they estimate a vaccine efficacy of 50%-60%. Do note that the error bars on these numbers are BIG, like 20%-95% big.\n\nThe vaccine seems to be on par to a flu shot in terms of efficacy. Unfortunately, flu has an r0 of 1-2. The original COVID19 had an r0 of 2-3, and delta looks to be 4-9.\n\nGiven delta is about 2x-3x more transmissible, and the vaccine is 1/2 has effective, lockdowns and masking are inconsistent, I'd estimate we're going to see COVID spread on par to the early pandemic. We're currently back to infection numbers similar to Nov/Dec 2020. Even if all vaccine hesitancy vanished overnight, given the mediocre efficacy coupled with high r0, vaccinations must be coupled with social distancing to control the spread. \n\nGiven human nature and politics, a lockdown NOW could theoretically control the spread. That is politically unviable. A lockdown later will be too late due to exponential growth, but will occur anyway once bodies start to hit the floor. \n\nThe doctor's haven't figured out why the vaccine isn't working, it could be waning immunity amongst the early vaccinations, or just a poor match. This would necessitate a booster, which the WHO just announced a moritorium on so poor countries can get vaccinated, or a delta specific booster, which Pfizer and Moderna are working on, but there's no data if it works or not. Of course, rich countries will likely give the WHO the finger, but this only helps if this is waning immunity and not vaccine mismatch.\n\nSo, what's this mean for the markets? Likely \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b \n\nBut in the mean time, everything's stupid expensive and I have no idea if/when this would occur. So, I'll give the personal finance advice to keep 6-12 months of cash to pay for rent/food if everything goes to shit. Even assuming that an uncontrolled pandemic occurs, I'd estimate a COVID-19 mortality of 1%-3% to not permanently cripple the economy. Unless your country is like Peru with a case mortality rate of \\~10%, in which case you're pretty f\\*cked. \n\n[https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality)\n\nBoomers are probably going to get killed by this virus, so investing in Zacks Funeral Services industry may be a good call: SCI, HI, MATW, CSV. Unfortunately, the market looks like they already priced this in.\n\nSo, stay safe. Get vaccinated. Socially distance. But it probably won't be enough.",

        "selftext": "# Major US indices pulled back Friday, but not all that much. I believe we are almost at a tipping point for an after summer correction, which will pull down the market across the board, gearing up for a run into the holiday season.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1bcspupbkue71.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02a41e032419f26faad300dd4bb7390095aacc6e\n\n Only one alert triggered Friday and that was an $**ABNB** put.  After starting on this project, I believe that $**ABNB** is overvalued and doesn't have the sustainability that the current market price implies. Therefore, I've put in two put alerts. Go small.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ejhnm9agkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40397c1f5393200798dd4c6033b186b808f6d782\n\n A better positions that I would prefer is entering into a bigger put at the YTD VWAP.

If **Tesla** pulls back to the 50MA, I'll buy more calls. However, there is a chance that $**TSLA** keeps running next week therefore I am not interested in short term puts.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xusig0cqkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22d5c663bbebc6b93cb2bf8f818047304dcf42da\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n $**MT** is looking a little bit overbought, and even though I and many other analysts are bullish long term, I believe that this can be a good time to lock in some quick profits.

The 180MA is approaching a large volume shelf that indicates a lot of buying will happen there. More so, the YTD VWAP is lurking at those levels as well. Long term bullish on **Salesforce**, and August is historically one of the best months for the stock. October or November calls, look tempting around the $230 level.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/udz6h6jskue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07559317d5d5618e74012c3ab7e3ae858b4b86db\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n$**TSM**, **Taiwan Semiconductor**, is, I believe, an undervalued company that has a fair price of around $130+. This is a great opportunity to pick up calls for November or EOY. September and October are some of the best months for **TSM** according to Trend Spider's Seasonality Chart. At current levels, the 50, 180, and a huge volume shelf are converging. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/21u9xyiukue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c03a9034effbf1c0594ba5aa34a48a6db2978b4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n $**AXP** has had an amazing run this year August is one of the better months over the past decade. I believe consumer spending has and will increase and monthly calls or vertical spreads are perfect here.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jpgpa2hvkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c2b50116bebade25f92b68a5e8f9b4437295997\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **$AAP, Advance Auto Parts**, is still an interesting play for me. Everyone has probably heard by now that used car prices have gone up a lot. If we can get a consolidation around the 50MA, I think it is worth it to buy calls. However, I won't be waiting much longer for this one. I'll give it another week.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g655tlewkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0966c88748b44fd8f3317333e8233339c43c3644\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n $**VRT** also had a good week, up from the 50MA. I'm waiting for a resistance bounce to enter some short term puts.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r3kkaddxkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87d502222fa3701d87bf608c6284efa2dbc8fad2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I'm still waiting for **$X, US Steel**, to pull back to the 180ma. As you can see last it just came off a 180ma bounce, but not quite low enough to hit my trigger. I'm a patient man and I'll wait again. This is a good play going into October and November, so we have some time to enter.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/09oy8sgykue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea114b1ade318baa53487eac738ca13ff3002470\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **$AI** is to overhyped, and puts at upper resistance will pay significantly in my opinion. I've reupped the time on this alert and will wait for a bounce to enter.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/snkwzjizkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acdd5c9d6fa626471ff21cf572b84a84a18343c7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n One of my favorite shorts is $**EBON**. Probably by now you know I have personal experience with this company. Sort them into the ground, please. This time the alert is set to trigger at the 50 MA and I'll go into a bigger position.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bgr3pqj0lue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20bef00a73ba2a1e68a0f2e2af0930cede9b9a95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n $**ETSY** is next and the interesting thing about this stock, since its IPO, it has never had a positive October. I will be keeping this in mind when I buy calls at support. September usually is a good month. Getting in and out of this one is most likely the key.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/whhewch1lue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58fd6d95a96e7fb55d0089c593522f3863b47043\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n ^(Disclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.)",

        "selftext": "**The Challenge:** *Double a $30K account in four months - 88 trading days, without using low float momentum trades. This is the update after two weeks, or ten trading days.*\n\n**The Reason:** *I set up this account specifically for this challenge.  Posting trades from my regular account was not instructive - mainly because, the trades were not relatable (e.g. most people are not buying 10 ITM TSLA calls that are 3 weeks out).  However, I wanted to show traders that it is possible to quickly grow your Day Trading account without having to do low float momentum trades (which is a fast way for traders, especially new traders, to lose a lot of money).  Instead, this challenge intends to utilize foundational Day Trading methods (i.e. Relative Strength to SPY) in a completely transparent way.  The amount I chose to start with was $30, as the federal guidelines requires $25K to Day Trade and I added $5K for some cushion.*\n\nIn order to reach this goal I would need to average $341 a day.  \n\nEvery trade since this challenge has started has been live posted in r/RealDayTrading as they happen.\n\nI am also providing the link to the accounts' TraderSync log.  Here is the updated log as of the end of day today:\n\n[https://shared.tradersync.com/hariseldon2021](https://shared.tradersync.com/hariseldon2021)\n\nI have not finished updating the \"setups\" and \"mistakes\" in Tradersync, I will do that this weekend.\n\n*Note: There are still some open positions that TraderSync does not report until they close, including calls for* ***DDOG*** *and puts for* ***CL.***  *As well as an open* ***/ES*** *short.  Thus, the total is overstated by about $1,700.  Only closed trades are included.*\n\nAlso being carried into next week are **IR** calls, **MA** puts, **SFIX** puts, **SNAP** calls and **SPCE** calls.\n\nThe total account value is at $35,321.48, almost $1,000 over goal.  \n\nCommissions and Fees paid so far: $669.82\n\nTotal number of trades: 223 - with 30 trades considered \"Breakeven\" (*within $25)* and 8 open trades.  Of the 185 remaining trades that were either winners or losers:\n\nWinners: 139 - 75.1%\n\nLosers: 46 - 24.9%\n\n**Notes:** Computer issues limited me to only a few trades today, and I took part of yesterday off.\n\nI made several mistakes (**PINS, MRNA**) that I outlined in other posts, and Ameritrade closed a lotto trade last Friday which cost me roughly $500 in profit. \n\nThis challenge is not for me to prove anything about my trading - to be honest, I do not need to - I have traded for a living for the past 3 years, make a good living out of it and have absolutely no need for validation.  However, after posting on the various trading forums here and speaking to hundreds of traders over the past two years, several things have become clear:\n\n1) Most people believe Day Trading is primarily *Gap n Go* strategies, which is what most so-called \"gurus\" market to people.  **This is not Day Trading**.  In fact, this method is *extremely difficult* and the last thing new traders should be trying.\n\n2) Everyone else believes that it is impossible to be a consistently profitable Day Trader.  Now I know this isn't true, because I am one.  Many of the professional Day Traders I know, also know this isn't true, since they do it as well.  Unfortunately, people here got it into their heads that 95% fail and technical analysis is bullshit.  Well most people *do fail* but that is because nobody tells them how difficult it is, and how much time (about two years of training) and effort it takes.\n\nSo I set up r/RealDayTrading to be a place where people can learn how to actually do this for a living.  I am not selling anything, have no desire to have any channel and do not have a product.   Once again, don't need it, don't want it.   However, I did want a place where other pros could come and teach people how to Day Trade without constantly being attacked by trolls (shocking I know, but Reddit has trolls).  I am very thankful that several of them agreed to come on board as mods and have been posting excellent content.   However, advice only goes so far - hence, this challenge.\n\nI hope some of you are finding it helpful.\n\nSee you next week!\n\nBest - H.S.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 2, 2021**\n\nStocks continued volatility from last week, with the three major indexes opening the day in the green before turning lower towards the end in the first trading session in August. As has been the case for at least a few weeks now, it seems the market will continue to perform a careful balancing act between record corporate profits and expectations for economic expansion and concerns surrounding the highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant and inflation. \n\nSo far, 59% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85%, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 20009. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. \n\nIn the last few weeks, concerns over the coronavirus Delta variant are increasing, which inevitably, has injected volatility in the markets. Last week, the CDC reversed their indoor mask policy. The agency now recommends that even fully vaccinated individuals begin once again wearing masks indoors in areas with high coronavirus transmission and in K-12 schools. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Director of the CDC said, \u201cIn areas with substantial and high transmission, CDC recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks in public, indoor settings to help prevent the spread of the delta variant, and protect others. This includes schools\u201d. \n\nAs I have said before and will explain further below, while the surge in cases is unfortunate, it is important to note that the surge is largely concentrated in areas with high vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, while cases are surging, thankfully, hospitalizations and death rates are much lower when compared to previous surges, a sign that the vaccine is doing its job. While it doesn\u2019t prevent one from becoming infected, it greatly reduces the possibility for complications. \n\nIn the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with new cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 78,433 as of July 31, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, it is important to note, despite the surge the 7-day average of deaths is 360, once again according to John Hopkins University. \n\nAccording to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, \u201cThere is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.\u201d Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.\n\nMoreover, last week, the Fed released its July Monetary Policy Report largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed\u2019s stated goals. The report also acknowledged potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if \u201cappropriate risks arise\u201d. The statement read, \u201cIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* In a big industry move, Square (SQ) acquired Australian fin-tech company Afterpay, which allows customers to pay in installments, for $29 billion in an all-stock transaction. Square released a statement that read, \u201cSquare plans to integrate Afterpay into its existing Seller and Cash App business units, enable even the smallest of merchants to offer BNPL \\[buy now, pay later\\] at checkout, give Afterpay consumers the ability to manage their installment payments directly in Cash App, and give Cash App customers the ability to discover merchants and BNPL offers directly within the app.\u201d\n* Along with the Afterpay announcement, SQ unexpectedly announced Q2 earnings, which showed gross profit growing 91% thanks to strong Cash App and Seller ecosystem growth. The company reported revenue of $4.68 billion, 87% growth year-on-year but below the the $5.03 billion expected. Earnings per share skyrocketed to $0.66 compared to $0.30 expected.\n* Google announced it was moving away from Qualcomm (QCOM) and would begin manufacturing its own in-house processors for new Pixel phones launching later this year. This follows a similar move to what Apple (AAPL) did to Intel (INTC).\n* Ford Motors (F) Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said the company hopes to reinstate a dividend by the end of the year. He said, \u201cWe've had a really tough period of time here the last couple of years with Covid last year and now the chip shortage. We plan to bring the dividend back as soon as we can...depending on how the second half goes with \\[computer\\] chips, it could be as early as the end of this year.\u201d Ford suspended its dividend last year.\n* Electric vehicle sales in China more than tripled in July compared to a year ago. \n   * Nio delivered 7,931 vehicles in July, 124% increase YoY\n   * Xpeng (XPEV) delivered 8,040 vehicles, 228% increase YoY\n   * Li (LI) delivered 8,589 vehicles, 251% increase YoY\n* \\*\\***Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Abbvie (ABBV) with two target raises. Stock currently around $115\n   * Mizuho from $128 to $131 at Buy. \n   * SVB Leerink from $144 to $145 at Outperform\n* Avantor (AVTR) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target $45 at Buy. Stock currently around $37\n* Chevron (CVX) target raised by Raymond James from $120 to $125 at Outperform.

        "selftext": "In my last post, I went over how to value stocks based on the discounted cash flow of a company. If you haven't read it yet, [start here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o8ygn4/how_stocks_are_valued_part_1_discounted_cash_flow/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) This post will go over ***relative valuation***, rather than the absolute value of a company.\n\n# Comparables\n\nWhen you're buying a house, how do you determine what the fair value of the house is? Appraisers often look at similar homes in the neighborhood to get an idea of how much the house should be worth.\n\nIf the house on 123 Potato Street were similar to all the other houses on Potato Street but was selling for 20% more than the average, odds are it's not going to sell. This concept of comparing assets to similar assets also applies in stock valuation.\n\n# How Do We Compare Stocks?\n\nRemember that stocks just represent a fraction of a company's future earnings. For similar companies with similar industries, earnings, and, $1 in earnings for company A should be worth the same as $1 of earnings for company B.\n\nA lemonade stand that makes $10 on Potato Street should be worth about the same to an investor as a lemonade stand that makes $10 somewhere else in the same neighborhood. If one is valued at $100 and the other at $120, the first lemonade stand might be undervalued.\n\nThere are several metrics we can use to compare stocks. Some ratios include:\n\n1. Price to Earnings (P/E). This ratio is calculated by dividing the stock price by its earnings per share. For example, WFC and BAC are (at a glance) similar companies since they're both in the same industry. It makes sense that they have similar P/E ratios, with WFC at 13.16 and BAC at 12.83. However, we see that BAC is relatively cheaper as we pay less for each dollar of earnings compared to WFC.\n2. Price to Sales (P/S). This is similar to P/E, except that we compare the stock price to the revenue of a company instead of its earnings. This is good for companies that aren't profitable yet, since comparing negative P/E ratios seems a bit silly. Uber, for example, has a P/S of 7.40. If we use only P/S to compare Uber to Lyft, which has a P/S of 8.71, UBER seems to be the better investment since we're paying less for each dollar of revenue.\n3. Price to Earnings Growth (PEG). This ratio measures the stock price as a ratio to the company's earnings growth (typically over the next 1-3 years). This ratio is calculated as the P/E divided by the earnings growth rate. For example, if AAPL has a P/E of 28.3x and a growth rate of 1.3%, AAPL has a PEG of 22.6x. MSFT has a higher P/E (35.09x), but because of its higher growth rate of 8.9%, has a much lower PEG of 3.92x.\n\nWe can use these ratios (and others) to identify whether stocks are relatively undervalued compared to other similar stocks, or we can compare stocks to the industry average. If we buy companies that are relatively cheaper compared to their peers, we should (in theory) perform better over time.\n\n# Short Term Relative Value Trading Strategies\n\nWe can also make relative value in the short term. \n\nA common retail trader\u2019s strategy is to buy a stock for a few days or a few weeks, hoping to scalp a few dollars and turn a profit. However, what if the market drops? Your stock could outperform the market by only falling 3% while the market falls by 10%. You were right but you still lost money due to your market exposure.\n\nHedge funds also bet on stocks, except instead of looking for a return on a single stock, they bet on stocks going up or down relative to another. They buy stock A and short-sell stock B, hoping A will outperform B. This is aptly named the Long-Short trading strategy or the pairs trade. If A falls 3% but B drops 5%, the hedge fund makes money overall.\n\n# Short Term Relative Value Trade Examples\n\nHow can we apply this to our trading? What if we think GME will outperform AMC? At $161 its may or may not be a good idea to be strictly long GME. However, we can hedge by shorting AMC. If all meme stocks crash, we still make money as long as GME doesn\u2019t fall as much as AMC does. If GameStop stays flat, we make money when AMC falls. (Of course, if you think AMC is the winner you can just inverse the above strategy)\n\nWe can apply this strategy to stocks in similar industries such as GM/F, V/MA, and KO/PEP.\n\nA second example would be a pairs trade I closed earlier last week.\n\nGoogle has two classes of (publicly traded) shares: GOOGL (Class A) which has voting rights, and GOOG (Class C) which has none.\n\nTheoretically, GOOGL should always be more expensive because they have voting rights, but because Alphabet is conducting share buybacks of GOOG exclusively, GOOGL was cheaper for a while - [We can see this in the trading view chart here.](https://imgur.com/a/Qng5vyG)\n\nBy buying GOOGL and shorting GOOG, I\u2019m betting the gap between the two stocks will close. I don\u2019t care if the market rises, falls, or goes sideways. I don\u2019t even care if google falls 50%. The only thing I\u2019m betting on is that GOOGL will be the same price as GOOG eventually, and after Alphabet announced it would start buybacks of both share classes, the gap closed.",

These risks stem from the whipsaw regulatory caprices of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Well, now, here's some more of that same talk.\n\nChinese gaming stocks were in free fall after CCP state-run media (like most large companies, media in China is subject to state control) suddenly referred to gaming as \"spiritual opium,\" and then deleted the remark, letting shares regain some of their losses. Deleted or not, this pronouncement harbinges future CCP crackdown and intervention in names like Tencent, Bilibili, and XD. The CCP sparked similar fears recently vis-a-vis Chinese tech and internet names, as well as education names, see, e.g. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/us-listed-china-education-stocks-plunge-as-beijing-regulators-crack-down.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/us-listed-china-education-stocks-plunge-as-beijing-regulators-crack-down.html) . The CCP has particularly targeted foreign listed companies for crackdown, especially those listed in the US. Again, the message could not be clearer: China has placed foreign--and, especially, US--investors in its crosshairs. The CCP is purposefully swinging its weight around to remind everyone who is in control in China; this is their overriding concern, to maintain control. It would not do to have Jack Ma, for example, stand up to Secretary General Xi the way, say, Mark Zuckerberg recently stood up to a certain orange-hued Tariff Man by banning him from FB. The CCP is about maintaining power and face: it is not about to let such a thing happen, even if it has to inflict a lot of pain on a lot of people.\n\nNow, there is nothing wrong with government deciding on and implementing policy to shape its society in a given way, and there is nothing wrong with government incentivizing the public to go along with it; that is indeed the nature and essence of government, and every government has the right to do this, including the CCP. We have heard they wish to curb monopoly power among the tech sector; to make education more broadly available to meet public demand by nationalizing those services; and now, it appears, they wish to curb the influence of gaming among the Chinese populace. All well and good.\n\nThe problem here, however, is that the CCP does not do this in a measured, deliberate, transparent, and predictable way; it instead acts whimsically and capriciously, without warning and without any attempt to gradually telegraph its plans to the investing public so that the market has time to react in a more measured fashion. This stands in stark contradistinction to the deliberative, telegraphed, and gradual process that marks US and European lawmaking and regulation, where statutes like the US' Administrative Procedures Act (APA) mandate public comment and interactive dialogue in regulated industries. The CCP's willingness to act in such a way is deliberate: the party moves swiftly and without warning not only to implement its goals as expeditiously as possible, but also to remind people--and especially foreign and US investors--who is in charge. Lack of reciprocity thoroughly characterizes the Chinese/Rest-of-the-World relationship, and this business with the gaming stocks today is one more example of that lack of reciprocity; other governments do not treat Chinese investors like China treats its foreign investors. It would not surprise me if the CCP turned around and ordered app stores to remove gaming apps within a week, just as was done with Didi.\n\nMany other r-slurs and I have reminded our fellows that the CCP could nullify the VIE contracts that allow Chinese companies to trade on US exchanges; they could pocket all your hard-earned money in a heartbeat, just as quickly as they've struck out at gaming industries today. Far be it from me to tell you where to put your money. But today's action vis-a-vis Tencent and other gaming companies presents another opportunity to repeat: be aware of the outsized regulatory and governmental risks imposed by the CCP if you are going to go long on juicy-looking Chinese stocks.\n\nVarious obligatory INB4s:\n\n\"Gosh, Romulus Augustus, China wouldn't shoot itself in the foot and injure its standing in the world by bilking foreign investors and taking all their money, leaving them high and dry.\" Recall what was done with the National Security Law in Hong Kong, in violation of a treaty the CCP signed (see one such recent arrest pursuant to that law: [https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/hong-kong-investigates-china-anthem-booing-during-olympics-broadcast-mall-2021-07-30/](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/hong-kong-investigates-china-anthem-booing-during-olympics-broadcast-mall-2021-07-30/)) . Recall also that the CCP signed the Paris Accords, and before the ink on their signature was even dry, turned immediately around and built a metric ass-ton (yes, that's a technical unit of measurement) of new coal plants: [https://e360.yale.edu/features/despite-pledges-to-cut-emissions-china-goes-on-a-coal-spree](https://e360.yale.edu/features/despite-pledges-to-cut-emissions-china-goes-on-a-coal-spree) . The CCP does not care overmuch for niceties or proprieties: they will think nothing of lulling you, and then taking your money and rugpulling you without compunction or hesitation if they deem the time is right.\n\n\"Gosh, Romulus Augustus, China is just getting several monopolistic and socially toxic industries under control, you should want the increased competition and improved Chinese society that will come from these measures.\" As I said before, all well and good. But do it in a measured, telegraphed, transparent, and predictable way: don't make a point of purposefully rugpulling and whipsawing foreign investors in a way other governments don't do with Chinese investors.\n\n\"Gosh, Romulus Augustus, isn't this just racist and anti-Chinese? Why are you so bigoted against Chinese people? #StopAsianHate. \" It\u2019s racist to point out that the CCP is bilking investors here of *all* ethnicities and creeds? I think not. Moreover, lobbing this accusation is a common wumao ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50\\_Cent\\_Party)/tankie/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent_Party)/tankie/) r/ sino tactic often used on social media. They\u2019ve learned they can deflect from the CCP\u2019s misdeeds by crying that any criticism of the government or enterprise is racist. But like Eric Carmen and the Raspberries, let's go all the way! Assume I am indeed a racist (I\u2019m not). How does that factually alter, rebut, or contend with the substance of anything I\u2019ve said here?\n\n\"Gosh, Romulus Augustus, don't you wish the US government had taken some action against its bad apples like Enron, Theranos, Your Hometown Deli, Lordstown, et al.?\" Someone will inevitably bring up Enron like they always do when this topic comes up, and, like always, it will drive me absolutely nuts. Besides the fact Enron was decades ago, it spawned disclosure and accounting laws that American companies now must comply with. Elizabeth Holmes (and that affected husky voice I'm sure some of you degens around here have busted one out to) is facing down a court for the shit she pulled with Theranos. NKLA somehow still has a 4 billion market cap despite Trevor Milton's crazy lies and fraudulent statements for which he's now facing criminal charges. Again, the US takes action against its bad apples in a measured, orderly, transparent way when compared with the CCP.\n\nI can already hear xupamos87, BVB\\_TallMorty, and the China Apologist/China Bull Crew now: \"Gosh, Romulus Augustus, the Chinese stocks present a great opportunity, boast great fundamentals, and I've already realized sick gains on DOYU and NIO and a whole host of others!\" More power to you! I'm glad you made money off these names! But that's besides the point of this post and other posts on this topic. The overarching point is, the CCP imposes regulatory risks and rugpulls foreign investors in a way that other governments don't do to Chinese investors: the point of this and other similar posts is to describe this risk if you're going to try to make money off these names, and also to point out the lack of reciprocity between China and the rest of the world. And as for the stellar fundamentals, well, they are cheap for a reason.\n\n\"Gosh, Romulus Augustus, the CCP has made clear it wants to work more closely with US regulators like the SEC to clean up its act and become more transparent.\" OK. Words are great, but actions are better. At this point in time, it sounds like a strategic attempt to lull US investors into a sense of security before yet another rug gets pulled or more foreign money gets siphoned off. Remember how I said above that the CCP signed the Paris Accords and then turned around and built more coal plants? (See, e.g., [https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-50474824](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-50474824) ). It strikes me the same is going on here with promises of greater transparency and cooperation with the SEC. China lulled the rest of the world into hamstringing itself to meet agreed-upon emissions targets while going full-steam (or coal) ahead on its own plans. Lull into a sense of security, then go back on your word in bad faith, and then pull ahead while others are struggling behind in an attempt to conform in good faith to the agreement and mutual commitments made.\n\n\"Gosh, Romulus Augustus, the US is so awful compared to China, how can you trash China and not recognize the US is evil, racist, and has done terrible things in the past?\" I hear this one a lot from younger-sounding Gen Z folks and tankies whenever the topic of China treating foreign investors poorly is brought up. I don't dispute the US bears its share of sin. But we are talking about problems today that are directly affecting all of us and our money. And China behaves less transparently and fairly towards foreign investors in its companies than the US behaves towards Chinese investors in US companies. That is the problem, and it is a problem that deserves addressing, regardless of what the US has or has not done.\n\nBottom Line: Be very, very aware of the outsized regulatory risks posed by the CCP that you will not face from the US or EU governments. Factor those risks accordingly into your personal risk tolerance matrix when going long Chinese stocks.",

        "selftext": "Recently, Bright Health Group landed on the New York Stock Exchange and made $924 million in its initial public offering. The IPO pricing values Bright Health at $11.23 billion, according to\u00a0[a report](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/tiger-global-backed-bright-health-raises-924-mln-us-ipo-2021-06-24/)\u00a0from Reuters. The startup insurer initially priced its IPO at $18 per share, and issued 51.3 million shares. At present, Bright Health's stock price is $16.7 and the market value is $10.277 billion.\n\nFounded in 2015, Bright Health is a medical health insurance and technology company. Through cooperation with top suppliers in the medical system, it establishes connections between medical consumers and suppliers, and is committed to providing users with reasonable medical insurance solutions\u00a0and high-quality medical services through advanced technology.\n\nThe company raised $500 million in a late-stage funding round in September last year from investors such as Tiger Global Management, T. Rowe Price Associates and Blackstone Group Inc\u00a0[(BX.N)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/BX.N), bringing total equity raised to over $1.5 billion.\n\nIn 2020, Bright Health generated more than 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in revenue, an increase of more than three times compared with the 280 million U.S. dollars in 2019. The total revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was US$874.6 million. While revenue has increased, the company's losses have been expanding. From 2018 to 2020, the company lost 62.6 million U.S. dollars, 125.3 million U.S. dollars and 248.4 million U.S. dollars, respectively, and its net loss almost doubled.\n\n**Business Model: 2C+2B**\n\nBright Health runs two businesses, NeueHealth(2B)\u00a0and Bright HealthCare(2C). In particular, Bright HealthCare sells Medicare and commercial health insurance to about 623,000 consumers in\u00a014 states of\u00a0the United States. NeueHealth offers virtual and in-person clinical care to patients through affiliated primary care clinics.\n\n**Bright HealthCare: diverse strategies serve different groups of people**\n\nBright HealthCare offers health plans for individuals and families, small businesses and employees, and Medicare Advantage plans for seniors.\u00a0Five years ago, Bright Healthcare only offered a single product in one state, and the number of users was only 10,765. As of now, this department operates in 14 states across the United States, and plans to expand to more states by 2022.\n\nCurrently, Bright HealthCare provides health care benefits to approximately 623,000 consumers. Customers include: 1) Commercial customers. Bright HealthCare provides commercial health plans in 11 states, including personal and family plans and employer plans, serving approximately 515,000 people; 2) Medicare Advantage users. Bright HealthCare provides Medicare Advantage products in 11 states, serving approximately 108,000 people, usually focusing on high-risk groups with special needs.\n\nIn addition, Bright Healthcare operates a small Managed Medicaid business in California. Regarding self-funded employer support, Bright Healthcare is currently establishing ASO business (ASO, administrative services only) for self-paying employers through multiple strategic partners. Administrative services only (ASO) refers to an agreement that companies use when they fund their\u00a0[employee benefit plan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/employer_sponsored_plan.asp)\u00a0but hire an outside vendor to administrate it. Bright Healthcare\u00a0believes that to continue expanding self-insurance market is\u00a0an important part of its diversification strategy. Bright HealthCare also participates in a number of specialized plans and is the nation\u2019s third largest provider of Chronic Condition Special Needs Plans (C-SNPs).\n\nFrom 2018 to 2020, Bright Healthcare\u2019s total premiums were US$127 million, US$272 million, and US$1.18 billion, with growth rates of 114.17% and 333.82%, respectively. The growth rate was tripled.\u00a0Its commercial insurance premium income was 111 million U.S. dollars, 236 million U.S. dollars, and 692 million U.S. dollars, with growth rates of 112.61% and 193.22%, respectively. Commercial premiums accounted for 87.64%, 86.77%, and 58.66% of total premiums, respectively, and their proportions dropped to about half in 2020. Medicare Advantage\u00a0premium income was 15.71 million U.S. dollars, 36.03 million U.S. dollars and 480 million U.S. dollars, with growth rates of 129.34% and 1232.42%, respectively. The growth rate in 2020 is particularly astonishing. MA premiums accounted for 12.36%, 13.23% and 41.34% of total premiums, respectively, and their proportions increased to nearly half in 2020.\n\nIn terms of users, the number of commercial users in 2020 was 145,000, and this number soared to 482,000 in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 232.41%. The number of MA users was\u00a062,000, and reached 67,000\u00a0in the first quarter of 2021. Although Bright Health has achieved amazing growth in both premiums and the number of users, combined with its acquisitions, both the surge in users and the increase in premiums were driven by Bright Healthcare's acquisition of Brand New Day.  \n\n**NeueHealth: Healthcare services empower 2C business**\n\nNeueHealth is a comprehensive medical institution that provides local and personalized care services in a variety of ways. Its services include: \n\nIntegrated Care Delivery \u2014 Operating clinics that provide comprehensive care to all populations.\n\nBright Health Network \u2014Ecosystem of Care Partners.\n\nValue Services Organization \u2014 Empowering high-performing primary care practices and care delivery organizations to succeed in their evolution towards risk-bearing care delivery.\n\nIts income consists of two parts, namely service fees and premium income. Service fees\u00a0mainly refer to NeueHealth affiliated medical group\u2019s pay-for-service\u00a0income and\u00a0the network service income generated by Bright Health Network under NeueHealth; the premium income refers to NeueHealth\u2019s value service organization and its affiliated medical group\u2019s income from taking charge of patients\u2019\u00a0medical care.\n\nIn 2020, NeueHealth's service fee income was 29.35 million U.S. dollars, and premium income was 7.79 million U.S. dollars.\u00a0In the first quarter of 2021, service fee income increased by US$8.1 million year-on-year, reaching US$15.6 million, mainly due to the increase in revenue from the inter-company network contract service of the Bright HealthCare division. Premium income increased by US$26.7 million year-on-year, an increase of 1,330.8% to US$28.7 million. Similarly, the increase in revenue was driven by the acquisition of PMA.\n\nAs of April 2021, NeueHealth works with over 200,000 care provider partners and operates 28 managed and affiliated risk-bearing clinics within its integrated care delivery system. Through those risk-bearing clinics, NeueHealth maintains nearly 75,000 unique patient relationships as of April 2021, approximately\u00a030,000 of which are served through value-based arrangements, across multiple payors. In addition to the\u00a0directly managed and affiliated clinics, NeueHealth manages care for an additional 33 clinics through its Value Services Organization.\n\n**Competitive advantages: technology empowerment + extensive customer base + full chain**\n\nAfter summarizing Bright Health's business model, we found that the company's competitive advantages include: extensive customer base coverage, technological empowerment, and full-chain services.\n\nOn the customer side, Bright Healthcare offers plans covering all groups\u00a0of people. In particular, the currently developing Managed Medicaid business covers children and low-income groups; the personal and family plans in the business plan section cover self-employed and part-time groups; Medicare Advantage covers groups over 65 years old; and Employer ASO covers self-financing employer groups. At the same time, many of Bright Healthcare's professional programs target the chronically ill population.\u00a0In other words, regardless of customers\u2019\u00a0income, age, work or the way to obtain insurance, Bright Health can provide products or services in a direct or indirect manner.\n\nHowever, at present, Bright Healthcare\u2019s two largest customer groups are business plans and MA groups. Both in premium income and customer groups, business plans make up the most part. Products and services for other groups are still in their infancy, and the development of these product lines in the future will still require a lot of effort.\n\nIn technology, Bright Health\u00a0has developed\u00a0\u201cBright Health Intelligent Operating System\u201d or \u201cBiOS\u201d. It \u00a0refers to Bright Health\u2019s end-to-end intelligent technology platform comprised of consumer, care delivery, and administrative solutions, all designed to enable an integrated, aligned, and consumer-focused healthcare ecosystem.  \n\nBiOS uses the powerful data generated by Care Partner model to achieve integration of the healthcare system, including smart data center Consumer360 and the solution DocSquad for consumers and suppliers. \u201cConsumer360\u201d refers to Bright Health\u2019s proprietary intelligent data hub, which aggregates clinical and administrative data, as well as information derived from the consumer experience (i.e., from call center and other consumer interactions) and data relating to Social Determinants of Health. It could create a personalized digital care plan to empower DocSquad.  \n\n\n\u201cDocSquad\u201d refers to Bright Health\u2019s consumer and care provider solution, comprised of a purpose-built set of tools and experiences connecting consumers with the organizations responsible for their care, while giving providers a 360-degree view of a consumer to better manage their healthcare needs. Its services include virtual care, personalized care team, smart warning, and other healthcare services.\n\nAnother advantage of Bright Health is that\u00a0it both provides 2C and 2B services. On the one hand, it provides customers with Bright Healthcare\u00a0products, as well as customized and market-specific nursing services through NeueHealth's network and other healthcare providers. On the other hand, for business clients, NeueHealth helps healthcare providers gather consumers and provide care partners with multiple value propositions, while providing innovative tools and solutions to support population health management and development of value-based care. For payers, NeueHealth allows Bright HealthCare and other third-party payers to participate in value-based payment arrangements, while managing risk-bearing care delivery. It\u00a0provides payers with predictability of medical expenses, allowing them to focus more on benefit design and management.\n\nIn sum, Bright Health integrates financing and delivery of healthcare through the division and collaboration of the two departments, covering both payers\u00a0and suppliers. The payer\u2019s funding not only focuses on preventing losses, but also on creating overall consumer value and increasing access to medical care through effective resource allocation. Suppliers construct value-based arrangements that aim to reward the quality of care provided, rather than the number of services. It could\u00a0reduce the total cost of care and\u00a0improve\u00a0clinical outcomes.\n\n**Future challenges: loss doubles, and medical cost ratio increases**\n\nApart from\u00a0advantages, Bright Health is also facing some challenges. To achieve future development and even profitability, these challenges need to be overcome.\n\nFirst, the problem of customer groups. At present, the company's main customer base is divided into commercial\u00a0users and MA users. Commercial users\u2019,or personal insurance\u2019s\u00a0market share is relatively small, and the number of users in this market has grown rapidly after the enactment of Affordable Care Act. But in the later stage, the user group who cannot receive premium subsidies will have adverse selection.\u00a0The data shows that the total number of monthly registrations in the personal market increased from 10.6 million in 2013 to 17.4 million in 2015, reaching a peak, and then fell to 13.8 million in 2018. One reason is that from 2017 to 2018, insurance premiums rose sharply, and many people were unable to receive premium subsidies, so adverse selection occurred. Consistent with the number of users, operators that provide individual insurance plans have also seen a general trend of growth first and then decline, which also means that this market is very difficult for insurance companies.\n\nIn addition, there are many other participants in the personal insurance market, including Oscar Health, which went public not long ago. Although Bright Health claims to be able to compete with the former in terms of healthcare\u00a0networks, Oscar has 400,000 individual insurance members, just slightly less than that of Bright Health in personal insurance market.\n\nOn the other hand, the MA market is full of giants, and leading insurance companies occupy a large part of the market share, leaving Bright Health only a small part. Whether it is in personal\u00a0insurance or MA, customer acquisition\u00a0is quite\u00a0difficult, which is why Bright Health has adopted mergers and acquisitions to grow its customer base.\n\nAlthough Bright Health said it would expand to other customer groups, including self-funding\u00a0employer market and small business market, the development of these strategies is still in the early stages and has not been reflected in the company's financial data. In the future, much\u00a0resources must be invested, and even mergers and acquisitions and other means\u00a0will be necessary\u00a0to seize market share and customer base.\n\nIn addition, although Bright Health has both an insurance supply department and a medical service department, its medical cost ratio(MCR)\u00a0has been growing. From 2018 to 2020, the company's MCR\u00a0were 75.8%, 82.4% and 88.7%, which did not have any advantages compared with other companies. In other words, the company's efforts to control medical expenses through NeueHealth do not seem to have worked.\n\nThe company's operating costs have also been increasing. From 2018 to 2020, operating costs were US$95.83 million, US$180 million and US$410 million, respectively, with growth rates of 88% and 127%. With high medical expenses, coupled with increasing operating costs, the company still has a long way to go to achieve profitability.\n\nNevertheless, Bright Health is committed to controlling the entire value chain including users, payers and suppliers. This model is still a core competitiveness, which distinguishes it from competitors such as Oscar, and also reminds people\u00a0of United Health.\n\nWhat we can learn from Bright Health is its practice of complementing business through acquisitions. Bright Health turned NeueHealth into an independent department and constantly emphasizes the possibility of its future development. This differentiated department is built through continuous acquisitions. At present, 3% of the revenue contributed by this department is contributed by the acquisition department. Furthermore, the success of UnitedHealth Group is also on the basis of continuous acquisitions.\n\nAnother lesson\u00a0is the construction and integration of technology platforms. The intelligent\u00a0platform built by Bright Health integrates users, payers, and suppliers, and its solutions for suppliers or patients, such as applications, are based on this\u00a0platform. It aggregates\u00a0all user data and claims data to achieve transparent exchange and empowerment of data.\n\nBright Health\u2019s future is worth looking forward to.",

Their GAAP MCR reported was 107.6% (but that\u2019s taking into account COVID-19 costs; without which was only 95.4%). Their expenses was $104.6 million, but that was \u201cprimarily due to an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation to certain executives in relation to the merger\u201d with SPAC. Which won\u2019t be on Q2 financials. Their GAAP net loss was $(48.4M) but that was primarily due to the fact the SEC made them change warrants to a liability in their balance sheet, which since have been redeemed and will affect their bottom line significantly (won\u2019t be a liability any longer). Their EBITDA (earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization) was ($76.2M) with COVID-19; without it would\u2019ve been only ($52.1M).

A reconciliation of projected normalized MCR (medical cost ratio, low number is better) to GAAP MCR cannot by calculated because of COVID-19. Which we did see a decrease in COVID-19 so those numbers can\u2019t be anywhere close to Q1. Th numbers are going to be awesome. Revenue will be higher than estimated ($205.39 Q2) because of estimated $20-30M due to direct contacting. And costs will be lower because Q1 included compensation to executives by way of non-cash stock-basis. They will show that even with COVID-19 costs, with their membership growth already at their estimates for the whole year, operating expenses what they really will be moving forward without the stock compensation, and warrant liability accounted for.
