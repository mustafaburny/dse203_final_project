        "selftext": "I\u2019m gonna conveniently skip the part where OP calls you a bunch of names and go straight to the shit, diptard. \n\nGME is already a piece of shit company, who even goes to a store to buy video games anymore that isn\u2019t Best Buy or some shit when the new Autists Anonymous 3 Survival Edition game comes out. Their revenue is declining like crazy and it [kinda looks like ](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/stock-comparison?s=gross-profit&amp;axis=single&amp;comp=GME) what happened to Blockbuster. \n\nWhy is GameStop trash?\nRemember when Netflix and other streaming services came out and blockbuster got a shit taken on them? It\u2019s the same situation now, with digital games being much easier to buy and pay for online. And lets face it, people are lazy, especially gamers. Look at the new PS5 and the new XBOX, there\u2019s two options, the digital one, and the one with a disk slot. The one with a disk slot is 50$ more. Who the fuck would pay 50$ just for a disk slot, aight i get it if you wanna keep your old games but honestly I doubt many people will be willing to do so. \nFurthermore, GameStop is always diarrhead on by the gaming community on the fact that whenever you want to turn in a game that you played for like 2 months and paid 50$ for they\u2019ll offer you 12$. Fuck that. Gay shit. Theres also waaay more PC players than Console players, who GameStop is targeted at. Well likely see a further decline in console players as they keep getting more expensive and pc part companies are growing like a monkeys dick in a whale enclosure. \n\nExtra professional DD\n\nThe other day I went to my local GameStop and there were literally 3 other people in it; the cashier, his homie, and his homies girlfriend. Idk about that but that sounds like a smashing amount of people for a company in a dying niche!\n\nTLDR: Fuck GameStop, its gay. \n\nYeah you\u2019ll call me a gay bear but I know another blockbuster when I see one.",
