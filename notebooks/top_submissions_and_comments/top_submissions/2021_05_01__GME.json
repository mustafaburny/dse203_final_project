Recently I\u2019ve been working on this fascinating piece of TA, and now I am finally ready to share that with [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msv8n1/tbh_i_only_trust_retards/). I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https://imgur.com/a/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.\n\nOh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities. Dafaq did I just write? - Dunno, but that's exactly what I meant!\n\n(Not a financial advice, as I am not a professional advisor, just an amateur ANALyzer)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche\u2019s market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.\n\nAs the general public was finding out about Wendysking\u2019s takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen\u2019s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2014 A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.\n\nWhat is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn\u2019t pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3w0ajhk1f2z61.jpg?width=1722&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4d29a8a0c5ccacfdd193f3e2d5100d0cfdee74b\n\nAlso, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now let\u2019s take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**\n\n[VWSS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)\n\nEven though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement \ud83c\udf08tool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.\n\nIn the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.\n\nOne may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it \"**Purple Haze**\".\n\nLet's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the \"**Squeezy Grail**\", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \\[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the \"**Runway**\"), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular \"**Squieezluminati Confirmed**\" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.\n\nEspecially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal \ud83c\udf08 grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.\n\nNot only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).\n\nPay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*\n\nNoice, but let's move further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly \u201cis become meme, Destroyer of shorts\u201d: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company\u2019s shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.\n\nRemember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla\u2019s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla\u2019s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:  \n\n\n&gt;The longest unprofitable short I\u2019ve ever seen!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk\u2019s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':\n\n[TSLASS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/f0qbrpqn22z61.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=479c78e6763043f81e9ac2c75cf8a6c769d9eee4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!\n\nLooking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \\[important!\\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?\n\nAnd the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.\n\nCurrent TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.\n\nToo many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Coincidences mean you're on the right path - *Simon van Booy*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;If you gaze long enough into an asshole, the asshole will gaze back into you - u/roman_axt\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome additional food for thought from TSLA:\n\n[For redditors with a different floor](https://preview.redd.it/gnd0yienc2z61.jpg?width=1668&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8b72e1671ad69cf871cde154ae386e52835e94a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Game stopped, or it is just a beginning?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:\n\n[GMESS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ko1ppnasc2z61.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d3f7c2a78135696d66a0a70e8e2a34ad4a04dbf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u/ControlTheNarrative, at least.\n\nAnd so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.\n\nThen, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.\n\nFibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.\n\nIdentifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:\n\n[Fibos' initiation point zoomed in](https://preview.redd.it/t2ouren1d2z61.jpg?width=1668&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cd87d96bb42ac20451c86059295f7560c8c44e8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy? Because this                        \u261d\ufe0f is clearly where the fun started.\n\nAnd now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey say, that coincidence doesn't happen a third time. I say, we shall see.\n\n**TL;DR** is in the comments.\n\nP.S.

Normally when continuation patterns come from downside - they have a bearish bias.

        "selftext": "Alright, this will be quite unpopular, but I don't buy this AMC will squeeze to the moon thesis for a few reasons.\n\nLet\u2019s look at liquidity:\n\nAMC had $813m in cash as of 3/31/21. Since then they\u2019ve raised $428m in fresh capital through share issuance, bringing up their total to $1.241b. This is good except their current cash burn is \\~$300m/qtr which gives them 4 quarters of runway. I do think that as covid goes away completely (possibly by fall) that there\u2019s a chance for this to stabilize. But there are a lot of variables to this such as timeline of opening and attendance rate once we are fully open.\n\nNext there's the valuation:\n\nForget covid and let\u2019s value them assuming everything returns to normal. Average adj. EBITDA between 2018-2019 was $850.3m. EV today using today\u2019s stock price and 3/31/21 debt numbers is 16.1b, which gives us 18.9x EV/adj. EBITDA multiple. For comparison, the same multiple was 6.9x in 2018. So assuming things return perfectly to normal, AMC is still valued 2.7x what it was in 2018. The highest market cap that AMC had previous to this year was in 2017 when its market cap was 4.0b vs. 5.8b today.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAMC is massively overvalued (who knew). Of course, everyone will point out this is a short squeeze opportunity like GME. However, there will probably never be another GME which once had 141% short interest at its peak vs. \\~20% for AMC now. What that means is GME had a legitimate reason for its stock price to completely decouple from its fundamentals, AMC doesn\u2019t, not to quite the extent of GME. There may be some squeezes here and there, but more players will join the short when they see how overvalued AMC is.\n\nThe current buying is predominantly from retail, and the CEO even boasted as much saying retail investors comprise of 80% of the share base. While people think this is a positive, I disagree. There is a reason institutional ownership is low and it means that while the stock price can certainly continue to go up, it will also shoot down just as fast, once everyone begins to exit. With a short interest of 20%, how are 80% of the people going to get out? Who are they going to sell to? In the end, it will just be a shifting of bags amongst the retail.\n\nIf I was the CEO of AMC, this would be the best scenario possible. I can continue to dilute share base and basically salvage my business which was on the verge of bankruptcy. I don\u2019t doubt that AMC will not hesitate to issue new shares within the next year again unless their liquidity situation improves. It\u2019s also why, I think, they would rather do an at-the-market offering rather than a subscribed offering to institutions.\n\nA lot of people are propping this up as something of a fight for the common people against the hedgies, who have done all the wrong. I actually think this can be quite irresponsible it\u2019s driving people to pour into AMC, basically like a Ponzi scheme. Invest safely!",

        "selftext": "  \n\nHey fellow traders. Today, l\u2019ll present to you a very strong bull case on AMC that is not explained by simply putting a rocket emoji (I love this emoji by the way) or because someone else posted a strong YOLO bet on the stock. Here is my analysis based on volume, price action, and a powerful pattern named the flag, high and tight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/5bruexp383271.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f679d9584a983071eaf036df2e4c5be14069eaae)\n\nFirstly on the weekly chart, we see a high tight flag that started developing from the low on January 5th at $1.91 (#1) to the high of the pattern which was achieved on January 27th at a staggering price of $20.36 (#2). In 17 trading days, the stock soared 1065.96%. It\u2019s an understatement that this price action caught my attention. The following months saw the stock consolidate in a flag, high and tight on falling volume. Bulkowski studied this pattern extensively and it\u2019s one of his favorites. HTF is characterised by a rise of at least 90% (aim for double) in less than 2 months followed by a consolidation period on ideally falling volume. I think we easily meet these criteria! The performance rank of this pattern in his work is 1 on 23 in a bull market (1 being the best) with an average rise of 69% and throwbacks happening 54% of the time. Price meets target 90% of the time. The measure rule helps us acquire a potential price target for this trade. In his work, Bulkowski tells us to measure the rise and project it 50% past the breakout point. With the measure rule, using the breakout point at $12, we would have a theoretical price target of $63.96 (1065.96/100/2\\*12)). Now to the analysis based on volume and price.\n\nOn the weekly chart, we have the breakout on #3 with rising and above average volume. This confirms the breakout is not fake, but supported by the professionals. After the minor pullback, we see the momentum exploding and the price action ripping past $20 on very high volume. Like we will see on the daily chart, the last trading day of the week saw some heavy selling which can be seen with the long upper wick on the weekly chart. \n\nI attribute this to two things. First, the stock rose to overbought levels and a pullback was imminent. Two, the stock hit the ATH of around $35 and many market participants saw this as a good point to take profits.  While it is true the SI rose in this period, I do not believe shorts created this long upper wick. Seems more likely professionals were taking money off the table. This being said, I do not think we are witnessing a trend end since strong momentums like this one cannot be broken in a single day. Like a big cargo ship, it cannot be stopped simply by turning off the engine. More effort will be necessary to break this rocket for sure. On top of that, the most conservative assessment would bring us to $63.96 in less than 30 days (around June 10th) following the breakout and we have a 90% chance of hitting this target according to Bulkowski. If these are not good odds, I don\u2019t know what is. I truly believe this is an opportunity of a lifetime!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/wslu122983271.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a1d2f718d41538d8bfad7ffad44ade99c796356)\n\nOn the daily chart, we can see the flag, high and tight develop from January 27th on #2 to the breakout at #3 on May 13th. Developing this cause is important according to Wyckoff\u2019s law of cause and effect. The development of a cause will be proportional to the subsequent effect. On May 14th (breakout day (#4)), we see rising and above average volume that confirms the start of a new trend. Then, the test of supply on the pullback at #5, we see falling volume until the stock reaches $12 which means there is no interest in selling at these prices. The rally resumes on very nice long white candles on steadily rising volume which means volume and price are in harmony fully supported by the great professionals. \n\nOn the second to last candle, we see some selling happening as shown with the upper wick. On #6, we see a tall black candle that closes very close to the prior day\u2019s close. I associate this candle with the bearish meeting lines candle. Bulkowski\u2019s work establishes the candle to be a continuation pattern 51% of the time in a bull market, which is pretty much as valid as a coin toss. If the next day\u2019s close is below this candle, Bulkowski tells us there is a 70% chance the candle acts as a reversal. So this is to be looked at closely for next week. The long upper wick and shorter lower wick associated with very high volume tells me there was more selling happening Friday by the professionals. \n\nWe must remember that stocks do not trend in a straight line. Volatility is cyclical, and all this is normal price action. Even in the event that Friday\u2019s price action is stopping volume by the great professionals and the beginning of a distribution phase, Wyckoff\u2019s work tells us this is associated with a potential preliminary supply and this stopping action ALWAYS fails and thus the rally WILL continue. Ladies and gents, I cannot stress enough how AMC is trading currently at a discount and any entry point is a good one at this point in time. We do not choose our seats on a rocket ship! You get in, strap on, and enjoy the ride! Trying to perfectly time the bottom on any pullback is a fool\u2019s errand! Looking back at the daily chart on AMC, #1 (hanging man) and #3 (dark cloud cover) shows us that any bearish candle in the recent history of this stock is likely to be very short lived. Shorting this stock based on the bearish meeting lines (weak bearish candle by the way) would be a very dangerous endeavour indeed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[30 minutes chart](https://preview.redd.it/erdc846b83271.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ec91557abfecf685c4af681eaf68f0da6a1fd9b)\n\nLastly, on the 30 minutes chart, friday we see at #1 strong buying pressure as seen with the long lower wick and high volume at $25.50. #2 was a retest on falling volume meaning falling interest to sell at this price. I do believe we have strong support at this level.\n\nNo one has a crystal ball and this could go either way, but the odds are that we reach $63.96 by the end of June with a 90% probability according to Bulkowski. I am adding to my position at any dip in this stock. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qbs706tc83271.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8669186d98ef0792b216b50992969cd1d08fe785\n\nIf history is of any guide, I expect AMC to have a short consolidation period with falling volume like we saw with GME before the great run up. Thus, I believe we have another week to add to our positions before this really takes off. Any close above 35$ will be extremely bullish\n\nI\u2019ve been reading many posts explaining the short squeeze potential and this adds to the excitement of a strong bull run in this stock way past $63.96. AMC is currently the most shorted stock in the market as we speak. Though I have doubts that AMC will reach 500k like many claim, I do believe we have a strong squeeze potential in this stock as shown by the candles and volume recently printed on the charts. Ultimately, volume and price will tell us when it is time to close our positions.\n\nCheers,\n\n20$ 07/16C AMC\n\n30$ 07/16C AMC",

        "selftext": "I often see people in the daily thread leaving lazy comments about, \"Ticker X has short interest of Y%\". This is dumb, and you should feed bad about wasting our time with something so useless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What is short interest\n\nHere we find the first reason why this is dumb comment. Short interest is an incredibly vague concept. Usually you see it reckoned as a percentage of the float, or the shares outstanding, but even this is not a consistent definition. Thinking back to the GME runup there were two numbers being thrown around for Short Interest, 140% and 270%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first number (140%) was short interest divided by the \\*total shares outstanding\\*. If a company has 1000 shares outstanding and 200 shares have been short sold, this works out to a 20% short ratio. But not every outstanding share is available to trade on any given day. Many will be owned by the company itself, insiders, and institutions that are not legally allowed to sell them without doing a bunch of publicly available (priced in) paperwork. So sometimes you'll see numbers like the second (270%) which use the shares that are available to trade on any given day as the denominator. If only 700 shares are available to the market that will increase the short float to almost 30%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTrouble is, how do you define a share that is available to trade? If you don't know the definition that was used when calculating the number you're throwing around, then you don't know what the short float number \\*actually means\\*. And if you don't know or can't explain it then you shouldn't be wasting our time with it because its meaningless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What is Days to Cover\n\nThere is *another* way of reckoning short interest that actually does have some validity. **Days to Cover** is a measure of how many days of trading it would take for every short position to be unwound. This is the total number of shares shorted divided by the average trading volume. That ratio is the number of days *on average* it would take for shorts to cover. If every short position had to be closed as quickly as possible it would take that many days *if every share traded were used to close a short position* for short interest by any metric to reach zero. This is at least a little bit useful because you can tell how long an increase in buying pressure from short positions being closed is likely to last.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why even DTC is not particularly useful\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven DTC can be an inconsistent metric, though, as likely not every short position must be closed immediately (reducing DTC) and the fact that it is taking the *average* volume means that a single high volume day could easily drop that number substantially. You don't know what's going to happen just because you have access to a single metric which is also available to every other trader on the market -and that includes those with open shorts. Going back to the GME example, even at the height of the short squeeze craze DTC was sitting at just over six days. Six days of *average* volume to cover and we saw trade volumes that were an order of magnitude higher than that average. Does that mean the shorts covered? Who knows. You certainly don't, even if someone on the internet told you they didn't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# It's probably not a short squeeze\n\nWhile the concept of a short squeeze is valid, you need to understand that they are incredibly rare events. If you want to make trading them your primary strategy, have fun, but be ready to wait a **long** time (*years*) for the next opportunity. You don't know when short positions need to be unwound, and there's no way for you to force anyone to do it involuntarily. You can be sure that they are doing everything in their power to minimize their losses/maximize their profits and you should do the same. Why should we believe that a ticker that is 30% short with a DTC &lt; 1 is going to squeeze? If you can't explain that, then it's not worth crowing about. *Nobody cares about your half-thought out conspiracy theory.* DFV spent a *year* building his case and still came within a few months of his positions expiring worthless. Michael Burry almost went bankrupt waiting for the housing market to crash. *You don't hear the stories of the ones who lost it all, even if they were right on the premise*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you've got knowledge of squeeze that is incoming, great, but build a case for it. Wildly screaming, \"GME SHORT INTEREST 30%\" in the daily is not a case. Shouting \"GME DTC 1.4 DAYS\" is a little more informative, but ultimately meaningless without further context. Can they afford to spread the covering out over several days? A week? *Four fucking months?* How many are held by a single entity, and therefore likely to be closed all at once? What is the price doing? Why would they get squeezed if the position is profitable and looks to continue being profitable for the foreseeable future? If you don't know, then nobody is going to care.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# No Bullshitting\n\nWe have a rule here: \"No Bullshitting\". \"Don't make shit up, and be responsible giving and taking advice. This includes talking about things you don't know about. You should listen, not talk. Nobody wants an ill-informed opinion. Lurk More.\" *Nobody wants an ill-informed opinion*. **Nobody wants an ill-informed opinion**. If you're in the daily thread vomiting numbers that are effectively meaningless in an attempt to pu&amp;#xFEFF;mp your pet stock, expect to be (at best) ignored. I know you're excited, and this may be your first foray into the market. Welcome. Lurk more.",

        "selftext": "Here I am at home, sipping champagne and laughing at how the market is convincing you that UWMC, America's largest wholesale mortgage lender, is supposed to be at ALL TIME LOWS while the real estate is exploding.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0vfuohmplrx61.png?width=686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60ec4444fbbf936dcac53ffdca7f5f0d530789e1\n\nLet's get some facts straight, because it hurts me to see how all of you amateurs are being played by the master poker players of Wall Street.\n\n# Real Estate prices\n\nHome prices are hitting record highs. Record low supply of homes. New listings selling on average in just 18 days, also a record pace. 48% of buyers are confident now is the right time to buy real estate. Where are these people getting the money from, you ask? By taking MORTGAGES! High lumber prices, high copper prices, high home prices? Yup, all that money comes from mortgages. Power to those who buy houses with cash, but most of the people need a mortgage. And guess who is in the mortgage business? You betcha, UWMC.\n\n# RKT's earnings were a dissaster, UWMC's will too\n\nUmmm, did you know Mat Ishibia (the CEO of UWMC) gave an ultimatum about a month ago, that brokers must choose who they want to work with. Either RKT or UWMC. Guess whom they picked?\n\nListen to the CEO: \"*out of my 12000 brokers less than 500 said they were gonna go with them, you will see that in the Q2 numbers*\" - https://twitter.com/RickardBalls/status/1390088528764284935?s=20\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8gwamgh5nrx61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ea48f104e76caf6a368cbe5ef2a9b86ae43eebc\n\n# Dividend\n\nI know most of you goofs here do not care about dividend because you are all busy making 100% a week gains, but in the real world, where you actually do get to drive a lambo, consistent predictable income like dividends are a big deal. You see, UWMC pays $0.40 per year for every share you own. This is fixed! It does not matter how much the stock price is. However, what matters is that you dividend yield depends on the price you pay to acquire those shares. Confused? Let me give you an example:\n\n* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $10 a share) = 4.00% annual dividend yield\n* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $9 a share) = 4.44% annual dividend yield\n* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $8 a share) = 5.00% annual dividend yield\n* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $7 a share) = 5.71% annual dividend yield - **WE ARE HERE!**\n* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $5 a share) = 8.00% annual dividend yield\n* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $3 a share) = 13.33% annual dividend yield\n* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $1 a share) = 40.00% annual dividend yield\n\nBasically, it's a gift from heavens to be able to buy a dividend paying stock at low levels because you are locking in a higher % return. Now some of you smartypants will say, *\"don't buy a stock just for the dividend\"*, and I agree. In some cases, when the company **does not generate cash flow** they will have trouble paying the dividend and will be forced to cut it. However, **UWMC** has no problem with cash flow, meaning $0.40 dividend per share is here to stay for the foreseeable future.\n\nFun fact, RKT pays no dividend. Institutions know this. They care about predictable stream of cash a.k.a. dividends. BlackRock knows this, hence why they reported on May 2, owning 11.15% of UWMC's float.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4oibshivrx61.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9724aeb147bdd05e8e28cd08babb8b4a06c2c63b\n\n# Russell Index\n\nRemember the Russell index hype? Remember how the price went from $7.63 to $9.62 in a matter of few days?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1tb8i3ikprx61.png?width=1348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2b49973b32b0f6171a51cbf110250ab48b3187d\n\nWell the inclusion story is still pretty much on the table. Russell made a mistake. UWMC is in touch with them and **UWMC is eligible for ocnsideration at the annual review in June 2021**. Yes, that's in about a month from now. Don't believe me? You should.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xxjhba02qrx61.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49913305ca2b760bca63a596b977f86b64b62961\n\n# Bluffing\n\nThe definition of bluffing in poker is - ***betting heavily on a weak hand in order to deceive opponents***. I know what you beginners fear - \"*What if my stock goes to zero?*\" Do you hear yourself? America's largest wholesale dividend paying mortgage broker soon to join Russell 1000 going to zero? Are you that dumb? Did Wall Street pros managed to fool you that much? Remember bluff stories like:\n\n* **We covered on GME** \\- No you did not! The stock ain't going below $100 and it's been months since you covered!\n* **AMC is going bankrupt** \\- No it's not! It went up 348% since January 2021!\n* **UWMC is worthless. You should buy real estate at all time highs, let's us buy this shitty dividend paying stock that's going to zero.** \\- Are you gonna fall for it again?\n\n# Mathematical pressure\n\nYou see, when you deal with single digit stocks like AMC at $2 in January 2021, GME at $5 in August 2020, there is a point at which there is just no meat left. There is only a bone. You can't short stock into an oblivion. There is nothing left to short! You are running a risk.\n\nAt some point, the rewards from going long way outweigh the risk of going short on a beaten down stock. Melvin did not understand this concept and that's why he lost billions. Simple as that.\n\nYou wanna buy low and sell high. Not short sell low and buy to cover high.\n\n# Summary\n\n* UWMC - America's largest wholesale mortgage lender is at **all time lows**\n* Real estate is at all time highs\n* UWMC is paying dividend (5.7% is the yield at the current share price), RKT is not\n* UWMC issued an ultimatum to mortgage brokers where 12,000 picked to work with them exclusively while 500 went with RKT\n* About to be reconsidered for Russell 1000 addition in June\n* Earnings are coming Monday, May 10, after hours.\n\nYour call.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor. If I knew anything about investing I would be stuck in some cubicle on a Wall Street, interning at an investment bank until late into the night.*\n\nMy positions:\n\n* 5000 shares\n* 30 puts sold\n   * \\-10 May 21 P $7.50\n   * \\-10 Jun 18 P $8.00\n   * \\-10 Dec 21 P $7.50",

As for the squeeze, I would not mind it but could care less atm. Should it occur, I will buy covered calls and enjoy it. \n\nWith the proxy vote arriving, does anyone see it being the catalyst for the squeeze to finally occur and be ended? We can all agree that absuive shorts attempted to bankrupt GameStop and should not have the power to do so. My thoughts are, with the amount of calls being \"thrown to the wind\" like these, is there something we do not know or cannot see? Why would someone aimlessly throw away $1.6m? They wouldn't. I have the luxury of doing well for myself and would not waste money on a guarentee fail. So, if you have any thoughts that aren't too tin-foilish, lmk.\n\nCheers and good luck to everyone.

        "selftext": "I've been an E\\*TRADE user for close to a decade now, but over the last few months, I've had a few **significant** issues within my account that simply shouldn't be happening. The type of mistakes that would likely throw the average person into a full-blown panic attack, or worse...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first \"issue\" was during the $GME uprising. I woke up like the rest of you, except with a **$234,357.55 cash call** on my account. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cash Call](https://preview.redd.it/mrndbfvwxax61.png?width=874&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c62fa1ae8a0f65d77c9f75e490d231fd166e4f25)\n\nYou may be thinking, \"you stupid fucking idiot stop playing with margin and that wont happen\", but my account was never even approved for margin lol. I owned **&lt;10 shares** of $GME at the time, and was selling them 1 by 1 as the price travelled through the $300's (sorry). So when I saw that I somehow had unwillingly entered a **short position of 736 SHARES OF $GME AT $22.86**, which my account literally did not have the ability to do, I freaked the fuck out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vcil9kxoyax61.png?width=1091&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c50088143246cfe6c270f5d6b66380aa8d837d7\n\nI'm still not sure what happened that day, but E\\*TRADE admitted it was an \"error\" on their end. Huh, what kind of error results in a massive (and impossible) short position on the biggest stock explosion in decades? There wasn't even an order # attached to the trades...imagine being someone who checks their portfolio weekly or monthly rather than 60 times a day, and seeing this shit pop up, not knowing if you made some terrible mistake and your life was completely ruined?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/li4mkcn61bx61.png?width=584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cc1c9b50fcd678eb7f9a798cc2fd16bcf218966\n\nWell a few months had passed, but last week I decided I finally wanted to upgrade my account to a margin account to allow me to sell a *PMCC* on a deep ITM $NIO call I owned. I had the cash available for the trade I wanted to make (a few thousand), so this shouldn't have been an issue. But like clockwork, the PMCC I sold for **19 FUCKING DOLLARS IN PREMIUM** resulted in another error. A Fed Call, for... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nvmte0tk0bx61.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61e561f141eebe3292b7a20f21baa62d7f731b76\n\n**...$21,554.07!** Again, after contacting E\\*TRADE and looking up whatever a \"Fed Call\" was, it was deemed to be yet another \"error\" on their end. The only trade I had made when margin was enabled was a profitable one, too. **$8.** No wonder this country has a mental health problem, thanks E\\*TRADE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Sure, Jan.](https://preview.redd.it/dkz2l0741bx61.png?width=490&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b12cfa9084bd7ec6a32332284c9d25e96ce96b93)\n\nOkay, the fed call thing was ridiculous, so the day after I was approved for the margin account, I downgraded my account (after all the trades had settled) so I wouldn't have to deal with this nonsense. I thought that would be the end of it. Until this morning, when I woke up to *\\*drumroll please\\*,* **over $4,000 in cash missing from my account!** I was the lucky winner of the E\\*TRADE lottery, because of all the times I've had to contact support for their \"issues\", I got to pay 1 months salary to a random E\\*TRADE employee! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Thank you, have a nice day!](https://preview.redd.it/0bwntrqx2bx61.png?width=1163&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63eb6e29eda6d955e9d733854cfe97a7d4157093)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I write this, the cash has since been deposited back into my account, but how is this acceptable? If the average person looks at their retirement account once a month and sees a hundred thousand dollar cash call, or a twenty thousand dollar 'Fed Call', they may not act rationally - that's a lot of fucking money. And they'd have no idea if it was an error or not because you would ASSUME that a multi, multi billion dollar brokerage wouldn't make mistakes like this...or maybe not.\n\nI guess the point of this post is to remind people to **be careful**. Up until recently, this hasn't been an industry where regular people had access to these resources, and it seems like they wish it stayed that way.",

That is because the Jul 16, 2021 $800.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat Is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat Do The Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for GameStop shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, GameStop is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Consumer Electronics industry that ranks in the Top 19% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four analysts have revised the estimates downward. The net effect has widened our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 41 cents per share to a loss of 56 cents in that period.\n\nGiven the way analysts feel about GameStop right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.",

        "selftext": "I'm sure you've all seen some of this in various threads over the last few days so here is what I see as the complete short term case for UWMC in one place. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor this is not advice don't listen to me etc.\n\nBefore the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the [fundamentals of this company](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/comments/n0414o/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) today (they're great), [the value even at this price](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nd9hyr/uwm_holdings_looks_like_a_value_bargain_with_low/), [a super good dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ndc6pu/united_wholesale_mortgage_uwmc_is_the_most/), [the wild housing market](https://the1a.org/segments/housing-pandemic-market/), [the great strategic decisions the company has made](https://twitter.com/SleipnirPerkins/status/1378305915800186884), or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Low float, low volume**\n\nUWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with \\~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual \"active\" float at less than 70 million.\n\nAverage daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Short interest, high short volume**\n\nIn the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. \n\nShort interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. ([Source](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=uwmc)) The shorts are here and they are relentless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle**\n\nLast Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. **Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short.** ([Source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)) It's [over 300%](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_330645419.jpg) on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs.\n\nRegarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll [let the recent post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncczh8/uwmc_on_nyse_threshold_securities_list_regulation/) speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Huge Buyback**\n\nMonday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back **$300 million** **in stock** over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or **half of the active float** of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though.\n\nWhat does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, **incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock.** It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. \n\nThere's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but  there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and [public statements from the CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nclll1/uwmc_the_most_important_statement_for_all_shares/), It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Options - Would you look at that**\n\nThis is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5/21 expiry. **Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly,** the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 **-** meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares**.** The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! \n\nAs for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (&lt;5000) open puts expiring.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion -** What needs to happen\n\nFirst, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.)\n\nSecond this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. \n\nIt's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week.\n\n**TL;DR:** This stock has a low active float, a whole bunch of shorts, an ongoing buyback, and a huge amount of unhedged calls expiring on Friday. All in the midst of a gigantic share buyback.  The conditions are perfect for a huge run.",

Last month India was wrecked. Next week I suspect Nepal, Pakistan. The infection will probably circle back to China in the near future. They are racing against time for  a safe, effective vaccine that can go into the rural hinterland. INO-4800 DNA vaccine is the answer.  (Market size $2.5 Billion)\n2.

        "selftext": "In an interesting development this week, GME put/call parity, which has tracked like any normal stock for months, started to split apart this week and today really fractured.\n\nPut/Call parity implies that both the put and call will have (about) the same IV at the same strike. I have been using a model to track GME IV since for, among other things, an at-the-money strangle since Jan 27, 2021, recorded in the database at around 1:00 PM ET.  \n\nMy models calculate implied daily volatility (IDV) rather than annual volatility. I am always tracking a monthly so currently the May 21.\n\nGME ATM IV has declined steadily and in a very orderly way and showing relative parity since late March. IV was extremely high in March but began a relentless decline. There was some asymmetry - put IDV typically higher than calls, such as Put IDV at 0.08748 and Call IDV 0.07048 on Friday, April 9 - but this is often seen in tech stocks and is usually explained by heavy hedging of long positions.\n\nIn the last two weeks, both calls and puts were moving down to the 0.05 level of IDV, largely at parity.\n\nToday, a little after 1:09 ET (I ran the model a number of times because I was having trouble pulling in live data) I recorded the 140 Put IDV at 0.06025 (GME at 141.27) and the 145 Call IDV at 0.03856 (GME was 141.22). [Yeah, I know, that is not the same strike but when they are that close you still get very close to parity].\n\nOther than in panics, I don't recall that I have ever seen a parity spread that wide. \n\nTo me it indicates and extreme level of hedging.

        "selftext": "For the past few months I have been happily collecting premiums by selling covered calls on my 200 GME shares. Since GME has been trading sideways, the premiums allowed me to collect about a 100% gain over the past 2 months. Over time I grew dissatisfied with these gains as I am greedy.\n\nOn May 12, I discovered r/thetagangbets to seek extra theta gains, since the actual thetagang people are happy with 1% monthly returns and wouldn\u2019t recommend any strategies that provide good growth (again, I\u2019m money hungry so 1% does not satisfy me). After consulting the greatest minds of Reddit, I decided to sell naked calls in addition to my covered calls. Usually I sell 2 calls on my 200 shares. This time I sold an additional 10 May 28 150C for $9.6, without any shares backing them. I happily collected my $9,600, as I figured it would be free money. Over the next couple weeks I happily took my theta decay from the buyers. The past three days, things have changed for the worst. My 10 sold calls are now worth $92,325, putting me at a -$82,725 loss. Unless GameStop drops tomorrow or Friday to below $150, I\u2019m afraid my sold options will be executed. \n\nI will never financially recover from this.",

        "selftext": "  \n\nHi fellow traders, this is my first time posting on WSB and wanted to share with you some TA using volume price analysis on CLOV. I got interested in CLOV recently and having profited a lot on GME (bought in shares and options in November). I felt this was my next big bet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2sx4id9ldlw61.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fabd25308652e8c12e834d7e4f17b77e160b430\n\nFirst of all on the weekly chart, I see signs of the market maker buying during the bear market in this stock that lasted from January to March. At #1, we have a hammer candle with a deep lower wick on very high volume which signals that the market maker is trying to stop the downfall and failed. The stock pursued its fall and reached the buying climax by the market maker in March. I can see this with the high volume and deep lower wick. Having retraced a significant amount since its ATH, the market needed to test this level to see if all the sellers were out of the market. The $7 retest was successful on low volume as we can see with the small doji that printed on the chart in april. The retest was above the ATL signaling strength. The next 4 candles have higher highs, higher lows and very very high volume. The long upper wicks signal that insiders are trying to push the price down but are incapable of breaking the trend because the buying pressure is intense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4oo9rdmdlw61.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11d7e1ed18232b575526ec194f840d47fddaa3f4\n\nOn the daily chart, we see the buying climax with the white hammer having a deep lower wick that coincided with the general market bottoming out in March. #2 was an attempt to breakout on high volume but was unsuccessful; the market retreated on falling volume, which is bullish. #3 is a very interesting candle: the stock tried to breakout again but was pushed violently to the downside below $9 on insane volume. Insiders were very desperate to push this stock down. #4 was the breakout on again very high volume. Insiders were trying to push the stock down again but failed! The following candles saw a test of the commitment of the sellers (test of supply) and there was none! Instead, we saw the stock trending lower of declining volume, which is very bullish (this is where I pulled the trigger and got a fill at $9.42 once the stock started climbing again). It didn\u2019t take long for the stock to rise again on high volume, only to be suppressed once again. The battle isn\u2019t over with the bears, but the signals that the bulls are starting to take over are there when you look at price and volume. At the second to last candle we see a bearish candle called the dark cloud cover: it signals a short term downtrend. As we see with the last candle (inverted hammer), the volume is declining once again as sellers are not in the market. This could signal the end of this short-term downtrend, but we need more price action to confirm this. There is a case for a short squeeze in this stock, though I don\u2019t believe it will squeeze like GME since the percentage of the float shorted is nowhere near what GME was. Clearing the $14 mark on high volume is very important to see this stock soar to the ATH of $17.50 and beyond. The last candles on the chart signal a bumpy ride ahead; the bears will not give up easily but when they do, this bet will be a very rewarding one.\n\nP.S.: Don\u2019t take my word for it and do your own DD.\n\nCLOV 15$C 06/18 + 550 shares.",

        "selftext": "\n\n\n\n\nIn the next 4 years the BY team (Biden&amp;Yellen) will most probably be the ones who fulfil Voltaire\u2019s prediction in 1729 that \u201cPaper Money Eventually Returns To Its Intrinsic Value \u2013 ZERO\u201d.\n\nLike Matt Piepenburg , Voltaire knew he would be right because history has 100s of examples of governments and central banks destroying the currency.\n\nBiden/Yellen don\u2019t really need to do much since the dollar is already down 90% since 1913. \n\n\nINFLATION IS HERE\n\nSo far the $10s of trillions of printed money has not translated into inflation in official consumer prices.\n\nBut we are now seeing major inflation in commodity prices.\n\n\nIf we just look at food commodity prices, they are up 54% since July 2020.\n\n\nAnd if we look at general commodity prices \u2013 up 89% since April 2020 \u2013 they are telling us that hyperinflation is not far away.\n\nIt would lead to a highly destructive deflationary depression after a short lived hyperinflationary period as central banks apply the only trick they know \u2013 UNLIMITED MONEY PRINTING.\n\nBut this time the world will finally discover that printed money has low value . \n\nDOW GOLD RATIO \n\nAll of the above is history. Even though gold has yielded an excellent return, it is what happens to the Dow/Gold ratio in the future that determines if investors should stay with stocks or hold gold.\n\nGold bottomed at $250 in 1999 as the ratio peaked at 45. The ratio subsequently fell to 5 in 2011 and corrected from there to 22.5 in 2018.\n\nSince 2018, the Dow/Gold downtrend has resumed. The indicator of The MACD turned down in 2019 for the first time since the 1999 top. This is a very strong sign that Dow/Gold has now resumed the long term downtrend.\n\nIf we then look at the long term picture of the Dow/Gold ratio, it gives us a very good idea of where we are heading.\n\nThe initial target is a ratio of 1 to 1 as in 1980 when the Dow was 850 and gold $850.\n\n\nREDDIT ATTACK SILVER MARKET?\n\nThe ultimate insurance against a total destruction of your wealth, is obviously physical gold and silver stored outside the financial system.\n\nDigital currency might be a good speculative investment and might also work as a payment method if central banks don\u2019t ban it. But it has nothing to do with real wealth preservation.\n\nSilver is normally the leading indicator for the precious metals.\n\nFollowing the spectacular short squeeze in Gamestop by the Reddit group Wallstreetbets, there is now speculation that the same could happen with silver.\n\nYes, everything is possible. But remember that in the gold and silver markets, against the Reddit players there will be:\n\nThe BIS (Bank of International Settlement),\n\nThe Fed, ECB and other central banks\n\nPlus the bullion banks\n\nSo a lot of fire power to beat compared to the Gamestop opposition.\n\nSILVER \u2013 THE INVESTMENT OF THE DECADE\n\nThe silver market is one of the most toxic of all. Heavily manipulated and with bullion banks now being 700 million oz of silver short on Comex and with no liquidity in London, as Alasdair Macleod has pointed out.\n\nStill, even if not in the next month or two, silver will win this game in the medium and long term as the dosage of paper silver shorts is much too big to survive a short squeeze.\n\nI would not be surprised to see the 1980 and 2011 $50 high to be taken out in 2021.\n\nSo silver will lead the metals and the gold/silver ratio, now at 67, will initially reach 30 like. The long term target is likely to be a lot lower, probably 15 or below.\n\nExpect 2021 to be the year when investors wake up to the fact that gold  is actually the best wealth protection you can hold and silver the investment of the decade\n\nWHEN THE MUSIC STOPS\u2026\n\nThe printed $8 trillion at $15 per hour (Biden\u2019s new minimum wage) equals 60 million man hours. But in the modern Money paradigm, you don\u2019t need to work for the money. Whatever the world needs, central banks and governments can just create out of nothing.\n\nThat is until the music stops. And Biden or Harris are the likely conductors who will preside over the music stopping and the whole edifice collapsing.\n\nThe wise will obviously find a chair already now because when the music stops there will be no chairs free and all hell will break loose.\n\nBy that time debt will not just be in the $trillions or $30  of trillions. No, the printing will have reached $ and EUR 100 trillions  as not only most collapsing debt will need to be bought by central banks but also derivatives which probably amount to several trillions or more.\n\nIn addition, medical care, social security and unfunded pensions will probably exceed  several hundred trillions usd globally and add to the demise of the financial system.\n\nCould I be wrong. Maybe. A close friend gave me once a T-shirt with the inscription:\n\n\u201cI AM NOT ALWAYS RIGHT \u2013 But I am never wrong\u201d!\n\nThe gift must have been a subtle hint \u2013 Hmmm\n\nStill, in my imho I don\u2019t believe that any orderly reset will change the inevitable course of events. So as far as I am concerned, it is not IF but WHEN.\n\n\nBut as I see risk at an extreme, now is the time to prepare.\n\nPrecious metals will clearly not solve all our problems as the world economy implodes. But it is better to hold the only money that has survived in history.\n\nIn virtually every period of crisis in history gold and silver has been a surety.\n( addendum from mr Egon von greyerz )",

        "selftext": "Today's premarket was definitely... interesting to say the least. I opened up my Yahoo finance app and saw literally all of the holdings in my speculative portfolio down anywhere from 4-12 percent. Specifically both $OPEN and $PLTR were down more than 10 percent (PLTR down that much initially after the earnings report). \n\nLo and behold, the market opens and everything immediately is up way higher than in pre-market. Now obviously futures are only indicative to some extent and don't actually reflect at which price-point stocks will open but it still leaves you wondering how PLTR can drop more than 10 percent in pre-market off the earningsreport and currently later in the day is trading up more than 8 percent. \n\nI don't buy all of the tin-foil hat theories that people have come up with since the whole GME saga but damn this is still kinda sus. I mean someone with premarket access could've scooped up some palantir shares this morning in pre-market and be up more than 20 percent within a matter of hours. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?",

        "selftext": "I must start this with do not touch your AMC for anything let alone a stock that hasnt even cemented itself in this new world - but the memeconemy is having a revival and with Wall St's apparent dislike of this company through shorts I think UWMC may have a nice place in this new order.\n\nPrice action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said before, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.\n\nWith ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.\n\n[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \\(high short float\\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)\n\nDO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.\n\nTHE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.\n\nExecute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions\n\nPositions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls.

I\u2019m the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.\n\nCongrats to AMC hodlers, but today we\u2019ll take a look at the superior stonk\u2018s current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.\n\nThe first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action\u2018s fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF\u2019s GF\u2019s ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.\n\nMACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.\n\nAnd the most important factor to \ud83d\udc3b in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.\n\nI hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day! \n\n(and compulsory not a fin advise and fuck you!)",

        "selftext": "Let me help you and break it down so you can make your own decision \n\nThis is what\u2019s going on\u2026\n\nAMC was attacked (shorted) because it was easy prey when covid hit, lock down, no revenue, stock drops.\n\nHedge Funds (HFS) took out short positions to capture profit on this which in normal business is fine. BUT they got greedy and used a legitimate process of creating a share for a temporary process and instead extended it and exploiting it over and over again to attack the value of the stock.\n\nSee, if they were successful in bankrupting the company all the synthetic shares would have been 100% profit and they would not have gotten caught.\n\nBut the CEO knew they were under attack and on Jan 27th 1.2b shares traded when the float was &lt;200m. This was the tell, it showed there were too many shares on the market.\n\nSo the CEO had a proxy vote to vote in 500m more shares which got everyone fired up to vote as they didn't want to dilute the price AND the people shorting it got extremely excited as they assumed AMC needed the money so the dug in again and shorted more!!! With fake shares.\n\nThe AMC CEO then comes out days before the vote and said he listened to the 3.2m share holders and because they have enough cash to last past 2022 they will take the shares off the table, no dilution (brilliant!)\n\nThis trapped the HF who were expecting to get away with their manipulation.\n\nNow there is another vote coming up June 2nd where once again holders will take part in a proxy, and this time all voters info will be captured so there is no doubt to the corruption of the HF.\n\nThe SEC and other regulators have been hidden during the blatant price manipulation BUT they have been busy making new rules to control the collapse and also to prevent this from happening again.\n\nWhere does that leave us now? 3.2m people would have to own the float many many times over, I myself have over 5k so the HF need to buy back the shorted shares or keep paying interest until they go broke or Margin Called. This is why it is expected to have a huge spike in price. How much who knows??  GME hit $500, and this is much bigger\u2026 and brokers won\u2019t intervene this time to stop the squeeze\u2026\n\nSo, what happens if the HF goes bankrupt? New rules will control the asset sell of the offending company to stop a crash of the holdings/market, then there is an insurance policy for these circumstances that has been increased to I believe 70 trillion dollars.\n\nInteresting days are ahead\u2026. This is lined up to be a massive shift In Wealth like the world has never seen before.\n\nAPES STRONG TOGETHER \n\nBUY and HOLD AMC!\n\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "**\\*TL;DR at the bottom**\n\nSo first let me get some things straight. I\u2019m not saying this could become another GME, but if it reaches even 10% of the GME potential then we might have a really good play here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Chamath** is one of the big investors in this stock. CLOV was made public through one of his SPAC\u2019S. I know lots of apes hate him, sure he should have diamond-handed GME. But should that be the reason not to buy CLOV? His track record is incredible nonetheless!\n\n* A little more about the investment Chamath made! Short-term-wise, he can\u2019t pull out his investment as he did with $SPCE because his lock-up expires in July 2021. I have to say that he wouldn\u2019t jeopardize his reputations if he thought Clover was a scam and didn\u2019t see the potentials.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Vivek Garipalli** is the co-founder and CEO of Clover Health.\u00a0Prior to founding CLOV, he founded CarePoint Health in 2008, a fully integrated healthcare system in New Jersey. He owns 83.5m shares in CLOV which is classified as class B shares which is looked until the price reached $30$ for a period of 90 consecutive days. In his early days he worked as an Healthcare Investment Banker at Credit Suisse, he also has worked at Blackstone Group and JPMorgan Partners.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What is Clover Health?** Well, it\u2019s an insurance company providing cheaper solutions for customers, but with a focus on the individual. In their own words: \u201cClover\u2019s Medicare Advantage plans are built on technology from the ground-up. Integrating our systems with doctors, clinicians, and nurse practitioners, Clover\u2019s data team helps healthcare professionals in the field intervene directly into patients\u2019 wellness to help them avoid acute health episodes.\u201d\n\n* The development of this software is led by the Andrew Toy the President and Chief Technology Officer at CLOV and a former Product Director from Google, working with things such as Develop Platforms, Develop Ecosystems and AI/Machine Intelligence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* What\u2019s the difference between Clover health and Original Medicare? Original Medicare covers some of the costs of hospitals and doctor visits but does not cover prescription drugs or vision, dental, or hearing care. It can have high copays and coinsurance, which can lead to high costs if a beneficiary needs to go to the hospital. Clover\u2019s Medicare Advantage PPO plan covers hospitals and doctor visits like Original Medicare, as well as prescription coverage and additional benefits aimed at keeping members healthy \u2013 all at a low cost and on an open network.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Besides being an insurance company, CLOV also seeks to develop the industry\u2019s best, most well-informed, and useful physician assistant tool to empower its partners to deliver better primary care to Clover members. They focus on PCPs because they are the trusted quarterback of each member\u2019s care that have the most significant impact on their care journeys. Arming them with relevant patient information and data-driven insights empowers them to take better care of Clover\u2019s members.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zbpuziab04y61.png?width=853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=435cc4b6a806072f100ddade81af707ee2a3cf2a\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now to the fun part, the numbers!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Public Float:** 109M; The biggest 3 combined owns 33M shares (Vanguard 26.1M, Black Rock \u2013 2M, Baillie Gifford &amp; Co\u2013 5M: They are either mutual fund &amp; long-term, so it is highly unlikely they will sell in short term. This also makes it way harder for short sellers to fully cover their short positions as they would need a lot of shares which is locked up in these mutual funds.\n\n**Revenue:** In 2020 they made $672.9m with a net loss of $92.7m and $462.3m in 2019 with a net loss of $181.5m. Revenue grew 46% from 2019 to 2020! Guidance for 2021 is $820-850m that\u2019s a YoY growth of \\~24.1%. They expect to be fully profitable in 2023, pretty impressive! Compared to the average 8-9% growth YoY in the medical insurance sector CLOV is doing way better!\n\n**EBITDA** may not be sexy, but they can easily beat EPS for sure. They will flush $44.8M gain on derivatives in Q1 (officially published), which can shoot up net income. Also, they flushed all the unnecessary expenses/losses in Q4 (i.e. I-P-O-C and CLOV Merger legal costs, etc\u2026. In Q1, 2020, they had a loss of 28M. So this one-time boost on derivatives in Q1 will beat the EPS estimate (at least for Q1). Also, they said they will increase their guidance - per the linked publication.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4a9il0d04y61.png?width=2346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2174d92db10eaba3718379314e7ce74be1b0cc6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Option Interest on Calls:** 601,034 (multiply by 100, which is 60M) - Gamma Squeeze. (Total) 350k of those expire in May. The options table looks ideal for a potential gamma squeeze, have a look in the picture below. As you can see there\u2019s lots of open interest for almost every strike! Short sellers and the total call OI is around 107m shares if all calls become ITM. This would literally make it impossible for naked call sellers and short sellers to cover their position because of the low public float of 109m shares!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xdtvus3e04y61.png?width=1310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6606fb497bdeecbf1d16e79b6d553936335bdd3d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Short interest:** As of Friday the SI% of the float was 43.48% or 47m shares sold short. (source: S3 partners) This is quite a lot, actually the top 3 most shorted US stocks! The funny thing about this is that the price went up close to 5% even though shorties added another 2m shares to their short position. The SI% of float has gone up almost every day to keep the price down! However, HF\u2019s are digging their own graves by doing that!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4iy1xxjf04y61.png?width=1124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6aef16302c77a723226aece12c2c75d487fa94c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Total call OI and shorted shares** are almost the same as the entire public float. Keep in mind that out of the public float of 109m, around 33m of those is locked up within the top 3 biggest investors. Bringing the actual free float down to 76m shares. This would make it nearly impossible for the short sellers to cover the 47.7m shares they shorted.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0jmhtglg04y61.png?width=608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e71646759dca08ce9fd2da917df085d7d19b4e0d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Short-Term Q1 Earning Call (Positive Catalyst - Facts)** \\- 58,040 enrollment as of Dec 2020 increased to 66,395 enrollment as of April 2021 (they released earlier in April). So far, this increased 14% compared to the prior year (i.e. their revenue is also expected to increase by 14% from $166M in Dec to $189M in Mar 2021. Note that their annual guidance is 68K \u2013 70K, so we are already halfway there meeting the target, excluding the CMS contract in 10 states (that opens the door up to 200,000, which was already approved and started on April 1) There was an email from Andrew (IR guy), he said that he will release at the right time (Quiet period until ER, so I would assume this will be released on ER. If not, when is Andrew ever going to release this positive news officially.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- As of today there are 117 open job positions on Clover Health's website! Definitely a sign of growth\n\n\\- Lowering the age of Medicare to 60 from 65 would add another 23m Americans to the TAM. In money that equals around $250b more! This would definitely help CLOV expand further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* In 2021, the Government would open the MA enrollment period for the whole year, so you can expect more people to enroll throughout 2021. - April 1, 2021 \u2013 Clover issued an 8-K statement to correct loss on derivative from $(51.1) million to $(6.3) million. This is a one-time adjustment that occurred after Dec 31, so this will get flushed as an adjustment in Q1. This is material because considering their budgeted M-C-R of 92.6%, Q1 profit is expected to be $13M (based on high-level calculations). This adjustment is 4 times that of profit/loss, so it will boost profits substantially in Q1 and the outlook of YTD 2021. (Note \u2013 if you are a long-term investor, you shouldn\u2019t care too much about this because this is just paper profit. But, because analysts\u2019 price target is based on the bottom line DCF, this will substantially boost their price target, further increase the price target). So, in Q1, Clover Health is expected to be in a net profit position Q1 instead of loss, which is impressive for a start-up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So if everything sounds so great why is the stock price 50% down from Dec/Jan highs?** Well, there\u2019s a couple of reason why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Money flowing out of Growth stocks and SPACS\n* Manipulation from short sellers (Very high SI)\n* Hindenburg short report, down below is a further explanation to this report.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe short report by Hindenburg covers some issues regarding a DOJ investigation and points out the losses over the year. There\u2019s some more minor stuff besides this.\n\nThe DOJ investigation looks to have been sorted out, they will probably announce something regarding this in the upcoming ER. The losses Hindenburg is pointing out are to be expected for a newly started company, and in my eyes, this is nothing to worry about as the company states they will be profitable in the fiscal year 2023. In fact, they already cut losses in half from 2019 to 2020, while generating 46% more revenue, impressive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**After the short report by Hindenburg short-sellers beat the crap out of CLOV**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* CLOV responded to this in a long report, and the CEO Vivek Garipall went on a phone call with Forbes saying:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\u201cThere is no more real person than I am about this shit,\u201d he contended, casting himself as an honest broker in a \u201cfucked up\u201d healthcare market during a meandering phone call. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care, like, publish whatever. But don\u2019t publish stuff without people like us being able to comment and tell you what we think.\u201d*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* This is a CEO that would do anything for his company, his shares are even locked up until the price reaches $30 for a period of 90 days!\n\n**Next week,** when they release short interest info from NASDAQ (Tues AH), May MA enrollments and earnings (May 17, PM), and options expiry date on May 21\u2026 can you feel something big and positive will come in the next few weeks? I sure as hell can!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Macro-wise,** NASDAQ had a little correction this week (today\u2019s job report sort of kicked rotation from value to growth). Also, hopefully, after Elon\u2019s SNL this weekend, that crypt-o capital will gradually flow into the stock market, especially already beat-up small/medium growth stocks with WSB \u201cshort &amp; gamma squeeze\u201d candidate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bearish case:**\n\n* Increasing competition in the space\n* Legacy companies VS CLOV\n* From 46% YoY growth to \\~24% guidance growth for 2021 (however this is really early still, we would need q1 to see updates on this, may surprise?)\n* Potential Nasdaq correction\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bonus info:** Alphabet (Google) backed CLOV with a $500m investment. Walmart and CLOV recently made a partnership. Demetrios Kouzoukas joins BOD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Analyst ratings:**\n\n* Citigroup buy with a PT of $19\n* Credit Suisse neutral with a PT of $10\n* JP Morgan neutral with a PT of $15\n\nSo right now we are trading below all analyst ratings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** CLOV is currently below its NAV and even further away from the average PT set by analysts.This is a company with huge success and a bright future ahead of it, in one of the hottest sectors under the Democrats! The potential downside is very low, as we are already near the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ways to get in**\n\n* Bullgang  \n\n   * Buy shares (Low risk)\n   * Buy calls (Medium/high risk)\n   * Vertical Bull Debit Call Spread - Buy a ATM call, sell OTM calls. (Low/medium risk)  \n\n      * Example: Buy 1x $10 call at $0.40 (May 21, 2021), Sell 1x $12.5 call at $0.20 (May 21, 2021) 1 contract = 100 shares. Therefore, the maxium risk is $20 for each contract, and max potential gain is $230.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Thetagang  \n\n   * Sell cash-secured puts (Low risk)\n   * Buy shares sell CC's (Low risk)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My price predictions**. If we get a little gamma squeeze I see this go to around $40-60 If we get a full-blown gamma squeeze combined with a short squeeze I could see this go to $75+ Without a gamma squeeze I see this at $15-30 before May 21st. **Please do your own DD before investing**, I\u2019m not a financial adviser. And this is not financial advice. I just would like a Lambo and quit my job\n\nFor the apes out there \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n**Position:** 81x $11 calls expiring in June, 3x $10 calls expiring in May and 10x $15 calls expiring in May.",

        "selftext": "This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tymisf4seiw61.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1aa1cef4c9a92f4863d89db376e4b86acf9380c9\n\n Microvision has overtaken GME to become the most discussed stock. This is the first time since Jan\u201921 that any stock has overtaken GME in the number of mentions (Not even the $100B Coinbase IPO could do it). Clover health has fallen from 3rd position last week to 7th this week. Coinbase also dropped out of the top 10 and is now in the 12th position. All the others are the usual stocks in the top 10 list except for Microsoft. They booked their biggest revenue growth since 2018 but down 3%+ after hours. \n\n **Top Growing Stocks of the Week** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/obttnaoueiw61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8e0b1a918c030d69646aa7f4915def8c13f1007\n\n Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**MicroVision ($MVIS)** has been trending for the last two weeks. To say that the stock had a wild ride for the last 2 weeks would be an understatement. The stock went from having less than 500 mentions to more than 15,000 mentions in the last 2 weeks. The sentiment has also been affected by the recent drop going from 24% last week to 15% this week.\n\n**Globalstar ($GSAT)** is a Mobile satellite service company incorporating themselves into many new areas. GSAT was up 50% on Monday causing the spike in chatter. There has been a lot of discussion on the company trading at a value less than what their satellites currently in orbit are worth.\n\n**Nokia($NOK)** has beaten all expectations in earnings report and the stock jumped 11%. Their net profit increased more than 11-fold to 375 million euros ($455 million) which was well above analysts' estimates for adjusted profit of 90 million euros. The extremely bullish outlook is also reflected in the sentiment figures.\n\n**Ocugen($OCGN)** was trending mainly due to their partnership with an Indian firm \u2013 Bharat Biotech which produces Covaxin. The vaccine was found to neutralize a new type of Covid-19 variant and Dr. Fauci has said that this might be very important against the current pandemic. Ocugen is planning to bring this COVID-19 vaccine to the US, pending FDA authorization.\n\n**Amazon($AMZN)** was generating discussions due to its pending earnings report. There was a lot of speculative talk about a stock split. But they delivered beats on overall revenue and AWS revenue and far exceeded EPS estimate for Q1 2021.\n\n**SOME FAQ\u2019s:**\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).\n\nCan I use the code/is it open source: Yes.\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*",
