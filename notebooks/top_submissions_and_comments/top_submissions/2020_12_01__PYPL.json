        "selftext": " Just saw a great DD article on Seeking Alpha on PLTR. https://seeking$$alpha.com/article/4392215-palantir-technologies-in-depth-look-whether-sustainable-competitive-advantage\n\nIt's paywalled so here's the text to share. I know most of you autists can't read for shit, BUT GODDAMN READ THIS SHIT SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SPENDING YOUR MONEY ON. or just read the summary, or scroll to the very bottom for TL;DR \n\n**Summary**\n\n* As speculators circle around Palantir from both the long and short sides, trading volatility has obscured the fundamental picture as to whether the company commands a sustainable competitive advantage.\n* In this article, I intend to have an under-the-hood look at Palantir as a 'digital resources' play to answer that all-important question.\n* I believe its Gotham, bundled with forward-deployed field service representatives, has surmounted the barriers to entry and now enjoys switching cost advantage and emerging network effect.\n* As it diversifies into adjacent commercial verticals through Foundry, Palantir will benefit from economies of scope and scale. Profits will ensue.\n* Shareholders are betting on Palantir's success in completing the digging of a wide moat. The less anticipatory investors may want to wait until such a moat becomes reality.\n\n**Palantir Technologies: Does It Have A Sustainable Competitive Advantage?**\n\nThere are probably as many investors who are averse to Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR), a recent public listing, as those who root for it. The stock has gone parabolic since the start of November 2020. Then, short-seller Andrew Left of Citron Research entered the scene with his tweet. All of the trading volatility has obscured one important fundamental question: does Palantir have a sustainable competitive advantage?\n\nBelow, I attempt to answer that question with an in-depth look at this interesting company.\n\n**What does Palantir do?**\n\nAs of 2020, Palantir's mission is to help its users, the people doing the hard work on complex, real-world problems by writing software that enables effective analysis against complicated, data-driven problems.\n\nPalantir offers two principal data fusion platforms for integrating, managing, and securing any kind of data at a massive scale, i.e., Gotham for government agencies and Foundry for the commercial market. With forwarded-deployed Field Service Representatives, Palantir transforms massive amounts of disparate information into an integrated data asset that reflects their operations, and layer applications on top of the Gotham or Foundry platform to make the integrated data asset accessible and actionable and for fully interactive, human-driven, machine-assisted analysis (Fig. 1).\n\nOn the backend, Palantir runs a system called Apollo as a continuous, automated means to deliver updates to the Foundry and Gotham platforms everywhere they are deployed - cloud, on-premises, and classified networks - without disrupting customer operations. Apollo reduces the demand for field engineering teams to manage software deployments and gives Palantir SaaS operating efficiency in a very heterogeneous environment.\n\nLooking ahead, Palantir is poised to become the default central operating system for data across the U.S. government and its allies. The company also aspires not only to be the central operating system for data at large businesses and even entire industries. To appreciate Palantir's ambition with regard to B2B big data, it may be helpful to recall how much economic benefit has been captured by Microsoft (MSFT) after Windows OS took the lead over MacOS of Apple (AAPL) in the PC era, and by Google and Apple in the consumer mobile phone age with their respective Android and iOS operating systems.\n\nThere is a range of potential competitors that offer similar services in some capacity, including (1) traditional IT consultancies, e.g., Booz Allen (BAH) and Accenture (ACN), which lack the technical prowess as well as niche focus; (2) blue-chip data companies, e.g., IBM/i2 (IBM), which cannot scale down efficiently enough to compete on price; and (3) defense contractors such as Booz Allen (BAH), Raytheon Technologies (RTX), Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), and BAE Systems plc (OTCPK:BAESF), which cannot compete on costs and end-user responsiveness with Palantir. These juggernauts are not nimble enough to pivot away from their legacies and wide-ranging service offerings to effectively match the focus and end-user friendliness of Palantir, although they may occasionally chip away some revenue.\n\nSilicon Valley heavyweights, such as Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), are unwilling to work for the Pentagon citing unethically even though it thought it was okay to collaborate with the Chinese government in project Dragonfly (see here).\n\nThere are some smaller start-ups that work in the same general field as Palantir, but they lack the resources (capital and talent) to climb the steep learning curve and compete against Palantir head-to-head. These may include Digital Reasoning, which entered the intelligence field even before Palantir and also received funding from In-Q-Tel, the venture capital firm of the CIA, which seems not to be particularly well run which is why its founder recently returned to the CEO helms; (2) Ayasdi, acquired by the SymphonyAI Group in 2019, which has a core topological analysis platform on top of which custom applications for customers mostly in healthcare and finance are built; and Beijing-based MiningLamp, self-styling as \"the Palantir of China\" and with US$300 million just raised in a funding round co-led by Temasek and Tencent, which may pose some threat in the commercial arena given it reportedly got business from western firms (see here).\n\nWith regard to the OS platform for data especially on the government front, Palantir more or less owns the niche. On the commercial front, Palantir is industry agnostic but is focused on forging ties with approximately 6,000 companies in the world with more than $500 million in annual revenue. Palantir has been saying the real competition is the in-house development projects of its potential customers.\n\n**The digital resources space**\n\nI believe some of the key characteristics of Palantir can be better understood in the context of what I call the \"digital resources\" investment space at The Natural Resources Hub (Table 1). This is a group of businesses from various industries, which in a nutshell share the following features:\n\nA unique value proposition. By accumulating and processing big data, or enabling data-intensive operations, these B2B companies generate recurring, subscription-based revenue from business or government customers.\n\nWide moat. They command a monopolistic or oligarchic position in their niche, protected by enormous barriers to entry, some network effects, and switching costs, which gives them a sustainable competitive advantage over the fellow industry participants they serve. They tend to show resilience during industry crises.\n\nDominance in native industry. They are deeply entrenched in their respective native industries. Some of them were even bankrolled at their birth by home industry advocacy groups. They then expand into adjacent industries in pursuit of economies of scope.\n\nAggressive acquisitions. In an expansion of their service into adjacent verticals, they usually face a fragmented competitive landscape, fertile for M&amp;A, which further fuels rapid growth.\n\nCapital and operational efficiency. They develop scalable solutions that are built once and installable or sellable countless times. So, they are capital-light and can operate very efficiently. They typically generate superior profitability and deliver a high rate of returns on invested capital.\n\nAs I shall demonstrate below, Palantir shares most, if not all, of the characteristics of the verified members of the 'digital resources\" space. Prima facie, it is a wide moat prospect and worth a deeper examination.\n\n**Does Palantir have a sustainable competitive advantage?**\n\nIn the consumer-oriented internet arena, winners are known to take all thanks to a number of traits, including the economies of scale and scope, network effects, the advantage of big data and machine learning, brand power, switching costs, the attraction of talents, the charisma of hard-driving founders, and benefits of geographical clustering, as has been summarized here.\n\nThe same may not be said about the B2B platform race, where peers compete mainly on products, services, and customer experience (see here). The outcome of the competition may not be binary (the winner takes all, and the losers die) due to the lack of viral growth.\n\n**The technological edge**\n\nAs I stated above, B2B platform rivals compete primarily on products, services, and customer experience. Palantir follows the approach of bundling superior technology with top-notch forward-deployed field service representatives.\n\nIn its home industry - intelligence and defense, Gotham was created with native attention to security rules, access privilege, and user action logging. No other systems allow users to draw associations between disparate data sets and to visualize the connections as easily and quickly. Palantir has maintained a laser-sharp focus on developing the world's best platform for data, while its primary competitors such as Booz Allen or Raytheon are widely diversified. From competition outcome to reputation among end-users, Palantir not only has a clear technological edge but also is more cost-effective than competitors (see here and here). That's why Palantir is confident it only needs to be placed in front of the right people to prove its worth.\n\nBut then, what makes Gotham shine are the forward-deployed field service representatives. Palantir field service representatives proved to be not only some of the brightest engineers known to government agencies but also extremely responsive to the needs of end-users. These forwarded-deployed engineers examine customer needs, resolve all data source and complexity issues, and build out applications on top of Gotham. Once the applications are built, they train users on site until the customers are ready to use the product on their own. The forwarded-deployed engineers also bring their experience acquired in the reality of deployment back to Palantir development centers as they rotate assignments.\n\nAlthough its technology and approach are by no means cannot be replicated, Palantir makes the smart decision of focusing on a narrow scope in the sprawling B2B data landscape and, in that niche, it excels at helping customers solving complex data problems at relatively low costs, which actually takes a lot to accomplish, from well-written software, via responsive backend support, to knowledgeable forward-deployed field service representatives. It is no wonder Palantir has earned a sterling reputation for effectiveness and ease of use in the intelligence and defense circle, which I believe it can parlay into the commercial market (Fig. 2).\n\n**Palantir brand and talent attraction**\n\nGiven the forwarded-deployed engineers play such an important role in the technological advantage of Palantir (as do the backend developers), it follows that it is critical for it to attract the smartest engineers in the market if that edge is to be maintained and expanded. To that end, the founders have successfully created an aura of mystery around Palantir:\n\nIn-Q-Tel, the venture capital firm of the CIA, being its very first investor; catcher of Osama bin Laden and the would-be preventer of 9/11; buster of the hacker of Dalai Lama's personal computer and Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff;\n\nsoftware vendor to a slew of U.S. intelligence and military agencies (including the CIA, FBI, DHS, NSA, Special Operations, the Marine Corps, the U.S. Army and West Point, the U.S. Navy, the USAF, and the U.S. Space Force), police departments like NYPD, the governments of U.S. allies, and commercial businesses Ferrari (RACE), Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF), BP (BP), Merck (MRK), and JP Morgan (JPM);\n\nhelper of the NIH, CDC, and NHS to track the COVID-19 virus, the World Food Program to stop famine, and the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children to fight child exploitation;\n\nhigh-profile politicians such as former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and CIA Director George Tenet advising, while luminaries Mike Kelly, David MacNaughton, Louis Mosley (grandson of Oswald Mosley), and Fabrice Br\u00e9gier (former No. 2 at Airbus) joining to lead its Australian, Canadian, British, and French subsidiaries, respectively;\n\na dissent in Silicon Valley that takes side with the U.S.A.; let alone the persona of the hard-driving founders, including Peter Thiel who is said to be the smartest guy in the Silicon Valley besides being a co-founder of PayPal (EBAY) and the first outside investor in Facebook (FB), the lawyer-philosopher-hedge fund manager CEO Alex Karp, and the genius engineers Stephen Cohen, Joe Lonsdale, and Nathan Gettings; even Shyam Shankar, the COO, has also been getting a lot of attention...\n\nThe mystique proves to be a powerful recruiting advantage; it helps line up a self-replenishing stream of the best applicants from some of the top-ranked colleges and graduate schools, who are confident they are the smartest computer geeks, who join to work long hours with a cultish band of fellow geniuses to solve the world's hardest problems in spite of lower salaries than Silicon Valley juggernauts like Google, Facebook, and Apple (AAPL).\n\nBecoming a publicly-traded company only strengthens the staffing edge, thus posing a serious challenge for the big IT consultancies, traditional defense contractors, and smaller start-ups. Hiring the best talents will undoubtedly help sustain Palantir's technological advantage.\n\n**High barriers to entry**\n\nThere exist extremely high barriers to entry in the intelligence and defense sector. Even the best end-user experience and reputation alone are not enough to get deals closed. Below, I highlight two hurdles.\n\nJust to open doors. To open doors and lubricate negotiations, some major defense contractors spend as much as $14 million per year on lobbying.\n\nPalantir had been quick in learning the rope of getting things done in Washington D.C. It consulted Washington insiders early on and went ahead hiring former senators John Braux and Trent Lott for formal lobbying (see here). Its lobbying spending has been on a steady rise and, in the last few years, reached well over $1 million per year by hiring &gt;25 lobbyists (Fig. 3).\n\nPalantir also retained former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and CIA Director George Tenet as advisers (see here).\n\nTo overcome buyer inertia gently and forcefully. Another major challenge faced by Palantir was the department of defense saw it as an outsider that tries to sell software not even in response to any specific requests in its conventional acquisition system, oblivious to the capabilities and cost-effectiveness of Palantir Gotham.\n\nIn response, Palantir allowed free trials of Gotham and provided free services before potential military clients made any purchases; it offered free or reduced-price training to military units that purchased its software. Forward-deployed field service representatives listened to the needs of its end-users and were capable of implementing requested changes quickly.\n\nPalantir's entrepreneurial approach led to a number of successes with, e.g., some Army military intelligence units and the Marine Corps. Some intelligence officials in the Marine Corps even went so far as to say they would not be surprised to see Palantir remain the de facto standard (see here).\n\nEven though Palantir has demonstrated the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of Gotham, the U.S. Army stuck to the plan of developing its internal intelligence software suite, i.e., the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Increment 2, and released a procurement solicitation in December 2015 for its development, thus effectively excluding the ready-to-deploy commercial alternative - Gotham - from being considered. The Army decision was a major blow to Palantir because Gotham does exactly what DCGS-A is trying to do yet at a much lower cost; in other words, the Army is reinventing the wheel, unnecessarily and wastefully.\n\nAfter a pre-award bid protest filed with the Government Accountability Office had been denied, Palantir sued the Army in the Court of Federal Claims in June 2016, arguing the Army violated the 1994 Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act by not conducting the market research necessary to determine if commercially available items could meet its needs, with or without modification. The lawsuit is an extremely bold move because defense contractors typically dared not to sue its largest customer, even when their interest as protected by the 1994 law had been infringed. The judge ruled in favor of Palantir in October 2016 and upheld Palantir\u2019s argument the Army violated the 1994 law (see here), which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on September 7, 2018.\n\nEven while the appeal was ongoing, the Army rethought its acquisition plan and, in March 2018, picked Raytheon and Palantir to provide new intelligence analysis platform offerings that could be used effectively at the tactical level in place of DGCS-A. In March 2019, the Army announced Gotham beat out Raytheon's FoXTEN system and won the $20 million first delivery order, as part of an $876 million contract over 10 years. Significantly, the Army's loss in court forced it to transform its procurement process. The Army now follows a \u201ctry, buy, decide approach\u201d when it comes to commercially available products (see here). The win in the court is expected to create a lot of opportunities for Palantir down the road.\n\nThe distance Palantir has gone to gain access to the intelligence and military market proves one thing: the presence of enormous barriers to entry. In the face of such formidable hurdles, few aspirants have the determination, investment time horizon, and resources to pull off the feat of entering and establishing itself as the de facto standard in that market. Over a time span of 15+ years, Palantir sunk quite a few billions of VC dollars on software development, offering products and services for free or on lean fees, and lobbying and suing to get a level playing field, yet without a single major botch-up over all those years. Those who sneer at Palantir for still losing money after 17 years of investment fail to appreciate how impossible a strategic goal the company has come to set for itself: to become a wide-moat software supplier to the governments of the U.S. and its allies.\n\n**Switching cost, economies of scale, and network effect**\n\nHaving earned contracts from the intelligence and defense sector, Palantir became an insider so to speak, and the barriers to entry work to its advantage. Gotham has been deployed as the platform for data integration at various intelligence and military units displacing the existing system including DGCS-A, a myriad of applications has been developed for the agents, and thousands of end-users have been trained to use those applications on a tactical level in critical missions and battlefields. A switching cost has arisen in favor of Palantir and it will only get higher.\n\nAs more contracts are signed with the U.S. government and its allies, Palantir will begin to enjoy economies of scale, thanks to the large fixed costs incurred for building the software once and the relatively low costs associated with deploying it countless times.\n\nJust playing out according to Palantir's plan, Gotham is increasingly being used for sharing disparate data sets across different government agencies. Once those siloed data sets are all integrated on Gotham, there will emerge a huge network effect, further heightening the existing barriers to entry. Under such a network effect, a new entrant may land an isolated deal sporadically, but it is beyond me how this hypothetical incursor can dislodge Palantir by convincing dozens of stodgy government agencies to simultaneously give up perfectly-functional, mission-critical Gotham and install an unproven piece of software instead. That's why I believe Palantir's competitive advantage in the government sector will prove to be sustainable.\n\n**The commercial market**\n\nAs I discussed above, 'digital resources' companies tend to expand into adjacent verticals for the benefit of economies of scope. Palantir's expansion into various industries in the commercial sector is precisely for that end. The same technological know-how sharpened in defense deployments can be parlayed into serving the commercial sector. The utilization of Apollo, the backend system for continuous, automated software update deployment, doubles as it supports Foundry in addition to Gotham. The corporate resources are shared by operations in both sectors, resulting in lower overhead per dollar of revenue. The direct sales force will be able to cross-sell Gotham to some commercial customers. Diversification into additional industries reduces the risk associated with the slowdown of individual industries. As opposed to the high barriers to entry in its home industry of intelligence and defense, the commercial world tends to have more competitors. However, economies of scope will likely offset the narrower moat.\n\n**Network effect in the commercial sector**\n\nOver the long term, Palantir (PLTR) estimates the total addressable commercial market contains \\~6,000 companies with more than $500 million in annual revenue (see here). Palantir began to develop Foundry for the commercial sector in 2012 and launched it in 2016. Foundry is poised to become a central operating system not only for individual institutions but also for entire industries. In 2017, e.g., the five-year, $300 million partnership with Airbus allowed Foundry to expand into a platform for the aviation industry, which today connects data from &gt;100 airlines and 9,000 aircraft around the world.\n\nIf successful, an industry-wide central operating system for data will effectuate an extensive network effect. However, to get there, Palantir needs to rapidly grow the commercial top-line. Foundry pulled in $340 million in 2018 and $397 million in 2019. Commercial revenue grew 35% from the 3Q2019 to the same period one year ago (see here). How will Palantir further accelerate commercial sales momentum?\n\n**Commercial sales strategies to accelerate the network effect**\n\nIn the near term, Palantir plans to focus on building partnerships with institutions that have the leadership necessary to effect structural change within their organizations - to reconstitute their operations around data. Buy-in from the top brass is imperative. Hopefully, Palantir can leverage its reputation and relationships gained in the government sector, as in an early case in which NYPD, then a customer, introduced Palantir to its first commercial client JP Morgan (JPM).\n\nPalantir used to have a policy of not hiring direct salespeople, given how intelligence and military contracts are acquired and serviced and perhaps due to a post-dotcom bubble belief \"technology is primarily about product development, not distribution\". However, there is absolutely no viral growth in B2B as there occasionally is in B2C. The common practice in the 'digital resources' space is to maintain a large force of salespeople each managing a few customer accounts, with responsibilities such as opening new sales territory, scouting for client needs, scaling within existing customer accounts, coordinating technical presentations by engineers, securing technical support for clients, and managing customer relationships. Palantir began to recruit direct salespeople in end-2018. The commercial sales growth in 2019 seems to prove the concept of direct sales works, so Palantir is poised to triple the headcount of the sales force.\n\nHistorically, data-inundated organizations either build in-house or buy dozens of off-the-shelf products and sew them together, both approaches having been proven inefficacious in a rapidly changing and increasingly uncertain world. Foundry offers the third, and better, option for those organizations. However, Palantir comes to realize that, in the near-term, institutions do have an imperative to stick to their internally-built software. So, Palantir makes its own solutions fully modular such that customers can \"take what they need, build on what they have\" (see here). Such a flexible approach should help overcome corporate inertia to reach out for external assistance and accelerate customer onboarding, and create a new way of going to market with channel partners.\n\nPalantir plans to partner with cloud-hosting channel partners, such as Amazon (AMZN), to drive commercial revenue growth. It was Amazon that helped facilitate the partnership between Palantir and the Colombian government. Palantir developed Visor COVID-19, a digital instrument built on top of Foundry hosted in the AWS infrastructure and offering a unified, near real-time view of the state of the pandemic using the largest integration of open data and depersonalized epidemiological data in Colombia.\n\nInternational sales already account for fo 46% of the total revenue as of the 3Q2020. As part of its international growth plan, Palantir has set up subsidiaries in Canada, Australia, the U.K., France, and other countries in the last few years. In Japan, it took a different approach and chose to form a joint venture in partnership with Sompo Holdings, Inc., which subsequently invested $500 million in Palantir. The JV launched in June 2020 \u201cthe real data platform for security, health, and wellbeing\u201d, powered by Foundry, to accelerate the digital transformation of Japanese governmental institutions and industries ranging from healthcare to automotive to manufacturing. The JV is also working on onboarding the Japanese government.\n\n**Risk abounds**\n\nPublic relation disasters can damage its image in the eyes of the next generation of software engineers; this is an area that Palantir, now a public company, should allocate additional resources to. A Snowden-like incident can set Palantir back appreciably, impacting client relationships and employee morale alike.\n\nPalantir must penetrate its chosen market swiftly to enlarge the switching cost, expand the network effect, and heighten barriers to entry, lest a resourceful competitor launches a dogged challenge in the government sector or its smaller imitators strike it lucky in the commercial market and steal potential customers. A well-intended acquisition can turn sour, contaminating the entire operation.\n\nAs far as I can see, the management team at Palantir is paranoid enough to allow any blind spots unaddressed in its business execution. However, Black swans do happen.\n\n**Investor takeaways**\n\nI believe Palantir has an inchoate durable competitive advantage, which acts as an economic moat to protect its business from invaders, which seems to be widening judging from new developments since the IPO.\n\nIn the self-created niche of supplying the operating systems for data for government agencies, Palantir clearly delivers a peerless customer experience with superior technology bundled with top-notch forward-deployed field service representatives.\n\nGotham has become the default operating system for data at some U.S. government agencies, where Palantir enjoys switching costs.\n\nPalantir seems to have also built a brand that helps attract top-notch talents, which sustains its technological edge.\n\nNow that it has kicked open the door of the U.S. government agencies by winning a critical lawsuit against the Army, Palantir is expected to achieve rapid penetration of that market. Gotham is increasingly being used for integrating siloed data sets across different government agencies, which in time will result in an enormous network effect, further heightening the barriers to entry for aspirant entrants.\n\nThe company is aggressively diversifying into adjacent commercial verticals and international markets for economies of scope. Revenue growth, both from the government and commercial sectors, will lead to economies of scale. Down the road, Palantir will have the pricing power at its disposal to drive profitability.\n\nAt this time, the share price of Palantir may seem to have gotten ahead of itself - a point to be further explored elsewhere. The shareholders are taking risks to bet that the company will succeed in digging the wide moat and that years of profitable growth will follow.\n\nLess anticipatory investors may want to wait until Palantir has completed building such a wide moat. For these investors, the entry opportunity may come in the form of a major sell-off during a general market recession or in an idiosyncratic crisis down the road.\n\n**TL;DR - PLTR has great prospects, short-term casino, long term (8-12 months) to the moon**\n\nPositions: some shares of PLTR, some 12/4 $30 puts (hedge) at 50% gainz.",

        "selftext": "I've been investing, trading, gambling for about 5 years now and I've done pretty much every rookie mistake there is. Sold winners from 2016 (Shop,Nvidia,AMD,Paypal) Lost fortunes on chasing that pennystock. Played and lost with trying to time the market, option trading. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been very active during these years reading and learning and you be surprised how often people get sucked in to the same stuff you self did once. \n\nThese are 8 guidelines that really helps me and that I've learn to appreciate over the years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1.Don't FOMO**\n\nYes we all heard it. You know that feeling when people are posting crazy gains on these new stocks, we all saw the EV hype. It's so so easy to get sucked in to thinking, if I just put in some money right now I can get 10-20-50% gains in a few days! It's already up 200% this month, surely it will keep going!? \n\nThis takes some real patience to keep your head cool and realize it could very well be overbought and the downside risk is just a lot higher than potential. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've seen several sector hypes. We all remember the crypto bubble, the weed bubble and now lately the EV bubble. They all come and go and the more of these you been in from the start the easier it is to realize what's going on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. Cut your losers and let your winners run**\n\nBuying the dip is great when the market is down but if the fundamentals of the business is bad then usually this will just result in greater loss. On the flipside, if you have a few great picks and nothing fundamentally has changed and it keeps moving in the right direction then don't be afarid to keep adding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. When the overall market is down, you buy**\n\nNo one can predict the market, don't waste time on it. When the overall market is down your stock is literally on sale. Usually every sector is down when the market is down, your stock and business has not changed one bit however, it's just a lower price now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. Don't be afraid of corrections.**\n\nYeah it sucks seeing your portfolio down 20-30-40% but realize that stocks always go up, they seriously always do. Just keep your head down, keep buying and play that long game.\n\n**5. Small amounts can turn into big profits down the line**\n\nWhen you get really into investing you seriously start rethinking your life. That new OLED 77 inch? Only 2k right? What do you think that 2000 could be in 10 years? You just want to put every damn penny you got in the stock market because compounding interests are just too good to pass up. So just rethink if really need that new thing now or if it could wait.\n\n**6. If the company keeps growing, why sell?**\n\nTaking profit is good however not always the best thing to do. If the stock you have keeps growing and keeps crushing earnings. Why should you sell? Why just not keep it for years, it sure can be tempting but are you sure that money could be spent better elsewhere when it's easily growing in your winning stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**7, Never regret that you didn't buy more**\n\n We all been here. Why the hell didn't I buy more of Amazon? Why didn't I just put my whole paycheck in this stock!? \n\nYou can never do this. It won't lead to anything, you can't fix it and you honestly did the best decisions at the time with the information you had. Realize that at the time this was the best decision, ofcourse hindsight it looks like you could have done a better decision.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**8. Don't sell and buy in again to time a correction**\n\nThis is very hard and with the momentum some growth stocks have these days you might just end up loosing more of that profit even if there is a slight correction. Just keep the money in and stop worrying.",

I wanted to do a bit of DD on BFT but also wanted to highlight something that was brought to my attention by a degenerate gambler. Lastly, I wanted to compile some good little snippets that have been put together by some other members as well as from the investor presentation.\n\n**Before reading further please understand the major Risks.**\n\n* This is SPAC with \\~10.00 NAV, if the deal falls through it could drop to 10.00 USD\n* The warrants could be very lucrative but they can be called and if a deal fails to materialize, these can become worthless.\n* If you're ok with the above risks, continue reading.\n\nKeep in mind that this merger is not complete, but the terms of the deal have been provided to investors and we will be able to either vote yes for the deal or vote no and redeem our shares in BFT for 10.00 cash.

Gambling is a tricky business and regulated differently than other industries. Many big players have avoided the industry and Paysafe has a great reputation and has become one of the early movers in the industry. The following are some notable customers.\n* &amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0bhbpnvr0b461.jpg?width=473&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57ec71dfedd8c6eb1d604282021340fbd8d39025\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cno03rvr0b461.jpg?width=285&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4281b8e0db4783b7b4b6cce74f62f0694bdbb008\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* A gentleman u/dancinadventures posted this comment on my last post:\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *I actually know Paysafe and the usage quite well.*\n\n*PayPal has many restrictions in Europe regarding iGaming , so does Square.*\n\n*This is a big play on iGaming for those that aren\u2019t aware.*\n\n*I was a mid- high stakes online poker player through the 2010-2018. Played a variety of sites. : iPoker; PokerStars, Paddy, MicroGaming, 888, Party. Why so many sites? Because I was always on lookout for where the action was, if a big whale sat down at one online casino; you bet your sweet ass I\u2019m there.*\n\n*So let me give you my take as a consumer that\u2019s probably spent over $100,000 in transaction fees personally on Paysafe.*\n\n*This was one of the cheapest and fastest ways to move money around online.*\n\n*Unlike Stripe this which is against risky business such as CBD and gambling, paysafe is actually one of the leading payment providers in both UK/AUS / Ireland for iGaming.*\n\n*Big example is William Hill, Bet365, Bwin.*\n\n*Now why would you want to move money online around as a gambler ?*\n\n*Well, Visa/MC charge close to 50%-&gt;75% more, online casinos = the merchant. They don\u2019t wanna pay that, and in fact put limits on this type of payment processor. (Your visa\u2019s credit cards etc). If a punter deposits / withdraws frequently, the online casino could literally be on the hook for like 20-30% of the turnover throughout the gambler\u2019s period. (This assumes the gambler doesn\u2019t lose all his money per deposit.*\n\n*Imagine you\u2019re a professional sportsbettor, you\u2019re not loyal to one site. Different spreads / odds are offered on every site, you want to be able to move your money from one to another quickly and cheaply. Arbitrage opportunities do exist in sports betting as bookmakers hedge their books to minimize risk, diff frequencies of bets occur on each sports book; you get the idea.*\n\n*For recreational punters, it\u2019s simple: some sporting events that are smaller simply don\u2019t exist on one site that exist on another. Eg. Perhaps you using Pinnacle / 10dimes for low spreads on high volume events, but perhaps you want to gamble on live events on bet365 on another day, and bet ponies on Hill.*\n\n*What if you only have $5000 ? Giant pain in ass to deposit money to each site, paysafe lets you move it around easily.*\n\n*Should you use visa, you may get blocked from depositing on various sites; Bodog, WHill, Bet365 just to name a few. Withdrawals and clearing deposits with bank transfers or checks takes days-&gt; weeks and gamblers ain\u2019t gonna wait for that shit.*\n\n*You can also buy prepaid paysafe cards from stores if you don\u2019t wish to use your real credit card; and load that shit up.*\n\n*One of the biggest markets this is prominent in is South east Asia, they are some of the biggest punters and fucking loving gambling. Looking at you pinoys, Indonesians, Malays. Not everyone wants to fly to Macau to get their rocks off.*\n\n*As much as this is a play on FinTech, please understand this company has more or less the best Payment service on online gambling globally.*\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# The Comparable VALUATIONS\n\nFrom this chart you can see that there looks to be some favorable multiples that could improve once a deal closes. Also, I'm very bullish on the great Margins as well as the conservative growth. I think Foley along with the growing Igaming undervalues the potential of this company. Just the Draft Kings relationship make me tingle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aozxwuft0b461.jpg?width=722&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e40cbc4538ff3bef87a31050dca316ecae996a9b\n\n# Management and Growth\n\n* Bill Effing Foley - I have a thing for guys name Bill and this guy get my nips hard.\n   * This guy has turned shit into gold. See his previous ventures before and after....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dp6oe2ew0b461.jpg?width=386&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e6f137c95fec971568dfa5bc07d0290997c753d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mhl9b7ew0b461.jpg?width=326&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f57ec2eb7c7c318323373af10c8bb12b03e9082e\n\n* Bill has connections and a strategy to dominate Igaming.\n* Igaming addressable Market is expected to grow immensely from a few billion to tens of billions.\n* &amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qfacblzz0b461.jpg?width=241&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbcdace95286ffccf613daa79b93554ca3e5728b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is an end to end payment processor with big big big name relationships for very disruptive companies that have huge addressable markets. The reason I am excited is because IGAMING is just really starting to take off and Paysafe is a first mover with brand new experienced management and very very fair valuations that could pop after a merger.\n\nTL;DR- BUY BFT stock and BFT.W because BFT stands for big freaking tenies.",

        "selftext": "With news of a Roblox IPO, I decide to dive into this company to see what the hype is about. When Roblox was first brought to my attention, I thought they were some sort of gimmick legos. Full disclosure, I have never played this game, but I did play Runescape many, many years ago. Chopped the hell out of some Yew trees. This makes me not the least qualified to gauge Roblox as a video game, but we are gauging its potential as a stock instead.\n\n   \n\n* Roblox is a global platform where millions of people gather together to imagine, create, and share experiences with each other in immersive, user-generated 3D worlds\n* Roblox plans to IPO before Christmas, so we take a look at the rumored valuation of $8bn\n* Covid-19 has generated a huge boost to traffic with Daily Active Users ((DAUs)) growing 82%, hours engaged growing 122%, revenue growing 68%, bookings growing 171%, and a large $292.6 mm in free cash flow in the nine months ended Sept 30, 2020\n* The valuation story depends on Roblox's ability to continue growing once the Covid pandemic is in the rear-view mirror\n\n**Roblox Business and Technology:** Roblox was founded in 2003 and has hit many milestones before the planned IPO launch. The most important recent developments being the Joint Venture with Tencent to establish Roblox China and re-launching Roblox Premium to develop a subscriber base with steadier cash flows.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: company S-1](https://preview.redd.it/v9zg6l79wr261.png?width=652&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d09098392824ef50ccdb348012f121908456c473)\n\nThe Roblox business model is based on the underlying technology and infrastructure that support the 31.1 million average DAUs. Roblox defines a DAU as \"a user who has logged in and visited Roblox through our website or application on a unique registered account on a given calendar day. If a registered, logged in user visits Roblox more than once within a 24-hour period that spans two calendar days, that user is counted as a DAU only for the first calendar day\" [(source: company S-1)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm). \n\nThis business is based on three elements:\n\n* **Roblox Client:** The underlying app that allows users to explore 3D worlds\n* **Roblox Studio:** The toolset that enables developers and creators to build, publish, and operate 3D      experiences and content \n* **Roblox Cloud:** The services and infrastructure that power the platform\n\n[We think this is what Roblox players do, but we can't be sure](https://preview.redd.it/cw6x1j3dwr261.png?width=691&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=351745b196e484eca18f7a959dcc73cddb178c70)\n\nThe Roblox platform and the key technology characteristics are as follows:\n\n* Identity: The Roblox avatar system allows users to create and personalize their unique 3D identities. There are a wide variety of character styles.\n* Friends: The Roblox Client allows users to connect through various means, including detecting nearby players or meeting in the Roblox world. The social graph created by these connections is stored in the Roblox Cloud. The Roblox Platform supports text-based chat among users sharing the same 3D experience and between users connected through the social graph.\n* Immersion: The Roblox platform allows developers to build deeply immersive 3D environments where users can share experiences.\n* Low friction: Users have the ability to interact with experiences almost instantly, on most popular      client devices, and from anywhere in the world over existing broadband and cellular networks. When a user joins an online experience, the Roblox Cloud assigns that user to a particular game instance based on the user\u2019s social graph, geographic location, spoken language, and age group. \n* Variety of content: Roblox provides developers with reference material, tutorials, community forums, and analytics to build their creations. **Developers and creators build nearly all of the content for the Roblox Platform.** Once content is built, it can be replicated and shared across multiple experiences giving developers the ability to scale their efforts and make rapid updates. There were over 18 million experiences on Roblox as of Sept 30, 2020.\n* Global: The Roblox Platform serves a global audience. In the nine months ended September 30,      2020, developers from over 170 countries and users spanning over 180 countries accessed the platform.\n* Economy: Roblox has a vibrant economy built on a currency called Robux, which can be purchased.      Developers and creators earn Robux by selling access to virtual content or by driving engagement of Premium subscribers through an engagement-based payout system. When Premium subscribers spend time in a developer\u2019s experience, that developer earns a prorated share of the user\u2019s monthly subscription fee. \n\n[Robux, the currency of the online Roblox world, buying options](https://preview.redd.it/ob8nmkdrwr261.png?width=648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08d00a16cb7c44c1d36329ef4692f1d85cd3b309)\n\n**Developer Incentives:** With nearly the entire Roblox online universe being built by the ingenuity of developers and creators, Roblox has developed a system to incentivize natural development expansion.\n\nRoblox currently offers developers and creators four ways to earn Robux:\n\n* The sale of access to their experiences and enhancements to these experiences\n* Engagement-based payouts - rewarding developers for the amount for time that Premium subscribers spend in their experiences\n* The sale of content and tools between developers\n* Sale of items to users through the Avatar marketplace\n\nAs users purchase and spend their Robux on Roblox, developers receive 70% of the Robux spent within their experiences and 70% of the items that appear in the Studio marketplace. Creators receive 30% of the Robux spent for their items on the Avatar marketplace.\n\n[ Example of a store from Mining Simulator by Runaway Rumble within Roblox  ](https://preview.redd.it/ll886iywwr261.png?width=701&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a297ebec391df538a2db9c580294c677a6b2d7c3)\n\nThese earned Robux are deposited into virtual accounts where developers can convert Robux into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of 1 Robux to $0.0035. In the nine months ended Sept 30, 2020, developers and creators earned $209.2 mm, up from $72.2 mm in the nine months ended Sept 30, 2019. Clearly, the Roblox developers and creators are also benefiting from the massive spike in users on Roblox.\n\n**Current Roblox Business Profile:** When users sign up for Roblox, they can create an avatar and explore the vast majority of experiences for free, although the business model for any experience is ultimately up to the developer. Users can purchase Robux either as one-time purchases or via Roblox Premium, a subscription service billed monthly. \n\nFor one-time purchases, users can purchase the virtual currency through various channels including the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, credit cards, prepaid cards, Microsoft app store, PayPal, and others. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 34% and 18% of Roblox revenue was generated on Apple App Store and Google Play Store, respectively. For operations through both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, Roblox must pay the customary 30% to Apple or Google. \n\nRoblox has managed to rapidly expand its DAU base. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[source: Company and our estimates](https://preview.redd.it/tgm7pzjzwr261.png?width=608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87bea9ab82d310c938dc0fff317a4ecbbb37ba47)\n\nRoblox has grown its DAU count by 94.9% and 96.9% in Q2 and Q3 of this year, respectively. DAUs are up in every geographic region with the Rest of the World segment growth being particularly impressive. However, Roblox acknowledges that this upsurge in growth during the pandemic may not be sustainable when they say, \"We do not expect these activity levels to be sustained, and in future periods we expect growth rates for our revenue to decline, and we may not experience any growth in bookings or our user base during periods where we are comparing against COVID-19 impacted periods\" (source: company S-1).\n\nThe growth profile and future look of Roblox as an attractive investment hinges on their ability to keep the surge in DAU growth they've experienced as a result of the pandemic and then continue to grow their DAUs (albeit at a slower pace compared to 2020).\n\nThe DAU metrics show that 55.6% of DAUs in the nine months ended Sept 30, 2020 are under the age of 13. \n\n[source: company S-1](https://preview.redd.it/cyhv0lh2xr261.png?width=672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45a85667c88551495acbff9c346b7ea71da5cbdd)\n\nDAUs drive spending, and Roblox has seen the average bookings per DAU increase as well. Bookings are defined as \"equal to the amount of virtual currency purchased by users in a given period of time\" (source: company S-1). Therefore, we can expect bookings to be the most widely watched metric every quarterly earnings release, not revenue. DAUs and average bookings per DAU growth are the primary drivers in our valuation model.\n\n**Roblox Cost Profile:** The major Roblox operating costs consist of \n\n* Cost of revenue - 3rd party payment processing such as Apple and Google app stores - 12.5% of Bookings YTD\n* Developer exchange fees - amount earned by developers and creators on the Roblox platform - 16.9% of Bookings YTD\n* Infrastructure - Data centers and technical support - 19.8% of Bookings YTD\n* R&amp;D, G&amp;A, and Sales and marketing - 19.8% of Bookings YTD\n\n[source: company and our estimates  ](https://preview.redd.it/j4khoil7xr261.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5e4f1d7614e4ca6a02656ae82fdf655b45cfcbb)\n\nAs you can see from the chart above, the Loss from Operations has widened significantly the past 4 quarters. However, this is slightly misleading because the company is cash flow positive and the company has been generating more cash flow, not less.\n\n[source: company S-1](https://preview.redd.it/ub0dbvdaxr261.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0052285a3da1637689665e1708d86cf482402877)\n\nThe reason for this is the method the company uses to recognize revenue vs bookings. On revenue recognition, \"We generally recognize revenue from users ratably over the average lifetime of a paying user, which for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2019 was 23 months. Therefore, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of purchases of Robux during previous periods\" (source: company S-1). And bookings - \"Substantially all of our bookings are generated from sales of our virtual currency **which we record as deferred revenue and then recognize that revenue over the estimated average lifetime of a paying user**\" (source: company S-1).\n\n[source: Company S-1](https://preview.redd.it/zoad08rcxr261.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3a9d7615a3cf3cbd3f35779c598ddf9e97f9fd9)\n\n**So these accounting losses don't necessarily matter** because the company is free cash flow positive. As we can see in the table of bookings and revenue, revenue as a % of bookings declined from 70% in 2019 to 38.4% and 48.8% in Q2 and Q3 2020 respectively. \n\n**Roblox Growth strategy:** Roblox is focused on four core strategies in order to achieve growth:\n\n* Platform extension: Roblox is continually investing in the platform including in avatars, experiences, technology, and other social features. These efforts can further drive bookings per DAU.\n* Age demographic expansion: Roblox and developers are working on building higher quality experiences      and content that appeal to an older age demographic. These efforts can drive DAU growth as well as bookings per DAU as older people don't have to beg mom and dad for their credit card.\n* International growth: The JV with Tencent in China is a testament to Roblox's ability to grow      internationally into new markets.\n* Further monetization: Roblox is working with their developer community actively to help improve      monetization. Efforts such as Roblox premium being introduced in August 2019 as well as working with leading brands to build unique marketing opportunities on the Roblox platform can further drive monetization.\n\n**Massively Multiplayer Online Gaming Market:** The MMO market has increased rapidly and has hit over 16 million total players. ([source](https://mmo-population.com/charts/players)) We take a look at the market's growth to get a sense of the growth that Roblox may be able to achieve in the near future and beyond. The total number of players dipped in 2019, but the trend is clear with around a 28.5% CAGR in total MMO players over the past 3 years.\n\n[ Source: https:\\/\\/mmo-population.com\\/charts\\/players  ](https://preview.redd.it/1u289h9jxr261.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42b6b45ae0f250d7b671e39c015c3191a4d818de)\n\nWe also take a look at the MMO arguably most similar to Roblox, Minecraft. Minecraft is owned by Microsoft and they have released intermittent data points on the number of active players on the platform. The number of active players on Minecraft has increased from 40 million in June 2016 to 126 million as of May 2020. We have only 5 total data points in this time-frame, but this indicates a 33% CAGR over the period and it has accelerated from October 2018 to May 2020. Can Roblox experience a similar level of growth in active players?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: Statista](https://preview.redd.it/4vk40mhmxr261.png?width=608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5aeaed7f528565eeacfa0e438c2c284135566db8)\n\n**Roblox Forecast:** The basis of our valuation is Bookings per user growth, DAU by region growth, and expenses as a % of Bookings.\n\nBookings per User have grown 68.6% and 52.5% in Q2 and Q3 y/y, respectively. We think they continue to grow at a high pace in Q4 and Q1 of next year. However, growth will then decelerate as the populations are vaccinated and people start to live their lives as normal once again, thus removing a tailwind for online gaming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[source: company S-1](https://preview.redd.it/65tv0bgoxr261.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0e840ee21dfd46a6fe29407791fedf8d2124640)\n\nWe have Bookings per user growing 20.6% in 2021, 10% in 2022, 7.5% in 2023, and 5% in subsequent years. For example, this deceleration in each DAU spend gives us a quarterly spend on over $20 a quarter in 2024.\n\nDAUs have grown rapidly during the pandemic, and likewise we expect this growth to decelerate as the pandemic draws to a close. We forecast that Roblox will consolidate its Covid user-base gains, and grow an additional 12.5% in DAUs in 2021, 7.5% in 2022, and 5% every subsequent year. This means that Roblox will pass 50 million DAUs in 2024 and will have close to 60 million in 2030.\n\nWe forecast that Roblox's costs and expenses will increase, but as a result of scaling will decrease as a % of Bookings in the future. We anticipate that Roblox will be able to consolidate its cost profile so far experienced in 2020 and will have a cost profile \\~60% of Bookings in the future, with the largest contributors to cost being cost of revenue, developer exchange fees, and infrastructure where it is more difficult to create efficiencies through scale.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[source: our estimates](https://preview.redd.it/fak9anwrxr261.png?width=655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1481cb9b74bd217e9128021b835a5f6e138f0e69)\n\nFor some scenario analyses of what the company bookings will be in 2025, we look at different ranges of DAU growth and Bookings per user growth. Roblox currently has averaged 31.1mm DAUs in 2020, and we run scenarios from 22mn to 92mm DAUs in 2025. Likewise, we grow average bookings anywhere from 0% to 17.5% a year. We estimate the likeliest bookings range to be $2.9bn to $5.4bn in 2025, compared to the estimated $1.8bn in bookings for full-year 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[source: our estimates](https://preview.redd.it/1c7eypauxr261.png?width=639&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=890160c98e1424fce516a7a087158e0dfdce9bc8)\n\n**Valuation:** We value Roblox through a Discounted cash flow model with a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 8% and a perpetual growth rate of 4%. With these assumptions, we get an equity value per share of around $26.50. With the rumors of Roblox seeking a valuation of \\~$8bn [(source)](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/technology/roblox-is-all-but-guaranteed-a-blockbuster-ipo-15496912), we get 114% upside. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[source: our estimates](https://preview.redd.it/bagtmrcwxr261.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14e0c99b1ae727ebfd7ea5134b5e64d58b0d756c)\n\nJust for fun, we run a scenario where we give Roblox decrease DAUs -5% and give 0% growth in bookings per DAU, while keeping the same cost profile, for the final three quarters of 2021 (when the pandemic winds down). We then grow at an anemic rate in DAUs in the future, 5% in 2022 and 2.5% a year onward, we get a price target of \\~$18.30 and an equity value close to $12bn.\n\n**Risks to our View:**\n\nYounger audience: With 55.6% of DAUs under the age of 13, how likely is it that they stay on the Roblox platform, we don't have a definitive answer. Kids so young move to the next hottest game very easily and quickly and therefore it is crucial that Roblox continue to capture and keep their attention in order to grow their DAU count.\n\nMMO gaming market competition: An extension of the first risk, the MMO gaming market is incredibly competitive and Roblox will need to continue to innovate and develop its platform to stay ahead of the competition. We aren't aware of any new releases that directly challenge Roblox's position as one of the most widely played games in the world, but new video games and revamps of old games happen all the time. We look forward to seeing how Roblox continues to differentiate itself in the gaming market from competitors and whether these efforts will be successful.\n\nInability to consolidate Covid user-base gains: Once the pandemic ends will the majority of DAUs gained no longer play Roblox or play/spend less? Our model assumes that the company is able to keep the majority of its DAUs and continue to grow, but this is truly a risk without a real precedent.\n\nIf you would like to see the model yourself and change assumptions as you see fit, you can download it for free here: [http://millennialmkts.com/2020/12/02/roblox-valuation-a-first-look/](http://millennialmkts.com/2020/12/02/roblox-valuation-a-first-look/)\n\n**TLDR;** This stock has a very positive story and a lot of price upside if Covid-induced growth can be consolidated and future growth can be achieved. We look to the pricing of the IPO. I've already seen it hyped on here and been asked about it so this will surely pop to moon \\*rocket ship emoji\\*",

        "selftext": "Most of you already know who Peter Thiel is. He is the co-founder/chairman and largest shareholder in Palantir. Most of his networth is tied to PLTR. He is the head of the PayPal mafia and really people he has backed formed the back of Silicon Valley post google.\n\nHe loves to provoke controversy by paying kids to drop out of college to start businesses. He promotes seasteading and anti aging research. So why does this matter. Well his ventures funds are all usually 10x oversubscribed so yes it\u2019s nearly impossible to invest into him even if you have billions of dollars. Yes you can throw billions of dollars at him and he won\u2019t take your money. \n\nBut by buying palantir you are literally replicating the same portfolio positioning as the smartest ventures capitalist in the world. The man who foresaw the rise of Facebook, the man who is best buds with Elon musk (backed Tesla and Space X, they actually both nearly died in a car accident in Elon\u2019s Mclaren F1). This man does not fuck around (even if he does fuck other men).  \n\nAnd on top of that his money is directly used to save the world from a mimetic apocalypse brought about by zero sum completion. The man is literally doing it out of Christian duty to save the world.\n\nhttps://www.city-journal.org/peter-thiel\n\nLook, if you don\u2019t give this man more money we will all be living in some sort of dystopia, be it totalitarian AI, matrix, post nuclear war road warrior, factional sectarian violence ala reformations 2.0 or the purge where antifa and militias battle it out on the streets. The only way to hold the apocalypse at bay is to invest in a few genius level people who can change the world and create millions of jobs and the best way to do that is to give all your money to Peter Thiel.\n\nTLDR: buy PLTR, make tendies, save the world",

        "selftext": "What do these companies all have in common? Peter Thiel as a founding investor. \n\nI'm sick of seeing all you dumbasses speculating on how hard it is to find the next TSLA in one thread and complaining about 'bag-holding' PLTR in another.\n\nYou retards have unwittingly bought into what the CEO has described will be the 'most important software in the world in a couple years' but are too ADD to sit on a stock for longer than a week.  The fucking DoD gave this company **[800 million dollars](https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/palantir-army-contract-dcgs-a/)** over a year ago and they've publicly stated they will never work with China (who by the way the US is about to engage in a tech / data arms race with if they aren't already). \n\nGov't contracts aside, public companies are spending 10s of millions of dollars on this software and it's *saving them even more*.  They have essentially been in stealth mode developing their tech for the last 17 years to assure that they have no competition, and the revenue is about to pour in big time. \n\nNobody understands this stock yet, and that's beautiful because it has potential to grow 10x in the next 5 years.\n\nThose bags you're complaining about holding are filled with diamonds, institutional investors realized this too late and have been trying to fuck with the price in response.\n\nIf you want more in-depth DD, look at [this post by /u/colonel_cubical](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kdp6qr/the_general_public_still_doesnt_understand_pltr/)\n\nTL;DR: Don't be the dumbass that sold TSLA for $50. \n\nPositions: 50% of my Portfolio in PLTR @ avg. cost of $16.40, bunch of various LEAPs for 2022/2023",

        "selftext": "Luminar makes LIDAR sensors and software for vehicles. Lidar sensors, which use laser light pulses to render precise images of the environment around the car, are seen as essential by **many automakers** to allow higher levels of driver assistance right up to making them capable of **self-driving**. The combined company will retain the name Luminar Technologies Inc. and list on the Nasdaq under the symbol \"LAZR\u201d. Since the announcement in august, GMHI stock is up 38%, bringing the mkt cap to $1.7 Bln. The deal should be completed by Q1 2021 and the merge pro forma implied enterprise value of approximately $2.9 Bln and a market capitalization of approximately $3.4 Bln, so today we are trying to understand if there\u2019s more room for tendies after the *bullish bonanza* of the previous week.\n\n**Gentlemen you had my curiosity ... but now you have my attention**\n\nThere are some serious players behind this deal so let\u2019s break them down:The deal includes $400 million of cash from Gores Metropoulos, whose founder is a private equity professional, $200 million financing by investors including tech billionaire **Peter Thiel** (PayPal, Palantir), GoPro Inc founder Nick Woodman, Volvo Cars Tech Fund and VectoIQ, the firm that helped Nikola Corp go public through a SPAC.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s56qgylfxm261.png?width=957&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e60ca72eda76e4b79edc07b46efc8ed47ca96e92\n\nNot only, they have a long list of clients who are all willing to pay big bucks to get their hands on sensors as soon as 2022. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1epmwrwlxm261.png?width=956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2126f96feceb9796ca9fe90880f45abf687c6fcf\n\n**Ehy but w8 a sec, I can see NIO there but no TESLA, WHERE\u2019S MUSK DADDY?!?...Why Tesla Won\u2019t Use LIDAR**\n\n*Let me quote the greatest absolute madman of our century: LIDAR is a fool\u2019s errand\u2026 and anyone relying on LIDAR is doomed.*  \nLIDARS are expensive and prone to be damaged, also not very smart in recognizing object, that\u2019s why Musk has opted for the proprietary VISION software which enables TESLA cams to understand the surrounding environment instead of shooting stupid lazer beams. Surely a great approach but right now their technology has a gap to bridge as they stated in one of their last meetings. Whether they will succeed or not isn\u2019t really important for a company which aims to get on the market hopefully sooner than them. Obviously, companies such as Daimler and Volvo (which historically sold **safety** as their key selling point)  would be very happy to sell AD4 cars by 2022.  \n\n\n**Ok but why tf should I buy shares of a company founded by a 17 years old dropout?** \n\nSurely there are many companies working on similar projects such as Waymo, Cruise, Argo, and Aurora, which aim to reach level 5 of autonomous driving (fully autonomous), but Luminar hits a different market. With a more modest target of hitting level 4 of autonomous driving, Luminar focuses on long-distance vision, key for highway driving. Yet, this is also a crowded market since players like Velodyne and others exist. Well not so crowded maybe, Velodyne has lost clients in the last year, it had Ford but they partnered with Luminar...they had Weymo (Google) but they went for their own road just as Tesla. Not to mention that Velodyne sensors have a crazy price at $25K.\n\n**Since this is a DD post, I will not get into the technical details of why their technology has** ***some*** **breakthroughs, but let\u2019s break down some more numbers**\n\nWe don\u2019t have balance sheets so we will have to rely on their presentation (which is where all the images come from btw). They expect 90% of future revenue coming from their 50+ already signed partnerships, and with a 50% + margin, selling both hardware **AND** software, this could be a great company to invest in (or just go for quick tendies who am I to judge). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5bx2vlgdym261.png?width=954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16d5769f3da85b8b7bdc4074a38b04348d8c7860\n\nYou can check further technical details about their technology and implementation on their presentation but the last figures I want to concentrate on is the following: as of 2020 there is no other LIDAR long-vision competitor, also their price tag is about $1000 for the IRIS sensor, which is 25 times cheaper than its closest competitor. This could really scale up quickly if the outsourcing production process is handled correctly, which by the way will take place in Thailand and Mexico.\n\n\\- *Archimede Gang*\n\n**Resources:**  \n[**https://www.luminartech.com/announce\\_gores\\_luminar/**](https://www.luminartech.com/announce_gores_luminar/)  \n**Sec filings:**  \n[**https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758057/000119312520227516/d63113dex992.htm**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758057/000119312520227516/d63113dex992.htm)   \n**Press release:**  \n[**https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758057/000119312520227516/d63113dex991.htm**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758057/000119312520227516/d63113dex991.htm) **Reuters:**  \n[**https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/auto-startup-luminar-to-go-public-in-34-billion-deal-2274664**](https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/auto-startup-luminar-to-go-public-in-34-billion-deal-2274664)   \n**WIRED article on why all these companies can\u2019t survive in the long run, but who cares LT right?**   \n[**https://www.wired.com/story/too-many-lidar-companies-cant-all-survive/**](https://www.wired.com/story/too-many-lidar-companies-cant-all-survive/)   \n**Price:**  \n[**https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/06/volvo-to-use-luminars-lidar-in-production-vehicles-to-unlock-automated-driving-on-highways/#:\\~:text=Luminar%20has%20previously%20said%20its,limited%20purposes%20like%20driver%20assistance**](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/06/volvo-to-use-luminars-lidar-in-production-vehicles-to-unlock-automated-driving-on-highways/#:~:text=Luminar%20has%20previously%20said%20its,limited%20purposes%20like%20driver%20assistance)**.**",

        "selftext": "You may have noticed an unexpected 10% spike on BFT after hours Friday (after it ran as high as 8% higher during regular trading). This spike came from no other than our boy Steve Grasso from Fast Money on CNBC. Steve said, \u201cI like to give you stocks that could double. I think this one could triple.\u201d \n\nNow.. if I had your curiosity and now have your attention, feel free to keep reading below. \n\nBFT is a SPAC. If you\u2019ve been living in a cave and didn\u2019t have internet access to waste your life on WSB, a SPAC is a company created for the sole purpose of taking another company public. It\u2019s a newer technique that has proven to be a much quicker way to get your company a ticker. \n\nThe company that will be getting a shinny new ticker is Paysafe. Paysafe is a multinational online payment system. Founded in 1996 and headquartered in London. Their largest marketshare is in Europe and are highly dominate in the gambling industry.  \n\nPaysafe\n\nFinancials: $1.5 billion in revenue. $468 mil EBITDA profit. Net profit of $142 million. \n\nCustomers: Paysafe is attached to very big names, in lots of sectors. Just a few are: Draftkings, Twitch, YouTube, Fortnite, Henri, Spotify, Staida, NH lottery. \n\nKey facts to note:\n\n1. Process over $100 billion per year. \n2. Jacked to the tits on diversification. From a large global presence, to a huge foothold in several key sectors. This has helped them a ton during Corona when so many others have faltered, they have remained steady.  \n3. Actually profitable, which is very rare for SPACS. \n4. Its major competitors (i.e. PayPal, Square, Venmo etc.) aren\u2019t willing to move into gambling where Paysafe is dominating.  \n\nI don\u2019t want to hear any, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me 18 years ago when the stock was a penny. The price went up so it can never go up again\u201d. This baby was just confirmed last week and is just starting to make it on major news networks. You will start to see more than just CNBC talking about it as it\u2019s one of the largest SPACS of the year, and I would challenge any of them to not recommend it as a buy. If we get a huge name to give it a thumbs up we will see a corresponding huge pump during the next open. \nBig Fucking Titties. 4 rocket ship emojis \n\nPositions: $50k in shares @ an average of $13.62\n\nI also want to add u/dhsmatt2 review as I think it\u2019s the most thorough on WSB. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaabxa/700000_bet_on_fintech_bft/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",

        "selftext": "**Quadruple witching day is just ahead, what will happen in the stock market? Does Apple have room to grow again? DASH &amp; ABNB are fading after crazy IPOs. Let\u2019s talk about this and the latest stock market news**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone and Good morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Monday, as we saw a great start in the early morning with the Dow hitting an intra-day record, but the rally faded for the broader stock market and especially the industrial heavy [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/yVcZV95) which lost .61%, with the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/xGBkgyF) also losing .44% while the tech heavy [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/dWNjyCY) lived up to the recent reputation as a go-to defensive play yesterday and finished up .50%. Meanwhile the [VIX](https://ibb.co/mH5Pmsw) also spiked more than 6% and is nearing the 25 levels, which could mean significantly more volatility for the stock market.\n\nWe also saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/jwVnsXt) on normal volume of about 10.5B shares, as we finally went below 80% of the companies trading above the 50-day simple moving average, as small-cap growth companies outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/NNWkSQt) with large-cap value companies lagging, especially from the energy and industrial sectors. With energy losing more 3.5% for the day, while the only 2 gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/0ymGMHL) were Technology and Consumer Discretionary, which seems to indicate what I was expecting, that investors are dropping losers from this year for tax purposes and betting again on the companies that sparked the rally since the bottom in March. And keep in mind that funds &amp; money managers use this tactic for window dressing also, so that they can have a nice advertising brochure for next year.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/kMTNKY7) from yesterday, you can see here the big wall of red in the energy sector, with Disney which saw a healthy correction after a huge run and Pfizer being some of the biggest losers. While Netflix, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and PayPal were some of the biggest gainers alongside the biotech sector.\n\n[HERE](https://ibb.co/tPnzGmN) is the economic data that will be received today, there isn\u2019t anything big on the calendar, as we get ready for a lot of big numbers coming on Wednesday and Thursday. Just a reminder, there was no big economic data that came in yesterday.\n\nSo, Quadruple witching day is just a couple of days away, and this time it will probably bring even more heavy trading volume than usual.\n\nFor anyone that doesn\u2019t know, quadruple witching [refers](https://ibb.co/p063Sgw) to the day when stock options, stock index futures &amp; options and single stock futures expire on the same day. \n\nThis happens 4 times every single year, and usually brings increased [volume](https://ibb.co/Gxr4pnc) to the stock markets, and guess what guys, this will coincide with the last day of trading before Tesla enters the SP index.\n\nSo I believe this next week and especially the 17th-22nd will be very volatile for Tesla. \n\nAt the [moment](https://ibb.co/SRTyzcN) there is more open interest in tesla stock options, with over 8 million contracts, which multiplied by 100 shares for each contract represent 800M shares, that is more than the actual free float for the stock at the moment at 760M shares.\n\nAnd, right now, there are a lot more put options contract on Tesla, with a put to call ratio of 1.5\n\nMy personal opinion is that we can see the stock continue to rise in the following days before going for a dip or correction following this huge moment of volatility for the stock. We can see the avg [volume](https://ibb.co/qYNg2dL) for Tesla has been near 60M shares in the last 10days, so there have been a lot of shares that have already exchanged hands. I believe most of the money managers, who are not obliged to perfectly track the SP indexes, have already finished up buying the stock, so I expect there will be a lot more sellers than buyers when most retail investors expect the stock to go even higher. But don\u2019t take my advice, do your own research and analysis. Full disclosure, I am a bull long-term on Tesla, but just think there is a downside risk approaching.\n\nSo let go through a couple of stock market news, [Apple](https://ibb.co/NVQsB0b) is planning on manufacturing almost 100M new iPhone in the first half of 2021, that would be an increase of almost 30%, as they are planning make more than 230M iPhones in 2021 (including new &amp; old models). This is great news for the stock as Apple has been pretty much flat after the September pullback, and might finally get some momentum back when they announce sales for the iPhone in the next quarters.\n\nThis might also be helped by the fact that US [consumers](https://ibb.co/f2Tfhpj) are expecting to spend more next year, even if they expect to have a pretty much flat income and earnings growth. This is an improving view of the consumers as they were expecting to spend less in the last survey from October.\n\nMeanwhile, as I expected [AirBnB](https://ibb.co/xSdVJrG) and [Doordash](https://ibb.co/wLfyvFG) have started to fade after that crazy IPO frenzy. [Doordash](https://ibb.co/tmyyWnW) fell more than 8% yesterday and is down again pre-market while [AirBnB](https://ibb.co/GnRxn3b) is also down almost 10% since last week. And with downgrades from analysts already starting to appear, this companies have small to no room for error at this valuation. Especially with Doordash which has received a significant boost in the last year, growth will be more difficult in the future and won\u2019t justify this price point.\n\nWe have also seen [Snowflake](https://ibb.co/J5j6DsP) come back to earth, dropping more than 15% in the last 5 trading days, as the first share lockup period expiration is today. This will allow current and former employees to sell 25% of their stock options, currently representing 1,3M shares. With Non-employee shareholders also able to sell up to 25% of shares, those shares stand at 38M right now, with the rest of the shares being unlocked after they release their second quarterly earnings report in March, \n\nWe also got [numbers](https://ibb.co/8srNcwj) from New Jersey, as gambling keeps expanding even if sports are not back to normal. This is great news for companies like DraftKings. While others like Wynn will [benefit](https://ibb.co/zHL4Gvw) a lot from more tourism both in the US and in Macau.\n\nAnd just keep an eye on [Shopify](https://ibb.co/nMHptKW), as the company seems to be in the eye of the tiger, with Amazon looking into ways of entering that market also.\n\nSo, guys, I still think there are a lot of positive catalysts for the markets, especially with a stimulus apparently very close, the European Central Bank [agreed](https://ibb.co/xqWDmZs) last week on a new stimulus for the Eurozone, as they keep printing money. And with interest rates probably remaining incredibly low after this week FED meeting, money will remain very cheap at the moment. So yeah, with the Pfizer vaccine yesterday, Moderna probably next week, and JNJ to follow in early 2021, I think we are poised for a good 2021 in the stock market. Especially with little political volatility after the Georgia run-off in early January as the US electoral College also formally [confirmed](https://ibb.co/pvjc9nf) Biden as the next President of the US yesterday.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/vjT9ghr) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

        "selftext": "Currently allocating the majority of my portfolio to SPACs as they\u2019ve been paying up well lately! Here\u2019s a list with concise commentary (concise because I don\u2019t enter into details of DD, but comment/ask away):\n\n- DMYD - world\u2019s 2nd largest supplier of data for online gambling/betting companies. This industry is growing fast and steady\u2026it is very hot atm, but imo is being shadowed by speculative industries like EV/Autonomous driving/AI. When more people realize this industry is a sure thing, I expect healthy returns!\n\n- THCB - maker of EV batteries, there\u2019s rumors they\u2019ll be supplying Tesla, read somewhere they\u2019re preparing to build facilities right next to Tesla\u2019s future production site in Germany. To me this is a pure speculative play, if the rumors get confirmed I\u2019d expect the stock to double from current levels of 15-17$. NOTE: they have an unbinding letter of intent to merge, not yet a done deal, or else I suspect the stock would already be past 20$ based on those rumors.\n\n- ROCH - this company has exclusive rights to use a patented methodology to recycle plastics. The patent owner is P&amp;G (Procter &amp; Gamble). What really turned my head was that the company is backed by P&amp;G, L\u2019Oreal, Total, and some other mammoths\u2026while being priced fairly cheap with lots of upside potential, this is an investment worth looking at!\n\n- GHIV - large mortgage seller with huge recent growth, plus expected further growth in the near future. What triggered my attention is that the company is already committed to paying dividends even before going public (to me this is unheard of\u2026we\u2019ve all gotten used to companies that lose money\u2026and here\u2019s one that\u2019s not only profitable it\u2019s also ready to pay dividends right away!)\n\n- BFT - fintech business, like a smaller version of Stripe. Think this was a record breaking SPAC that priced the company at 9b pro forma. The whole online payments/banking is hot atm, I don\u2019t expect this business to ever compete with PayPal but if it keeps growing as it is, it\u2019ll definitely be acquired (and we all know how acquisitions pay off! Salesforce just bought Slack for 28b, it was half that a week before the offer!)\n\n- STPK - battery optimization AI. It\u2019s complex stuff I couldn\u2019t bother to fully understand, but ticks all the boxes for the current speculative market\u2026so I got a small position because we all know the current market isn\u2019t too worried with fundamentals, it\u2019s more concerned with keywords.\n\n- PSTH and IPOF - both don\u2019t have a target to merge yet, but both have lots of potential! PSTH is  a 4b SPAC lead by Bill Ackman, and the latter is the largest SPAC (1.6b) from a series of successful deals by Social Capital Hedosophia. I expect at least one of these to eventually catch a huge fish, like Sportradar, Stripe or even Bloomberg!\n\nAlso LAZR I bought as a SPAC (GMHI) for 15$. I think the CEO is going far\u2026 people like him have the potential to become the next Elon Musks, Mark Zuckerbergs or Bill Gates. It may still be early to call, but from his track record I\u2019m very optimistic. I mean he started the company at 17, dropped out of Stanford, is backed by Peter Thiel, is a billionaire at age 25, seems obsessed in his mission to develop, improve and deliver\u2026in time we will see.",

        "selftext": "**Overview**\n\nHut 8 Mining Corp., headquartered in Toronto, Canada is a cryptocurrency mining and blockchain infrastructure company focused solely on mining bitcoin. It\u2019s one of the largest publicly traded bitcoin miners in the world with over 2,900 bitcoins in its treasury reserve.\n\n**Tickers**\n\nTSX: HUT\n\nOTCQX: HUTMF\n\n**Why invest in Hut?**\n\n***Short-term***\n\nShort-term, the price of bitcoin is rising. Recently bitcoin has hit new all-time highs and it\u2019s expected to surpass 20,000$ this bull cycle.\n\n\u25cf Paypal is on the cusp of going global with its crypto initiative, which will see 26 million companies accepting cryptocurrencies as a valid form of payment. The CEO of Paypal has recently stated that he expects vendors to prefer cryptocurrencies to other forms of payment methods going forward into the future, as has been shown by the data gathered in their US trial run.\n\n\u25cf There is both public and private interest in bitcoin currently. Countries like Nigeria, Iran, and Venezuela are utilizing bitcoin instead of their normal fiat currencies.\n\n\u25cf The state of California is set to have a hearing regarding the recognition of cryptocurrencies as a legal asset in 2022.\n\n\u25cf Private corporations are also beginning to offset their cash reserves and treasuries in bitcoin. We\u2019ll likely see a small-scale adoption in the summer of 2021 with Twitter leading the charge. Companies that have already done this include Microstrategy, Grayscale and Square ([https://bitcointreasuries.org/](https://bitcointreasuries.org/) ). Realistically, the mass adoption of crypto is underway, it isn\u2019t hard to see why so many analysts predict the price of bitcoin to be 100k or higher.\n\n***Long-Term***\n\nWe expect that long-term, the yearly return on investment will greatly surpass bitcoin and many other Cryptocurrencies as both private corporations and world governments begin to integrate blockchain on a socio-economic level. We can already see this trend with the vast public sector interest in the formation of Central Bank Digital Currencies, integrated smart cities, and digital ID\u2019s. This is of-course a bullish outlook, as blockchain infrastructures require a significant amount of computational power in order to operate effectively. The infrastructure is hard to establish and costly to run. Therefore it will be in both private and public interest to offset these costs onto private contractors, like Hut8 Mining.\n\n***Recent News***\n\n\u25cf 1031PH/s Petahashes per second mining capability\n\n***Q3 2020 Report Highlights***\n\n\u25cf Quarterly revenue of $5.8 million with mining profit margin of -37%.\n\n\u25cf Renegotiated key terms with lender to provide more downward flexibility with bitcoin collateral and save Hut 8 nearly $500,000 per year in interest expense.\n\n\u25cf Hosting revenue of $0.5 million from Hut 8\u2019s first hosting client with 6MW of latest generation bitcoin mining equipment.\n\n\u25cf Transferred the management of site operations from Bitfury to Hut 8, providing savings of over $1.5 million per year.\n\n\u25cf Made a bitcoin equipment order for 275 PH/s of which 154 PH/s using 6.7MW was installed this quarter with the remainder expected to be installed by the end of 2020.\n\n\u25cf Hut 8 became the first company to enter and exit the TSX Sandbox successfully, which solidifies its place as a TSX issuer.\n\nQ3-2020 was the first full quarter after the bitcoin halving where bitcoin production was cut in half while the network hash rate continued to rise, making it one of the most difficult periods for bitcoin miners to operate. To put this into context, it became 140% more difficult to mine for a bitcoin from just before the halving in May 2020 to September 30, 2020, while the bitcoin price increased by 9% in that same period. The economics of mining bitcoin has significantly improved subsequent to Q3-2020.\n\nHut 8 also recognized $0.5 million of hosting revenue after signing up its first client with 6MW of latest generation bitcoin mining equipment. This is a new revenue stream for Hut 8 and provides consistent recurring revenue with its available electrical capacity and existing infrastructure. Hut 8 has continued to find ways to reduce costs in Q3-2020 through many successful initiatives in the quarter. In July 2020, the Company re-negotiated its credit facility terms with Genesis Global Capital, LLC (\u201cGenesis) and successfully reduced the interest rate from 9.85% to 8.00% per annum saving approximately $500,000 per year.\n\nAnother initiative during Q3-2020 was that Hut 8 transferred the Clarke chips from its Drumheller facility to Medicine Hat which brought together Hut 8\u2019s higher efficiency chips with its best electricity pricing at Medicine Hat. Also, Hut 8 completed the transfer of the management of operations of both the Medicine Hat and Drumheller facilities from Bitfury to Hut 8, providing for savings of over $1.5 million per year. With full control over the sites, Hut 8 will continue to streamline operations while maintaining the highest industry standards.\n\nHut 8\u2019s strategy of mining and holding bitcoin continued to pay off as there was a $5.6 million gain on the re-measurement of bitcoin holdings in Q3-2020. Additionally, by only strategically selling bitcoin at higher prices, Hut 8 recorded a $0.2 million gain on the use of digital assets. Overall, for Q3-2020, Hut 8 recorded a net loss of approximately $0.9 million and a negative Adjusted EBITDA of $2.9 million.\n\nMore than halfway through the quarter, Hut 8 completed the installation of 1,000 M31S and 1,000 M31S+ mining equipment at its Medicine Hat facility. The equipment collectively increased Hut 8\u2019s mining power by approximately 154 PH/s using 6.7 MW of power. The remainder of the equipment purchase, which consists of 1,590 M30S units is expected to be shipped sometime soon and will provide an additional 140 PH/s using approximately 5.3MW.\n\nHut 8 also achieved a milestone when they became the first company to successfully exit the TSX Sandbox which solidifies Hut 8 as a TSX listed issuer. Hut 8 was also the first issuer to be listed to the TSX via the TSX Sandbox and has been trading on the senior TSX exchange since early October 2019.\n\n**Predicted Price Range**\n\nCurrent Price: 1. 6 9$ CAD (December 3rd 2020 1 5:09 UTC).\n\nShort-Term (5-6 months): 4- 5$ Long-Term (2-3 years): 20 -25$\n\n**RIOT Blockchain - A comparison to competition**\n\nRIOT runs a similar mining operation however there are quite some contrasting differences. RIOT is currently heavily pumped on various subreddit's, discords, and Twitter. Currently, it is overpriced for what it is worth. Comparatively, Hut has 3x the production capacity of RIOT and 3x the bitcoin reserves ( [https://bitcointreasuries.org/](https://bitcointreasuries.org/) ) Long term it is likely that Hut will exceed the ROI of RIOT. It has done this in the past in 2017 and will do it again. As the price of bitcoin grows, so too will the price of Hut exponentially. Our argument is not that RIOT is bad, but that Hut is being overlooked.\n\n**Risks involved**\n\n\u25cf Quarterly Losses; this however is the norm within the crypto mining industry, and can be expected of any new industry. We are likely to begin to see the returns on investment as the price of bitcoin rises, and economies of scale begin to come underplay.\n\n\u25cf Low exposure; being a Canadian miner, and being predominantly traded on Canadian stock exchanges, Hut receives lower exposure than its American counterparts. This means that the stock typically moves slower, but as such is subject to lower levels of volatility.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThere are numerous reasons to be bullish on Hut. Its sheer size and capacity to mine bitcoin, certainly gives it a competitive advantage. Its bitcoin reserves make it a safe bet as the price of bitcoin is expected to rise on a macro time scale. There are a number of socio-economic phenomena driving up the price of bitcoin, however, as discussed Hut will likely transcend that as private and public blockchain based contracts become more readily available. Compared to its largest direct competitor, Hut outclasses Riot in terms of sheer numbers but lacks the same level of exposure as RIOT. Its quarterly losses are concerning but are expected within a newly forming industry; and it is important to note that its fellow competitors face the same constraints. The low exposure is something that should be fixed as it begins to be discussed more commonly within public discourse, specifically stock forums, subreddit's and discords, as well as on Twitter. There is a lot of potentials here for growth. This is a long term bet, buy and hold for the next 2-3 years.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nA strong long-term play, likely to pay out in the realm of 10-20x if held for a period of 2-3 years.\n\n(See below for Q3 2020 Report)  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/om5mrtjx86461.png?width=910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad6af023d5d28ebb8b350d306bb80b7b4731f928",

So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Monday, as we saw a great start in the early morning with the Dow hitting an intra-day record, but the rally faded for the broader stock market and especially the industrial heavy [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/yVcZV95) which lost .61%, with the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/xGBkgyF) also losing .44% while the tech heavy [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/dWNjyCY) lived up to the recent reputation as a go-to defensive play yesterday and finished up .50%. Meanwhile the [VIX](https://ibb.co/mH5Pmsw) also spiked more than 6% and is nearing the 25 levels, which could mean significantly more volatility for the stock market.\n\nWe also saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/jwVnsXt) on normal volume of about 10.5B shares, as we finally went below 80% of the companies trading above the 50-day simple moving average, as small-cap growth companies outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/NNWkSQt) with large-cap value companies lagging, especially from the energy and industrial sectors. With energy losing more 3.5% for the day, while the only 2 gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/0ymGMHL) were Technology and Consumer Discretionary, which seems to indicate what I was expecting, that investors are dropping losers from this year for tax purposes and betting again on the companies that sparked the rally since the bottom in March. And keep in mind that funds &amp; money managers use this tactic for window dressing also, so that they can have a nice advertising brochure for next year.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/kMTNKY7) from yesterday, you can see here the big wall of red in the energy sector, with Disney which saw a healthy correction after a huge run and Pfizer being some of the biggest losers. While Netflix, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and PayPal were some of the biggest gainers alongside the biotech sector.\n\n[HERE](https://ibb.co/tPnzGmN) is the economic data that will be received today, there isn\u2019t anything big on the calendar, as we get ready for a lot of big numbers coming on Wednesday and Thursday. Just a reminder, there was no big economic data that came in yesterday.\n\nSo, Quadruple witching day is just a couple of days away, and this time it will probably bring even more heavy trading volume than usual.\n\nFor anyone that doesn\u2019t know, quadruple witching [refers](https://ibb.co/p063Sgw) to the day when stock options, stock index futures &amp; options and single stock futures expire on the same day. \n\nThis happens 4 times every single year, and usually brings increased [volume](https://ibb.co/Gxr4pnc) to the stock markets, and guess what guys, this will coincide with the last day of trading before Tesla enters the SP index.\n\nSo I believe this next week and especially the 17th-22nd will be very volatile for Tesla. \n\nAt the [moment](https://ibb.co/SRTyzcN) there is more open interest in tesla stock options, with over 8 million contracts, which multiplied by 100 shares for each contract represent 800M shares, that is more than the actual free float for the stock at the moment at 760M shares.\n\nAnd, right now, there are a lot more put options contract on Tesla, with a put to call ratio of 1.5\n\nMy personal opinion is that we can see the stock continue to rise in the following days before going for a dip or correction following this huge moment of volatility for the stock. We can see the avg [volume](https://ibb.co/qYNg2dL) for Tesla has been near 60M shares in the last 10days, so there have been a lot of shares that have already exchanged hands. I believe most of the money managers, who are not obliged to perfectly track the SP indexes, have already finished up buying the stock, so I expect there will be a lot more sellers than buyers when most retail investors expect the stock to go even higher. But don\u2019t take my advice, do your own research and analysis. Full disclosure, I am a bull long-term on Tesla, but just think there is a downside risk approaching.\n\nSo let go through a couple of stock market news, [Apple](https://ibb.co/NVQsB0b) is planning on manufacturing almost 100M new iPhone in the first half of 2021, that would be an increase of almost 30%, as they are planning make more than 230M iPhones in 2021 (including new &amp; old models). This is great news for the stock as Apple has been pretty much flat after the September pullback, and might finally get some momentum back when they announce sales for the iPhone in the next quarters.\n\nThis might also be helped by the fact that US [consumers](https://ibb.co/f2Tfhpj) are expecting to spend more next year, even if they expect to have a pretty much flat income and earnings growth. This is an improving view of the consumers as they were expecting to spend less in the last survey from October.\n\nMeanwhile, as I expected [AirBnB](https://ibb.co/xSdVJrG) and [Doordash](https://ibb.co/wLfyvFG) have started to fade after that crazy IPO frenzy. [Doordash](https://ibb.co/tmyyWnW) fell more than 8% yesterday and is down again pre-market while [AirBnB](https://ibb.co/GnRxn3b) is also down almost 10% since last week. And with downgrades from analysts already starting to appear, this companies have small to no room for error at this valuation. Especially with Doordash which has received a significant boost in the last year, growth will be more difficult in the future and won\u2019t justify this price point.\n\nWe have also seen [Snowflake](https://ibb.co/J5j6DsP) come back to earth, dropping more than 15% in the last 5 trading days, as the first share lockup period expiration is today. This will allow current and former employees to sell 25% of their stock options, currently representing 1,3M shares. With Non-employee shareholders also able to sell up to 25% of shares, those shares stand at 38M right now, with the rest of the shares being unlocked after they release their second quarterly earnings report in March, \n\nWe also got [numbers](https://ibb.co/8srNcwj) from New Jersey, as gambling keeps expanding even if sports are not back to normal. This is great news for companies like DraftKings. While others like Wynn will [benefit](https://ibb.co/zHL4Gvw) a lot from more tourism both in the US and in Macau.\n\nAnd just keep an eye on [Shopify](https://ibb.co/nMHptKW), as the company seems to be in the eye of the tiger, with Amazon looking into ways of entering that market also.\n\nSo, guys, I still think there are a lot of positive catalysts for the markets, especially with a stimulus apparently very close, the European Central Bank [agreed](https://ibb.co/xqWDmZs) last week on a new stimulus for the Eurozone, as they keep printing money. And with interest rates probably remaining incredibly low after this week FED meeting, money will remain very cheap at the moment. So yeah, with the Pfizer vaccine yesterday, Moderna probably next week, and JNJ to follow in early 2021, I think we are poised for a good 2021 in the stock market. Especially with little political volatility after the Georgia run-off in early January as the US electoral College also formally [confirmed](https://ibb.co/pvjc9nf) Biden as the next President of the US yesterday.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/vjT9ghr) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "Hey guys, I am, pretty new at SPACs and after reading this sub for a month or so, I have noticed a whole lot of strategies, from going for a single SPAC,, waiting for it to boom, then move to the next one, to owning multiples and just taking them down one by one like cans with a Magnum.\n\nMy real question is this: do you guys also own regular portfolio stocks (PYPL, MSFT, TSLA, INTL, AMZN...), or you guys just trade SPACs as a main way of hustling?\n\nI am not going to reveal my target (as this is not a pump post), but I am thinking of selling $1500 worth of MSFT stocks that I have owned for the last 2 months (exactly at $0 profit and $0 loss) and go for a $10.20 SPAC that I have interest in (after doing some DD). \n\nThinking that a NAV price cannot really be any major risk, do you think this would be a good idea, or should I hold my major stocks and not try to lose/win in SPACs?\n\nThanks for your answers guys, and thanks for this subreddit, I wasn't aware there was such a large community hanging out and talking trash about each others investments with such flair \ud83d\ude01 cheers!",

        "selftext": "In more recent valuation estimates for private companies that could go public, as of about a year ago, Stripe was valued at $36 billion, Palantir at $20 billion, AirBnB at $18 billion, Snowflake at $12 billion.  Fast forward to today, Snowflake is $110 billion, Palantir $45 billion, to go along with PayPal moving from $100 billion to $250 billion and Square from $25 billion to almost $100 billion.  I haven\u2019t heard present day estimates from people that legitimately know what they\u2019re talking about, noting that that group of people is few and far between. But my best guess is about $100 billion. Given how clearly Stripe has made it known, they\u2019re not interested in going public, and don\u2019t need cash, I can\u2019t see them coming to market at a lower valuation just because.  If a guy like Ackman could bring like $10 billion to the table for 10%, I wonder if that\u2019s a definite no?  No other SPAC would have a shot.  The valuation ot would trade at, I\u2019d guess is somewhere between PayPal and Square, like $150-200 billion in today\u2019s market.  Thoughts?",

        "selftext": "Key points:\n\n \n\n* **Luminar CEO and co-founder Austin Russell is poised to become a billionaire at 25 when his autonomous driving technology company Luminar goes public on Thursday.**\n* **The lidar sensing technology company works with major automakers as well as Intel\u2019s Mobileye.**\n* **Elon Musk says lidar is not needed for self-driving, but Luminar has a $1 billion-plus book of business and relationships with major automakers.**\n\n \n\n[Tesl](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TSLA)a isn\u2019t the only upstart auto industry player having a big year.\n\nLuminar, which creates lidar technology critical to many automakers\u2019 autonomous driving efforts, is going public on Thursday through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) and the deal will make Luminar co-founder and CEO Austin Russell a billionaire \u2014 at the age of 25.\n\nRussell, who founded the company as a 17-year-old high school student, said the feeling of becoming a billionaire (on paper, at least) is \u201cabsolutely incredible\u201d and \u201ctotally surreal.\u201d\n\nBut the Luminar CEO said it also follows the plan his company has had in mind since founding. \u201cIt is totally surreal and it totally makes sense and it is hard to explain the dichotomy of it, but this has always been the goal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe set up the company to be a long-term sustainable business and power the future of autonomy for all of these automakers. We are in it for the long-term,\u201d Russell told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d on Thursday morning.\n\n Russell was a bit of a science prodigy.\n\n\u201cI guess, I did memorize the periodic table \u2014 I think I was around 2 or so,\u201d [Russell told\u00a0CNBC Make It](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/09/thiel-fellow-austin-russell-founded-self-driving-car-tech-co-luminar.html) in a 2018 interview. \u201cI was just obsessed with learning certain things ... just independently learning and understanding a lot of new types of scientific fields, among other things.\u201d\n\nThat evolved into work on lasers and ultimately, lidar, which uses lasers to detect and measure distance and ultimately create a 3D map of the real world environment that can be used in self-driving.\n\nHe ended up at Stanford University studying physics, but dropped out and received a Thiel Fellowship, created by tech icon and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel to provide tech talent with alternatives to traditional education programs.\n\nRussell said the company has a forward looking book of auto business at $1.3 billion and estimates its overall market opportunity within the multi-trillion auto market at \u201chalf a trillion\u201d as lidar and autonomous vehicles come into focus for the auto industry.\n\nLuminar works with automakers including Volvo, which is owned by Chinese auto company Geely.\n\nWhile Russell said it can be hard for the market to value new technologies that lack existing market comps, he noted Luminar is working with [Intel](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=INTC)\u2019s Mobileye, which also focused on [the future of autonomous sensing systems](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/09/intels-self-driving-leader-on-the-race-against-tesla-uber-and-lyft.html). \u201cIt\u2019s cool to see back in 2017 they were acquired at a 43x revenue multiple of the business.\u201d\n\nLuminar, which made the 2018 [CNBC Disruptor 50](https://www.cnbc.com/cnbc-disruptors/) list, began trading under the ticker symbol [LAZR on the Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/lazr) on Thursday, after its deal with SPAC [Gores Metropoulos](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=LAZR) was completed.\n\n## Elon Musk\u2019s doubts about lidar\n\nThe Luminar CEO is not worried about lidar technology his firm has built become commoditized IP, saying the rise of this breakthrough technology is closer to what chip maker Nvidia does than a tech hardware company. \u201cWe have one of the most insane moats of any company at this stage,\u201d Russell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve built out and pioneered core components ... building from the ground up. We have not used commodity parts. We have the largest patent portfolio in sensing systems, more than the top five other lidar R&amp;D efforts combined.\u201d\n\nCompeting lidar technologies include firms such as [Velodyne](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=VLDRW) and [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GOOGL)\u2019s Waymo.\n\nThere is one notable doubter.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has said that [lidar is not needed for autonomous driving](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/23/autonomous-vehicle-pioneer-doubles-down-on-technology-trashed-by-musk.html) to work. \u201cFreaking stupid,\u201d were Musk\u2019s words. The world\u2019s newest billionaire, Russell, disagrees.\n\n\u201cI think 50 commercial partners and a majority of the major automakers we are working with would disagree. Cameras and other systems are great for assisted driving, but with autonomy, that\u2019s where need really high-performance lidar,\u201d he said, adding that Luminar is the only company able to provide this technology at production and for use at highway speeds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/03/luminar-ipo-mints-a-25-year-old-autonomous-driving-billionaire.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/03/luminar-ipo-mints-a-25-year-old-autonomous-driving-billionaire.html)",

        "selftext": "I'm not on mobile so I can't add rocket emojis but you can just use your imagination and put 1000 of them right here because this move is the fcking go. I use a program that a ton of analysts use, and it just updated the fair value of FOUR to $96.18. Analysts will be updating SOON, like this week after they load up, and the price will follow. That's not even the DD though. Here it is  \n\n\nFOUR is the leader in integrated payment processing solutions. The new fair value estimate came as an average of 2 models, both using DCF growth multiples. \n\n\\*\\*FOUR is currently trading at $70\\*\\*\n\nFOUR marketcap is just 3% of SQ, yet they do 10% of revenue and have a similar YoY Growth. P/B for FOUR is 18.3x meanwhile SQ is sitting at fucking 51.5x. Either of these show FOUR has huge upside, but to use the smaller number of rev/mc discrepancy, \\*\\*FOUR should be trading at $233\\*\\*\n\nIn another comp comparison, FOUR is just 1.1% of PYPL Marketcap, while doing 3.7% of PYPL revenue. PayPal is so big that FOUR actually has way more expansion and growth available, but ignoring that the revenue/marketcap discrepancy implies \\*\\*FOUR should be trading at $230\\*\\*\n\nIn a final comparison, FOUR is less than half of LSPD marketcap(Lightspeed POS), but this one is really fucking wild because FOUR does 5X MORE FUCKING REVENUE. This one is probably a tad out of reach and moreso implies that LPSD is overvalued and needs to come down a ways but since we know FOUR is undervalued and we don't know if LPSD is overvalued, we'll just pretend LPSD is properly valued and by the metric, \\*\\*FOUR SHOULD BE TRADING AT FUCKING $710\\*\\*\n\nBut comparisons aren't everything, CVNA and KMX are an example that investors will pick the more well known/currently hyped name, so the next thing you need to know is \\*\\*The CEO is a fucking badass\\*\\* Jeff Isaacman is his name. Forbes has done a few articles about him, the high school drop out that started a payment processing company in his parents basement, sold some equity, bought his old employer and created Draken, the world's largest private airforce, at age 28, whiel still running his POS company, sold Draken to Blackstone for 9 figures, used that to buy out several other payment processors, and is now a billionaire at age 37. Dudes a fucking genius, and because of his strategic buyouts, FOUR now does over \\*\\*$200 BILLION ANNUALLY\\*\\* in payments for over 1/3 of the country's hotels and restaurants including KFC, ARBYS, FOUR SEASONS, HILTON, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne reason FOUR hasn't caught on big is because it hasn't turned a profit as the new entity, but that will all change after this quarter according to the consensus of 7 American IT analysts who agree there will be a final total loss in 2020 before turning a profit of $27m in 2021 and \\*\\*growing at an average rate of 145%\\*\\* For the record though, Isaacman's original payment company was turning profit for over a decade. But with all the acquisitions they took on some debt and liabilities from the acquired companies.   \n\n\nJeff also still has a 38% stake in the company, meaning he's gonna continue to fucking kill it and we will make tendies in the process. Back to my original point, \\*\\*I have seen several occasions where my program comes out with models which raise the Fair Value Estimate, and within a week Analysts have raised theirs to nearly identical numbers\\*\\* This obviously isn't true for all analysts, but I've seen it a bunch. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Positions/Tldr\\*\\* - I'm in for 1000 shares and have calls at all different expirys up to $110 through 2021. If you're more risky, you can go as far OTM as possible in the next year and you have a real shot of cashing out huge. It's extremely undervalued and when the price targets come out, it is going to go up with a green dick the likes of which have never been seen before",

        "selftext": "Paypal was an early COVID investing pick due to its nature of contactless payments and its rise in young populations with Venmo. Paypal has a storied history, founded by some of the most influential Silicon Valley VC\u2019s and entrepreneurs they started as two smaller companies founded in the middle of the tech bubble (1998 and 1999) as Confinity and X.com by Peter Thiel and Elon Musk. They were able to weather the storm of the 2000 tech fallout by being bought out by eBay for $1.5B beforehand. Under eBay, Paypal grew their services into what most of us know them for: digitized payments. Starting from effortless check transfers for unauthorized vendors to working their way to B(!)tcoin, Paypal has made it more convenient for payments to be processed, and in our consumerist economy that\u2019s an absolute goldmine. Square is a relatively new player in the digital transaction space but they\u2019ve had quite a run up this year under the leadership of Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter. Their first product was a card reader that fit into the headphone jack of smartphones, so naturally Square expanded into the enterprise services market and continued developing solutions for small businesses like payroll management. I\u2019ll further discuss the respective structures of both companies in this due diligence\n\n**The Expansion of Digital Transactions**\n\nPaper currency has been the standard means of exchange for ages, but the digital method of exchange, particularly mobile exchanges has now become far more convenient. In 2017, digital payments were expected to reach a market value of [$726B](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/09/digital-payments-expected-to-hit-726-billion-by-2020-study-finds.html) in 2020, and here we are post covid with the value of digital payments at over 910B.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mr9elex5z0561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18e6eb1b9039d738af6c2ea5277018d2749cbbfd\n\nStatista forecasts that most of the sales growth for digitized payments past 2020 will come from mobile POS, and that most of the user growth for digitized payments will also be in peer-to-peer transactions. Paypal has both bases covered with Venmo when it comes to mobile transactions and it has E-Commerce covered with its major retailer partnerships and with eBay. Square has Cash app, which is a peer-to-peer payments app plus they also have in-person small business products for digital payments like their \u201ccash register\u201d called the Square Stand which is useful for freelancing professionals and small businesses.\n\nSo a pro of Square is that it has a far more established presence in the growing sector of digital payments which is mobile POS payments, not E-Commerce. However, E-Commerce is the much larger sector by users alone:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x99o8v39z0561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c12fa73d91b1948acec47fe715cdefe8b4bfb3bb\n\n### As you can see, mobile POS payments are expected to triple in the same time that E-commerce will grow by around\u00a020%.\n\nThis makes a lot of sense to me as E-Commerce still makes up a small amount of all transactions and its trajectory is very much fixed and established now. POS payments are definitely growing though, as on my last trip to India, one of the fastest growing countries, I observed that every small business had a PayTM barcode for transactions, and this is where both Paypal and especially Square will eventually expand to. CNBC also forecasts most digital payment growth will happen in emerging markets (which is why I\u2019ll suggest an ETF at the end which incorporates emerging market companies) \u201cEmerging markets are expected to grow at a rate three times that of developed economies in terms of digital transaction volumes. Digital payments in developing markets grew 21.6 percent between 2014 and 2015, compared to a 6.8 percent rise in mature markets. Non-cash payments in Asian emerging markets are projected to grow by almost a third (30.9 percent), led by powerhouses China and India\u201d. According to CNBC analysts though, cash will still remain supreme for the following reasons: speed of exchange, universal acceptance, anonymity, absence of record and free of charge. Anonymity and absence of record are things that are being fixed by the incorporation of cr(!)ptocurrency into transactions, but it\u2019s likely the biggest reason people don\u2019t switch to cashless is because not all merchants use it and the fees add up especially for many transactions a day for the *merchants*. Eventually when the digital transaction economy grows fully, there will be enough competitors to offer sellers competitive rates to a point where they\u2019ll choose mobile payments for the convenience it provides in terms of not having to use physical cash but as of now only small businesses are willing to make the opportunity cost of losing fees so they don\u2019t have to store cash.\n\n***Paypal***\n\nPaypal is \u201ca global, two-sided network at scale that connects merchants and consumers with 305 million active accounts (consisting of 281 million consumer active accounts and 24 million merchant active accounts) across more than 200 markets. PayPal helps merchants and consumers connect, transact, and complete payments, whether they are online, on a mobile device, in an app, or in person\u201d. They have a variety of new products in development as they have made several acquisitions since their establishment. Paypal offers merchants a technology-agnostic platform that requires no hardware and little time to set up with its Braintree product which is primarily for online sellers and iZettle which is used for POS payments primarily in international markets and they have a user base of 19 million. This acquisition was made with the full intention of competing with Square and since Paypal has had an extremely talented eye for acquisitions in the past in Xoom and Venmo, this [relatively new acquisition](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/06/07/why-did-paypal-pay-such-a-high-price-for-izettle/?sh=60f035216860) has a lot of potential, but it could also just be a last minute scramble to catch up to Square\u2019s huge market share in POS payment offerings. Paypal has a great P2P ecosystem in Venmo and Xoom and a credit partnership with Synchrony bank as well which helps diversify revenue streams. Paypal also owns a company called GoPay, which basically provides the same services Paypal does but in China, which expands them into a market that\u2019s more likely to grow in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w3vmknzbz0561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23c083f35611ffa86a997cf3a9f75a7c29de7a9f\n\nAs you can see, Paypal has some pretty consistent revenue, profit, and EBITDA growth, but a bit more concerning may be the fact that margins have been relatively stable and they haven\u2019t been increasing at all. I believe the reason for this is because PayPal\u2019s full potential isn\u2019t close to being realized, and even founder Peter Thiel said in his book \u201cZero to One\u201d that Paypal wouldn\u2019t start realizing a majority of their cash flows until 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/78wifzfdz0561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bce649ad199031a1c5ddbfbdb663324b7ae3454\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u00a0While Paypal was able to increase earnings per share by a strong 21% from 2018 to 2019, they decreased cash flows from operating activities by 17% from 2018. This requires that we go into the capital expenditures in their CF statement, which will provide a clearer idea of why and how Paypal lost cash flow despite rising net income. Another thing standing out may be the fact that the operating margin is pretty constant, which can be a concerning sign for investors seeking a growth stock. Plus, considering how much the price for PYPL has run up in the past few months you\u2019d expect better profitability to come with it hand-in-hand. But the future being factored into Paypal isn\u2019t based on its face value, or else the price would be very stagnant right now and it wouldn\u2019t have grown nearly as much as it has.\n\nHere\u2019s what I mean:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/47r8msvez0561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cefbcab0e52e1a1ca9e42b946f569f4a1595785\n\nThe amount of profit Paypal can squeeze out of its main product is pretty much at a maximum as transaction expenses are growing at the same rate as revenues are and operating expenses are still going up at a somewhat proportional rate to that of net income, meaning that no more value is going to come out of the existing product. While the existing product is still going to grow in popularity, its profitability is only going to decrease or stagnate as Paypal expands into developing markets that aren\u2019t willing to cough up as much in fees. As Thiel himself puts it, that\u2019s \u201chorizontal innovation\u201d AKA just globalism. That alone isn\u2019t enough to justify the investment levels in Paypal, but investments and acquisitions into the future of transactions will expand it, and on top of this it is only recently Paypal has experienced such tremendous growth in cash flows YoY.\n\nNow you\u2019ll see below PYPL\u2019s historic cash flows, and if you go to the bottom you\u2019ll see their free cash flow decreased from 2018 to 2019 as I previously mentioned. The root cause of this is investment purchases, which increased by $5B in 2019 and contributed to the Free Cash Flow decreasing by 800M. Again, if we look at Paypal\u2019s track record when it comes to acquisitions they\u2019ve been very successful, so there\u2019s not much reason to expect much different this time around. If Paypal\u2019s investing, investors are excited. They\u2019ve piled up cash up until last year, and they\u2019re finally using it now based off their cash per share:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rq6x4g8kz0561.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=976d294dbc9ceb68d288570648b9a894fde8c1ac\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jh21m90lz0561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b77b71f08785127aea6cad5afa30e6ff37f78f11\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z2kkuyilz0561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dc69e6a4ecd333adf5c3e9fa851a266473fe4ec\n\nAdd to this the tremendous increase in digital payment volume in the past year and we can expect a real change in the entire sector\u2019s trajectory. Hedge funds have been piling up on this supposed legacy company for a valid reason: their time for expansion is ***now, and COVID-19 has only spurred in realizing this perfect storm, as net income and revenue has seen a jump in the past two quarters:***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v4cgyl1nz0561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=272965de645fa1a9aac0ff763863cc28e7942035\n\nSo you must be wondering why Paypal\u2019s cash from operations was down in 2019 from 2018, but in their most recent 10k Paypal explained cash from operations and free cash flow was only down due to \u201cpositive impact of $1.4 billion of changes in loans and interest receivable, held for sale, net following the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio\u201d which was added into the operating income as it was a noncash expense and that\u2019s why 2019 looks down about $1B in cash even though operating income for 2019 was up $0.4B:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7i979ldoz0561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=798113837df594aa112574facc98df32685c8c79\n\nPaypal\u2019s newly acquired capital is already being used and it\u2019ll be put to good use based on the meteoric rise in transactions in the past two years. Contactless payments will eventually become a norm and their established e-commerce platform will set them up pretty well on this end.\n\nNow to address the flip side of the coin: POS or Point of Sale transactions, which is a market Square has wrapped around its finger as it\u2019s had the head start since the iPhone 4. Here\u2019s how Square got started, instead of giving 10$ to people for using their product, founder and CEO Jack Dorsey (who also is the founder and CEO of Twitter) gave them the product for free and built an infrastructure around it. It was simply a credit card scanner that could be inserted into the headphone jack of a smartphone. This simple product is still being sent out for free to small businesses and the software and business model that surrounded this tiny card reader has expanded like a wildfire since then. Square would collect 2.75% on each payment similar to Paypal.\n\nSquare also made a \u201ccash management\u201d app, Cash App to dive into a non-retail market.\n\nAbout Cash App: \u201cCash App provides an ecosystem of financial products and services to help individuals manage their money. While Cash App started with the single ability to send and receive money, it now provides an ecosystem of financial services that allows individuals to store, send, receive, spend, and invest their money.\u201d\n\nIt appears as if Square is trying to become an all-round player in the consumer and producer financial ecosystem as Cash App has become more like a bank or brokerage account rather than just a P2P service like Paypal or Zelle. Now, Cash App makes 25% of SQ\u2019s revenues.\n\nIn Square\u2019s 2019 annual report, they reported the following:\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2019, we processed $106.2 billion of Gross Payment Volume (GPV), which was generated by nearly 2.3 billion card payments from 407 million payment cards. At the end of 2019, our Square point of sale ecosystem had over 180 million buyer profiles and approximately 230 million items were listed on Square by sellers.\n\nAs of December 2019, Cash App had approximately 24 million monthly active customers who had at least one cash inflow or outflow during a given month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The above image shows Square\u2019s payment volume distribution across different industries, and as you can see in 2019 payment volume was very diverse which bodes well for SQ\u2019s stability.](https://preview.redd.it/rjjzniarz0561.png?width=371&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efe83afdb1c1d8adc38f4c37325fde9c1b125f93)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This shows the increasing size of sellers who use Square, and this shows that Square\u2019s mission of making small businesses big and having them stick to their product regardless of their stage in growth is working.](https://preview.redd.it/cj0vx6gsz0561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7f72e7dad5f7cbe846c489a90be6fa8d81067dd)\n\nAlthough their main business is in processing payments, Square is making itself a fin-tech institutional force with 30 different API\u2019s for retail and e-commerce sellers along with invoicing, appointment, payroll, loyalty/gift card, and account management services. Square also has financing for small businesses in Square Capital, which I find to be the most interesting part of their model. They give small loans to businesses based on the data that they ***already have as Square manages the business\u2019 finances, remember? And this puts them at an advantage to make good debt because of the transparency into the business\u2019 finances. This will allow Square to make extremely profitable and high turnover loans that have virtually NO risk of default***. The types of loans they give are generally small, and they could be as little as $500. They describe these loans as the type you\u2019d ask for from your parents or relatives. Square has such in-depth data from these businesses that when they make loans they don\u2019t even *consider* credit scores: \u201cGenerally, for loans to Square sellers, loan repayment occurs automatically through a fixed percentage of every card transaction a seller takes. Loans are sized to be less than 20% of a seller\u2019s expected annual GPV (their payment volume) and, by simply running their business, sellers repay their loan in eight to nine months on average\u201d\n\nSince 2014, Square has made over $6B in loans with a failure rate of only 4%, which makes sense because Square has access to all of its client\u2019s financials so therefore they possess the ability to make fully transparent loans.\n\nWhen you jump into Square\u2019s financials, there\u2019s a lot of promise to say the least:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a4zkobuvz0561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35c1273cb128c0d627add76e54bb36a9b34941a1\n\nNot only has revenue grown by 42% from 2018 to 2019, net income finally became positive in 2019 and free cash flow increased from 232m to 400m in the same span.\n\nHere\u2019s the revenue breakdown for Square, and as you can observe while transaction revenue saw much stronger compared to Paypal, the real deal was Square\u2019s expansion of its enterprise solutions as those revenues increased by 74% last year, these are revenues recognized as the following: \u201cRevenue from Cash App, Square Capital, and Instant Transfers for sellers currently comprise the majority of our subscription and services-based revenue. Cash App subscription and services-based revenue is primarily comprised of transaction fees from Cash App Instant Deposit and Cash Card. Our other subscription and services-based products include website hosting and domain name registration services, Gift Cards, Square Appointments, Customer Engagement, Employee Management, Payroll, Square Card, and other product offerings.\u201d\n\nB(!)tcoin revenues from Cash App investing whose revenues increased by 210% (in this case B(!)tcoin is an asset that Square owns and sells to those using Cash App to invest in cr(!)ptocurrency.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6krvne7101561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87bb78977eaa222762e5f24f5061651850ad74e5\n\nAlso in that same span, Square\u2019s cash has nearly doubled. This liquidity will be necessary as Square Capital continues to grow and will require financing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0b3gxlr201561.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=068b3f2d994b04f67fd2ad5c6de629851dd658ae\n\nObserving some long term trends now for $SQ:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Lower SG&amp;A expenses per $ of revenue](https://preview.redd.it/gz1ncgq301561.png?width=398&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52195d2a61cfd59582c11349b010a4203c5ca5b9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Low receivables\\/sales despite expansion of Square capital because revenue has grown so fast](https://preview.redd.it/xa3wpk1501561.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d87e93f2f5a146b7506dbb47cad697b7366adbf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Increasing return on equity \\(higher net profit margins and leverage\\)](https://preview.redd.it/mwzv067601561.png?width=390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d91926c27c23d593e8b951cacc99e32d98babdbc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Consistently increasing free cash flow points to stability \\(especially since 2019 turned positive\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xzbtkm8701561.png?width=418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8044e4e5413607ece7c32c4a9e093522ffa9469)\n\nWhile Square is far riskier than Paypal, they seem to be capturing a much larger market and have a bigger vision for the future at this point. Paypal becomes more like Microsoft and Square is kind of like Apple if we went back 10 years. One of them has widespread use and an established platform but still has consistent growth (about 15%) and the other is finding itself in a competitive market but is also slowly establishing absolute dominance. Square is absolutely overvalued, but for a growth stock that\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary, and so is Paypal considering they don\u2019t have nearly as much a prospect for growth unless leadership shows a huge change in direction some time soon. The \u201cPaypal Mafia\u201d however has surprised us before and I think there\u2019s a solid chance of growth still plausible for them. Regardless, both of these companies should be a holding in your portfolio amidst a growing FinTech sector and a huge transition away from traditional payments.\n\nTickers: $ARKF $PYPL $SQ\n\nARKF 1/15/21 55c",

        "selftext": "  \n\nHi all,\n\nWe're excited about AbCellera's IPO and noticed nobody is really paying attention or interested. We've put together an analysis on their IPO below, with diagrams available at our blog post below. Appreciate any feedback and discussion!\n\n**Pre-IPO: Everything you need to know about AbCellera**\n\n* AbCellera is expected to IPO on Nasdaq on **December 10, 2020**; shares are expected to price between $14 to $17 a share, raising as much as $391 million.\n* AbCellera is a Vancouver-based AI-powered drug discovery platform with backing from Peter Thiel, known for its leading platform and COVID-19 treatment in partnership with Eli Lilly\n* Its most successful antibody (LY-Cov555)/bamlanivimab has recently been granted emergency approval by Health Canada and the FDA - expected to receive &gt;$100mn in royalties\n* Its unique, proprietary business model and experienced management &amp; board positions AbCellera for long-term success \n* We see AbCellera as a play on LY-Cov555 success and the near-term delivery of other antibody candidates, with the downside of potential headline risk \n\nThe Vancouver-based AI drug discovery platform that has caught the eye of investors including Peter Thiel for its leading platform and the development of its COVID-19 treatment with Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), AbCellera Biologics Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cAbCellera\u201d) is set to IPO (NASDAQ: ABCL) with Credit Suisse as lead left underwriter ([prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1703057/000119312520299507/d29983ds1.htm) filed November 20, 2020). \n\n***Here\u2019s all you need to know about AbCellera and its proposed IPO.***\n\n# Outline\n\n1. Business Model\n2. Recent Developments / Company Timeline\n3. Management Team &amp; Board Overview\n4. Competitive Landscape\n5. IPO Details\n6. Financial Analysis\n7. Valuation\n8. The Bottom Line \n\n# AbCellera Business Model\n\nAbCellera provides drug developers with a platform to find antibody candidates for drug research. Its AI-powered full-stack platform searches and analyzes real-world immune system databases to find leads that are subsequently used for clinical R&amp;D. Unlike its competitors, AbCellera operates along the entire value chain from sourcing to the delivery of antibody candidates; this solves the existing problem of either inadequate/outdated discovery approaches or using multiple fragmented solutions (costly and inefficient). \n\nIt is important to note what AbCellera is not - a drug developer. Instead, Abcellera lends their technology to pharmaceutical companies, both large and small, in hopes of speeding up discovery times for antibody therapies. This in turn leads to cost savings for the drug developer, quicker times to clinical trials, and faster delivery of medical solutions. They define themselves as the \u201cOperating System for Antibody Discovery\u201d.  \n\nIt follows then that revenues are project driven - the more programs authorized by drug developers, the more fees Abcellera earns. Abcellera sees long term value in the business to be driven off downstream and royalty payments that are more stable and are a consequence of successful discovery programs. We explore this notion later in the article. To summarize, revenues streams are as follows: \n\n1. Licensing / Research Fees (68% of revenue, 9 months ended September 30, 2020): payments for technology access and performing research\n2. Milestone Payments (32% of revenue): downstream payments for clinical/commercial milestones\n   1. *We note that only one program to date, LY-CoV555 (Eli Lilly), has resulted in milestone payments*\n3. Royalties: royalties on net sales of any approved therapeutics\n   1. *As of September 30, 2020, AbCellera has yet to receive any royalties*\n   2. *Royalties generally will range from low-single digit for non-COVID targets to mid-teens to mid-twenties for COVID targets*\n\nAs of September 30, 2020, AbCellera had 94 discovery programs either completed, in-progress, or under contract, with a few public key partnerships below. Some of AbCellera\u2019s recent, public partnerships are as follows:\n\n*Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY)* \\- On March 12, 2020, AbCellera and Lilly announced to co-develop antibody therapies for the treatment of COVID-19, the potential treatment LY-CoV555 accelerated due to Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program. As part of the agreement, AbCellera received an upfront payment of $25mn and is entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $29mn of milestone payments. As of September 30, 2020, AbCellera has received $8mn related to LY-CoV555 and is eligible to receive royalties on aggregate sales (including Lilly\u2019s $375mn and $312.5mn contracts with the US government and US Army Contracting Command respectively).\n\n*Invetx* \\- On February 23, 2020, AbCellera originally entered a multi-year, multi-target partnership agreement with Invetx. Based on the successful delivery of research programs under the original agreement, the scope of the collaboration has been expanded to include multiple new targets over several years on November 19, 2020.\n\n*Kodiak Sciences (NASDAQ: KOD)*  \\- After a successful collaboration in 2016, AbCellera and Kodiak Sciences announced a new partnership on October 29. 2020 to generate therapeutic antibody candidates in ophthalmology.\n\n*IGM Biosciences (NASDAQ: IGMS)* \\- AbCellera and IGM Biosciences announced on September 24, 2020, that they have entered into a multi-year, multi-target strategic research collaboration and license agreement to facilitate the discovery and development of novel IgM antibodies. \n\n\ud83d\udcf7*AbCellera\u2019s solutions to existing challenges.*\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n*The diagrams above illustrate AbCellera\u2019s partnerships over time; the Company continues to expand partnerships in line with its growth strategy.*\n\nAbCellera\u2019s business strategy (per prospectus) is focused on (i) using the drug discovery platform to unlock new opportunities for therapeutic antibody development; and (ii) allowing partners to access the platform to reduce delays and costs associated with setting up drug discovery capabilities. The firm continues to develop their strategy, building a stronger platform with the idea of higher downstreams royalties negotiated. \ud83d\udcf7\n\n*AbCellera\u2019s strategy creates a positive feedback loop through which each round of research program improves the speed and efficiency of the next round of data generation*\n\n# Recent Developments / Company Timeline\n\n1. In March 2020, AbCellera entered into a discovery partnership with Eli Lilly and Company, to perform discovery research for a number of targets for Lilly that will result in antibodies for Lilly to develop and potentially commercialize. \n2. In April 2020, AbCellera entered into a multi-year agreement with the Canadian government\u2019s Strategic Innovation Fund, and CAD $175.6mn ($125.6mn) was committed by the Government of Canada, of which &gt;$110mn remains and is intended to be used to build a GMP facility.\n3. In June 2020, LY-Cov555 moved to first in-inhuman testing and progressed to Phase 3 clinical trials. \n4. In November 2020, LY-CoV555 was granted emergency-use authorization by the FDA and Health Canada. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, AbCellera received an aggregate of $8.0mn upon the satisfaction of clinical milestones by Lilly. \n5. In November 2020, AbCellera acquired Trianni for $90.0mn. Trianni develops transgenic mice that provide a source of fully-human antibodies for therapeutic antibody candidates. Trianni mouse technology will allow AbCellera to generate more high-quality antibodies against difficult targets and improve the speed of the discovery programs, which in turn should create higher leverage when negotiating downstream royalties. In addition to strategic value, Trianni also generates revenues through mouse sales, platform licensing fees and associated downstream milestone payments.\n\n**Defining Bamlanivimab**\n\nWhile any treatment for COVID-19 is big news for the world community, we\u2019d like to emphasize what LY-CoV555/Bamlanivimab  is not - a vaccine, a cure, or even a recovery aid for COVID-19.\n\nRather, clinical trials showed a 72% reduction in hospitalization rates within patients that have already been diagnosed with COVID-19. We make an analogy and compare the effect of bamlanivimab to blood clotting - it stops from excessive bleeding (hospitalization) when a wound or blood vessel is burst (diagnosis of COVID-19). For already hospitalized patients, studies have shown little to effect in helping patients recover from the advanced stages of COVID-19. Other clinical trials evaluating Bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms and for recovery purposes remain active.\n\nThis carries some short and long term implications. Abcellera will likely benefit both in the short and long term if the treatment becomes widely used in hospitals. They may also receive more milestones and royalty payments from governments and drug developers. However, the growth story will deteriorate as vaccines, which are already in federal approval stages, become available. Vaccines, herd immunity and measures to avoid the spread of COVID-19 will reduce growth opportunities for Bamlanivimab to be a continued factor in Abcellera\u2019s growth. Finally, any royalties from the sale of Bamlanivimab remains unknown as no further disclosures have been made to date. \n\nNonetheless, the drug received US FDA approval, with Eli Lilly inking an agreement to supply the U.S government to provide 300,000 vials to high risk patients.for a sum of $375,000,000, or \\~$1,250 a vial. Health Canada has also approved the use of the treatment, \n\nCuriously, Abcellera proposed $200Mn comes shortly after a slew of positive news for the firm. This could come as a redflag to some, with the view that the firm is slapping as much lipstick as possible on the pig to sell it. However, we remain optimistic with the view that all the recent developments are timely given the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare the firm for future growth.    \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n*Company Timeline: AbCellera has demonstrated consistent growth and has generated positive operating cash flow cumulatively since its inception in 2012.* \n\n# Management Team &amp; BOD Overview\n\nAbCellera\u2019s management team is highly experienced with significant experience in related industries. AbCellera has also continued to bolster its board of directors with high-profile names including Peter Thiel (Palantir, Paypal, Facebook) and John Montalbano (CPPIB) ahead of its IPO. \n\nWith its recent additions, we view AbCellera\u2019s management team and board as a strength.\n\n***Executive Officers***   ***Positions***\n\nCarl L. G. Hansen, Ph.D.  Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nAndrew Booth    Chief Financial Officer\n\nV\u00e9ronique Lecault, Ph.D.  Chief Operating Officer and Director\n\nTryn Stimart    Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary\n\n***Non-Employee Directors***\n\nMichael Hayden, Ph.D.  Director\n\nJohn S. Montalbano   Director\n\nPeter Thiel    Director\n\n***Director Nominee***\n\nJohn Edward Hamer, Ph.D.  Director Nominee (nominated to join in December 2020)\n\nShareholders are detailed below:\n\n*\ud83d\udcf7*\n\n# Competitive Environment\n\nAbCellera\u2019s current market position as a full-stack service provider provides meaningful barriers to entry, with its primary competitors providing services at some point along its value chain. The integrated nature of AbCellera\u2019s services (provides integrated services from start to end), in addition to the nature of its AI-platform (interconnection and scale enable AI to continuously become more efficient) is a competitive advantage.\n\nThat being said, the life sciences and biotech platform technology market is highly competitive; technical competitors at different stages of AbCellera\u2019s platform in the following fields are detailed below:\n\nSingle-cell screening: Berkeley Lights Inc. *(NASDAQ: BLI)*, HiFiBio Inc., Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. *(NASDAQ: LGND)*, and Sphere Fluidics Ltd.\n\nAntibody RepSeq: 10X Genomics Inc. *(NASDAQ: TXG)*, Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp. *(NASDAQ: ADPT)*, *Atreca Inc (NASDAQ: BCEL)*. and Distributed Bio Inc.\n\nBispecific antibody engineering: Abbvie Inc. *(NYSE:ABBV)*, Genmab A/S, Merus N.V. and Zymeworks Inc. *(NYSE:ZYME)*\n\nDiscovery using genetically engineered rodents: Ablexis LLC, Crescendo Biologics Ltd., Harbour Antibodies BV, Kymab Ltd., Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc *(NASDAQ: LGND)*. and RenBio Inc.\n\nIn addition, AbCellera competes with a variety of fee-for-service contract research organizations, in most cases using legacy technologies that would compete with one or more steps in AbCellera\u2019s technology stack. Organizations may also elect to develop their workflows on legacy systems rather than rely on AbCellera\u2019s platform.\n\n# IPO Details\n\nThe IPO will be jointly underwritten by Credit Suisse (left lead), Stifel, Berenberg, SVB (healthcare specialist) and BMO Capital Markets. \n\nOn Monday December 7 2020, AbCellera said it is offering 23 million shares in the IPO, which is expected to price between $14 to $17 a share. The company could raise as much as $391 million. The pro forma adjusted common shares count after the IPO is \\~265.95mn shares. This puts AbCellera at a market capitalization of \\~$4.1bn based on $15.5 IPO price.\n\n# Financial Analysis\n\nIn this part of our analysis, we will take a deeper dive into the valuation, pro forma financials, capital structure, and go-forward expectations for the business. The below provides a brief overview of the financials. We view the company to be financially healthy, given the low capitalization and limited contractual obligations, supported by continued licensing/research revenue and royalties from LY-CoV555 and other contracts.\n\n**Revenue** has grown at a 109% CAGR since 2014, primarily driven by increased research fees (driven by the number and quality of programs under contract) and milestone fees (AbCellera received its first milestone fee in 2020 from Lilly of $8mn). September 2020 YTD revenue was \\~$25mn (\\~$30mn pro forma for Trianni acquisition).\n\n**Key Revenue Drivers** in the near term will include milestone payments on existing contracts and royalty payments from Lilly for LY-CoV555. The company is eligible for royalties in low- to mid-teens for aggregate sales below $125mn and mid-teens to mid-twenties on aggregate sales above $125mn. Assuming a 20% royalty on existing US contracts (\\~$690mn), this would drive an incremental $137mn of revenue (excluding an additional $21mn available through milestone payments).\n\nWe noted that Abcellera will likely move towards a recurring revenue model as the business develops more partnerships and use of their technology is more prevalent (and successful) in the industry. Details of future milestone payments and royalty payments are set out through partnership agreements with the drug developers. While we have no insight into the specifics of these arrangements, we expect more transparency going forward as Abcellera sees continued success in their programs. \n\n**Liquidity** will be bolstered by the equity raise, with the use of proceeds used to continue making investments in R&amp;D, building its business development team and other general corporate purposes. AbCellera has more than $8mn of total future contractual obligations and commitments (as of September 30, 2020), which can be financed through cash on hand or other debt (AbCellera has demonstrated access to bank and private placement debt).\n\n***Capital Structure*** will look significantly different post-IPO; the pro forma adjusted \\~265.95mn common shares, includes 23mn IPO shares issue, \\~81.2mn convertible preferred shares, and \\~7.63mn shares from convertible notes based on $15.5 IPO price. The company also has \n\n* \\~13mn common shares reserved for issuance under their current plan, as of September 30, 2020, which shares will cease to be available for issuance at the time their 2020 Plan becomes effective.\n* \\~21mn common shares to be reserved for future issuance under the 2020 Plan\n* 27mn common shares to be reserved for future issuance under our 2020 Employee Share Purchase Plan\n\n**Valuation**\n\n**Comparable Companies**\n\n*Information gathered as of November 26, 2020.*\n\nRelay Therapeutics *(Nasdaq: RLAY)* \\- Relay Therapeutics is a clinical-stage medicines company transforming the drug discovery process with the goal of bringing therapies to patients. Relay\u2019s Dynamo platform integrates an array of experimental and computational approaches to provide a differentiated understanding of protein structure and motion to drug these targets. The company currently has three candidates with one in Phase 1 trial. The company planned to sell 20mn shares in the IPO. The company\u2019s shares began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market on July 16, 2020. The first trading day closed at \\~$35 per share, which is 75% above the $20 IPO price. The company currently has a market cap of \\~$4.9bn.\n\nPandion Therapeutics *(Nasdaq: PAND)* \\- Pandion Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutics designed to address the unmet needs of patients suffering from autoimmune diseases. The company has combined a network-based conceptualization of the immune system in advanced protein engineering to develop drug design and discovery platform. The company currently has four candidates with one in Phase 1 trial. The company planned to sell 7.5mn shares priced at $18 a share. The company\u2019s shares began trading on the Nasdaq on July 17, 2020. The first trading day closed at \\~$18 per share, which agrees with the IPO price. The company currently has a market cap of \\~$534.0mn.\n\nPliant Therapeutics *(Nasdaq: PLRX)* \\- Pliant Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel therapies for the treatment of fibrosis. The company currently has two lead product candidates that are in Phase-2 trial. Pliant also has a second product candidate, partnered with Novartis, undergoing Phase-1 trial. In addition to clinical-stage programs, Pliant currently has two preclinical programs targeting oncology and muscular dystrophies. The company announced the pricing of its initial public offering of 9mn shares at $16 per share. The shares begin trading on the Nasdaq on June 2, 2020. The first trading day closed at \\~$21 per share, which is \\~31% above the $16 IPO price. The company currently has a market cap of \\~$1.0bn.\n\nForma Therapeutics *(Nasdaq: FMTX)* \\- Forma Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company that has an approach integrating its drug discovery technologies and oncology expertise, enabling screening, discovery and rational development of a generation of small molecule drug candidates. Forma is building a pipeline of therapeutics in human cancers, such as key targets associated with cancer stem cells, tumour cell metabolism, programmed cell death of epigenetic disease mechanisms. Forma leverages its innovative drug discovery platform to address challenging targets and develop an internal pipeline of drugs. The company currently has five candidates, with two in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials respectively. The company also has two out-licensed program candidates in Phase 1. Forma announced the pricing of its initial public offering of \\~16mn shares, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase up to \\~2mn additional common shares at $20 per share. The shares began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market on June 19, 2020. The first trading day closed at \\~$39 per share, which is 95% above the $20 IPO price. As of November 26, 2020, The company currently has a market cap of \\~$1.7bn.\n\nAlthough the goal of the above companies is to discover and develop potential drugs or therapies to satisfy different requirements of the patients, the business model and strategy are very much similar to what AbCellera is aiming to achieve with its IPO. Some of the notable goals are listed below:\n\n* Advance its lead product candidate as well as other potential candidates.\n* Leverage its proprietary discovery platform by expanding its library and harnessing the insights and data generated from each research program.\n* Build a pipeline of additional drugs in their own fields of expertise.\n* Explore and evaluate additional partnerships or collaborations to maximize commercial opportunities. \n* Become a market leader in its own field of research.\n\n# The Bottom Line\n\nOur Investment Thesis: we think that AbCellera is well-positioned to grow as a leader in an attractive, lucrative, and fragmented industry, supported by a strong management team and board. As the Company continues to find success, AbCellera will transition from its position today as a company heavily dependent on near-term binary outcomes (reliance on a few partnerships with milestone payments for revenue) to a more stable (royalty cash flows) company with significant upside for growth.\n\n## The Positives:\n\n* World-class management &amp; shareholder support\n   * *Experienced executive team with deep experience (STEMCELL, Precision NanoSystems)*\n   * *Strong and supportive long-term minority shareholders and experience board*\n* Leading industry platform with barriers to entry\n   * *Full-stack solution is a unique value proposition vs. its competitors.*\n   * *Data generated through discovery partnerships provide the basis for training AI modules that yield new insights into antibody responses; with each research program, the platform becomes more effective and efficient*\n   * *Benefits from natural antibody optimization vs \u201cgenetically made\u201d antibodies from legacy systems*\n* Scalable business with a large addressable market\n   * *AI platform and partnership strategy enables organic growth with minimal funding requirements*\n   * *In 2019, antibody-based therapeutics accounted for over $140 billion in sales worldwide and represented five of the top 10 selling therapeutics.*\n* The business model enables diversified revenue long-term stream\n   * *Three pronged revenue stream: research, milestone payments, royalties.*\n   * *Revenue to stabilize as therapeutics are approved and come to market (e.g. LY-CoV555)*\n* COVID upside\n   * *Bamlanivimab (Eli Lilly collaboration, LY-CoV555) approved for treatment by Health Canada and the FDA*\n   * *Royalties and future milestone payments to drive near-term revenue growth*\n\nThe Risks:\n\n* **Headline Risk:** milestone payments and earnings are dependent on unknown, binary outcomes (excluding royalties).\n   * Timing and quantum of LY-Cov555 royalties are unknown, delays or other negative developments would limit near-term upside\n   * Lack of transparency - disclosure of partnerships is at the mercy of AbCellera\u2019s customers, with little to no control over public disclosure from partners.\n* **Customer Risk:** AbCellera\u2019s revenue stream relies on its partnerships as if it cannot maintain and expand current partnerships or failure to address the needs of customers could impact the market acceptance of the platform. \n   * As of September 30, 2020, AbCellera had 94 discovery programs that were either completed, in progress or under contract, including 71 with the potential for milestone and royalty payments.\n* **Lack of traction:** Abcellera relies on their technology and partners\u2019 ability to advance a product into clinical development and medical use. Since the launch of their partnership program in 2015, Abcellera has only 1 program lead to clinical milestone payments. If investors are to put a premium on their valuation, Abcellera will need to show rapid adoption of their technology within the industry and successful delivery of therapies to the population. \n   * We expect larger, high profile antibody discoveries (through the use of Abcellera\u2019s technology) to receive higher coverage and perhaps prompt drug makers to disclose Abcellera\u2019s involvement.  \n\nhttps://seeking alpha.com/instablog/52796529-breakwater-research/5525083-pre-ipo-everything-you-need-to-know-abcellera-part-i",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, December 16, 2020**\n\nStocks traded mixed today, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq finishing the day positive while the Dow Jones finished in the red. Market participants continue to closely monitor developments in Washington surrounding stimulus and an announcement by the Federal Open Market Committee. The Nasdaq and the Russel-2000 recorded new highs today.\n\nThis afternoon, the Federal Open Market Committee committed to continuing its asset purchase program at the current rate \u201cuntil substantial further progress has been made toward the committee\u2019s maximum employment and stability goals.\u201d During the pandemic, the Federal Reserve has bought $80 billion in Treasurys and $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities per month in order to inject buoyancy and liquidity into the pandemic-stricken market. The asset purchasing program, along with cutting interest rates to near zero, have been the Fed\u2019s main tools in ensuring the smooth functioning of financial markets during the pandemic.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy convened on Tuesday to discuss both the COVID-19 relief package and broader government spending bill, to which the virus relief aid is expected to be attached. Recently bipartisan group of lawmakers released the details of their $908 billion proposal. The proposal under discussion composed of two different bills. One will include $748 billion for the vaccine rollout, aid for small businesses, and enhanced unemployment benefits. The $160 billion proposal includes aid for state and local governments and liability protections for businesses. The reason for the split is to separate contentious provisions. The larger $748 billion includes provisions both parties agree on, while the smaller bill is more polarizing. In a note to clients, Goldman Sachs wrote, \u201cThe odds of a fiscal deal before the year\u2019s end are improving. While we had expected a smaller package to pass now with a larger package waiting until early 2021, it appears increasingly likely that most of this could pass this week. Either way, this is likely to be the last substantial COVID-relief package unless Democrats win both Senate seats in the January 5 runoff elections in Georgia\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Facebook (FB) has accused Apple (AAPL) of anti-competitive behavior over planned privacy changes in Apple\u2019s upcoming IOS 14.

        "selftext": "So I was browsing LULU looking at new joggers (ok fine, I was checking out the guys/girls modeling their shit) and it says $128 OR 4 payments of $32 with Afterpay which made me realize I have seen a lot of \"offers\" like that and wanted to see if it is a money making opportunity.\n\n**TL;DR: Buy Affirm when its IPO goes live. Former PayPal execs are starting microlending and \"buy now, pay later\" companies which could become the modern credit card. Affirm is a large one is going to IPO with a potential $100M offering. The Affirm/Shopify partnership could be like Ebay/Paypal back from the internet stone age**\n\nFor the purpose of this DD, we will be looking at Sezzle and Afterpay which are currently publicly traded and Affirm which has recently registered for an IPO (more on that later). All of these companies bill themselves as Fintech companies offering alternative payment platforms and a micro financial lender. Merchants have an incentive to sign up with one of these guys because the payment platform assumes the risk while the business gets advertised on their service. These companies make money by charging merchant fees and interest on missed payments.\n\nStarting with Sezzle cause that is the least interesting, its listed on the upside down market in Australia trading around $5 but is HQ'd in Minnesota and has [estimated revenue](https://growjo.com/company/Sezzle) of \\~30M.  Sezzle reported in February that they had achieved 1M users and now with the pandemic are estimated to be around 1.8M. 6 months ago they brought in [former PayPal executive](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paul-paradis-promoted-to-company-president-and-veronica-katz-from-paypal-to-take-chief-revenue-officer-role-301090602.html) Veronica Katz as Chief Revenue Officer. Sezzle [advertises](https://sezzle.com/merchants) its business product as \"Engaging the next generation\" and the ability to \"unlock millions of users and increase sales with zero risk\".\n\nNext is AfterPay, an actual Australia based company. They [reported](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/afterpay-announces-full-year-results-301119541.html) their year ending June 30 and revenue topped **$11B with 10M Users and 55.4K merchants.** There are tons of highlights in that report which are worth the scroll. Afterpay has a huge number of customers/products to choose from including the aforementioned LULU and other major retails stores youve heard of. They also have tons of Becky products on there including Shein, Ulta Beauty, Soma, and other places your girl shops at. \n\nThis company, unsurprisingly, is teeming with former PayPal folks. [VP Xin Ge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xin-ge-b6b258?trk=org-employees_profile-result-card_result-card_full-click) 7 years at paypal, [Dana Stalder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dcstalder/?trk=org-employees_profile-result-card_result-card_full-click) VP back in 04-08 who is now a VC and on the Afterpay board, [Amanda Pires](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandapires1/) 9 years at Paypal now a VP at afterpay. the company is also littered with former Visa and citigroup folks\n\nAt this point for those still reading you understand what this game is all about, Affirm does the same thing as the other two. We're going to talk about Affirm and its upcoming IPO. Affirm's CEO/founder is [Max Levchin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxlevchin/) who YOU GUESSED IT was an original cofounder of Paypal and was the CTO. Affirm shares unprofitable status like so many other silicon valley companies (PLTR, UBER, etc) but totaled 174M in Q1 2020 revenue. The biggest draw here for Affirm is it's [partnership](https://www.affirm.com/press/releases/affirm-to-power-shopify-shop-pay-installments) with Shopify to use its installment payment platform and gain access to shopify's &gt;200M users. Affirm filed for an IPO to offer 100M in stock with an unannounced IPO date but will probably go in the next few months. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like there is a way to get exposure before IPO (unless you like Morgan Stanley) but the [investors](https://equityzen.com/company/affirm/) in this should tell you how big this company could be. That being said Affirm is seeking to be the credit card of the next generation who have no concept of money but will gladly take the pay for it later method. While they aren't yet profitable, this is a potential billion dollar company with potential buyouts from SQ, big banks, in the future.\n\n**Conclusion: These companies are a hybrid of payment processors, micro lenders, and advertisers that support merchants of all sizes. With the continued explosion of online shopping and the natural human desire to worry about it later, investing in Affirm at IPO could be like getting in the ground floor of PayPal. We know about the PayPal mafia but even the lesser known execs are working on some very forward leaning companies that have huge potential. Affirm is going to IPO and its rocket both short term and long term**",

        "selftext": "**Quadruple witching day is just ahead, what will happen in the stock market? Does Apple have room to grow again? DASH &amp; ABNB are fading after crazy IPOs. Let\u2019s talk about this and the latest stock market news**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone and Good morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Monday, as we saw a great start in the early morning with the Dow hitting an intra-day record, but the rally faded for the broader stock market and especially the industrial heavy [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/yVcZV95) which lost .61%, with the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/xGBkgyF) also losing .44% while the tech heavy [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/dWNjyCY) lived up to the recent reputation as a go-to defensive play yesterday and finished up .50%. Meanwhile the [VIX](https://ibb.co/mH5Pmsw) also spiked more than 6% and is nearing the 25 levels, which could mean significantly more volatility for the stock market.\n\nWe also saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/jwVnsXt) on normal volume of about 10.5B shares, as we finally went below 80% of the companies trading above the 50-day simple moving average, as small-cap growth companies outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/NNWkSQt) with large-cap value companies lagging, especially from the energy and industrial sectors. With energy losing more 3.5% for the day, while the only 2 gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/0ymGMHL) were Technology and Consumer Discretionary, which seems to indicate what I was expecting, that investors are dropping losers from this year for tax purposes and betting again on the companies that sparked the rally since the bottom in March. And keep in mind that funds &amp; money managers use this tactic for window dressing also, so that they can have a nice advertising brochure for next year.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/kMTNKY7) from yesterday, you can see here the big wall of red in the energy sector, with Disney which saw a healthy correction after a huge run and Pfizer being some of the biggest losers. While Netflix, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and PayPal were some of the biggest gainers alongside the biotech sector.\n\n[HERE](https://ibb.co/tPnzGmN) is the economic data that will be received today, there isn\u2019t anything big on the calendar, as we get ready for a lot of big numbers coming on Wednesday and Thursday. Just a reminder, there was no big economic data that came in yesterday.\n\nSo, Quadruple witching day is just a couple of days away, and this time it will probably bring even more heavy trading volume than usual.\n\nFor anyone that doesn\u2019t know, quadruple witching [refers](https://ibb.co/p063Sgw) to the day when stock options, stock index futures &amp; options and single stock futures expire on the same day. \n\nThis happens 4 times every single year, and usually brings increased [volume](https://ibb.co/Gxr4pnc) to the stock markets, and guess what guys, this will coincide with the last day of trading before Tesla enters the SP index.\n\nSo I believe this next week and especially the 17th-22nd will be very volatile for Tesla. \n\nAt the [moment](https://ibb.co/SRTyzcN) there is more open interest in tesla stock options, with over 8 million contracts, which multiplied by 100 shares for each contract represent 800M shares, that is more than the actual free float for the stock at the moment at 760M shares.\n\nAnd, right now, there are a lot more put options contract on Tesla, with a put to call ratio of 1.5\n\nMy personal opinion is that we can see the stock continue to rise in the following days before going for a dip or correction following this huge moment of volatility for the stock. We can see the avg [volume](https://ibb.co/qYNg2dL) for Tesla has been near 60M shares in the last 10days, so there have been a lot of shares that have already exchanged hands. I believe most of the money managers, who are not obliged to perfectly track the SP indexes, have already finished up buying the stock, so I expect there will be a lot more sellers than buyers when most retail investors expect the stock to go even higher. But don\u2019t take my advice, do your own research and analysis. Full disclosure, I am a bull long-term on Tesla, but just think there is a downside risk approaching.\n\nSo let go through a couple of stock market news, [Apple](https://ibb.co/NVQsB0b) is planning on manufacturing almost 100M new iPhone in the first half of 2021, that would be an increase of almost 30%, as they are planning make more than 230M iPhones in 2021 (including new &amp; old models). This is great news for the stock as Apple has been pretty much flat after the September pullback, and might finally get some momentum back when they announce sales for the iPhone in the next quarters.\n\nThis might also be helped by the fact that US [consumers](https://ibb.co/f2Tfhpj) are expecting to spend more next year, even if they expect to have a pretty much flat income and earnings growth. This is an improving view of the consumers as they were expecting to spend less in the last survey from October.\n\nMeanwhile, as I expected [AirBnB](https://ibb.co/xSdVJrG) and [Doordash](https://ibb.co/wLfyvFG) have started to fade after that crazy IPO frenzy. [Doordash](https://ibb.co/tmyyWnW) fell more than 8% yesterday and is down again pre-market while [AirBnB](https://ibb.co/GnRxn3b) is also down almost 10% since last week. And with downgrades from analysts already starting to appear, this companies have small to no room for error at this valuation. Especially with Doordash which has received a significant boost in the last year, growth will be more difficult in the future and won\u2019t justify this price point.\n\nWe have also seen [Snowflake](https://ibb.co/J5j6DsP) come back to earth, dropping more than 15% in the last 5 trading days, as the first share lockup period expiration is today. This will allow current and former employees to sell 25% of their stock options, currently representing 1,3M shares. With Non-employee shareholders also able to sell up to 25% of shares, those shares stand at 38M right now, with the rest of the shares being unlocked after they release their second quarterly earnings report in March, \n\nWe also got [numbers](https://ibb.co/8srNcwj) from New Jersey, as gambling keeps expanding even if sports are not back to normal. This is great news for companies like DraftKings. While others like Wynn will [benefit](https://ibb.co/zHL4Gvw) a lot from more tourism both in the US and in Macau.\n\nAnd just keep an eye on [Shopify](https://ibb.co/nMHptKW), as the company seems to be in the eye of the tiger, with Amazon looking into ways of entering that market also.\n\nSo, guys, I still think there are a lot of positive catalysts for the markets, especially with a stimulus apparently very close, the European Central Bank [agreed](https://ibb.co/xqWDmZs) last week on a new stimulus for the Eurozone, as they keep printing money. And with interest rates probably remaining incredibly low after this week FED meeting, money will remain very cheap at the moment. So yeah, with the Pfizer vaccine yesterday, Moderna probably next week, and JNJ to follow in early 2021, I think we are poised for a good 2021 in the stock market. Especially with little political volatility after the Georgia run-off in early January as the US electoral College also formally [confirmed](https://ibb.co/pvjc9nf) Biden as the next President of the US yesterday.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/vjT9ghr) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

        "selftext": "My 8 investing guidelines.\n\nI've been investing, trading, gambling for about 5 years now and I've done pretty much every rookie mistake there is. Sold winners from 2016 (Shop,Nvidia,AMD,Paypal) Lost fortunes on chasing that pennystock. Played and lost with trying to time the market, option trading. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been very active during these years reading and learning and you be surprised how often people get sucked in to the same stuff you self did once. \n\nThese are 8 guidelines that really helps me and that I've learn to appreciate over the years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1.Don't FOMO**\n\nYes we all heard it. You know that feeling when people are posting crazy gains on these new stocks, we all saw the EV hype. It's so so easy to get sucked in to thinking, if I just put in some money right now I can get 10-20-50% gains in a few days! It's already up 200% this month, surely it will keep going!? \n\nThis takes some real patience to keep your head cool and realize it could very well be overbought and the downside risk is just a lot higher than potential. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've seen several sector hypes. We all remember the crypto bubble, the weed bubble and now lately the EV bubble. They all come and go and the more of these you been in from the start the easier it is to realize what's going on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. Cut your losers and let your winners run**\n\nBuying the dip is great when the market is down but if the fundamentals of the business is bad then usually this will just result in greater loss. On the flipside, if you have a few great picks and nothing fundamentally has changed and it keeps moving in the right direction then don't be afarid to keep adding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. When the overall market is down, you buy**\n\nNo one can predict the market, don't waste time on it. When the overall market is down your stock is literally on sale. Usually every sector is down when the market is down, your stock and business has not changed one bit however, it's just a lower price now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. Don't be afraid of corrections.**\n\nYeah it sucks seeing your portfolio down 20-30-40% but realize that stocks always go up, they seriously always do. Just keep your head down, keep buying and play that long game.\n\n**5. Small amounts can turn into big profits down the line**\n\nWhen you get really into investing you seriously start rethinking your life. That new OLED 77 inch? Only 2k right? What do you think that 2000 could be in 10 years? You just want to put every damn penny you got in the stock market because compounding interests are just too good to pass up. So just rethink if really need that new thing now or if it could wait.\n\n**6. If the company keeps growing, why sell?**\n\nTaking profit is good however not always the best thing to do. If the stock you have keeps growing and keeps crushing earnings. Why should you sell? Why just not keep it for years, it sure can be tempting but are you sure that money could be spent better elsewhere when it's easily growing in your winning stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**7, Never regret that you didn't buy more**\n\n We all been here. Why the hell didn't I buy more of Amazon? Why didn't I just put my whole paycheck in this stock!? \n\nYou can never do this. It won't lead to anything, you can't fix it and you honestly did the best decisions at the time with the information you had. Realize that at the time this was the best decision, ofcourse hindsight it looks like you could have done a better decision.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**8. Don't sell and buy in again to time a correction**\n\nThis is very hard and with the momentum some growth stocks have these days you might just end up loosing more of that profit even if there is a slight correction. Just keep the money in and stop worrying.",

        "selftext": "FEAC is a SPAC being used to send the company Skillz Inc public. A SPAC, In short, is a company that forms for the sole purpose of bringing another company public. The company backing this SPAC is no other than the same which backed Draftkings (Flying Eagle). Flying Eagle\u2019s CEO is Harry Sloan. He has been in the business a long time. He was a founding investor and board member of a company you might have heard of - Bethesda Games. So either he has a great eye for this or he is super lucky - Time will tell. \n\nSkillz is an online mobile multiplayer competition platform that helps developers monetize their games. You likely haven\u2019t heard of most of the games Skillz\u2019s represents, but your grandma probably has. They are: Solitaire Cube, Blackout Bingo, Pool Payday, 21 Blitz and more. All of these are listed on the Apple and Android App Store. All highly rated and with thousands of reviews. The thing that makes them unique vs. other games is that you can 100% legally gamble in them. They accept PayPal and most major credit cards. All withdrawals of winnings can go straight to your bank account. How they managed to get this pass both major App Stores and the US gov I can\u2019t seem to figure out. \n\nNoteworthy Facts:\n1. Forbes named it on its list of the next \u201cBillion dollar start ups\u201d. CNBC named Skillz the \u201cglobal leader in eSports\u201d. \n2. Skillz players averages 65 min per day. To put in perspective, Netflix only averages 50 min per day, per user. \n3. They expect user growth to get into the \u201chundreds of millions within the next two years\u201d. \n4. 10 different SPACS tried to bag Skillz IPO, but they decided to pick Flying Eagle because of Harry Slone\u2019s success. \n5. Financials: Third Quarter Revenue of $60 Million (Up 92% Year-over-Year), Revenue for Year to Date of $162 Million, (Up 91% Over Prior Year). Full Year Revenue expected at $225 Million. \n6. Working towards being incorporated into Peleton bikes. \n\nSkillz checks the box on financials. The rest is up to interpretation. The important take aways for me here is that it\u2019s backed by a guy with a great eye for gaming and a company that has somehow added gambling to these games. I also am seeing little talk about it on stock forms (only 2 posts on WSB in the last 3 months) and the general media for a company that is getting high marks from some major hitters like Forbes and CNBC. It\u2019s been on a steady rise since it officially announced its IPO on Monday, so don\u2019t expect a 100% return, but it\u2019s in no way done. 2 rocket ship emojis \n\nPositions: $50k stock. \nSelling 50% at $20, 25% at $22 and holding 25% long term.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, December 22, 2020**\n\nStocks were mixed Tuesday as market participants weighed new concerns around the coronavirus against the approval of a long-awaited stimulus package in the United States. The Dow (DIA) fell 0.7%, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell a modest 0.15%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.5% today and reported a record closing high.\n\nDuring the weekend, the United Kingdom announced the discovery of a new strain of the coronavirus that is reportedly 70% more transmissible than the original strain. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific advisor to the UK government, said that over 60% of the new infections recorded in London were caused by the new variant. In response, more than 48 -including European allies- have imposed travel bans on the UK, with the duration of the ban lasting anywhere from a couple of days to months. \n\nHowever, with much yet to be discovered about the new coronavirus strain, the markets rallied after Washington finally passed a new $900 billion coronavirus package. The bill includes another round of direct checks to Americans, this time for only $600, enhanced federal unemployment benefits of $300 per week, and additional funds for small businesses and vaccine distribution efforts. The bill passed because some of the more contentious points of earlier stimulus negotiations \u2013 such as additional money for state and local governments and liability protections for businesses \u2013 were omitted from this deal. The [text of the 5,593-page bill ](https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-116HR133SA-RCP-116-68.pdf)was released yesterday. Ian Shepherdson from Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note to clients, \u201cThe biggest single component of the new COVID relief bill is the re-funding of the Paycheck Protection Program, with a total of $284 billion. It worked -  and will work again - by offering loans to small businesses based on the size of their payrolls. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The US Justice Department sued Walmart (WMT) over its alleged role in the opioid crisis. The Justice Department alleges the company unlawfully dispensed the controlled substances through its pharmacies in America. Walmart operates more than 5,000 pharmacies in its stores around the country and noted it always empowered its pharmacists to refuse to fill problematic opioids prescriptions and said they refused to fill hundreds of thousands of such prescriptions.\n* JPM Securities raised its price target on Tesla (TSLA) to $788, the highest target by an analyst.\n* It was announced the NIO Day, an annual event where the company announces new vehicle launches and features, is scheduled for Jan. 9. Shares of NIO have been red-hot this year.\n* According to Reuters, people familiar with the matter have said Apple (AAPL) is moving forward with self-driving technology and are aiming 2024 to produce a passenger vehicle. The effort dubbed \u201cProject Titan\u201d has proceeded unevenly since 2014 but it seems with the recent EV hype Apple will be stepping up its efforts.\n* According to a new report, The global video gaming industry is expected to be worth roughly $159 billion in 2020. This surpasses the box office film / the movie industry revenue by an easy 4 times, AND almost 3 times the music industry has built up thus far. ( The music industry reached a $57 billion market in value). Keep an eye out for videogame stocks in the future.\n* Activision-Blizzard (ATVI) target raised by Morgan Stanley (MS) from $100 to $108 at Overweight. Stock currently around $88.\n* TakeTwo Interactive (TTWO) target raised by Morgan Stanley (MS) from $200 to $215 Overweight. Stock currently around $200.\n* Cleveland-Clifs (CLF) target raised by Keycorp from $14 to $17. Stock currently around $13.50.\n* ArcelorMittal (MT) target raised by Keycorp from $23 to $28. Stock currently around $23 after recent monster run.\n* Nike (NKE) target raised by Argus from $140 to $165. Stock currently around $144.\n* Peleton with multiple target raises today after ripping more than 11% up after-hours. Consensus price target around $175 with BUY rating.\n* Paypal (PYPL) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $234 to $275 at Buy. Stock currently around $237.\n* uniQure (QURE) target raised by Royal Bank of Canada from $53 to $61 at Outperform. Stock currently around $39.\n* Square (SQ) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $214 to $255 buy. Stock currently around $233.\n* Twilio (TWLO) target raised by Northland Securities from $340 to $390 Outperform. Stock currently around $365.\n\n\u201cLife is what happens when you\u2019re busy making other plans.\u201d - John Lennon",

        "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI am new here, just recently discovered reddit and didn't even think there would be such a big community around stocks, especially spacs. I am actually a low budget investor (I own 6 stocks of MSFT, 3 stocks of PYPL, $17k worth of RKT and INTL) that just recently at age 30 started investing a small portion of my savings into the stock market.\n\nI've been investing with my older brother, we search for stocks separately, do our DD and double-check everything the other one is saying and proposing. Part of the double-checking has stopped me from investing in PLTR@10,50 and SOLO@2,60, instead went for more secure, big companies to hold for 5+ years.\n\nToday, after 2-3 weeks of DD on PSTH, VGAC and DMYD, we went for a riskier investment, DMYD  460@11.50.\n\nMy real question (some general advice would also be helpful, I've seen how you guys love giving friendly advice) is, with the merger already arranged, do you think the DMYD price would start moving (up or down) at the time of the ticker change, before that, or long after (perhaps at quarterly earnings call)?\n\nBeing positive about online gambling boom in the US (Americans love sport, love statistics, love the risk), I am thinking about DMYD for a long run, so basically, the merger might not even be a big event for this kind of stock?\n\nTLDR, I need some assurement that we made the right call going into close-to-NAV-priced DMYD, plus some general thoughts about this and other stocks. Thank you for your time and may gods love be with you! \ud83d\ude0a",

        "selftext": "Airbnb, sounds like a unicorn company for vacation rental online marketplace, has its own problem with this special business. The biggest issue I think, is that the most service they provide is Consumer to Consumer, which means Airbnb is hard to control both sides' behavior.\n\nThe last time I used Airbnb was in 2018 and it was terrible. After that, I decided to book rooms in any other places but not on this website anymore. PS: I've only used Airbnb 4 times and I have to say none of them was perfect.\n\nBack to my worst experience, there were several things the landlord did:\n\n1. On Airbnb, the landlord required $300 for deposit and asked me to pay her through Paypal.\n\n2. I could not move in the day I want and had to check in one day later. And I paid $100 for the hotel.\n\n3. The room I reserved was taken by another renter.\n\n4. Someone broke into the house during I lived in and I called the police. The house cannot provide safety and it was a nightmare. I had to move out with my friends for several days.\n\n5. No wifi for the last month I lived in. I told her so many times and she never responded. I had to pay $60 for myself.\n\n6. She was always suspicious that I brought others to stay overnight which I did not. Of course, she had no evidence but she always wanted to charge me extra money for that. \n\n7. The landlord never actually lived in the house. She asked help with her house, like roof leaking, bulb changing, sending mails to Florida, etc. And she did not pay me for the shipment.\n\n8. She requested me to write a good review for her.\n\n9. She wanted to make the personal contract, not through Airbnb.\n\n10. Low down the rent and changed the policies after I moved in. She did not tell me and keep charging me the high price until I found out. The changing policies also included, like no more deposit, free cancellation, etc.\n\n11. She is very quick to reply with questions initially... until there were issues. Did not answer texts, phone calls and the voice mailbox was full.\n\n12. Of course, I never get my deposit back.\n\nUntil now, I still didn't get a certain response from Airbnb. \n\nAlso, besides the problems from landlords, I know Airbnb also cannot prevent the wrong behavior from the renters(not me). I saw some complaints on twitter like stealing, making noise, etc.",

        "selftext": "What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is near the lows and almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!\n\nIf you guys find this list useful (it's my first time posting this here), I can make this a weekly/weekend thing. I like doing it on Sundays so I can prepare for the trading week ahead.\n\n# High IV Tickers List\n\n\\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays! Also, the \"next earnings date\" data will resume starting in January, 2021 (very soon).\n\nPlease note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit.

        "selftext": "I've been investing, trading, gambling for about 5 years now and I've done pretty much every rookie mistake there is. Sold winners from 2016 (Shop,Nvidia,AMD,Paypal) Lost fortunes on chasing that pennystock. Played and lost with trying to time the market, option trading. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been very active during these years reading and learning and you be surprised how often people get sucked in to the same stuff you self did once. \n\nThese are 8 guidelines that really helps me and that I've learn to appreciate over the years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1.Don't FOMO**\n\nYes we all heard it. You know that feeling when people are posting crazy gains on these new stocks, we all saw the EV hype. It's so so easy to get sucked in to thinking, if I just put in some money right now I can get 10-20-50% gains in a few days! It's already up 200% this month, surely it will keep going!? \n\nThis takes some real patience to keep your head cool and realize it could very well be overbought and the downside risk is just a lot higher than potential. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've seen several sector hypes. We all remember the crypto bubble, the weed bubble and now lately the EV bubble. They all come and go and the more of these you been in from the start the easier it is to realize what's going on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. Cut your losers and let your winners run**\n\nBuying the dip is great when the market is down but if the fundamentals of the business is bad then usually this will just result in greater loss. On the flipside, if you have a few great picks and nothing fundamentally has changed and it keeps moving in the right direction then don't be afarid to keep adding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. When the overall market is down, you buy**\n\nNo one can predict the market, don't waste time on it. When the overall market is down your stock is literally on sale. Usually every sector is down when the market is down, your stock and business has not changed one bit however, it's just a lower price now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. Don't be afraid of corrections.**\n\nYeah it sucks seeing your portfolio down 20-30-40% but realize that stocks always go up, they seriously always do. Just keep your head down, keep buying and play that long game.\n\n**5. Small amounts can turn into big profits down the line**\n\nWhen you get really into investing you seriously start rethinking your life. That new OLED 77 inch? Only 2k right? What do you think that 2000 could be in 10 years? You just want to put every damn penny you got in the stock market because compounding interests are just too good to pass up. So just rethink if really need that new thing now or if it could wait.\n\n**6. If the company keeps growing, why sell?**\n\nTaking profit is good however not always the best thing to do. If the stock you have keeps growing and keeps crushing earnings. Why should you sell? Why just not keep it for years, it sure can be tempting but are you sure that money could be spent better elsewhere when it's easily growing in your winning stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**7, Never regret that you didn't buy more**\n\n We all been here. Why the hell didn't I buy more of Amazon? Why didn't I just put my whole paycheck in this stock!? \n\nYou can never do this. It won't lead to anything, you can't fix it and you honestly did the best decisions at the time with the information you had. Realize that at the time this was the best decision, ofcourse hindsight it looks like you could have done a better decision.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**8. Don't sell and buy in again to time a correction**\n\nThis is very hard and with the momentum some growth stocks have these days you might just end up loosing more of that profit even if there is a slight correction.

        "selftext": "Next $RIOT is $DMGGF\n\nRiot blockchain is a US based crypto minimg company, DMG blockchain solutions does basically the same thing but is canada based and does it way better.\n\nIf riot were california gold rush miners, dmggf is present day gold mining.\n\nThey have kyc for miners, handle the tax implications of mining, give investors exposure to crypto and have a similar balance sheet to riot but theyre sitting @ .22 cents right now. Mind you riot has what they have but in an area with higher electricity costs, warmer climate, and no answers for customers that will eventually ask how all this is supposed to be taxed. \n\nNow for the disclosures, ive been in riot since it was back at the .85 range and just sold 2022 calls to margin into more riot and dmggf. Personally with the space booming, dmg is a steal, I target $1 by the end of next year as payment systems with crypto take off. Some to note are the visa btc rewards card, paypal crypto merchant pos systems coming q1 2021, square crypto integration updates coming 2021.\n\nIts my belief that visa alone can skyrocket btc. $250 reward in btc using the card $3000 in 3 months, btc @19,000/250= 76 participates hitting reward level for 1 btc to be consumed\n\nLets say 500,000 people hit the mark. 500,000 / 76 = 6578 btc demand at a price of 19,000 if they buy at the best price this month. 125,000,000 usd to btc investment from half a million visa users with a rewards card hitting reward bonus.

Apple's ratio isn't bad though. \n\nAs for P/E, pypl is at 65.83 given trailing 3 Q's + Q4 low estimates and share price @ 210. Aapl is at 36.59 given FY20 earnings and share price @ 120.

        "selftext": "**Overview**\n\nHut 8 Mining Corp., headquartered in Toronto, Canada is a cryptocurrency mining and blockchain infrastructure company focused solely on mining bitcoin. It\u2019s one of the largest publicly traded bitcoin miners in the world with over 2,900 bitcoins in its treasury reserve.\n\n**Tickers**\n\nTSX: HUT\n\nOTCQX: HUTMF\n\n**Why invest in Hut?**\n\n***Short-term***\n\nShort-term, the price of bitcoin is rising. Recently bitcoin has hit new all-time highs and it\u2019s expected to surpass 20,000$ this bull cycle.\n\n\u25cf Paypal is on the cusp of going global with its crypto initiative, which will see 26 million companies accepting cryptocurrencies as a valid form of payment. The CEO of Paypal has recently stated that he expects vendors to prefer cryptocurrencies to other forms of payment methods going forward into the future, as has been shown by the data gathered in their US trial run.\n\n\u25cf There is both public and private interest in bitcoin currently. Countries like Nigeria, Iran, and Venezuela are utilizing bitcoin instead of their normal fiat currencies.\n\n\u25cf The state of California is set to have a hearing regarding the recognition of cryptocurrencies as a legal asset in 2022.\n\n\u25cf Private corporations are also beginning to offset their cash reserves and treasuries in bitcoin. We\u2019ll likely see a small-scale adoption in the summer of 2021 with Twitter leading the charge. Companies that have already done this include Microstrategy, Grayscale and Square (https://bitcointreasuries.org/ ). Realistically, the mass adoption of crypto is underway, it isn\u2019t hard to see why so many analysts predict the price of bitcoin to be 100k or higher.\n\n ***Long-Term***\n\nWe expect that long-term, the yearly return on investment will greatly surpass bitcoin and many other Cryptocurrencies as both private corporations and world governments begin to integrate blockchain on a socio-economic level. We can already see this trend with the vast public sector interest in the formation of Central Bank Digital Currencies, integrated smart cities, and digital ID\u2019s. This is of-course a bullish outlook, as blockchain infrastructures require a significant amount of computational power in order to operate effectively. The infrastructure is hard to establish and costly to run. Therefore it will be in both private and public interest to offset these costs onto private contractors, like Hut8 Mining.\n\n***Recent News***\n\n\u25cf 1031PH/s Petahashes per second mining capability\n\n***Q3 2020 Report Highlights***\n\n\u25cf Quarterly revenue of $5.8 million with mining profit margin of -37%.\n\n\u25cf Renegotiated key terms with lender to provide more downward flexibility with bitcoin collateral and save Hut 8 nearly $500,000 per year in interest expense.\n\n\u25cf Hosting revenue of $0.5 million from Hut 8\u2019s first hosting client with 6MW of latest generation bitcoin mining equipment.\n\n\u25cf Transferred the management of site operations from Bitfury to Hut 8, providing savings of over $1.5 million per year.\n\n\u25cf Made a bitcoin equipment order for 275 PH/s of which 154 PH/s using 6.7MW was installed this quarter with the remainder expected to be installed by the end of 2020.\n\n\u25cf Hut 8 became the first company to enter and exit the TSX Sandbox successfully, which solidifies its place as a TSX issuer.\n\nQ3-2020 was the first full quarter after the bitcoin halving where bitcoin production was cut in half while the network hash rate continued to rise, making it one of the most difficult periods for bitcoin miners to operate. To put this into context, it became 140% more difficult to mine for a bitcoin from just before the halving in May 2020 to September 30, 2020, while the bitcoin price increased by 9% in that same period. The economics of mining bitcoin has significantly improved subsequent to Q3-2020. \n\nHut 8 also recognized $0.5 million of hosting revenue after signing up its first client with 6MW of latest generation bitcoin mining equipment. This is a new revenue stream for Hut 8 and provides consistent recurring revenue with its available electrical capacity and existing infrastructure. Hut 8 has continued to find ways to reduce costs in Q3-2020 through many successful initiatives in the quarter. In July 2020, the Company re-negotiated its credit facility terms with Genesis Global Capital, LLC (\u201cGenesis) and successfully reduced the interest rate from 9.85% to 8.00% per annum saving approximately $500,000 per year.\n\nAnother initiative during Q3-2020 was that Hut 8 transferred the Clarke chips from its Drumheller facility to Medicine Hat which brought together Hut 8\u2019s higher efficiency chips with its best electricity pricing at Medicine Hat. Also, Hut 8 completed the transfer of the management of operations of both the Medicine Hat and Drumheller facilities from Bitfury to Hut 8, providing for savings of over $1.5 million per year. With full control over the sites, Hut 8 will continue to streamline operations while maintaining the highest industry standards.\n\nHut 8\u2019s strategy of mining and holding bitcoin continued to pay off as there was a $5.6 million gain on the re-measurement of bitcoin holdings in Q3-2020. Additionally, by only strategically selling bitcoin at higher prices, Hut 8 recorded a $0.2 million gain on the use of digital assets. Overall, for Q3-2020, Hut 8 recorded a net loss of approximately $0.9 million and a negative Adjusted EBITDA of $2.9 million.\n\nMore than halfway through the quarter, Hut 8 completed the installation of 1,000 M31S and 1,000 M31S+ mining equipment at its Medicine Hat facility. The equipment collectively increased Hut 8\u2019s mining power by approximately 154 PH/s using 6.7 MW of power. The remainder of the equipment purchase, which consists of 1,590 M30S units is expected to be shipped sometime soon and will provide an additional 140 PH/s using approximately 5.3MW.\n\nHut 8 also achieved a milestone when they became the first company to successfully exit the TSX Sandbox which solidifies Hut 8 as a TSX listed issuer. Hut 8 was also the first issuer to be listed to the TSX via the TSX Sandbox and has been trading on the senior TSX exchange since early October 2019.\n\n**Predicted Price Range**\n\nCurrent Price: 1. 6 9$ CAD (December 3rd 2020 1 5:09 UTC).\n\nShort-Term (5-6 months): 4- 5$ Long-Term (2-3 years): 20 -25$\n\n**RIOT Blockchain - A comparison to competition**\n\nRIOT runs a similar mining operation however there are quite some contrasting differences. RIOT is currently heavily pumped on various subreddit's, discords, and Twitter. Currently, it is overpriced for what it is worth. Comparatively, Hut has 3x the production capacity of RIOT and 3x the bitcoin reserves ( https://bitcointreasuries.org/ ) Long term it is likely that Hut will exceed the ROI of RIOT. It has done this in the past in 2017 and will do it again. As the price of bitcoin grows, so too will the price of Hut exponentially. Our argument is not that RIOT is bad, but that Hut is being overlooked.\n\n**Risks involved**\n\n\u25cf Quarterly Losses; this however is the norm within the crypto mining industry, and can be expected of any new industry. We are likely to begin to see the returns on investment as the price of bitcoin rises, and economies of scale begin to come underplay.\n\n\u25cf Low exposure; being a Canadian miner, and being predominantly traded on Canadian stock exchanges, Hut receives lower exposure than its American counterparts. This means that the stock typically moves slower, but as such is subject to lower levels of volatility.\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nThere are numerous reasons to be bullish on Hut. Its sheer size and capacity to mine bitcoin, certainly gives it a competitive advantage. Its bitcoin reserves make it a safe bet as the price of bitcoin is expected to rise on a macro time scale. There are a number of socio-economic phenomena driving up the price of bitcoin, however, as discussed Hut will likely transcend that as private and public blockchain based contracts become more readily available. Compared to its largest direct competitor, Hut outclasses Riot in terms of sheer numbers but lacks the same level of exposure as RIOT. Its quarterly losses are concerning but are expected within a newly forming industry; and it is important to note that its fellow competitors face the same constraints. The low exposure is something that should be fixed as it begins to be discussed more commonly within public discourse, specifically stock forums, subreddit's and discords, as well as on Twitter. There is a lot of potentials here for growth. This is a long term bet, buy and hold for the next 2-3 years.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nA strong long-term play, likely to pay out in the realm of 10-20x if held for a period of 2-3 years.\n\n(See below for Q3 2020 Report)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/duq5iinw46461.png?width=910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c91ab9e6f112a407f62911fca3b27a904abc1490",

        "selftext": "Well, I had a good run with SPACs and then after an epic fail with CFFA is said I\u2019m gonna take a break and part from common SPAC life for a while (full disclosure still traded warrants). However, lately some companies have been looking tasty like a nice ass with a clean butthole. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m really digging Shaq\u2019s FRX with the Disney execs and the ex tik tok guy. People chatting AEW but the problem there is Khan. Dudes got so much money he probably snorts blow through a diamond tooter. Why would he part ways with 10% to go public, and reverse merger doesn\u2019t seem his style. But I\u2019m hoping it is, it\u2019s a better product with less overhead than WWE. Then, there\u2019s Triller, the ex Tik Tok CEO is on Triller\u2019s advisory board. Nice product supposedly worth around 1.25B which would net them close to 25% ownership. Triller would have to be willing to understand that with 25% ownership there\u2019s more probability they take over into majority ownership. And eventual buyout. They say their looking for entertainment and tech, Triller kind of fits the bill, but I\u2019m more into AEW.\n\nI\u2019m also super into BFT that\u2019s merging with PAYSAFE, foley tresimaine is headed by the same dude who owns the Vegas nights, they have contracts already with draftkings, William hill gambling, roblox and many more. The company is valued at 9 billion. They produce over 100bil in digital transactions a year. Their competitors SQ does 180Bill a year and PayPal does well over 200Bill. I\u2019m super into and long on this company. If it does half of what sq does I\u2019ll lick cocaine from a midget strippers butthole to her vagina. \n\nHope y\u2019all like my prospects.",

        "selftext": "Hi. My name is the Rad Menace and I'm a business nerd. Business models fascinate me. Ever since I came across crypto it has dominated my thoughts. I'm not trying to sell you crypto, rather I believe these new fangled business models are game changing. Due to the US gov having both thumbs up it's ass, the crypto rules are not very well defined by law. Many of the articles out there are either filled with technical jargon or trash price predictions. Because of this, I've decided to put crypto into terms other business minded people might understand. This industry is broad and this article is a 10,000 foot view, so I guarantee there is an exception to anything I say, but I'll attempt to explain how to look at a cryptocurrency as a company.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat is Cryptocurrency?\n\n\nCryptocurrency is somewhat of a misnomer because it is not exclusively currency. Cryptocurrency in itself refers to a new fangled standardized internet \"token\" based on the creation of blockchain databases. This is the first time something can represent finite ownership over the internet without a middleman. This is a game changer. Some people call crypto \"the internet of value\". It is important to note that not all crypto tokens create their own blockchain, some are built on the back of another blockchain. Dapps (decentralized applications) can be built on a chain such as Ethereum and release their own token. Generally speaking, these tokens are used to pay for whatever services the Dapp offers.\n\n\nSince the creation of the internet, the biggest issue has been piracy. Ownership of something digital over the internet was impossible because the files could be copy / pasted and shared. Companies found the only way to combat this was to have a centralized authority who decides who owns what. A few examples include Bloomberg machines that are needed to view their proprietary data, buying videos on amazon that must be viewed on their platform, buying music that must be listened to via iTunes, or PayPal moving money from one user to another. The issue with this model is that any of these middlemen could change the rules on you or go out of business, and you could lose the files you purchased through them. With crypto, these centralized authorities are no longer needed. The underlying blockchain technology makes sure the ownership of your digital data can't be forged or duplicated, and since it isn\u2019t owned by the middleman, you can take your files to another platform easily.\n\n\nAnything could be turned into a crypto token, such as stocks, bonds, art, cards, data, computing power, data storage, news articles, ect. A bunch of bored nerds have built lots of intriguing infrastructure around these tokens and this concept and there is a ton of innovation coming out of it, which has brought in investment money as well as a lot of scams. The Crypto ecosystem wasn\u2019t planned out by some large corporation, rather it was built by the bored nerds just because they could. A few of the innovations coming out of this ecosystem include the blurring of the lines between cash and liquid assets, the idea of digital commodities controlled by no one party, and fully decentralized autonomous organizations with no need for a leadership team.\u00a0\n\n\nCryptocurrency currently has its own parallel financial system built to accept these \u201ctokens\u201d. When you buy one, you are buying a unique digital token which can be owned and traded. You don't necessarily have voting rights, like when you own a stock, instead you own a piece of the company's product. The product can vary widely and there is no telling what new ideas will come out in the future. Many crypto startups require you to use their token to purchase whatever service they offer and pay their \"employees\" with this token. This creates some interesting supply and demand dynamics. Long term, the crypto financial system and the traditional financial system will merge. Even longer term, many things in the real world will also be imported to the token system.\u00a0\n\n\nIf this ecosystem sounds confusing, it's because it is, and it's still developing and evolving. There are many factors that differentiate cryptos but I'm going to focus on three: How the company is governed, where do new tokens come from, and what is the company's product.\u00a0\n\n\n3 Factor Framework for Analyzing Crypto Companies\n\n\nHow is the Crypto governed?\n\nA Cryptocurrency\u2019s governance structure defines who makes the rules for the crypto token or the company. These rules can define anything about the algorithm or the company, such as who produces new tokens, how many tokens are produced, or specifics about the blockchain.\u00a0\n\nCentralized model: These cryptos have a person or organization behind them creating the rules generally running it like a company. An example of this is the crypto company Ripple or Facebook's Libra. While Ripple has a tradable token and you pay for usage of the ripple network using this token, the centralized team holds most of the token and has total control over the algorithm, how much of the token is produced, and what the company does. Ripple also does all of the processing of the code to run the crypto and its blockchain, leaving a single point of failure. Another example is a company that releases a crypto as a funding mechanism, but the token itself does nothing special. This type of crypto will most likely be regulated as a stock but only time will tell.\u00a0\n\nDecentralized model: These cryptos are not necessarily controlled by any one party, and instead are owned and controlled by the users and producers of the token. These decentralized cryptos give the user and investor confidence that a company won't try and change something that is a detriment to the system. An example of this is ethereum. While ethereum still has a centralized team working on projects and upgrades, they do not produce the new tokens or process their own code. Instead, anyone with 32 ether and a desktop computer can run the ethereum blockchain, acting as the employees while getting paid in ether. These decentralized cryptos will most likely be regulated as commodities.\n\nDecentralized Autonomous Organizations: This is a subsect of decentralized Cryptos companies and they are totally autonomous. This means the company doesn't have a leadership team, anyone can join in and do the work, and the rules are exclusively based on code. The original example of this is bitcoin. Bitcoins blockchain is voted on based on processing power, and people are paid in bitcoin to perform this work. These will most likely get regulated as a commodity as well.\u00a0\n\n\nWhere do new Tokens come from?\n\nCryptocurrency companies create new tokens through a variety of mechanisms. This category is closely linked with it's governance structure. This could be compared to the federal reserve who decides when to print new US dollars and who receives them. Some companies mix several of these options together.\u00a0\n\nCrowd sale: this is essentially an auction, where a company sells the token to the highest bidders. Companies generally use this as a funding mechanism, raising money to create their product or fund operations. Companies that sell crypto this way may be regulated as a stock, similar to raising money via a class C stock with no voting rights.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMining: mining is a process of verifying the blockchain based on computing power. New tokens are created and rewarded to the miners based on the amount of computing power they added to the system.\u00a0\n\nStaking: staking is a process of locking up a certain number of tokens and receiving rewards or punishments for system uptime and downtime. This process requires less computing power than mining because you have something at stake if you have downtime.\u00a0\n\nOther: who knows what new forms we will see over time.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat is the Crypto's Product?\n\nThere are an unlimited number of uses for Cryptocurrency and blockchain databases. Many products out right now directly compete with each other. Like any other network, the network effect will consolidate these products into a monopoly or an oligarchy market. This is in no way an exhaustive list, it's simply an overview.\n\nCurrency: the easiest product to fathom is a currency. Since cash can't be exchanged over the internet, we have to rely on companies like paypal connecting to a bank connecting to another person on PayPal connecting to their bank. For international transactions this process is even more difficult. The most famous example of a currency is bitcoin. This model has historically seen the most fraud, where someone holds a crowd sale of a currency that does nothing special and walks away with the money.\n\nProcessing power: the second largest Cryptocurrency is Ethereum and their product is processing power. Ethereum is essentially a decentralized database that is constantly checking whatever code is written on the ether tokens. You can write any kind of simple or complex code and have it automatically executed by the blockchain. The catch, you must pay to access this processing power using the ether token.\u00a0\n\nMoving money quickly and cheaply: the third largest Cryptocurrency is Ripple. Ripple allows you to exchange money from any currency to any other currency almost instantly for a low fee. You must pay this fee using Ripple's token.\n\nStable coin: stable coins attempt to emulate the price of an underlying asset. Facebook's libra did this by making a basket of currencies and assets, while things like tether attempt to keep the price at $1 usd.\u00a0\n\nDecentralized finance: the newest trend in crypto is known as DeFi. These cryptos automate normal bank functions, such as lending, insurance, investing, ect. Once again, you pay for their service using their token.\u00a0\n\nNon Fungible Tokens (NFTs): These tokens are identifiers that allow you to hold a unique item on the blockchain. Companies use this to store, prove and verify ownership of an item in the real world over the internet. Things such as art and land are already being stored on the blockchain.\n\n\nThere is way too much to simply explain in an article. The crypto ecosystem is still evolving. Looking at the three factors of governance structure, token creation, and the company's product, you have a framework with which to analyze these new business models. Keep your eyes peeled for new articles.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSigning off for now, stay rad.\n\n\nThe Rad Menace\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MenaceRad?s=09",

        "selftext": "Paypal was an early COVID investing pick due to its nature of contactless payments and its rise in young populations with Venmo. Paypal has a storied history, founded by some of the most influential Silicon Valley VC\u2019s and entrepreneurs they started as two smaller companies founded in the middle of the tech bubble (1998 and 1999) as Confinity and X.com by Peter Thiel and Elon Musk. They were able to weather the storm of the 2000 tech fallout by being bought out by eBay for $1.5B beforehand. Under eBay, Paypal grew their services into what most of us know them for: digitized payments. Starting from effortless check transfers for unauthorized vendors to working their way to b(!)tcoin, Paypal has made it more convenient for payments to be processed, and in our consumerist economy that\u2019s an absolute goldmine. Square is a relatively new player in the digital transaction space but they\u2019ve had quite a run up this year under the leadership of Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter. Their first product was a card reader that fit into the headphone jack of smartphones, so naturally Square expanded into the enterprise services market and continued developing solutions for small businesses like payroll management. I\u2019ll further discuss the respective structures of both companies in this due diligence.\n\n**The Expansion of Digital Transactions**\n\nPaper currency has been the standard means of exchange for ages, but the digital method of exchange, particularly mobile exchanges has now become far more convenient. In 2017, digital payments were expected to reach a market value of [$726B](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/09/digital-payments-expected-to-hit-726-billion-by-2020-study-finds.html) in 2020, and here we are post covid with the value of digital payments at over 910B.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStatista forecasts that most of the sales growth for digitized payments past 2020 will come from mobile POS, and that most of the user growth for digitized payments will also be in peer-to-peer transactions. Paypal has both bases covered with Venmo when it comes to mobile transactions and it has E-Commerce covered with its major retailer partnerships and with eBay. Square has Cash app, which is a peer-to-peer payments app plus they also have in-person small business products for digital payments like their \u201ccash register\u201d called the Square Stand which is useful for freelancing professionals and small businesses:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo a pro of Square is that it has a far more established presence in the growing sector of digital payments which is mobile POS payments, not E-Commerce. However, E-Commerce is the much larger sector by users alone:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, mobile POS payments are expected to triple in the same time that E-commerce will grow by around\u00a020%.\n\nThis makes a lot of sense to me as E-Commerce still makes up a small amount of all transactions and its trajectory is very much fixed and established now. POS payments are definitely growing though, as on my last trip to India, one of the fastest growing countries, I observed that every small business had a PayTM barcode for transactions, and this is where both Paypal and especially Square will eventually expand to. CNBC also forecasts most digital payment growth will happen in emerging markets (which is why I\u2019ll suggest an ETF at the end which incorporates emerging market companies) \u201cEmerging markets are expected to grow at a rate three times that of developed economies in terms of digital transaction volumes. Digital payments in developing markets grew 21.6 percent between 2014 and 2015, compared to a 6.8 percent rise in mature markets. Non-cash payments in Asian emerging markets are projected to grow by almost a third (30.9 percent), led by powerhouses China and India\u201d. According to CNBC analysts though, cash will still remain supreme for the following reasons: speed of exchange, universal acceptance, anonymity, absence of record and free of charge. Anonymity and absence of record are things that are being fixed by the incorporation of cr!ptocurrency into transactions, but it\u2019s likely the biggest reason people don\u2019t switch to cashless is because not all merchants use it and the fees add up especially for many transactions a day for the *merchants*. Eventually when the digital transaction economy grows fully, there will be enough competitors to offer sellers competitive rates to a point where they\u2019ll choose mobile payments for the convenience it provides in terms of not having to use physical cash but as of now only small businesses are willing to make the opportunity cost of losing fees so they don\u2019t have to store cash.\n\n***Paypal***\n\nPaypal is \u201ca global, two-sided network at scale that connects merchants and consumers with 305 million active accounts (consisting of 281 million consumer active accounts and 24 million merchant active accounts) across more than 200 markets. PayPal helps merchants and consumers connect, transact, and complete payments, whether they are online, on a mobile device, in an app, or in person\u201d. They have a variety of new products in development as they have made several acquisitions since their establishment. Paypal offers merchants a technology-agnostic platform that requires no hardware and little time to set up with its Braintree product which is primarily for online sellers and iZettle which is used for POS payments primarily in international markets and they have a user base of 19 million. This acquisition was made with the full intention of competing with Square and since Paypal has had an extremely talented eye for acquisitions in the past in Xoom and Venmo, this [relatively new acquisition](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/06/07/why-did-paypal-pay-such-a-high-price-for-izettle/?sh=60f035216860) has a lot of potential, but it could also just be a last minute scramble to catch up to Square\u2019s huge market share in POS payment offerings. Paypal has a great P2P ecosystem in Venmo and Xoom and a credit partnership with Synchrony bank as well which helps diversify revenue streams. Paypal also owns a company called GoPay, which basically provides the same services Paypal does but in China, which expands them into a market that\u2019s more likely to grow in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, Paypal has some pretty consistent revenue, profit, and EBITDA growth, but a bit more concerning may be the fact that margins have been relatively stable and they haven\u2019t been increasing at all. I believe the reason for this is because PayPal\u2019s full potential isn\u2019t close to being realized, and even founder Peter Thiel said in his book \u201cZero to One\u201d that Paypal wouldn\u2019t start realizing a majority of their cash flows until 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u00a0While Paypal was able to increase earnings per share by a strong 21% from 2018 to 2019, they decreased cash flows from operating activities by 17% from 2018. This requires that we go into the capital expenditures in their CF statement, which will provide a clearer idea of why and how Paypal lost cash flow despite rising net income. Another thing standing out may be the fact that the operating margin is pretty constant, which can be a concerning sign for investors seeking a growth stock. Plus, considering how much the price for PYPL has run up in the past few months you\u2019d expect better profitability to come with it hand-in-hand. But the future being factored into Paypal isn\u2019t based on its face value, or else the price would be very stagnant right now and it wouldn\u2019t have grown nearly as much as it has.\n\nHere\u2019s what I mean:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe amount of profit Paypal can squeeze out of its main product is pretty much at a maximum as transaction expenses are growing at the same rate as revenues are and operating expenses are still going up at a somewhat proportional rate to that of net income, meaning that no more value is going to come out of the existing product. While the existing product is still going to grow in popularity, its profitability is only going to decrease or stagnate as Paypal expands into developing markets that aren\u2019t willing to cough up as much in fees. As Thiel himself puts it, that\u2019s \u201chorizontal innovation\u201d AKA just globalism. That alone isn\u2019t enough to justify the investment levels in Paypal, but investments and acquisitions into the future of transactions will expand it, and on top of this it\u2019s only recently Paypal has experienced such tremendous growth in cash flows YoY.\n\nNow you\u2019ll see below PYPL\u2019s historic cash flows, and if you go to the bottom you\u2019ll see their free cash flow decreased from 2018 to 2019 as I previously mentioned. The root cause of this is investment purchases, which increased by $5B in 2019 and contributed to the Free Cash Flow decreasing by 800M. Again, if we look at Paypal\u2019s track record when it comes to acquisitions they\u2019ve been very successful, so there\u2019s not much reason to expect much different this time around. If Paypal\u2019s investing, investors are excited. They\u2019ve piled up cash up until last year, and they\u2019re finally using it now based off their cash per share:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdd to this the tremendous increase in digital payment volume in the past year and we can expect a real change in the entire sector\u2019s trajectory. Hedge funds have been piling up on this supposed legacy company for a valid reason: their time for expansion is ***now, and COVID-19 has only spurred in realizing this perfect storm, as net income and revenue has seen a jump in the past two quarters:***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo you must be wondering why Paypal\u2019s cash from operations was down in 2019 from 2018, but in their most recent 10k Paypal explained cash from operations and FCF was only down due to \u201cpositive impact of $1.4 billion of changes in loans and interest receivable, held for sale, net following the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio\u201d which was added into the operating income as it was a noncash expense and that\u2019s why 2019 looks down about $1B in cash even though operating income for 2019 was up $0.4B:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaypal\u2019s newly acquired capital is already being used and it\u2019ll be put to good use based on the meteoric rise in transactions in the past two years. Contactless payments will eventually become a norm and their established e-commerce platform will set them up pretty well on this end.\n\nNow to address the flip side of the coin: POS or Point of Sale transactions, which is a market Square has wrapped around its finger as it\u2019s had the head start since the iPhone 4. Here\u2019s how Square got started, instead of giving 10$ to people for using their product, founder and CEO Jack Dorsey (who also is the founder and CEO of Twitter) gave them the product for free and built an infrastructure around it. It was simply a credit card scanner that could be inserted into the headphone jack of a smartphone. This simple product is still being sent out for free to small businesses and the software and business model that surrounded this tiny card reader has expanded like a wildfire since then. Square would collect 2.75% on each payment similar to Paypal.\n\nSquare also made a \u201ccash management\u201d app, Cash App to dive into a non-retail market.\n\nAbout Cash App: \u201cCash App provides an ecosystem of financial products and services to help individuals manage their money. While Cash App started with the single ability to send and receive money, it now provides an ecosystem of financial services that allows individuals to store, send, receive, spend, and invest their money.\u201d\n\nIt appears as if Square is trying to become an all-round player in the consumer and producer financial ecosystem as Cash App has become more like a bank or brokerage account rather than just a P2P service like Paypal or Zelle. Now, Cash App makes 25% of SQ\u2019s revenues.\n\nIn Square\u2019s 2019 annual report, they reported the following:\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2019, we processed $106.2 billion of Gross Payment Volume (GPV), which was generated by nearly 2.3 billion card payments from 407 million payment cards. At the end of 2019, our Square point of sale ecosystem had over 180 million buyer profiles and approximately 230 million items were listed on Square by sellers.\n\nAs of December 2019, Cash App had approximately 24 million monthly active customers who had at least one cash inflow or outflow during a given month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe above image shows Square\u2019s payment volume distribution across different industries, and as you can see in 2019 payment volume was very diverse which bodes well for SQ\u2019s stability.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis shows the increasing size of sellers who use Square, and this shows that Square\u2019s mission of making small businesses big and having them stick to their product regardless of their stage in growth is ***working***.\n\nAlthough their main business is in processing payments, Square is making itself a fin-tech institutional force with 30 different API\u2019s for retail and e-commerce sellers along with invoicing, appointment, payroll, loyalty/gift card, and account management services. Square also has financing for small businesses in Square Capital, which I find to be the most interesting part of their model. They give small loans to businesses based on the data that they ***already have as Square manages the business\u2019 finances, remember? And this puts them at an advantage to make good debt because of the transparency into the business\u2019 finances. This will allow Square to make extremely profitable and high turnover loans that have virtually NO risk of default***. The types of loans they give are generally small, and they could be as little as $500. They describe these loans as the type you\u2019d ask for from your parents or relatives. Square has such in-depth data from these businesses that when they make loans they don\u2019t even *consider* credit scores: \u201cGenerally, for loans to Square sellers, loan repayment occurs automatically through a fixed percentage of every card transaction a seller takes. Loans are sized to be less than 20% of a seller\u2019s expected annual GPV (their payment volume) and, by simply running their business, sellers repay their loan in eight to nine months on average\u201d\n\nSince 2014, Square has made over $6B in loans with a failure rate of only 4%, which makes sense because Square has access to all of its client\u2019s financials so therefore they possess the ability to make fully transparent loans.\n\nWhen you jump into Square\u2019s financials, there\u2019s a lot of promise to say the least:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot only has revenue grown by 42% from 2018 to 2019, net income finally became positive in 2019 and free cash flow increased from 232m to 400m in the same span.\n\nHere\u2019s the revenue breakdown for Square, and as you can observe while transaction revenue saw much stronger compared to Paypal, the real deal was Square\u2019s expansion of its enterprise solutions as those revenues increased by 74% last year, these are revenues recognized as the following: \u201cRevenue from Cash App, Square Capital, and Instant Transfers for sellers currently comprise the majority of our subscription and services-based revenue. Cash App subscription and services-based revenue is primarily comprised of transaction fees from Cash App Instant Deposit and Cash Card. Our other subscription and services-based products include website hosting and domain name registration services, Gift Cards, Square Appointments, Customer Engagement, Employee Management, Payroll, Square Card, and other product offerings.\u201d\n\nB(!)tcoin revenues from Cash App investing whose revenues increased by 210% (in this case B(!)tcoin is an asset that Square owns and sells to those using Cash App to invest in B(!)tcoin.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso in that same span, Square\u2019s cash has nearly doubled. This liquidity will be necessary as Square Capital continues to grow and will require financing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObserving some long term trends now for $SQ:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile Square is far riskier than Paypal, they seem to be capturing a much larger market and have a bigger vision for the future at this point. Paypal becomes more like Microsoft and Square is kind of like Apple if we went back 10 years. One of them has widespread use and an established platform but still has consistent growth (about 15%) and the other is finding itself in a competitive market but is also slowly establishing absolute dominance. Square is absolutely overvalued, but for a growth stock that\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary, and so is Paypal considering they don\u2019t have nearly as much a prospect for growth unless leadership shows a huge change in direction some time soon. The \u201cPaypal Mafia\u201d however has surprised us before and I think there\u2019s a solid chance of growth still plausible for them. Regardless, both of these companies should be a holding in your portfolio amidst a growing FinTech sector and a huge transition away from traditional payments.\n\nTickers: $ARKF $PYPL $SQ\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: SQ 240c 12/18 ARKF 55c 1/15/21, ARKF, PYPL, SQ shares",

        "selftext": "\nThis is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

I have current positions in the following: \n\nTTD, TSLA, FVRR, CRWD, PYPL, NFLX, SNPS, PINS, HUBS, TWLO \n\nMy last change, I took a little off the top with TWLO as I thought it was going to tank...it did not and it kept going.

I should have let it run, but oh wellz. \n\nWhat I'd like to do is hopefully have 40% annualized return so I can get $1,000,000 in a 10 year timeline. I'm not interested in going index funds (I will advise folks who are in their 20s to do that.) \n\nI am think of liquidating everything to keep my double-up and go into the following M1 pies: \n\n**Financial Pie** 25%\n\n**Consumer Cyclical Pie** 25%\n\n**Communication Services Pie** 25%\n\n**Technology Pie** 25%\n\n**\\*** **Financial Pie** \n\nLMND 50%\n\nPYPL 50%\n\n\\* **Consumer Cyclical Pie**\n\nAMZN 50%\n\nTSLA 50%\n\n\\* **Communication Services Pie**\n\nDIS 20%\n\nFVRR 20%\n\nPINS 20%\n\nTWLO 20%\n\nZM 20%\n\n\\* **Technology Pie**\n\nCRWD 17%\n\nHUBS 17%\n\nSHOP 17%\n\nTTD 17%\n\nADSK 16%\n\nOKTA 16%\n\n\\--------\n\nShould I start from scratch with the above? If I can get 40% or more of annualized returns with what I've done I'd be very happy. Once I get a million, I will then turn into a dividend investor and live off yields for the rest of my life.
