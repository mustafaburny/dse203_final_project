        "selftext": "**US equities lower: Dow (2.81%), S&amp;P 500 (2.89%), Nasdaq (3.11%), Russell 2000 (2.63%)**\n\n* US equities under broad-based pressure with all sectors lower in Wednesday morning trading. S&amp;P down for a third straight session. Energy, tech, comm services, materials among the big decliners. FAANGs mostly underperforming. Defensives holding up best and industrials, healthcare also among the outperformers. Treasuries mostly stronger with some curve flattening. 10-year yields down for a fourth straight session. Dollar seeing good gains vs euro and sterling but little changed vs the yen. Gold down 1.9%. WTI crude down 5.8%.\n* **Worsening coronavirus trends** remain the big overhang on risk sentiment with the focus on rising case counts, hospitalizations and most importantly from an economic perspective, consumer behavioral changes and fresh mitigation measures. Vaccine optimism, which has long offset other coronavirus-related concerns, has also been dented a bit from a timing perspective. **Near-term fiscal stimulus expectations continue to fade** with no sign of progress between Democrats and White House in recent days. **Election risk** another overhang with some recent tightening in the polls (and lingering polling skepticism). **Earnings beat rates elevated but slipping** and stock price reactions suggest a lot of good news already priced in and focus may be elsewhere (coronavirus, election).\n* **Big earnings day** and now 40% of S&amp;P 500 has reported. According to FactSet, 81% have surpassed consensus EPS estimates, better than the 73% one- and five-year averages. However, this is down from the 84% seen at the end of last week. In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings 15.6% above expectations, better than the 8.0% and 5.6% respective one- and five-year year average positive surprise rates, but down from 17.2% last week and the 23% beat rate in Q3.\n* Several higher-profile names reported today. Takeaways somewhat complicated by outsized macro focus today. **MSFT-US** beat and analysts continued to highlight cloud momentum but there some transactional headwinds and revenue guide was a bit light. **MA-US** missed on both top and bottom line though coronavirus concerns/European exposure may be bigger issue for the stock. **UPS-US** beat but domestic volume growth moderated and expectations elevated given e-commerce narrative. **GE-US** a standout with focus on better industrial FCF and Q4 guide for that metric. **ADP-US** beat and raised on pickup in business activity.\n\n**Notable Gainers:**\n\n* \\+15.7% **FSLR-US** (First Solar): Q3 earnings and revenue beat strongly, reinstated Q4 guidance with midpoint a bit ahead of consensus; analysts noted increased visibility, stronger system sales, clearing prior backlog in Asia projects, cost reduction plan on target though Malaysian production a risk due to Covid travel restrictions.\n* \\+15.5% **CLGX-US** (CoreLogic): CNBC's David Faber said company engaging potential buyers and receiving bids at more than $80/sh (vs Tuesday's $68.25 close); said has already signed an NDA with one party; CSGP-US mentioned as a potential buyer.\n* \\+8.7% **GE-US** (General Electric): Q3 revenue, EPS and operating profit beat; Street takeaways focused on unexpectedly positive industrial FCF, better industrial FCF guidance for Q4, industrial EBIT upside, lack of major surprises on impairment testing, stronger healthcare, still soft aviation.\n* \\+7.3% **ADP-US** (ADP): Big FQ1 earnings beat with revenue better; highlighted tailwinds from improving economies and increased business activity; raised FY guidance; noted strong start to new business bookings.\n* \\+1.5% **GRMN-US** (Garmin): Q3 earnings, revenue, and margins beat; sales above consensus in every segment; notable strength in Fitness amid higher demand for fitness/cycling products; FY guidance better than the Street.\n\n**Notable Decliners:**\n\n* \\-17.3% **ELY-US** (Callaway Golf): Confirmed merger with Topgolf previously reported by WSJ; company will \\~$2B of shares and take on Topgolf's $555M of debt; deal expected to be dilutive until 2025; analysts upbeat on Topgolf as an asset but also noted how it changes the Callaway stock narrative; company also issued a positive Q3 preannouncement with the deal news.\n* \\-11% **DXCM-US** (Dexcom): Q3 earnings beat while revenue was same as pre-reported 26-Oct, guidance raised to levels in line with Street; analysts noted solid results in Pharmacy and Medicare and record patient additions; however G7 will launch as 10 day sensor instead of 14 day, increased competition and pricing challenges despite \\~70% share price outperformance ytd.\n* \\-9% **BBBY-US** (Bed Bath &amp; Beyond): Three-year financial roadmap sees stable comps in 2021; planning for $1 - $1.5B in capital investments including store revamps; launching $225M accelerated buyback; comes after stock has rallied \\~130% in past three months.\n* \\-6.2% **UPS-US** (UPS): Q3 earnings and revenue beat with guidance withheld; noted improvement in small and medium sized businesses and continued strength outbound from Asia; analysts discussed high expectations, moderation of domestic volume growth, higher cost per piece, though recent price increases may benefit results going forward.\n* \\-6.1% **AKAM-US** (Akamai): Q3 earnings, revenue, operating margins were a bit ahead; analysts noted in line Q4 guidance relies to an extent on one off factors; Security segment which is important to valuation argument has decelerated somewhat; some concern over peak-traffic; however results mostly solid benefitting from currently elevated traffic levels in OTT video and gaming.\n* \\-6.1% **CHRW-US** (C.H. Robinson): Q3 revenue, EPS beat, though low quality on better taxes; operating income missed; reduced FY20 capex guidance; analysts flagged weaker North America truckload volume growth, weaker net revenue margins from contract commitments and elevated spot rates.\n* \\-5.8% **MA-US** (MasterCard): Q3 revenue and EPS light; takeaways somewhat mixed with focus on continued weakness in cross-border, headwind from other revenues and processing fees, lower rebates and operating expenses, stable to better October volume trends, and risks from second coronavirus wave (particularly with its exposure to Europe).\n* \\-4.4% **CME-US** (CME Group): Q3 EPS missed; revenue in line, though clearing and transaction fees weaker; analysts cautious on impact of low rate and weak energy sector backdrop, flagged weaker Q4 volume trends as EPS headwind.\n* \\-3% **MSFT-US** (Microsoft): Fiscal Q1 revenue and EPS beat with all segments ahead; Street takeaways largely positive with focus on cloud momentum/leverage to digital transformation push; Azure growth beat consensus and what several analysts noted was a higher whisper number; however, some focus on transactional headwinds and slightly below consensus Dec Q guidance.\n\n09:28:54 AM CDT on 28 Oct '20",
