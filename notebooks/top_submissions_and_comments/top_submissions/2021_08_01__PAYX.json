If you take a nice look at there ticker they have been increasing at a pretty nice rate over the years, even though the returns probly wont be to huge, the 9/17 120c's are like 1.50 or something like that, and with the constant growth of this company and the consistent demand for online payment services i think there could be some decent money to be made. but im a degenerate, so take my word with a grain of salt.",
