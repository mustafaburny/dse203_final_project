That is, the engineering capabilities they demonstrated on stage were explained somewhat not terribly, but still made sense to me. With that said, what did you guys think?\n\nAlso, some questions for the electrical engineers/others who have experience in this field - how viable and how possible does this innovation seem to you? Is this revolutionary as Elon is saying?\n\nFor everyone else, does this make anyone else feel like they are undervaluing TSLA? I mean, it definitely put some doubt in me as to my current valuation. This morning, if you had asked me, I would\u2019ve definitely said yes. After watching this, I am not so sure. I might even increase the value of the company.  Now, I am an Elon fan but I also know his tendency to not follow through with deadlines, yet still succeeding massively due to his ability to build things from ground up (his first-principles .\n\n Is the comprehensive innovation he is bringing to the whole of the batteries - all the components make TSLA worth more than it is currently?

        "selftext": "**I. INTRODUCTION**\n\n* When I look at the sentiment surrounding GameStop, it doesn\u2019t take very long to see [comments]( https://i.imgur.com/lndA70O.png) [like](https://i.imgur.com/Ec4z1fx.png) [these](https://i.imgur.com/6WoeXUS.png), yet here we [are](https://i.imgur.com/NpANVzR.png). What\u2019s going on? Are people that stupid? Just jumping on the new console cycle? Idiots not pulling their gains and going to zero? When even r/wsb thinks the stock is a dud, it must be right? Nearly 120% short interest, yet the stock is up nearly 40% this week. \n* Its no secret GameStop has been hurting. The secular shift to digital has been pressuring them for some time with their highest margin category - used video software \u2013 under significant distress. Each year their gross margins contract with net income in the red these past few quarters. Everybody has written them off as the easiest short in the world, however I'm going to try to explain whats going on and tell you that buying GameStop may not be as bad as you think.\n\n**II. CONSOLES**\n\n* Just to start things off, you have to remember we\u2019re in the beginnings of the new console cycle. But what does that even mean? Well the advent of new consoles means new trade-ins, new product, new customers, and a fresh spike in GameStop\u2019s popularity. Sales have stagnated the years prior, and they are all but certain to go up and remain elevated for the next 1-2 years. Note that against all counts, the company was actually profitable during the 2019 holiday season, with new consoles you can bet that they will annihilate all expectations and proceed into 4-8 more positive quarters off the cyclic shift. This is pretty unanimous, and everyone accepts that they will start reporting positive going forward. In fact, new console cycles are where GME has historically [spiked](https://i.imgur.com/LOehh3E.png).\n\n**III. POST CONSOLE CYCLE**\n\n* At this point, the focus turns to what happens once the hype dies down. Digital will continue to erode upon physical, but the key factor here is that physical is not actually dying off. [Its not](https://i.imgur.com/kmVPF39.png) [going to](https://i.imgur.com/rfRRGC9.png) zero. **The biggest reason physical is sequentially a lower percentage of the market is because the total market size is increasing.** Digital is shooting off while physical is largely stagnant. Note that physical games admittedly have their strengths. Not only are they structurally cheaper because you can resell them, they also have clear definitions of ownership and the collectability factor where you *need* to have a physical copy you can hold. In fact, [two thirds](https://www.limelight.com/resources/white-paper/state-of-online-gaming-2019/) of console video game players prefer physical vs digital.\n* While physical is here to stay, albeit at a weaker level, that isn\u2019t enough to turn the tides for GameStop. You see, GameStop knows digital is the trend and here to stay, they are not fighting it, **they are moving along the secular shift**. GameStop sells [digital games](https://i.imgur.com/RZJGjFE.png). GameStop is set to release a mobile app combining Game Informer and a online storefront by [month end](https://i.imgur.com/rdXejYc.png). They are doubling down on their online store with +500% ecommerce growth in [Q1]( http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-first-quarter-results) and +800% growth in [Q2](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-second-quarter-results-and-strong-progress). Expanding into numerous other [categories](https://i.imgur.com/QSkZEAw.png). Nearly 70% of their online orders were fulfilled on the same [day](https://i.imgur.com/NK8lkqD.png) leveraging their wide network of stores, of which they are pruning the excess. Also, Game prices are set to [increase $10](https://technosports.co.in/2020/09/19/sony-confirms-that-ps5-games-will-cost-up-to-69-99/). \n* GameStop\u2019s Loyalty Program accounts for over 55M [users](http://news.gamestop.com/fact-sheet-0). They intend on leveraging this network though a [company branded credit card](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-now-taking-pre-orders-sony-playstationr5-and-sony) with spending rewards to grab market share and retain customers. Furthermore, a digital revenue sharing model continues to [grow](https://i.imgur.com/V94FWJC.png) as publishers understand the value of GameStop as a customer acquisition service and that keeping the company afloat is better for sales and the general video game industry. (*[See the fall of Toys R us and its impact on Mattel/Hasbro](https://www.retaildive.com/news/the-toy-category-still-hasnt-recovered-from-the-death-of-toys-r-us/571701/); turns out the manufacturers really needed ToysRUs*)\n\n**VI. BALANCE SHEET**\n\n* But wait, their financials must be shit right? They have to be losing money. How much longer can they last? \n* Well it turns out their books are rock solid. They offered their creditors a new set of terms to push back debt for 2 years, 50% of them [took it](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-expiration-and-final-results-exchange-offer). They have eliminated all excess goodwill impairments. They are in a [$300M net cash position](https://i.imgur.com/HhfHaIT.png) with significantly reduced inventory (which explains the sharp reduction in Q1/2 sales) and massively cut SG&amp;A by 28% in preparation for the console cycle. [FCF KING](https://i.imgur.com/LYyrrUm.png)\n* Many believe the days of their strong margins are long gone, but in fact its only beginning. You have to remember, digital is only outpacing NEW physical games. [Retro games](https://thenextweb.com/gaming/2019/02/01/retro-consoles-video-game-sales-nostalgia/) are a [huge untapped market](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/01/talking_point_how_much_is_your_video_game_collection_really_worth_to_you) where GameStop can replicate their past success, and it is a category digital can never penetrate. [Jesus wtf.](https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nes/little-samson) GameStop is looking into [these already](https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/retro-gaming/pre-owned)\n\n**V. MAJOR BACKING**\n\n* In fact, their ecommerce prospects are so promising, Ryan Cohen bought a [10% stake](https://investorplace.com/2020/08/gamestop-news-sends-gme-stock-soaring/). This guy took on Amazon and [won](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2020/01/26/ryan-cohen-started-a-company-that-took-on-amazon-and-sold-it-for-3-billion-now-hes-thinking-about-whats-next/#7cdf60865579). [Jefferies](https://i.imgur.com/Duyxu1i.png) and [Talsey](https://i.imgur.com/K169L1N.png), wall street firms, came out with strong buy ratings citing company prospects. [Michael Burry](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/michael-burry-top-portfolio-holdings-massive-bet-alphabet-google-scion-2020-8-1029517864#) still holds a 5% stake. This guy took on Wall Street and won. [Half their creditors](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-expiration-and-final-results-exchange-offer) ($200M worth) believe in GameStop\u2019s prospects. Why would they defer their debt unless they believed the company will be in a paying position by 2023?\n\n**VI. THE SHORTS**\n\n* But here is the real kicker. GameStop\u2019s short float. 120% has never been seen before. The short theory was that GameStop would not make it to the new console cycle and the shorters would collect their tendies. But GameStop made it. Current short fees are like 60% and from some figures we can draw on, we estimate that around 70% of the shorts got in [under $7](https://i.imgur.com/wRaMbLx.png), GameStop is currently nearing $10. **70% of the shorts are underwater.** Even if you don\u2019t believe that any of their initiatives will work you have to admit that the company will be able to continue operating for another two years off the new console hype alone. When the stock hits roughly $15, we can expect to see several margin calls trigger a fucking massive short squeeze. For reference, [Blue Apron](https://i.imgur.com/6EqU417.png), [Volkswagen](https://i.imgur.com/S3DHn3j.gif).\n\n**VII. CONCLUSION**\n\n* Just the fact GME got to the new console cycle must be making the shorts cry. Add on that they\u2019ve been making serious progress towards online and mobile presence, aligning themselves with industry trends, operating in a growing market, potential monopoly in the untapped retro market, solid financials, beginning their new upward cyclic cycle; you have the makings of a powerful ecommerce storefront just leaning into their growth period. Even post console hype, they should be able to leverage their branded credit card to retain a huge number of customers and bite off huge market share off other retailers. Lastly, remember that despite the trend towards digital, its in the gaming industry's best interest to keep GameStop going strong. The likelihood of additional revenue sharing agreements are fairly high.\n* For comparison GameStop has a P/S ratio 0.11. Chewy has a P/S ratio of 3.6. If GME begins to grow their revenue from this point its valuation will begin to normalize. Even a P/S of 0.2 would mean a stock price of ~$16, 0.4 would mean $32. The company is going to ride the console hype and likely trigger more than a few margin calls along the way. Everything management has been doing is to ride the new cycle into a fluid ecommerce business model, and everything I'm seeing suggests its going to work. \n\n[Tl;dr](https://i.redd.it/bxn2mf4bzoj41.jpg)\n\n10c 9/25 to play XBOX prerelease\n\n10c 10/2 to play Mobile App/Stimulus \n\n10c 11/20 to play Console Release Date\n\n10c 4/16 to play Holiday Earnings/short squeeze\n\n***most text references are from GameStop's Q2 transcript which you can find [here.](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/09/10/gamestop-gme-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone.  I'm a mechanical engineering student with a hobby interest in finance.  I've spent the last few days figuring out if Nikola's leasing model is actually possible.  There's some really wacky stuff going on in Nikola's presentations and financial projections, and I wanted to share my findings.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is an absolute wall of words, and I wouldn't be offended if you didn't want to read it all.

Next there is a portion where I look at the discrepancies between their Financial Projections and their Lease breakdown.   Then a quick little peanut gallery where I look at their unrealistic assumptions and the hypocrisy of their comparisons.  Finally, a more serious portion where I discuss the design, efficiency, and utility implications of Nikola's chosen power output and battery capacity.

Nikola claims they can do this for $2.47/kg.  I highly doubt their estimate, and will elaborate on that later.  Hydrogen has a specific energy 33.3 kWh/kg.  A Fuel cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) has an average thermal efficiency of 55%.  A diesel semi tractor, which easily compares to Nikola\u2019s offerings, consumes about 1.25 kWh of work per km (or 2.125 per mile) of useful work loaded.  \n\nThis implies the Nikola truck will use 3.86 kWh of hydrogen per mile, at a cost of $0.59 per mile, or $.29 using their estimates.  The DoE estimate could be pretty rosy as well, Hindenburg cited a practical price of $16 per kg for hydrogen in their report.  Nikola\u2019s estimate in the leasing breakdown is 7.5 miles per kg of hydrogen @ $2.47 per kg.  That works out to $.33/mile.  Our estimates are pretty close, excluding hydrogen costs.  It looks like, in a surprising twist, they actually overestimated the energy consumption of a tractor.  Or maybe not.  We\u2019ll get to that  \n\nICCT Tractor-Trailer Fuel Consumption:  https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/EU\\_HDV\\_Testing\\_BriefingPaper\\_20180515a.pdf\n\nWhy do I doubt their hydrogen cost estimates?  $2.5 per kg implies $.075 per kWh of hydrogen produced  The average price for Industrial electricity in Arizona, the state they are headquartered in, was $.068/kWh, some of the cheapest in the US.  Of course, there isn\u2019t a 1:1 conversion of electricity to hydrogen: an electrolyzer uses about 50 kWh per kg of hydrogen ( specific energy of 33.3kWh/kg), making the electricity expense alone in excess of $.10 per kWh of hydrogen.  Electricity must also be used to compress the hydrogen.  This would take another \\~4 kWh, though we\u2019re already over budget.  God forbid they use California electricity at an average cost of $.15 per kWh.  The electricity expense for the Electrolyzers alone exceeds their estimates, much less depreciation expense, cost of capital, maintenance expense, salary expense, etc.  Clearly a bogus number.  \n\nI suppose they can use renewable excess during off-hours for cheap, but the rapidly decreasing costs of energy storage will likely level out those low prices rather quickly.  This also only works in Arizona and a select few other states; California not included.  There is the issue of a startup paying to build huge electrolyzers that might have a utilization factor of \\~30%, and additional high pressure storage will be needed.  The abhorrent upfront capex needed to try and drive down operating costs is not viable for them.      \n\nEIA electricity prices nationwide:  [https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm\\_table\\_grapher.php?t=epmt\\_5\\_3](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_3)\n\nNREL H2 cost analysis from 2011.  This is just about the most recent research I can find.  The abject lack of new material tells me it\u2019s not exactly a hoppin\u2019 field:  [https://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/production-cost-analysis.html#fn3](https://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/production-cost-analysis.html#fn3)\n\n**Fuel Cell costs:**\n\nPart of the reason there are currently so few FCVs on the road today is the limited service life of a fuel cell.  Fuel cells are precision manufactured components that degrade quickly when jostled &amp; vibrated too violently.  This is not good when combined with the rock-hard suspensions of semi tractors.     \n\nThe DoE targets a useful life of 150,000 miles for a fuel cell.  Currently, there is no information confirming this target has been met.  A Toyota Murai comes with a 100,000 mile warranty on its FC.  For the sake of argument, I will assume Nikola FCs can meet this target.  The DoE targets a cost of $40/kW for fuel cell production in 2020, provided mass hits 500,000.  This hasn\u2019t happened yet, but I will again assume this to give Nikola the best chance.  As an aside:  Nikola\u2019s decision to use exclusively GM FC technology in their Badger pickup indicates to me they have nothing \u201cup their sleeve\u201d to make the technology more viable, despite my optimistic assumptions.\n\nI\u2019ll assume the Nikola Two\u2019s Fuel cell is 500 kW, less than the 750 kW claimed output.  I think it  likely their horsepower claim will be a peak power figure only achievable when the motors draw on the battery &amp; FC.  I cannot confirm this, because Nikola does not list the output of their motors and FC separately (along with myriad other questionable, or lack of, claims).  I think this is reasonable, considering FC thermal efficiency is maximized between 20% and 30% load, and a semi will average \\~90 kW of useful work required on the highway, translating to \\~170 kW of FC usage.  This is near the peak efficiency band of a PEMFC.  This assumption also allows steady-state operation at 66% of the \u201crated\u201d output.  This implies an upfront cost of $20,000.  A targeted useful life of 150,000 miles implies a depreciation expense of $.13 per mile.  \n\nNREL Stack Durability and Performance vs load chart:  [https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy19osti/73011.pdf](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy19osti/73011.pdf)\n\n**Battery costs:**\n\nUsing BNEF 2023 battery cost estimates of $100/kWh, that equates to $25,000 of battery expense.  Assuming a useful life of .25M miles, more than any existing warranty currently covers, that results in a depreciation expense of $.125 per mile.  \n\n**Chassis and the rest:**  \n\nLastly, I extrapolated an FCEV COGS of $175,000 per truck from their Financial projections, minus the $45,000 of equipment already listed, and a 15% scrap value I pulled out of my ass to try and help nikola here, leaves $104,000 depreciated over 700k miles, or a $.15 depreciation expense per mile.\n\n**Maintenance costs:**\n\nNikola assumed a $.061/mile maintenance cost.  Any engineer should be able to see such a claim and immediately question it.  Tires alone should account for $.03 per mile.  That leaves\u2026. $.031 for brakes, air lines, HVAC, wiring, electrical equipment, motors, inverters, those battery and FC expenses I already calculated, sensors, etc.  They make no additional provisions for the battery/FC in their leasing breakdown.  Pure, unadulterated bullshit.   The ICCT puts BEV per mile maintenance at \\~$.19/mile.  How they squeezed 70% of those costs out, as an unproven startup, by going for a more complex FC-BEV hybrid is beyond me.  \n\nCost of trucking:  [https://www.thetruckersreport.com/infographics/cost-of-trucking/](https://www.thetruckersreport.com/infographics/cost-of-trucking/)\n\nNikola Leasing cost breakdown, p19:  [https://d32st474bx6q5f.cloudfront.net/nikolamotor/uploads/investor/presentation/presentation\\_file/5/NikolaInvestorRoadShowPresentation042720.pdf](https://d32st474bx6q5f.cloudfront.net/nikolamotor/uploads/investor/presentation/presentation_file/5/NikolaInvestorRoadShowPresentation042720.pdf)\n\n**Leasing Conclusions:** \n\nAdding their laughably low per mile maintenance expense of .061 + .15 + .125 + .13 +.59  gives us an aggregate $1.06 per mile expense for Nikola.  Using their fuel expense estimate of $.29, this equates to $.76; still more than their projected gross expenses.  The first estimate is 50% over they need for their claimed 30% gross margin at $.95 per mile.  Note:  I used a projected battery expense, projected FC service life target, and projected FC production expense.  None of these have been met.  I used the average resitive forces acting on a US tractor-trailer, which appear to be lower than the number Nikola uses.  I did not include warranty expenses in my estimate.  Additionally, these are EXPENSES, and includes 0 profit for the suppliers of these parts.  The GM-Nikola deal clearly shows there will be little vertical integration in their production, and such allowances would have to be made. \n\nA more reasonable estimate, including a still optimistic 3% interest expense for truck capex, a .4% annual warranty expense (corresponding to their presented 3% estimated reserve).  That reserve, btw, is very optimistic:  Tesla used a higher reserve on the S for years, while building a simpler product with a warranty length/distance a literal order of magnitude lower than the Nikola truck.  A \\*STILL\\* low maintenance expense of $.12, and a 10% margin for battery &amp; FC production, we end up with an **$.92** per mile expense, or more than Nikola can afford, even when using their untenable $2.5 per kg hydrogen estimate.  This is before G&amp;A expenses.  Their leasing business model is not possible.  \n\n**Lease Projections v. Income Projections:  Internal Chaos or Outright Fraud?**\n\nIt\u2019s possible some of the folks at Nikola have already found those problems out, though.  Nikola says they have plans to Lease their trucks.  They\u2019ve had presentation slides including the idea, and their truck descriptions on their website include a leasing plan.  In their most recent presentation at the DB Global Auto Industry Conference in June, however, the Leasing cost breakdown slide was conspicuously missing.  Their Financial projections slide showed 2,000 FCEV trucks being produced in 2023, and 470 million in revenue from FCEV sales.  This represents $235,000 per truck, and their FCEV revenue scales exactly linearly into their 2024 projected sales; no room for residual from the 2023 trucks.  **They\u2019re projecting to sell them!**  Revenue from maintenance and Hydrogen sales are also listed separately.  Their Financial projections clearly show the upfront sale of trucks with additional Hydrogen fueling and maintenance revenue, and the leasing model slide has disappeared.  It\u2019s easy to see why.  Their projected combined expenses and capex exceeds $7.5 billion through 2024, significantly more than their current $1 Billion in assets and a couple of lease payments would allow for.  This would take some intense share dilution (not something I think Trevor would be on board with) or extremely expensive leverage.  \n\nIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to get cheap loans secured against their proprietary trucks, requiring their proprietary stations, to run only their customers\u2019 preset routes.  A bank wouldn\u2019t want that kind of collateral.  The leasing idea is a real mess.\n\nNikla DB presentation, projections are 2nd to last page:  [https://d32st474bx6q5f.cloudfront.net/nikolamotor/uploads/investor/presentation/presentation\\_file/7/Nikola\\_and\\_VectoIQ\\_Conference\\_Presentation\\_DB\\_Global\\_Auto\\_Conference\\_\\_6.10.2020\\_.pdf](https://d32st474bx6q5f.cloudfront.net/nikolamotor/uploads/investor/presentation/presentation_file/7/Nikola_and_VectoIQ_Conference_Presentation_DB_Global_Auto_Conference__6.10.2020_.pdf)\n\nOne can claim that the lease model is still in the description of the trucks, but so are battery and fuel cell specifications for the Nikola one.  The Nikola one was, ostensibly, never actually powered by hydrogen, and development has since been abandoned.  It looks like their leasing Idea may have been abandoned as well.         \n\nI\u2019ll also point out that an expected 2024 FCEV maintenance revenue of 56 million on 7000 trucks sold, assuming an average of 50,000 miles per truck sold in 2024 (the average mileage if the trucks are sold at a constant rate through the FY) and 100,000 per truck in 2023, equates to 12.4 cents per mile, more than double the $.061 projected maintenance costs in the april lease presentation.  Either they plan on making a killing from maintenance, or there was some aggressive re-shuffling of numbers when maintenance went from an expense to revenue stream, or vice versa.\n\nThe same analysis of hydrogen expenses puts their per kg revenue at $4.08.  Still low, but a hefty sum above their $2.47 cost average on the leasing slide.  \n\nIf we use their projected FCEV maintenance revenue of $.124, $4.08 per kg H2 revenue, and $235,000 truck price depreciated over 7 years w/no interest expense, **the cost of ownership, according to their income projections, is $1 per mile** for a 100,000 mile year.  **More than they say a diesel will cost**.  OOPS!\n\nThat\u2019s most of what I wanted to talk about.  It\u2019s pretty clear that Nikola cannot possibly make a profit with their lease model, and Nikola\u2019s finance department has indirectly acknowledged this.  Hydrogen tech is still many, many years away.  Nikola\u2019s move fast and break things approach (though I\u2019m not convinced we\u2019ve seen much moving outside of gravity assists) will end up a \u201cmove fast and bankrupt things\u201d strategy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI now want to take a few moments to look at some of the sillier things I found in my research:  \n\nIn a laughably exuberant turn of events, Nikola projects 25% gross margins during their first year of production.  That\u2019s downright cute!  They plan on, ostensibly, slapping GM FCs &amp; batteries on IVECO platforms, and beating the margins of all publicly traded auto companies sans Ferrari within a few months of production start.  It's that easy.  Get your shit together, Ford! \n\nOn Nikola\u2019s website under their trucks, they have a comparison of FCs, BEVs, and Diesel where they seem to forget their trucks have hundreds of kWhs of battery storage onboard.  They claim \u201cHydrogen acts as a buffer and grid balance,\u201d while \u201cbatteries are a drain on the grid.\u201d  You heard it hear first, folks, batteries can\u2019t be used as a grid buffer, only a grid drain.  They also claim H2 is the \u201cmost abundant element on the planet,\u201d while \u201cBatteries \\[are\\] made of non-renewable resources; dangerous/costly to mine.\u201d  Makes me wonder why they chose to put so many on their trucks.  Also hilariously hypocritical, considering Platinum -required for PEMFCs- is one of the rarest metals on earth.\n\n**Design considerations and odd choices:**  \n\nI want to take a moment to talk about chassis design and the implications of Nikola\u2019s set power parameters.  And I want to start with a quote from Elon Musk during the Tesla Semi reveal:  \n\n\u201cWe designed the Tesla truck like a bullet,\u201d Musk said. \u201cA normal diesel truck is designed like a barn wall.\u201d The Tesla Semi is more aerodynamic than a $2 million Bugatti Chiron sports car, he said. \n\nA bold claim, but I believe this to be correct.  Cheesy, but correct.  Why?  Cooling requirements.  The more cooling air you need, the less favorable aerodynamics you\u2019ll have.  In the simple representation of an engine, there is a fuel input, a work output, and a heat output.  A gas engine  -especially one not designed with fuel efficiency in mind like the Chiron\u2019s- will likely only output \\~20-25% of its fuel input as a work output.  The Chiron makes 1,500 hp, and needs to reject 4,500-6,000 hp of heat at full throttle.  The goal of a Chiron isn\u2019t to slip through the air, au contraire.  It\u2019s designed suck in as much air as possible for cooling and brute it\u2019s way to 270 mph through raw horsepower.  Most modern sedans have more favorable aerodynamics than a Bugatti.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, about 90% of the inputs from an EV charger make it to the wheels -- a major factor that makes EVs so efficient.  This means Elon can put, for example, 1000 hp of motors in his truck and only worry about rejecting 100 hp of heat at full load, an easy task.  That\u2019s less cooling than a Prius needs, and the truck can be designed with virtually zero air input constraints.  He can swing his \u201c3x the acceleration\u201d dick around, and the only tradeoff is beefier driveline bits for the extra torque and bigger motors. \n\nC\\_D lists on wikipedia:  Note almost every production car below Cd=.24 is either a small displacement diesel or electric.  No supercars in sight.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile\\_drag\\_coefficient \n\nThe Chiron\u2019s standard Cd is .38.  A 1995 ford windstar minivan has a standard Cd of .35.  Not exactly a prestigious club, haha:  \n\nhttps://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/car-technology/a32329/these-rare-development-photos-tell-the-full-bugatti-chiron-story/\n\nHydrogen is a different story.  The thermal efficiency of a FCEV -above 50% load- will dip down into the 40-50% range.  The average efficiency of a diesel truck is \\~45%, and it will dip to \\~35% at max rpm, full load.  \u2018Ever seen the video where Trevor says the production trucks won\u2019t need as much cooling as their current prototypes?  He\u2019s lying through his teeth.  A 1000 hp FC would need more than 1000 hp of cooling; as much if not more than a 500hp diesel.  500 hp diesels are already built like a brick with a front aftercooler &amp; radiator the size of a football field.  Trevor\u2019s dick swinging has major consequences.  More cooling means more drag, more weight in heat sinks/radiators, and more power draw to move coolant.  These all create positive feedback loops, e.g. more air requirements mean less favorable aerodynamics &amp; more drag, which means more power draw at speed, which means more cooling, which means more air requirements...  It\u2019s not all fun and games like the pure BEV Tesla is making.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDaimler\u2019s recently announced H2 semi offering only has 300 kW, and they can recycle their waste heat to warm up incoming liquid hydrogen, Nikola uses compressed hydrogen and won\u2019t have the same luxury.  Running so much horsepower is a real head scratcher; one would think their head of R&amp;D\u2019s only experience was pouring concrete or something.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note US tractor-trailers are hard capped at 80,000 lbs.  This means that every pound of tractor weight is a pound taken from potential cargo.  Y\u2019know\u2026 the part that actually makes money.  One has to wonder why Nikola is keeping \\~5000 lbs of batteries on the tractor; their website showed they aren\u2019t fans of the stuff.  It\u2019s enough to run a loaded tractor two full hours on battery alone, more than a regenerative braking system would require or power peaking during a hill climb.  It\u2019s dumb; 100 kWh would be more than enough when an on-demand primemover like a hydrogen cell is also onboard.  It\u2019s an expensive and opulent display to the vexation of customers, who would, in all likelihood, much prefer an extra 2 tons of cargo capacity.                      \n\nFeatures like 1000 hp and 250 kWh of battery appeal more to retail investors than trucking companies.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nActual conclusion time:  I think that I pretty conclusively showed that: \n\n1. Nikola\u2019s hydrogen cost projections are bogus.  There isn\u2019t even enough money there to pay for the electrolysis and compression, much less maintenance, depreciation, or labor.\n2. Nikola\u2019s leasing costs undercutting diesel is bogus.  One can disprove that with their own financial projections, much less the real costs of FCs and H2 electrolysis.  \n3. Nikola\u2019s plan to lease the trucks is totally divorced from reality, according to their own financial projections.  \n4. Nikola\u2019s projected per mile operating &amp; maintenance expenses are beyond indefensible.\n5. A myriad of odd, marketing focused design choices limit the trucks on-road efficiency and utility to potential customers. \n\nIf you made it this far, congrats!",

        "selftext": "From my time in here I know that being wrong is one of the things that we do best, so I finally found out how to make money off of it. I first dipped my toes into options trading a few years ago. I had previously been swing trading stocks so I had a couple years of experience before that, but the leverage and potential returns that options provided really piqued my interest. After it was all said and done, I lost almost $20,000 buying options. After realizing that someone was getting all of this money I was losing, I learned about option selling and haven\u2019t looked back since.\n\nI recently posted my YTD performance [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/i0mkv3/10k_to_100k_in_5_months_23k_in_deposits_and_67k/), and received a lot of questions about how I did it. My strategy changed over time, but I first started with credit spreads, which may be applicable to more people since it\u2019s a strategy that works with smaller accounts too. I got a lot of questions about how I played credit spreads and it\u2019s tough to completely explain what I do through a comment here and a comment there so I created this guide explaining my exact approach to trading credit spreads. Here you go:\n\nThis is a wall of text, so if you're a more visual learner, here's a link to videos explaining all four parts:\n\n[Part One](https://youtu.be/J12HR1Ax2k0)\n\n[Part Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1mlknat5qA)\n\n[Part Three](https://youtu.be/Uu7_8856nZw)\n\n[Part Four](https://youtu.be/2p5nlczCcFo)\n\n#Part One: The Basics\n\nSo what is a spread? A high level conceptual explanation is that you\u2019re essentially betting on a stock to finish above or below a certain price upon expiration. One of the advantages here is that you can set this number out of the money, so if a stock is trading at $100, you can bet that it\u2019ll remain below $110 by a certain date. This is a bearish position, so if you\u2019re correct and it goes up, you\u2019ll make max profit. The catch though is that even if you\u2019re wrong, you basically have a 10% downward cushion before you start to lose any money. So the easiest way to describe it is a strategy that lets you make money if you\u2019re right, but also make money if you\u2019re slightly off.\n\nHow does it work? So in the above example, if we were bullish on a stock we would open what\u2019s called a put credit spread. We could set it up where we sell a 110c for a credit of $1.50, and buy a 115c for a debit of $0.50. This means that in this transaction we receive $1.50, and pay $0.50 for a net credit of $1. That credit is your max profit on the play. If you\u2019re familiar with options you\u2019ll know that if the stock finishes at or below $110 upon expiration, both of these calls will be worthless. That\u2019s great news for us because the long leg we bought (115c) for 0.50 will be a loss, but we\u2019ll get to keep the full $1.50 from the short leg (110c) that we sold, resulting in us realizing our max gain on the trade of $1.\n\nWhy not just sell the 110c and collect the full $1.50? While it cuts into our profits, the reason we buy the 115c in this example for $0.50 isn\u2019t to cut into our profits when we\u2019re correct, but rather protect us when we\u2019re wrong. If the stock in the example stays below $110, we\u2019re good to go and we\u2019ll hit max profit. But what if it goes to $120, $150, or something crazy happens and it hits $200. If the stock hits $150 upon expiration, that 110c that we sold for $1.50 will be worth $40, meaning that we\u2019ll incur a $3,875 loss in pursuit of a $150 gain. We\u2019ve seen crazy run ups from the likes of TSLA and ZM lately, and people who sold what we call \u201cnaked options\u201d got absolutely killed. With our spread, yes our 110c will be worth $40 meaning we\u2019re down $4,000 on that position, but the 115c we bought behind it will be worth $35 meaning we\u2019re up $3,500 there for a net loss of $500. Additionally, we get to keep that $1.00 credit we received up front no matter what, so our loss with this spread is actually $500-$100=$400 as opposed to the $3,875 loss that we would\u2019ve seen had we sold the 110c by itself. THAT is the value in selling a spread as opposed to a naked option.\n\nWhy are you multiplying everything by 100? Each options contract is worth 100 shares, so a contract that is trading for $1.50 actually costs $150 to purchase.\n\nAnother high level point I like to make is that there are really 5 different things that can happen when you make a play. Let\u2019s say you think a stock will go up. It can (1) go up a ton and you\u2019d be correct, (2) go up a little and you\u2019d be correct, (3) trade flat and you\u2019d be incorrect, (4), go down a little and you\u2019d be incorrect, or (5) go down a lot and you\u2019d be incorrect. With a bullish spread, you\u2019d hit max profit on 4/5 , or 80% of the possible outcomes, whereas if you bought stock or purchased an option you\u2019d only be profitable on (1) or (2). Obviously the actual outcomes are a little more complex, but for a base-level understanding of the advantages a spread provides, I think this is a good way to look at it.\n\nSo that\u2019s the value of a spread. A lot of traders are introduced to option selling and are scared of the prospect of incurring a huge loss like we mentioned above, but using credit spreads is a great way of receiving the benefits that selling has to offer while limiting a lot of the risks. So let\u2019s move onto actually opening a spread.\n\n#Part Two: Making the Trade\n\nSo for actually opening a spread up, we have a four-step approach we take: Pick a Stock Pick a Direction Pick a Strike Price Execute the Trade\n\n**1: Picking a Stock:**\n\nOne of the most important things I tell people is to trade what you know. I have a watchlist of 25-30 stocks that I watch and get familiar with during the day. That way if I recognize a good opportunity, I\u2019ll have a decent base of knowledge to rely on to make what I feel is a smart play. It\u2019s super easy to get caught up in the \u201cstock of the week\u201d and try to jump in on a play because a ticker is in the news. If you\u2019re not familiar with a stock, don\u2019t trade it.\n\nFor this example (the one used in the video), Wayfair was trading in a 195-210 range for a little bit and then had a big day where it broke up out of that range and up towards $220. This was an unusual move that I noticed since it was on my watchlist, so I decided to make a play.\n\nSTOCK: WAYFAIR\n\n**2: Picking a direction:**\n\nSo if we look at Wayfair\u2019s YTD chart, it has exploded this year. A clear upward trend, but a recent trend that I noticed from following the stock was that every time it broke out like this, there would be a little bit of a pullback afterwards. Additionally, I felt the stock was overvalued on a fundamental basis (had a negative book value at the time of the trade) so I wanted to play this stock back down. This is probably the quickest and easiest step of the four, since you\u2019ll likely already have an opinion on most of the stocks that you follow.\n\nDIRECTION: DOWN\n\n**3:Picking a Strike Price:**\n\nSo we know that we\u2019re going to be playing Wayfair back down, but now the question is what spread are we going to set up to do that. In this example Wayfair was trading at $218.42 at the time that we decided to make this trade. In the video we illustrate a trading channel that Wayfair was at the top of. It was also approaching the ATH of $221.54. A lot of the time that will act as resistance for a stock, meaning it\u2019ll bounce down off of it. So in order to give ourselves a bit of a cushion we decided to set our short leg at 222.50, meaning that we\u2019re playing the stock to stay below $222.50 by the end of that week.\n\nSo with this play it means in plain English that if we\u2019re correct and the stock goes down, we hit max profit. But if we\u2019re wrong and it goes up, we still have a $4.08 cushion before we\u2019re not hitting max profit anymore. So we could be a little wrong, have the stock go up a few dollars, and still walk away with max profit.\n\nSTRIKE PRICE OF SHORT LEG: $222.50\n\n**4: Executing the Trade:**\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to tell you that when I started trading spreads I didn\u2019t realize you could open both legs of the spread at was. I was stupid. I would like to think I\u2019m at least a little bit smarter now. If you look at the options screen for most brokers, you\u2019ll just see single legs. Switching over to \u201cvertical\u201d allows you to set up the entire spread in one trade. If you use something like RH, there\u2019s a feature that allows you to select multiple options, so you\u2019ll select the one you wish to sell (short leg) and the one you wish to buy (long leg).\n\nIn this example we selected the 222.5/225c spread, meaning that we sold the short leg of 222.5 and the long leg of 227.5. The net credit was 1.45, which is our max gain on the trade. A wider spread gives a larger credit but also increases max loss. This is a $5 wide spread but we could have made it a tighter spread with a $2.5 width. Typically the best risk to reward ratio is on the tightest spreads, but a slightly wider spread will raise your breakeven price and studies have shown that it actually results in better expected value long term.\n\nCircling back to the credit we received of $1.45, this means that our max profit was $145 and our max loss was $355 for each spread that we sold. We know that because our broker tells us that, but a quick way to calculate it is the width of the spread minus the credit. A $1.45 credit on $5 wide spread means a $5-$1.45=$3.55 max loss.\n\nWhen I evaluate trades like this I look for a max profit to max loss ratio of 1:2 to 1:4. Based on different scanners I\u2019ve seen, the best expected values tend to fall on spreads within that risk/reward ratio. The ratio on this trade is 1:2.44.\n\nSo we put our order in for a credit of $1.45, it filled, and now we get to sit back and watch. Sometimes your order won\u2019t fill right away. In fact, most of the time it won\u2019t fill right away. It\u2019s important to be patient with your fill price and not chase it downwards. We want the highest credit possible. So if the credit on these spreads dropped to 1.30 when I was trying to place an order, it usually isn\u2019t a great idea to drop my order price down to 1.30 just to get a fill. The only time I would recommend that is if you\u2019re trying to open a spread right before the market closes. Otherwise, hang tight. Patience pays.\n\n#Part 3: Managing the Trade\n\nSo now that we\u2019ve made the trade, it\u2019s time to manage it. In my opinion one of the best parts about trading spreads is that they don\u2019t require active management. You get to sit back and watch the price. Once the trade has been opened, which is also quick, it takes very little effort.\n\nSo with the Wayfair example we used, our analysis turned out perfectly, as Wayfair touched the ATH and dipped back down to end the week safely at $214. We hit max profit on that trade, but what if the trade goes against us? That\u2019s what we\u2019ll take a look at in this section.\n\nOne thing we didn\u2019t address in part two is when to open the trade. We like opening spreads on Mondays and Tuesdays, and monitoring them during the week. This is the part of my strategy that is a little bit controversial, as there is a (legitimate) school of thought that selling spreads about 45 DTE is better value. I like that idea and if you would rather do that then absolutely go for it. It\u2019s important to trade what you\u2019re comfortable with. All of the lessons in here still apply to that strategy. With that said though, I stick with the weekly strategy of opening them at the beginning of the week and look to close them throughout the week.\n\nThe way I see it, your % of max profit should be the metric you\u2019re looking at when deciding what to do with a spread. Divided up equally, that means if you progressed through the week to max profit in a linear fashion, you would be at 20% of max profit on Monday, 40% on Tuesday, and so forth. A good rule of thumb I use is that if you\u2019re ever on the fence about whether or not to close something out, do so if your return exceeds the linear return for that day of the week. The market can move quickly and I\u2019ve had several times where I have regretted not closing a spread out. It\u2019s important to take profit.\n\nAnother thing I\u2019ll add to this is that this weekly strategy gets a little risky on Thursday afternoon headed into Friday. If your spread is remotely close to being in the money on Thursday afternoon, close it out. Now that I type that out I realize that may all sound a little convoluted, but it\u2019s better visualized in the video I\u2019ve linked for this section.\n\nNow let's get into what happens if a trade really starts to move against you. With the strategy we use there are really two options: (1) Close the trade for a loss and move on, or (2) Roll the strikes higher.\n\nThe first option is pretty self explanatory, but a quick note I want to add here is that you can have a stock move way against you but still be able to close the trade for less than max loss. The example I use in my video is I played FB earnings, thought it would go down, but it shot way above my spread and well into max loss territory. We opened a 245/247.5c spread for a credit of $0.54. FB was reporting earnings on a Thursday night and we sold this spread that expired the following day, so there wasn\u2019t a ton of time to manage it. Long story short, FB killed earnings and shot up to $256 that morning. Really not a prayer that it would come back down to the spread I opened by the end of the day. But despite the fact that this trade went way against us and we had almost no time to manage it since it was a Friday play, we were still able to close out for a debit of $1.90. Yes that\u2019s a loss of $1.36 per spread, but we SAVED an additional $0.60 cent loss by avoiding a max loss debit of $2.50. That\u2019s another benefit of spreads.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about option two. This is the best option to use if you\u2019re confident that you\u2019re correct about the ultimate price action on a stock, but you need a little extra wiggle room on the trade. For this example we\u2019ll look at a TSLA call spread that I opened. TSLA was trading at $1542 after an incredible run, so I figured I would play it below 1600 with a 1600/1610c spread that offered a credit of $2.52. As is the theme with this section, TSLA exploded the following morning (Tuesday) and went all the way up to $1794 at one point. My spread was literally almost $200 out of the money. One of the biggest possible moves against myself that I had ever seen. Despite this crazy move, it was only Tuesday and we were able to close the first spread for a debit of only $5.25 (as opposed to a $10 max debit). We opened 6 of these off the bat so this was a loss of $1638. From there we \u201crolled\u201d our strikes higher, opening 10 1750/1760c spreads for a credit of $3.45. So the closing and subsequent opening of a spread like we did here is what we are referring to when we say we \u201crolled the strikes higher\u201d.\n\nBy the end of the week TSLA had finally crashed a bit and it finished at $1506. This meant the second of spreads we opened were easily max profit. And while we lost $1,638 on the first set of spreads we opened here, we profited $3,450 on the second set of spreads so we were able to still finish the week with a $1,812 profit on TSLA. The funny thing with this one is that the original spread would have hit max profit since it dropped all the way back down to 1500, but we would have had the same result had TSLA finished anywhere below 1750.\n\nRolling the strikes higher gave me extra breathing room and turned a potential disaster into a profitable trade. One thing I\u2019ll add though is that with this method you do run the risk of increasing your potential max loss. Because of that, I\u2019ll only roll my strikes higher ONCE. Anything past that is chasing a losing trade. If I roll my strikes higher and it\u2019s still going against me, I\u2019m at the point where I need to accept the fact that I don\u2019t fundamentally understand a stock as well as I thought I did and move on. There is always another trade out there.\n\nThe final point I\u2019ll add to this is ALWAYS CLOSE OUT YOUR SPREADS. The only time I\u2019ll let a spread expire worthless is if my spread is OTM by a crazy amount and it would quite literally take a historic after-hours move on Friday to take me back ITM. Other than that, close your spreads out. Even if it\u2019s just for a $0.05 debit. It may seem annoying but I\u2019ll tell you why in the following section.\n\n#Part 4: Additional Risks and Considerations\n\nI will start this section by saying I\u2019ve never been impacted by any of the following risks, but it\u2019s important to be aware of 100% of the possible outcomes of your trade before you enter it. They\u2019re infrequent but this really wouldn\u2019t be a comprehensive guide if I omitted them. They are as follows: (1) Early Assignment, (2) Dividend Risk, (3) Pin Risk.\n\n**1: Early Assignment:**\n\nThe best way to start this section is by talking about why your max loss is actually your max loss. We know it\u2019s quickly calculated as the width of your spread minus the credit, but why is that?\n\nLet\u2019s use a 110/115c spread as an example. We\u2019ll say we received a credit of $1. We know that if the stock finishes anywhere below 110 then both legs are worthless and we\u2019ll hold onto that $1 credit. But what happens if we\u2019re in a max loss position. Let\u2019s say the stock finishes at $120.\n\nIn this situation the short leg (110c) we sold would be worth $10 (120-110), meaning that we would owe $1,000 on that position. The long leg we bought would be worth $5 (120-115), meaning we are holding a position worth $500. The net effect is a $500 loss, but remember that\u2019s netted against the $100 credit you received, so it\u2019s a max loss of $400. That math checks out as the width of the spread is $5, the credit is $1, so the max loss is 5-1=$4*100=$400.\n\nSo that\u2019s how it works upon expiration. But lets say this position moved against you, you still have a few days until expiration, but the stock is at $120. Since there are a few days left, you probably could close the contract for a debit of $3.50 rather than the max loss debit of $5. However, since your short leg is ITM the person you sold the option to may choose to exercise their option. As a result, that would require you to take on a short position of $110*100=$11,000 per contract sold. You may not be able to afford to cover that, or your broker may not let you hold that position. So what happens is your long leg gets exercised as well resulting in you taking a max loss early. So while on paper you received a credit of $1 that could have been closed for a debit of $3.50 and your loss was only $2.50, early assignment results in you prematurely taking a max loss.\n\nWhen does this happen? It typically doesn\u2019t, since it requires the buyer sacrificing the remaining extrinsic value on the option, but it\u2019s more likely with certain stocks. There are three different classifications of a stock that relate to it\u2019s borrowing ability: Easy to Borrow (ETB), Hard to Borrow (HTB), and Not Available to Borrow (NTB). The harder a stock is to borrow, the more likely it is that a call is exercised early because it gives the buyer a way to acquire a stock which may not be available to them through their broker. So if you\u2019re selling call spreads that are close to being ITM, make sure to check out the borrowing status of the stock.\n\n**2: Dividend Risk:**\n\nThis risk relates to the first one discussed, as it\u2019s just another way you risk early assignment. If a company is announcing a dividend, there will be something known as an \u201cex-div\u201d date, which means that all shareholders as of that date are entitled to receive the divident, which will be distributed usually at a later date. Because of this, call buyers may exercise an out of the money call option in an effort to acquire those shares.\n\nRemembering that exercising an option means that you sacrifice all remaining extrinsic value, another reason a buyer may exercise a call option before an ex-dividend date is that the value of the dividend announced is greater than the extrinsic value remaining in the option. Say a 100c is trading at $2 and the underlying (stock) is currently at 101. The extrinsic value is the value of the option in excess of what it would be worth upon expiration. So the extrinsic value in this situation is $1, since the 100c trading for $2 is just $1 in excess of the current strike price. If the company in question here announced a $2 dividend, an option buyer would likely exercise their call option because the $2 dividend is greater than the $1 of extrinsic value.\n\n**3: Pin Risk:**\n\nWe know that if your spread finishes out of the money it\u2019s a max gain and if both legs of your spread finish in the money it\u2019s a max loss. But what happens when the price of a stock finishes between the two legs of your spread? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nSo using a 100/110c spread as an example, let\u2019s say that the stock finishes at 105. Your long leg, which is there to protect you, is worthless so you wouldn\u2019t exercise it. However the short leg at 100 that you sold will be exercised by the buyer since it\u2019s ITM. As a result, you\u2019re now short 100 shares at a price of 100 and you\u2019ll be holding that position over the weekend. This can go both ways from here, but since we\u2019re focused on risk let\u2019s say that this stock you\u2019re now short shoots up over the weekend and some sort of news/event brings it up to $120.\n\nWith this short position of 100 shares at $100 you\u2019re borrowing $10,000 worth of stock. Now that the stock is worth $120 this position is now worth $12,000. Over the weekend you\u2019ve sustained a $2,000 loss. If we received a credit of $3 when we opened this spread, we may have thought that our max loss was 10-3=$7*100=$700. Since we failed to close the spread out, this position has now resulted in a $2,000 loss net of the $300 credit that you received when you opened the position. So on a trade where you thought you could lose at most $700, you\u2019re now down almost $2k.\n\nI can\u2019t repeat it enough, but THIS IS WHY WE CLOSE OUT SPREADS BEFORE EXPIRATION. That is the single most important takeaway I can give you here. Spreads are great since they\u2019re defined risk and defined gain. When you\u2019re buying options you have a defined loss but a potentially infinite gain. This can make it really easy to get greedy and I\u2019ve seen countless traders lose big profits because they keep holding out for more. When you have a defined gain and defined loss it makes it easier to make smart decisions, take profits, and continuously build on those profits over time.\n\nThat was an enormous wall of text but I hope it helps explain, from a base level, what spreads are and how they work. Switching from buying options to selling options has dramatically changed my performance in the market so I hope sharing this can do the same for someone else. If you have any questions let me know and I\u2019d be happy to answer them.",

This correction is ***the last stop before this rocket heads to mars.***  What's that?  You've heard this song before?  Nah... not like this.  Let me show you.\n\nSo the selloff first started when TSLA announced a 5B$ Capitol Raise.  They about to dump shares to raise money.  Makes sense right?

Nah, Papa Elon is one of us.  He just filed BDE paper work that says \"You'll sell when TSLA wants, if TSLA wants, at the price TSLA wants\".  Now to be fair, TSLA absolutely will make good on this.  It's no secret at this point that the money will ensure their balance sheet/cash flow/fundamentals are squeaky clean ahead of SP inclusion, which is inevitable now that [salesforce just kicked Exxon out of the DOW](https://borneobulletin.com.bn/2020/08/reshuffling-the-dow-exxon-out-salesforce-in/).  Elon wants to see the SEC cry.\n\nBut what about other investors?  The selloff turned ugly when Wednesday morning, it was announced that a massive investor dumped their position.  I guess they wanted to take profits like TSLA right?\n\n[Nope, they sold because TSLA was literally too good](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/02/teslas-largest-outside-shareholder-reduces-holding-citing-portfolio-restrictions.html)\n\nTSLA shot up so fast that this firm was forced to reduce its position because TSLA became an \"outsized influence on the firm's holdings\".  In plain english: TSLA was doing better than the entire rest of the portfolio and it freaked out the risk team at the firm.  Bless their boomer hearts.  The firm still plans to hold as much TSLA as they possibly can which is about as bullish as you can get.\n\nBut this is where it gets juicy.  I think many of you autists know that the Market loves to fuck you.  And their ain't no better way to fuck than doggy.\n\nThat's why she loves making you look at something shiny on CNBC when the real shit is about to bend you over from behind.\n\nWell this idiot turned around and you know what I saw?\n\n[The Lucid Air](https://electrek.co/2020/09/02/lucid-air-beats-tesla-model-s-9-second-quarter-mile/)  \nWith its  [record setting battery range](https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/the-all-electric-lucid-air-gets-an-estimated-epa-range-of-517-miles/) of 517 miles.  \nDebuting on [September 9th](https://www.lucidmotors.com/stories/lucid-air-production-reveal)\n\nThis retard firmly believes MM's are dumping because they think when the Air is revealed, it will confirm the record shattering 517 mile range estimate and that will totally deflate TSLA.  Battery day will be playing catchup and the entire idea that Elon has this massive head start will go right out the window.\n\nAnd that would warrant a massive correction.  Here is the Catch.\n\nThe 517 Mile Range is [Not Confirmed by the EPA themselves](https://insideevs.com/reviews/438723/lucid-air-tesla-model-s-porsche-taycan-range/).  The Estimate comes from 3rd party testing.\n\nAnd when Porsche got a Third Party to give them an EPA estimate for the Taycan, [they overshot it by 40%](https://amcitesting.com/taycan/).\n\nSo in summary: I believe the correction is happening because investors think the Lucid Air is going to come out and totally wipe away Elon's \"it\" factor when some no-name startup overtakes them in battery tech.  I believe they are wrong and when the real EPA gives the Air a range around 300 miles, there is going to be a mad dash back to TSLA ahead of Battery day... and then its Q3 Earnings, SP Inclusion, Cyber Truck and Semi Sales beginning, potential of a TSLA Plane, and oh look when did TSLA go back to 2000?\n\nAlso Lucid is owned by [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_Motors).

This behavior is  common during market recoveries throughout history. The increase in  darkpool buying supports the idea that we are either at the bottom of  this dip, or nearing it, based on historical DIX numbers during pull  backs and corrections.

This will cover two primary subjects, number one, Intel VS AMD and their competitive advantages, including nodes, partnerships and foundries along with how I expect things to play out over the next few years.\n\n**Intel VS AMD**\n\n*The following documents Intel\u2019s most recent launch and the potential inconsistencies I found, please be aware that the reviewers are not at fault and should not be blamed for anything that is potentially foul play.*\n\n***Cascade Lake and a story of deception***\n\n[Intel 10900k](https://preview.redd.it/t9l7el4iudo51.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66b0fa720fcf9d783c5092a42a8ce8207d15d895)\n\nThe x86 CPU space has two companies currently competing in it. One is the master and one is subservient, but what happens when these roles get reversed and the master becomes the underdog? \n\nThe fight gets dirty.\n\nEver since the launch of the Zen architecture, AMD has been slowly gnawing away at Intel\u2019s market share, Zen 1 brought them back into the discussion, Zen+ consolidated their position and Zen 2 brought the fight to Intel\u2019s crown jewels. Intel in the years since Zen launched floundered with 10nm, and now 7nm while TSMC slowly ran away with their lead in manufacturing all the while AMD continued to innovate. This left Intel with two choices, buckle down and try to work the problem, or fight dirty. They chose the latter.\n\nIn 2018, well before Zen 2 launched, AdoredTV investigated Intel and their relation with reviewers and found that Intel was most likely seeding the tech press with golden samples. The scale of this was astonishing, almost all sites that he investigated had received exceptional samples. \n\nThis was in 2018, when Intel was still firmly in the lead when compared to AMD\u2019s Zen+ architecture. What about now? When AMD is on par or firmly in the lead with Zen 2?\n\nInspired by Adored\u2019s Conlake video, I chose to look into any potential foul play with their newest 10900k launch.\n\n***Methodology***\n\nIn order to ensure that Intel was fairly portrayed, I looked into as many publications that I could who published their all core overclocks along with their voltages set in the bios. All in all I found 17 publications that fulfilled the criteria.\n\nAfter I had collected the necessary data, I reached out to Silicon Lottery to ask about higher bins than what they published, that being 5.2 GHz, and 5.3 GHz.\n\nThey kindly responded to me and provided this information:\n\n*\u201cI can tell you that 1) we do not publish statistics until we reach a sample size of at least 100,*\n\n*and 2) there are a few 10900K that can fall within our theoretical 5.2GHz bin (we're talking about top \\~1% here), but a 5.3GHz bin is not possible for a 10900K under our tests.\u201d*\n\nFrom this statement we can safely assume that their theoretical 5.2 GHz bin would use 1.4 volts as each 100 MHz bump is matched by an increase of 0.025 volts, with their highest binned parts reaching 5.1 GHz at 1.375 volts.\n\nWith that out of the way let\u2019s move onto my findings.\n\n***Findings***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qlan4vkrtdo51.png?width=577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d17d3f53fb045dc3af44d0fda3e2ac85f01caa9\n\n*\\*Power draw from the wall was about equivalent to that of Guru3D, implying a voltage of 1.4 volts.*\n\n*\\*\\*JayzTwoCents did not mention the voltage used, but I felt it was important to mention him as his result was completely out of line when compared to other sites.*\n\nThe first important note that should be made is that for some of the sites, they started with a voltage of 1.35 and applied a multiplier without doing any further tuning, meaning some of these publications could have achieved a better overclocking result. Secondly, because of the nature of some reviews, I could not get as many sources as I originally intended, but 17 should suffice for our needs.\n\nWith that out of the way, we can look at a few numbers, the average clock speed achieved and the average voltage necestated.\n\n**Average all core overclock:**\n\n*5.164 GHz*\n\n**Average Voltage:**\n\n*1.341 Volts*\n\nAnd we can also determine the mean all core overclock and voltage, which will be important to ensure the results are not skewed by aberrant values such as with JayzTwoCents and Overclock 3D.\n\n**Mean all core overclock**\n\n*5.1 GHz*\n\n**Mean Voltage:**\n\n*1.332 Volts*\n\nAs we can see, both the average and the mean samples would be considered Golden samples by Silicon lottery, who have had less than 100 samples achieve similar results. It is clear that something is a little fishy here, so let\u2019s take a deeper look into the results.\n\nStarting with Guru3D, the first result that completely blew me away, 5.2 all core overclock with only 1.35 volts applied. When compared to Silicon Lottery of less than 1% of samples reaching 5.2 GHz under their testing with the assumed 1.4 volts. Even if we are generous and add an extra 0.025 volts to ensure long term stability, Guru3D\u2019s review sample far exceeds the theoretical requirements for a 5.2 GHz, golden sample bin. \n\nMoving onto the next stand out, Overclocker 3D, we see an absolutely astonishing result, 5.4 GHz with a voltage of 1.402. Silicon Lottery stated that they do not believe it is possible for a 10900k to reach 5.3 GHz all core, let alone 5.4 GHz. This sample is definitively a golden sample, in all likelihood, Silicon Lottery has never seen a part that can perform this well despite testing hundreds of chips. \n\nAll other chips are excellent samples as well, with the vast majority of them landing in golden sample territory or at worse, good samples.\n\nThat being said, there is one outlier, JayzTwoCents. I am not entirely sure what happened here, it is the only chip that did not make 5.0 GHz, and is the only chip that would not be considered a good bin. Perhaps some wires got crossed or he was sent a retail unit by accident.\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nMake of this what you will, but I feel that this is a clear demonstration that Intel is again seeding press with golden samples. This could have been done by them to quell the rumours that the 10900k would be a power hog or to potentially dull the edge of any potential reviews, but it is pretty clear that something is amiss. \n\nIt is also clear that Intel will continue to pull shenanigans until we call them out for it. I feel that the press should be a little more discerning or more skeptical of their results given what I have found and what Adored found in the past.\n\nFinally if you plan to buy an Intel product, please be aware that misleading information such as this is present and be aware of it.\n\n***Sources and Footnotes***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mse7izj9udo51.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd19e2f2deb5d2fa6f966e0026003e9dcce82bea\n\n**The future of Intel?**\n\nAs we can see, Intel is not shy about potentially deceiving press and consumers. That being said, I do not expect to see any legal consequences come of this as it is very difficult to ascertain if this did indeed happen.\n\nThat being said, the pain has just begun for Intel. The following will encompass a brief overview of some Intel products and the major issues they will be facing in the near future.\n\n***The death of a leading foundry***\n\nIn my last post, I said that Intel would not be highly competitive in 2022. While I admit, I was hoping to get the follow up post out much sooner, what I meant by this is Intel will not have 7nm until 2022 at the earliest. That being said, with Intel\u2019s most recent quarterly earnings, I have to readjust my personal road map for Intel, and I now believe they will be competitive again at earliest, 2023. There are a few reasons for this, and the following will be based upon leaks from Moore\u2019s Law is Dead, AdoredTV and RedGamingTech. All three have proven to be reliable sources, with Moore\u2019s Law is Dead predicting almost the exact performance of Intel Tiger Lake months in advance.\n\nCurrently, as we all are aware of, Intel is encountering massive difficulties with their 10nm and 7nm production. The issues are so prevalent that 10nm has been delayed for years, and 7nm will be delayed for just as long if not longer. Because of this they have been forced to delay product launches, back port architectures and increase power consumption massively to keep pace with AMD. \n\nThat being said, they cannot continue to increase power consumption in all sectors, for example, in note books, AMD recently launched their much anticipated Renoir APUs, which far exceed both press and my expectations. At the moment AMD\u2019s solutions are notably stronger in multithreaded tasks and graphics work loads when compared to Intel Cascade Lake and Intel Ice Lake. In fact, according to Hardware Unboxed, a reputable review channel, it is not uncommon to see AMD perform at twice the level as Intel when comparing low power solutions (15 watt TDP or lower). That being said, Intel Tiger Lake is a good improvement in terms of GPU performance, outclassing AMD by \\~20% in the 15 W form factor, while still being significantly weaker in multithreaded performance.\n\nThis shows that Intel absolutely needs 10nm yesterday, they cannot continue to increase power and lose efficiency, sooner or later they will find that even though their products consume twice the power, they are out classed in all aspects. That wall will be Zen 3.\n\n[AMD 3950x](https://preview.redd.it/a29o16umudo51.jpg?width=1344&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d12b43cb90019ef1bf776266e6b1234e7d38a99)\n\n***Zen 3***\n\nThis will be brief as not much has changed from my previous post, and I still fully expect AMD to take the gaming crown from Intel Cascade Lake. However, there are a few small updates that I must make. Intel Rocket Lake is expected to come out Q1 or Q2 of 2021, and it will have 8 cores at most. Though I am not sure why Intel would want to max their consumer platform at only 8 cores, and not maintain 10 cores, I suspect that 10 cores may consume too much power. However, it will have a 10-20% IPC bump, which *might* allow it to reclaim the gaming crown from Zen 3, though at the moment it could be a toss up depending on how well Zen 3 scales with frequency. \n\nFurthermore, I will clarify a few things: \n\n1. Zen 3 will have a unified cache, meaning that latency should be lower as packets do not have to cross over the infinity fabric.\n2. Zen 3\u2019s cores will have more access to L3 cache as it is unified, meaning it will have to access system memory less, thereby again improving latency.\n3. Zen 3 should have a small clock speed increase from an improved node, though I suspect it will be no more than 200 MHz\n4. Finally, Zen 3 should also have a higher f-clock, meaning it will have lower latency when accessing the system memory.\n\nAll in all, Zen 3 is a relatively iterative performance increase over Zen 2, with a 15-20% increase in single threaded performance being likely.\n\n***Big and Little cores Vs Zen 4***\n\nA few months ago, Moore\u2019s Law is Dead detailed Alder Lake and Sapphire Rapides; Intel\u2019s \u201cbig\u201d comeback. The following will be a summary of what he detailed, and I strongly recommend you watch his video to understand my reasoning to what will happen: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqErX7VkitI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqErX7VkitI)\n\nThe gist of it:\n\n1. Alder Lake will be on 10nm, and will utilize \u201cbig cores\u201d with high ipc, and \u201clittle cores\u201d with low ipc, and low power consumption.\n2. Alder Lake will come out late 2021 or early 2022.\n3. Sapphire Rapides will be Intel\u2019s big splash back into the data center, and will succeed Ice Lake server.\n4. Sapphire rapides will most likely have 56 cores.\n\nMy opinion:\n\nThough we have very little information on Zen 4, we know one thing for certain, it will be on 5nm TSMC. You may immediately see the issue, in my last post I said that 5nm was designed to compete with Intel 7nm, not 10nm. AMD will still have a node advantage. This along with what we know so far, Zen 4, will increase core counts substantially again, and it will be an advanced package solution, this shows that unless Alder Lake and Sapphire Rapids come out two quarters or more before Zen 4, it will not be competitive. \n\nThis is a major issue for Intel because as I detailed previously Intel\u2019s roadmap is massively behind schedule and I believe that all products that have yet to be announced, such as Alder Lake and Sapphire rapids will have been delayed by at least a few months. These delays will be further compounded by Intel\u2019s wording security problems forcing companies to either purchase more Intel products as a stop gap, or migrate over to AMD.\n\n***Data Center and the Cloud***\n\nIf you work in the server space, you know that security is paramount, and as I said in my last post, Intel has none of it. Now you may ask, why is Intel still selling massive amounts of CPUs to various OEMs such as Dell? Here is the reason as detailed by Mike Burzonne (who is supporting the Federal Trade Commission v Intel Corp. Dockets 9288 and 9341) on SeekingAlpha:\n\n\u201cAverage OEM price where I suspect deeper discounts are available for large volume bundles and hyperscale / cloud commercial.\n\nDesktop $283.79\n\nMobile $282.13\n\nXeon $715.04\u201d\n\nNow the astute may see the issue, Intel is selling these for much less than their suggested retail value. Essentially what these large OEMs are doing is, buy Xeons on the cheap, burning through them in about a year, then purchasing new ones. Obviously this is not sustainable, so they are potentially looking at AMD. \n\nMike Burzonne also believes that AMD ships about 50m units per year compared to the 400m of Intel, and from this the issue is clear, they do not have enough capacity to bring on these large OEMs in any meaningful way, plus the software stack is not entirely mature yet. \n\nNow if you look at the software stack, this is a very real head wind, but things are slowly changing, when Zen 3 is released, the Zen architecture will be just about 4 years old, which is typically when you start to see software maturity at around 5 years. This compounded with improved efficiency over Zen 2 should allow AMD to make a very convincing argument to not buy Xeons. Furthermore, we also know that AMD is ramping wafer orders from TSMC thus they should be able to increase shipments and bring large OEMs on board.\n\nThe way that Intel is going to combat this is by selling Xeons on the cheap while showing off what they have coming down the pipeline to incentivise companies to make do with their current products. The issue with this is they have proven time and time again that they do not have the ability to execute, as proven most recently by the 7nm delays.\n\n***Trouble with the FTC***\n\nThis will be very brief as I do not entirely understand the ins out outs of the suit, but the reason I specifically brought up Mike Burzonne was his involvement in an anticompetitive suit against Intel for monopolistic practices as summarized in my first post. Mike Burzonne believes that total damages could exceed 20b and a 2010 revision states 88B in damages.\n\nThe reason why the charges are so slow to move is Mike Burzonne believes that the FTC and the European Union are synchronizing to ensure that the charges are proper and cannot be easily dismissed, nor will there be lasting economic tensions as Intel is a US based cooperation.\n\nIf you wish to read more about the suit, here is the 2010 revision: [https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public\\_comments/proposed-consent-agreement-matter-intel-corporation-corporation-ftc-docket-no.9341-550006-00014%C2%A0/550006-00014-55228.pdf](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_comments/proposed-consent-agreement-matter-intel-corporation-corporation-ftc-docket-no.9341-550006-00014%C2%A0/550006-00014-55228.pdf)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6miicxssudo51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c10575c5850a57d5dcdcf7c54b0e570b282dba30\n\n**Conclusion/TLDR**\n\nAs I believe I highlighted very clearly, Intel is increasingly starting to turn to more shady tactics to paint themselves in the best light possible, such as with the Cascade Lake reviews, they are losing ground to AMD in efficiency and performance, they are losing server market share and they have a potential massive lawsuit on the horizon. \n\nAll of this should demonstrate that AMD has a golden opportunity to gain massive market share as Intel toils with 10nm and 7nm.\n\nOne final thing I should note, is that the FTC lawsuit is very much uncertain, and I would be wary of basing any decisions on it. \n\nFinally, I see AMD as worth 150B in the next few years as they eat Intel\u2019s lunch, cloud compute continues to grow rapidly, and their collaborations with Xbox and PS5 bear fruit.",

After several red days, shares of Amazon (AAPL), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and other big companies rallied. On a dour note, reopening stocks (travel, cruise lines, airlines, hotels, etc) were down after AstraZeneca (AZN) announced it had its COVID-19 vaccine trial paused. \n\nThe S&amp;P finished 2.08% up, the Nasdaq was 2.92%, leading the day, and the Dow finished 1.68% up. The volatility index (VIX) was down 4.8%, indicating increased risk appetite in traders.\n\nToday, it was announced that AstraZeneca, a forerunner in the development of the COVID vaccine announced a pause of their experimental trial after one patient became more ill, pledging to make safety a priority and take the time necessary to let science prevail. This setback comes in stark contrast to politicians and governments who seem to imply a cure is just around the corner. Shares of AstraZeneca sank 2%, while those of companies competing to develop a Covid-19 vaccine including Moderna (MRNA) and Novavax (NVAX) rose. \n\nUS oil prices plunged nearly 7% today, after Saudi Aramco, the largest oil producer in the world, announced it would be slashing its selling price to Asia and the United States, per Bloomberg. \"Oil demand globally is really sluggish. All of the low hanging fruit from the global oil recovery has already happened,\" said Michael Tran, managing director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAsia-Us cargo rates are at the highest since March lows. For bulls evidence of a rebounding economy, for bears activity is fueled by liquidity and the shoe has yet to drop.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* After falling nearly 20% in the week, Tesla (TSLA) stock roared back today, finishing the day 10.9% up.\n* Big Commerce (BIGC) reported earnings today.

        "selftext": " \n\nRegarding  the FED's stimulus budget and balance sheet changes with respect to  liquidity and solvency, looking at these metrics shows the same as 2008  where as soon as the market went to the bottom, the FED announces  \"unlimited\" liquidity and solvency, and this was the bottom, this ended  up signalling the current bottom as well which now makes this a tell and  people will know the next time that the bottom will be when the FED  announces unlimited liquidity and solvency, and because this is already  known, people will no longer panic because they realize that the bottom  will be bailed out by the FED.  You can only have a market crash when  people are fearful but when they know that the FED will signal the  bottom of the recession then they will not panic sell and will instead  know that the market will recover in V shape, when you know that there  will be no market crash, this will cause people to not be afraid of the  market and cause the spike and is why there will no longer be a market  crash.\n\nWell that is grate, but  what can I do about it?  The key is to leverage low interest rates to  benefit the stock market portfolio, if you have cash and are waiting for  the dip there will no longer be dips because of the FED and inflation,  because of this, cash is no longer as important, the FED printed many  trillion of dollars and this will increase the market cap by many  trillion of dollars, if they announce another stimulus package this will  add that to the market cap of corporations, because of this you should  hedge sparingly on call options while investing in equities.  Gold does  not increase in value due to stimulus package because we have limited  number of gold kilograms, while stock market will continue to rise as  new stimulus adds market cap, do not be surprise if APPL goes to 3  trillion, we do not hesitate when APPL goes from 200 billion to 300  billion, the new order of magnitude will take adjustment but while  others are adjustmenting to the new normal it is time to act and act  fast, when we saw APPL go to the trillion market cap, the new order of  magnitude is the 10 trillion market cap which should occur over the next  10 years as more stimulus in the form of FED balance sheet adjustments  and adding new capital to the markets.\n\nThe  bottom line is that the name of the game is equities and you should not  have any money in cash at the moment, by the time you will deploy this  cash into the market it will be too late as there will most likely not  be another dip in the market, on average once every 15 year is the dip  and we had 3 dip in past 20 year and could possibly go for 25 year  without the another dip so apply cash to equities sparingly as you do  not want to be in cash.",

        "selftext": "Understanding chart patterns and formations is really the foundation for more advanced technical analysis and trading strategy. However, some chart patterns are more valuable and consistent then others, so I decided to put together this list of what I personally believe to be the 4 best chart patterns for day trading! **Side note:** Obviously there are really no *\"best\"* patterns... some may work better for me than you and vice versa. \n\nBefore getting into the chart patterns, it's important to understand a bit about what makes up a chart in the first place. The foundation of our charting and analysis are candlesticks. To summarize and simplify **candlesticks**, they are formed by an open, high, low and close over a set period of time. That period of time is dependent on what timeframe your chart is set to. That means that your candlesticks can represent 1 minute of price action, 1 week of price action, or just about any amount of time between. The image below shows how candlesticks are formed and why they look the way they do.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/PrnntBh](https://imgur.com/a/PrnntBh) \n\nThe **real body**, which is the colored portion of the candlestick, shows us the difference between where the price opened and closed for that period of time. Of course, a positive change will create a green candlestick, and a negative change will create a red candlestick. The **upper** and **lower wicks** are then the lines that stick straight out from the top and bottom of the real body. These lines show us the highest and lowest point that the price went before the candlestick closed.\n\nAll of this can be very useful while doing technical analysis and analyzing chart patterns, because this data from candlesticks can give us exact prices to get the most out of the chart patterns! With that being said, let's get started with the chart patterns themselves!\n\n**Bull Flag:** A bull flag is a bullish chart pattern, indicating a continuation upward. This patterns will typically form after a strong move up and is a consolidation period for the stock before it breaks out again and continues its run. The bull flag is a great chart patterns for traders looking to take advantage of a stock's momentum. You can look to either buy at/ear the bull flags support level, or buy the bull flag breakout for the stock's continuation.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/pXiUg5T](https://imgur.com/a/pXiUg5T) \n\n**ABCD Pattern:** The ABCD pattern is another bullish pattern, which can offer traders some great opportunities to safely buy the dip/pullback in a stock. The great thing about the ABCD pattern is that it allows you to get into a stock without chasing at the highs and it also offers a clear level of risk so that you can cut your losses quickly if the pattern doesn't happen to follow through.\n\nYou can see in the diagram and example below that the pattern is made up of four points *(A,B,C and D)*. The way we use these points to actually find trades is fairly simple. After the high point of A and the low point of B have formed, you look for a higher low at point C to buy. From there, you of course want to see the breakout at point D, but if it happens to fail you can use the low from point B as your risk level to cut losses. Alternatively, you can wait for a confirmed breakout at point D to buy into the stock's momentum! If you want to see my youtube video going over this pattern in more detail, you can check it out by clicking [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bljscVZM5q0&amp;t=3s)!\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/3KIPFf8](https://imgur.com/a/3KIPFf8)\n\n**Head and Shoulders:** Unlike the first two patterns, the head and shoulders pattern is actually a bearish chart pattern. It typically forms at the top of a strong move up or uptrend, indicating a reversal to the downside. For that reason, this pattern is typically used to sell long positions and lock in profits or even to short-sell to profit from the reversing and heading back down.\n\nThe time to sell or short-sell within this pattern is when the right shoulder forms. At this point it will confirmed that the stock is not in an uptrend, since the right shoulder will be lower than the head of the head and shoulders pattern. By short-selling into the right shoulder, you can then use the high point at the head as your risk level to cut losses on your short position if the stock happens to rebound and begins to move higher. Alternatively, you can wait for a confirmed breakdown below the support level that is formed between the two shoulders to sell or open your short position!\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/ftYScwb](https://imgur.com/a/ftYScwb)\n\n**Bullish Wick Reversal:** The pattern is one that is actually formed by individual candlesticks themselves. To spot this pattern you have to pay close attention to the lower wicks of the candlesticks. Since the lower wick represents the lowest point the stock went before the candlestick closed, a long lower wick shows us that the demand *(buying)* in the stock increased before the candlestick closed. For that reason, long lower wicks can be a great indicator of a bullish reversal.\n\nLook for candlesticks similar to the ones in the diagram and examples below to potentially buy into the stock in anticipation of a reversal and move higher. As always, you also should have a risk level when you buy into this formation. You can simply use the lowest point from the lower wick to risk off of in case it happens to be a fake out rather than a major reversal.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/tUgeFow](https://imgur.com/a/tUgeFow)\n\nThese four patterns are a great foundation for any trader and can be very beneficial for improving your technical analysis. I hope found this post and keep an eye out for these patterns during your next trading session! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Full Blog:** [https://masterthemarket.teachable.com/blog/215321/4-best-chart-patterns-for-day-trading-stocks](https://masterthemarket.teachable.com/blog/215321/4-best-chart-patterns-for-day-trading-stocks)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** Pay attention to candlesticks! Watch for bull flags in an uptrend to ride a stock's momentum, use the ABCD Pattern to dip buy stocks while they're pulling back rather than chasing at the high, and look out for the head &amp; shoulders pattern.... it can be a red flag if you're in a long position and can often lead to a great opportunity to short-sell!",

        "selftext": "**Natural Shrimp, Inc. (SHMP)** is disrupting the billion-dollar seafood industry with its patented electrocoagulation technology that allows them to grow fresh shrimp in any major city, disease, and virus free without any antibiotics. After almost two decades of R&amp;D, SHMP is moving into the production (revenue-generating) and commercialization phase of their operation and will be \u201cvery profitable\u201d in 2021 (see numbers below in the \u201cFun Facts\u201d section).\n\n**TLDR:** **Natural Shrimp** has applied to be **uplisted to the Nasdaq** and this is likely the last time you\u2019ll see the stock price this low based on their recent announcements at the H.C. Wainwright Annual Global Investment Conference (recording here - [https://wsw.com/webcast/hcw7/shmp/1618264](https://wsw.com/webcast/hcw7/shmp/1618264)). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer:** Currently hold and have been long on **SHMP** for 3+ years (in at .02 cents, currently trading at .12 cents). This is the only OTC stock I own in my portfolio. \n\nThis DD is based on my own research over the 3+ years I\u2019ve been following the company, as well as the research of others. Many insights I\u2019m sharing were sourced directly from research in *The Emergent REAL Green Aqua Technology: A TRAGIC NECESSITY* *-* [*The Eddie Yolk Zone*](https://www.facebook.com/healthyselfnow777/?eid=ARDe4SZgioRfdUtiDYgm97z7xTBbmgFxaWlmIANPwayQxizgZbWThxmrJjBTCGHtgi4Z2HWAap3jVW71)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\\^TRA Tradeshow 7/2019 (YouTube video linked below)\n\nNaturalShrimp, Inc. **(OTCQB: SHMP)** is a publicly-traded agro-tech company headquartered in Dallas that has developed the first commercially viable system for growing shrimp and other seafood indoors with their patented proprietary technology. NS produces fresh (never frozen), gourmet/sushi-grade shrimp without the use of antibiotics, probiotics, or toxic chemicals. \n\n**Company and Technology Summary:**\n\nNaturalShrimp set out with one explicit goal in mind; to raise shrimp WITHOUT the use of ANY chemicals, antibiotics in a clean, sanitary, completely organic aqua-farming environment comprised of indoor recirculating sea-water tanks where their location is dependent upon consumer locale rather than any dependency upon coastal regions or even the ocean itself. \n\nThrough the use of their patented \u201celectro-coagulation\u201d (EC) technology, an electrical current is generated in the water and the susceptibility of bacteria and viruses to this electro-disinfectant mechanism results in approximately 99% of all pathogens to be eliminated; therefore, this physical nature and effect of electricity provide the means by which a clean, completely organic environment is maintained. Electrocoagulation is not a new concept, however, to address both essential and critical factors responsible for the demise of most aqua-farming crops; bacterial, viral infection and or the increase in ammonia levels as a result of the waste build-up from shrimp crops; the latter is the arch-nemesis and far more difficult to manage. \n\nHowever, the use of EC also confers the other essential benefit by liberating the chlorine molecules in the NACL or salt compound of the seawater that in turn combines with the nitrate compounds building up as a result of increasing shrimp waste levels; the newly formed solid aggregates (Chloramine, NH2CL) are formed that can be readily filtered from the seawater and therefore effectively controlling ammonia levels in the tank environment. \n\n**Where does our shrimp come from today?**\n\nAre there certain products you wouldn\u2019t consider buying if they were from China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, or India? I know I wouldn\u2019t buy my kid\u2019s baby food or my medications from there and I\u2019d certainly never buy seafood from these places. \n\n**So, why are we?!** \n\nAn analysis was conducted covering a decade of records from the FDA related to imports, inspections and rejection data from 2006 to 2015. The analysis revealed only 6 % of the total seafood market is domestic whereas 94% comes from imports outside the US and only 2% of these imports are inspected and from this minuscule sampling; only 1 in 9 imports are rejected.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nHowever, from these rare inspections, since 2001, the FDA has detected the use of banned veterinary antibiotic residues on the shrimp crops sampled with unacceptable levels of chloramphenicol and nitrofuran antibiotics imported from China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand and India. These antibiotics remain banned and illegal due to the carcinogenic nature of nitrofurans and chloramphenicol use associated with the onset of aplastic anemia. Yet these same banned drug residues still find their way onto American dinner tables merely by overwhelming an already sporadic and ineffective inspection system mediated by the FDA. The danger of tainted shrimp crops is twofold; the bacteria organisms that survive the chronic overuse of antibiotics develop immunity to more and more of the antibiotics used and are elevated to the status of \u201cSuperbugs\u201d and the drugs themselves, particularly pesticides can cause neurological, respiratory, organ system damage with prolonged exposure. In the article \u201c[Shrimp containing antibiotic-resistant bacteria found in Canadian grocery stores](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/shrimp-antibiotics-resistance-amr-marketplace-1.5055101?fbclid=IwAR1KxQ4CUv8dFPaHFFM8OqY9fkR3NwcXT6FfhFrbwL7mG89VXAHa4yKbjjE)\u201d; the \u201cMarketplace\u201d periodical cited \u201c17 percent\u201d of the sampled shrimp (9 of 51 shrimp sampled) and tested by the University of Saskatchewan revealed strains of E.coli and Staph Aureus that showed resistance to at least one antibiotic and all but one of the shrimp were resistant to multiple drugs \u201cmeaning they have the potential to cause hard-to-treat infections \u2013 so called superbugs that antibiotics may not be able to kill\u201d.\n\n**Why Aquafarming?**\n\nThe shift from wild-caught to farm-raised seafood where the production of the Aquafarming industry has grown dramatically from 50 million tons (in 1970) annually to over 150 million tons speaks to the necessity to provide environmental relief to land-based farming and the over-fishing of wild-caught species where nearly 90% of the world\u2019s marine fish stocks are categorized as either fully fished to overexploited. \n\nWhile seafood comprises 17% of the animal protein consumed in the world, it is estimated 200 million jobs are either directly or indirectly connected to the fisheries sector making fish one of the most traded food commodities worldwide and therefore generates more income than most other food commodities combined. \n\nFor some of the biggest seafood species and markets like North Atlantic salmon; over half of the salmon consumed annually comes from the Aqua-farming industry. The largest seafood industry continues to be shrimp, however, where worldwide, the consumption of shrimp amounts to nearly 5 billion pounds per year. The estimates for this year\u2019s shrimp consumption are set for 1 billion pounds for the US alone. We will never be able to meet the world or even national seafood demand. \n\n**Why is NaturalShrimp different?**\n\nThe NS solution chose to simulate the ideal natural environment of shrimp in their natural habitats where water quality is high and where bacterial and viral infections are not a critical deterrent to healthy cultivation because the entire cascade of out of control oxidation, waste build-up and poor water quality that leads to bacterial and viral infections is eliminated altogether and the focus then becomes how to MAINTAIN the optimal environment rather than a risk mitigation approach. \n\nThis is an altogether DIFFERENT patented solution that did warrant the 18 years of research in order to arrive at a more quantitative, specific and effective technological breakthrough and solution that can in effect maintain optimum conditions within recirculating tank environments albeit a completely clean, organic and healthy methodology for the shrimp organisms and ultimately for us; the consumers. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTo understand the essential differences between all of the most innovative models is to appreciate how actually groundbreaking this NS technology is and why such a patented solution that is currently being tested across MANY seafood species (barramundi, salmon, clams, crab, lobster) is poised to become a historical marker and industry disruptor for the seafood industry. \n\nCan you imagine sitting in the middle of the country, hours away from an airport with the ability to eat freshly harvested king crab legs?! That\u2019s the future in which SHMP is leading the charge. If you believe in socially and environmentally responsible companies (BYND, TSLA, etc) that will disrupt the future with their technology and products, SHMP is a company you be watching. It is simply where the world is heading and the world millennials and future generations want to live in. Always fresh, never frozen, always natural - no antibiotics or chemicals introduced.\n\nSimilar to Tesla, there are many applications outside of their core focus in seafood, such as use in both residential and commercial aquariums and pools (multi-billion dollar industries). This is a billion-dollar licensing of their technology opportunity and I can assure you the SHMP team has this on their radar. \n\nNow, after nearly 20 years of R&amp;D, they\u2019re on their final step to commercial production and massive revenue streams. They\u2019ve stayed pretty quiet and have been flying under the radar until more recently from a publicity standpoint as they prepare to launch into their production phase and uplist to the Nasdaq. I\u2019d encourage you to check out their recent filings and press releases in comparison to previous years (see link below). It is very obvious they\u2019ve hired the appropriate resources to start marketing, selling, and propelling SHMP to the next level. \n\nOnce more institutional investors gain access (most can\u2019t hold OTC assets) and SHMP gains more exposure, the stock should rise steadily. That run should continue and start spiking as that revenue switch gets flipped on in 2021. Barring massive market instability, SHMP shareholders would see massive gains and I truly believe the next few weeks and by the end of November will be the last time you will see prices under .25. By 2022, this could easily be $5-10+ if not considerably more. \n\nThis isn\u2019t that far off from what Beyond Meat did to get started and is doing. Look at their massive market cap of almost $10B with a net revenue of only $297M in 2019 and $87M in 2018. SHMP could easily see that level of net revenue over the next few years, as their Iowa facility alone is forecasting $8-10M in net revenue. \n\nWith their Texas facility up and running already, the major expansion plans (see diagram below), and massive opportunities to license their technology (it has been indicated there are several opportunities to do so), they\u2019ll easily hit the $100M mark and see similar trends from a market cap standpoint to BYND. Thus, rewarding shareholders with an innovative, socially responsible technology and massive gains for early shareholders.\n\n**Fun Facts:**\n\n* (9/16/20) CFO presented at the HC Wainwright Investor Conference\n   * **Announced SHMP will be \u201cvery profitable\u201d next year as they move into the production phase of their rollout.** \n      * 60-65% margins (this is HUGE)\n      * The cost to grow out shrimp are $6/pound\n      * The Webster City, Iowa location alone will be producing 15-20k pounds of shrimp per week (270k sq. ft., 240 - 10k gallon tanks, all equipment is new)\n      * Full production by late October/early November 2020\n   * **Distributing the shrimp fresh, never frozen and always natural**\n      * 90% of the shrimp market is frozen\n      * As soon as wild shrimp are caught they are dipped in sodium triphosphate and then flash frozen. Sodium triphosphate is a preservative for seafood, meats, poultry, and animal feeds. In foods, STPP is used as an emulsifier and to retain moisture. Many governments regulate the quantities allowed in foods, as it can substantially increase the sale weight of seafood in particular. (per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_triphosphate))\n   * **With EC tech, SHMP can raise 4x the density of shrimp compared to biofloc systems in that same cubic yard (much more economical which allows them to be profitable)**\n      * Biofloc isn\u2019t scalable (profitable) but does work, however, it is more suited for selling shrimp at a farmers market\n      * Current commercial biofloc systems are not profitable and will not be profitable without the use of the NS EC technology (many are already calling SHMP)\n   * **Anticipating 2-3 species to be raised in 2021, scaling to more species from there**\n      * Many discussions and requests to expand the use of this technology into China for crayfish\n      * Very successful in their phase 1 trial to cure amoebic gill disease in salmon. Responded within 3 minutes of being exposed to the technology \n   * **Shrimp larvae are bought from 1 of the 2 growers in the nation but there is work being done internally to build and produce their own shrimp larvae**\n      * In 2019, after being assured they were healthy, SHMP unknowingly bought and started growing larvae that were infected with the viral shrimp disease Infectious Hypodermal and Haematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHHNV) which resulted in the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department quarantining the facility\n   * **Announced joint venture in California and Florida that are \u201cboth well on their way\u201d - more to come (this could be the licensing of technology play many shareholders are hopeful for)**\n* SHMP has an amazingly transparent and open team that readily accepts and acts on feedback, answers questions, and proactively updates shareholders on a regular basis (check out their Facebook group - [https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158050257692447/about](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1158050257692447/about))\n* Their business model allows them to grow fresh shrimp in warehouses in major cities, allowing for a farm to table strategy to provide the freshest, healthiest shrimp possible to restaurants and grocery stores\n   * **No deveining required** **- Their technology, process, and regional site business model allow them to stop feeding the shrimp 3 or so days before harvesting so that all waste is expelled from the shrimp at the time of harvest and therefore not requiring you to devein the shrimp**\n* $SHMP applied to be uplisted to the Nasdaq on 8/19/20 (this process usually takes 4-6 weeks so their assumed approval should be announced very soon). - [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/naturalshrimp-submits-application-nasdaq-capital-113000886.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/naturalshrimp-submits-application-nasdaq-capital-113000886.html)\n   * **When this approval happens, they\u2019ll have access to institutional investors with large wallets and the stock price should jump accordingly.** \n* 3 institutional investors took positions in June (combined these institutions are managing 10\u2019s of billions of dollars in assets) - [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/shmp/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/shmp/institutional-holdings)\n   * **CAPTRUST (has $364B in assets they manage) -** [**https://www.captrust.com/**](https://www.captrust.com/)\n   * **Cullinan Associates -** [**http://www.cullinan.com/**](http://www.cullinan.com/)\n   * **Formidable Asset Management -** [**https://www.formidableam.com/**](https://www.formidableam.com/)\n* SHMP Head Chef, Douwe Iedema, showcasing the massive shrimp at the Texas Restaurant Association Tradeshow in 2019 \n   * **Skip to 4:24 to see the shrimp in the tank and waiting to be prepared** \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4BqFbN69KM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;fbclid=IwAR3kWDtGtCC-jzM1Ff0h8hgzKLCcBNk2miW3zmTCe\\_76nMjNZQXD4\\_5RSeY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4BqFbN69KM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;fbclid=IwAR3kWDtGtCC-jzM1Ff0h8hgzKLCcBNk2miW3zmTCe_76nMjNZQXD4_5RSeY)\n   * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YJUhgD8YlA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YJUhgD8YlA)\n* Expansion plans\n   * \ud83d\udcf7\n\n**Links:**\n\n* Company History/Timeline - [https://naturalshrimp.com/about-our-company/](https://naturalshrimp.com/about-our-company/)\n* FAQ - [https://naturalshrimp.com/faqs/](https://naturalshrimp.com/faqs/)\n* September 2020, Commercialization Podcast with President and Founder, Gerald Easterling (10min) - [https://stockdaymedia.com/naturalshrimp-inc-discusses-upcoming-commercialization-strategy-with-the-stock-day-podcast-shmp-september-10-2020/](https://stockdaymedia.com/naturalshrimp-inc-discusses-upcoming-commercialization-strategy-with-the-stock-day-podcast-shmp-september-10-2020/)\n* September 2020, Investor Presentation - [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1465470/000165495420010146/shmp\\_ex991.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1465470/000165495420010146/shmp_ex991.htm)\n* September 2020 - H.C.

        "selftext": "I am new at investing but I am very excited about this company. I have been searching all I can find and I have been watching these threads over the weekend. My research started on Friday when I was taking more of a macro look at nickel as a commodity and how it will fare in the upcoming years. And then I came across the Reuters article about Giga and Tesla in talks and I have been doing a ton of research. Here is my case for Giga:\n\n1. Elon was very clear that he was going to be needing a large supply of nickel. He thinks big picture and realizes that by the time nickel is priced high enough to incentivize the suppliers, it\u2019s already much too late. It takes 5-10 years to get a mine up and running\n2. Battery Day is being teased as a big reveal. Current speculation is that Tesla could unveil a million-mile battery and/or claim that by scaling up battery production they can drive down the cost to 100/kWh which makes it price-parity with conventional. Also some crazy ideas like nickel nano-tubes that could revolutionize the industry. All speculation of course.\n3. Combine whatever big announcements stem from number two above and it probably relates back to number one, that is to say that the announcements will require lots and lots of nickel.\n4. Acquiring Maxwell and Hibar last year point to Tesla manufacturing their own batteries going forward and there is even a pilot line at Gigafactory 1\n5. Giga Metals has a boatload of Class 1 nickel sulphide and they have been working to be carbon-neutral for some time now. If they get the results of the UCB study validated then they can claim carbon credits and truly make a net-zero statement if findings support it\n6. HPAL is dirty. No EV manufacturer in their right mind wants to have their brand associated with destruction of earth and oceans. They want to ensure their entire supply-chain is as green as can be. This will become increasingly important. I initially looked at Norilsk and Vale when I heard the news about Elon looking for nickel but the environmentally-friendly qualifier stuck out like a sore thumb. I did some quick research and there\u2019s oil spills, large natural devastation, rivers on fire, red beaches, lawsuits, contaminated waterways, etc.\n7. I learned a new term while researching and it\u2019s called \u2018bifurcation\u2019 which is essentially splitting a market into two segments. I think \u2018clean\u2019 Class 1 metal for environmentally-conscious EV makers is an example of this that has not totally been realized yet, and they will pay a premium because it\u2019s worth it in their opinion.\n8. Giga is open-pit mine and while Canada has strong environmental regulations, that\u2019s a plus (to some extent) in this case. The Turnagain mine apparently operates in a somewhat friendly mining district from what I gather.\n9. Phillipines recently stopped exporting nickel. I don\u2019t know all the reasons especially if price is so low but that\u2019s a big risk, I would want to invest in a stable relationship/country. \n10. Vertical integration makes perfect sense here. If Elon predicts there is a shortage upcoming because the price is too low to get miners mining then of course this is going to cause the price to go up and that will make the cost of his vehicle go up. Imagine if he has to start paying 3-4x for the nickel he is using in batteries in five or seven years? It\u2019s too late at that point, nickel prices will be what they are. That\u2019s a gigantic hit to profit, or ensures a loss. By acquiring a stake in a mining operation now he can potentially get nickel at the cost it is to mine it and refine it, or some markup on it but not spot prices. A billion dollars and five years to get this mine up and running is no joke, but now is the time to get started on feasibility work and permits and he could have a percentage of company plus a stable supply and cost structure.\n11. Elon said in 2019 they may get into mining, whatever they need to do to secure their supply chain [https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-says-tesla-might-get-into-mining-business-2019-6](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-says-tesla-might-get-into-mining-business-2019-6)\n12. Elon is an engineer at heart, an inventor, someone who revolutionizes industries. Maybe this is where I\u2019m going off the rails but I look at his Model 8 semi-truck and I wonder if he could retrofit it into a line of hauling equipment, operated with his batteries and using self-driving technology to haul the thousands of deliveries of paydirt or tailings or whatever it's called in this sector. Maybe that would cost way too much, I have no idea, but I can envision it. If the mine has a life of 40 years, is that such a crazy thought for the year 2030 or 2040? Potentially haha...\n13. A net-zero carbon mine is is something you could make a commercial out of (from our mines to your vehicles,...'.'). There is value to that.\n14. I believe in the president of the company after watching a couple of youtube videos, notably the one below. This is strictly a character assessment based on my own opinion, but I trust this dude. He came out of retirement in 2004 to be the president after he was the CEO of an oil company (who\u2019s stock went from 35 cents to 150 bucks mind you).. He seems sharp and alludes  that when he took over in 2004 it was a pump and dump company previously. He shut down pretty much everything related to the mine in 2011 when nickel prices cratered a second time so that the company could weather the storm. As such they retained 100% ownership and it was a very smart move in hindsight; meanwhile they have still been pursuing the carbon-neutral aspect because he knows how important it will be. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKf0EQdKKAo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKf0EQdKKAo)\n15. I believe in the board of directors. I think maybe that's underestimated or looked at for a penny stock. They have a lot of technical expertise. One of the guys is a a former Senior Vice President at Vale. These are people I don't feel like have a lot to benefit from misleading the public, they are just waiting on nickel prices to rise and an investment partner.\n16. Check out this 7 minute video that only has 848 views from 2018 haha. Definitely worth a view imo...[https://youtu.be/OetP9DxKDPg](https://youtu.be/OetP9DxKDPg)\n\nIf nothing is mentioned on battery day then I imagine this stock probably falls back to $0.40 or so and that\u2019s a real risk. But that is not the only option for someone looking for a potentially phenomenal return sometime in the next few years. Even if it 'only' goes up to five bucks at some point, that's still a 300%+ return and pretty darn good, better than 12% hopeful on DJIA. \n\nThis is not a pure play on Tesla Battery Day, it\u2019s a play on Class 1 ethically sourced nickel over the next decade; that\u2019s different than nickel supply as a whole. Many EV companies could be interested in this and Tesla is not the only company they are talking to. I anticipate EV companies thinking about shoring up their supply chains for the next 20-40 years, Elon strikes me as the one who would love to become part owner and drive improvements. He also has some experience from the Boring company I imagine.\n\nJust wanted to share my thoughts and they are just that, realize this is far from a guarantee but I am very excited about it, not just for next week but as an actual company. I picked up 74,000 shares at $1.40ish USD yesterday morning. Personally I am not worried about if the price is $1.54 and then goes to $1.11 or whatever, I wanted to get in under $2.00 and was glad I did.  I don\u2019t see this as a penny stock but a longer-term play with great potential. \n\nFull disclosure, the one thing I saw I did not like at ALL was that two of the insiders traded just about all their shares on Friday (9/11) when the stock was around a buck. Very alarming but again I trust the management and long-term picture, sorry if I am rambling hahaha",

        "selftext": "Looking down the road a bit, it seems likely right now with Coronavirus leading to more people doing mail-in voting this year that the final results of the US presidential election won't be settled for at least several weeks after Election Day.\n\nIf that's the case, it sort of reminds me of 2000's Bush v. Gore election which (from what I've been able to find from the limited research I've done so far) coincided with a ~5% drop in the markets over the weeks when the results of Florida were contested and the Supreme Court had to rule.\n\nSo my questions for everyone are:\n1. Do you think we could be in a similar scenario this year?\n2. If so, what actions do you plan to take during the weeks until the election is settled?\n3. How do you plan to adjust your portfolio and transactions if Donald Trump is declared the winner or if Joe Biden is declared the winner?\n\nNo wrong answers, just wanted to get broad strokes and perspectives from how different people of different walks are approaching this and see how other people were thinking about these things (I don't imagine I'm the only person who is), but if no one's looking beyond their TSLA puts right now, I understand :P",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 14th, 2020.\n\n# **Investors will look to the Fed to soothe the market next week, but that may be a tall order  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/11/investors-will-look-to-the-fed-to-soothe-the-market-next-week-but-that-may-be-a-tall-order.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Markets are looking to the Federal Reserve to be a soothing force when it meets in the week ahead, but stocks could remain choppy if the central bank disappoints and as investors focus on the election and the economic recovery.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is expected to end Wednesday with minor tweaks to its statement and some clarity on how it plans to use forward guidance. The Fed also updates its economic and interest rate outlook, including forecasts for 2023 for the first time.\n*****\n&gt; But Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential Financial, said the stock market could easily be disappointed because the Fed is unlikely to offer more clarity on monetary policy, such as plans for bond buying.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is concerned the Fed is not going to give us explicit readings on their plans for monetary policy,\u2033 she said. The Fed\u2019s extraordinary policies have been an important factor behind the stock market\u2019s 50% surge from the March 23 low, and it\u2019s also seen as a major factor limiting the depth of the market\u2019s sell-off.\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the Fed is not likely to tweak much and it continues to buy $80 billion a month in Treasurys. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do anything to the markets either way,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were volatile in the past week, falling hard, rallying, falling and rallying again. That left the S&amp;P 500 with a weekly decline of about 2.5%, its worst week since June. The harder hit Nasdaq was down about 4.1% for the week, its worst weekly decline since March. The quadruple expiration of options and futures at the end of the coming week could add to the volatility.\n*****\n&gt; Bank of America strategists said the bond market is watching the Fed for any balance sheet adjustments and the changes to its forward guidance, which includes the Fed\u2019s recent tweak in its inflation policy. The Fed changed its policy of focusing on a target inflation rate to an average rate, meaning it may not tighten policy if inflation overshoots its 2% target.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe see risk the rates market is underwhelmed by the guidance provided by the Fed, which would support higher back-end rates and a steeper curve,\u201d the Bank of America strategists noted. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slid in the past week, touching 0.67% Friday, and it could move higher, meaning bonds may sell-off, if the Fed does not clarify policy around its bond buying program.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the stock market is hoping for a dovish Fed. \u201cThe market needs that now because fiscal policy is going nowhere,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; BTIG strategist Julian Emanuel said the market could focus on the fact that Congress failed to make headway on fiscal stimulus, if the economic data begins to disappoint.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales for August are expected Wednesday morning, as the Fed meets. They are expected to rise by 1%, and that should be an important look at whether the lack of enhanced unemployment benefits, which expired July 31, impacted consumer spending. Among other things, Republicans and Democrats could not agree how to replace the $600 weekly payment to the unemployed.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cDepending on the polls and the economic data, the probability of stimulus rises and falls,\u201d said Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur view is that next week is just going to be lots of back and forth with the potential for a further extension of the range for the downside, if the political narrative gets more inflamed,\u201d said Emanuel. Emanuel expects the market to remain choppy and fall further into the month of October, as investors worry about the uncertainty around the presidential election.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s meeting this week is its last before the election, and analysts expect Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to sound reassuring that the Fed will do whatever it takes to support the economy. Powell holds a briefing after the meeting Wednesday, and he is expected to also be asked about the potential for higher inflation. The Fed has said it is more concerned about disinflation, but recent inflation data has been hotter than expected, though still well below 2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere is a tug of war between those who say buy chips now because inflation is moving higher, versus those why are saying deflationary forces are still weaving their way into the economy,\u201d said Krosby.\n*****\n&gt; Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said he expects the Fed to sound reassuring but it\u2019s not likely to discuss a target for bond purchases or the yield curve controls some investors were hoping for. Yield curve control would mean the Fed would try to manage interest rates by targeting its purchases of specific Treasurys. For instance, it may focus on trying to keep longer duration yields lower, and buy the 10-year.\n*****\n&gt; Chandler also noted the Fed\u2019s $7 trillion balance sheet has recently declined by about $100 billion from its peak, and its bond purchases are falling behind the European Central Bank.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy sense is the Fed is going to keep saying it\u2019s not worried about inflation. Its bigger worry is downside risks. They\u2019ll repeat their call for fiscal stimulus which after this week seems less likely,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Chandler said the stock market could remain choppy in the coming week, but he does not expect a sharp selloff. The dollar could decline, if the Fed sounds dovish, and that is a positive for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t think a 10% pullback [in Nasdaq] has caused enough pain to have people capitulate. This is just an ordinary correction, and we\u2019re going to make new highs,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N5HwCxp.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jr7e4gT.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/z7gtiCt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tgPKm6Y/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LUUHMDE.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CWgjO92.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/c37y9mp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Eau1B5A.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SHieVRq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/fTBYdV6v/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/05GY8WnF/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/qMk8gsZR/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election Charts You Need To See: Part 1\n\n&gt; First off, our thoughts go out to everyone who was impacted by the tragic events of September 11, 2001\u201419 years ago today. It is a day to reflect and remember those who were lost.\n\n&gt; One of the top requests we\u2019ve had here at LPL Research is for more charts on the election. Over the next week, we will share some of our favorite charts on this very important subject.\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s how the S&amp;P 500 Index performs under various presidents and congressional makeups. The best scenario has historically been a Democratic president and Republican Congress, while a Republican president and Democratic Congress has been the weakest.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Building on this, a split Congress historically has been one of the best scenarios for investors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The best scenario under a Republican president is a split Congress, a potential positive for 2020 that has played out after the massive reversal in the stock market since March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Looking at the four-year presidential cycle shows that stocks haven\u2019t been down during a year the president was up for a re-election since FDR in the 1940s, another bullish tailwind for 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s another look at this, as stocks historically have done much better when there isn\u2019t a lame duck president.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Active Managers Do an About Face\n\n&gt; The National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) has an index which tracks the exposure of its members to US equity markets. Each week, members are asked to provide a number that represents their exposure to markets. A reading of -200 means they are leveraged short, -100 indicates fully short, 0 is neutral, 100% is fully invested, and 200% indicates leveraged long. Two weeks ago, in our Bespoke Report, we highlighted the fact that the exposure index had moved to one of the highest levels in its 15-year history. Now, just two weeks later, these same active managers have reigned in their exposure considerably as this week's reading dropped from just under 100 to 53.1.\n\n&gt; This week's drop was the second-largest one week decline in the index's history and just the 10th time that the index lost more than a third (33 points) in a single week. The most recent occurrence was back in early March in the middle of the Covid crash, and every other prior period where the index saw a similar drop, the S&amp;P 500 was also down every time by an average of 2.3%. Therefore, it's not much of a surprise to see the big drop this week given the big declines in the market. But what about going forward? Do big drops in the NAAIM Index mean a bounce back for markets or further declines?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/091120-NAAIM.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Most and Least Heavily Shorted Stocks in the Russell 1,000\n\n&gt; Below is an updated look at the most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000. Each of these 30 stocks has at least 15% of its equity float sold short.\n\n&gt; At the top of the list is Nordstrom (JWN) with 38.66% of its float sold short. With a YTD decline of 61.86%, the shorts have crushed it with JWN this year.\n\n&gt; With its huge portfolio of office and retail real estate, Brookfield Property REIT(BPYU) has the second highest short interest in the Russell 1,000 at 33.7%. BPYU is down 35.7% YTD.\n\n&gt; There are plenty of other well-known companies on the list of the most heavily shorted stocks. Examples include American Airlines (AAL), Virgin Galactic (SPCE), LendingTree (TREE), Wayfair (W), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), ADT, TripAdvisor (TRIP), Beyond Meat (BYND), and Kohl's (KSS).\n\n&gt; One name that is no longer on the list of most shorted stocks is Tesla (TSLA). When we provided an update on short interest back in February (a pre-COVID world), Tesla (TSLA) had more than 17% of its float sold short, but that number is all the way down to 8.3% as of the most recent filing.\n\n&gt; These 30 stocks with the highest short interest are down an average of 3.01% since last Wednesday (9/2) when the S&amp;P 500 made its last closing high. That's actually a little bit better than the 3.55% average decline for the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000. And year-to-date, these 30 stocks are up an average of 0.60% versus an average gain of 0.81% for the rest of the index. That's not much of a difference!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/most-heavily-shorted.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a list of the 30 least shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 as a percentage of equity float. None of these stocks have more than 0.71% of their float sold short, and they're mostly made up of more conservative names in the Health Care and Consumer Staples sectors.\n\n&gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) has the lowest short interest as a percentage of float in the Russell 1,000 at just 0.36%. Microsoft (MSFT) -- one of the key mega-cap Tech names -- has the second lowest short interest, followed by Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Medtronic (MDT).\n\n&gt; Somewhat surprisingly, Amazon (AMZN) is the sixth least shorted stock in the entire Russell 1,000. While AMZN is still thought of as a high-flying momentum name by many investors, its short interest levels tell a much different story, painting it as more of a non-cyclical stock like Pepsi (PEP), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), or Coca- Cola (KO).\n\n&gt; While the 30 most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up 0.60% YTD, the 30 least shorted stocks in the index are up much more at +8%.

Looking ahead, economic growth below potential, slack in the labor market, and an extremely supportive Federal Reserve (Fed) may limit rate pressure in the near term, but with interest rates already low and massive stimulus in place, we believe the overall direction is likely to be higher.\n\n&gt; \u201cEven in a falling rate period there are lessons from the last cycle about rising rates,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cAmong them: Careful when the Fed stops buying and sometimes the best defense is a good offense.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; While every economic cycle is unique, the last cycle highlighted these key takeaways about periods of rising rates:\n\n&gt; * **Careful when the Fed stops buying.**  The two drivers of rising rates last cycle were economic growth and Fed bond purchases, also known as quantitative easing (QE). The Fed buys bonds to keep rates down, but the start of Fed buying has actually been the time when rates rise\u2014likely on expectations that the purchases would help strengthen the economy. These periods also often followed large rate declines either because markets anticipated the start of Fed buying or the economy was faltering. The takeaway: unless the economy is really taking off, any rising-rate period may pause for an extended period, or even reverse, when the Fed backs off bond purchases.\n&gt; * **Sometime the best defense is a good offense.** Lower-quality, more economically sensitive bond sectors actually performed well during periods of rising rates during the last cycle. Rate gains were largely driven by economic improvement rather than a large pick-up in inflation, and that\u2019s typically a good environment for sectors like high-yield bonds and bank loans. The downside is that these are much riskier bond sectors and don\u2019t provide the potential diversification benefits of higher-quality bonds during periods of stock declines.\n&gt; * **Don\u2019t expect TIPS to provide much resilience because of their inflation adjustment.** Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are high-quality bonds that have provided a little extra insulation against rising rates compared to similarly dated Treasuries when inflation expectations increased. TIPS prices are adjusted for inflation, but even with the adjustment, they are still very sensitive to rates.\n&gt; * **Investment-grade corporates can both hurt and help.** If credit spreads narrow when rates are rising, investment-grade corporates can post some solid gains in a rising-rate environment, but if spreads are holding steady or even widening, they can be very sensitive to changes in Treasury yields, potentially (although not often) even more sensitive than Treasuries.\n&gt; * **Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)** have not provided as much insulation as corporates, but they also have had less downside. While MBS have certainly outperformed Treasuries during periods of rising rates, they have not performed as well as investment-grade corporates. But they also have come with less downside, losing only 1.4% in their worst performing period compared to a 4% loss during the worst period for corporates.\nWith the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher. We are playing some offense with our equity exposure, which allows us to emphasize a focus on higher-quality bonds. Among bond sectors, we are emphasizing MBS and still prefer investment-grade corporates over Treasuries. History may not repeat, but if it rhymes, this positioning may help add resilience to a fixed income portfolio if rates extend their move off recent lows.\n\n&gt; With the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher.

Below we take a look at the best and worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 since the 9/2 high for the S&amp;P. For each stock, we also include its YTD total return and its percentage change from the 3/23 COVID Crash low through 9/2.\n\n&gt; Capri Holdings (CPRI) is up more than any other stock in the Russell 1,000 since 9/2 with a gain of 17.43%. Even after the recent gains, however, Capri -- the holding company for brands like Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo, and Versace -- is still down 52.9% year-to-date.\n\n&gt; Only four other stocks are up more than 10% since 9/2 -- Beyond Meat (BYND), PVH, Virtu Financial (VIRT), and Reinsurance Group (RGA). Interestingly, BYND and VIRT are also up big (~80%) year-to-date, while PVH and RGA are both down more than 35% year-to-date.\n\n&gt; What stands out the most about the list of winners is that only one Technology stock made the cut -- Sabre (SABR). Most names come from the two consumer sectors including cruise-liners like Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise (NCLH), Kohl's (KSS), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Six Flags (SIX), Foot Locker (FL), and Ralph Lauren (RL). Both UBER and LYFT also made the cut with gains of 6% since 9/2. The 30 biggest winners since 9/2 are still down an average of 20% year-to-date, while the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up an average of 1.46% YTD.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/bestsince92.png))**\n\n&gt; While only one Technology stock made the list of biggest winners since 9/2, the sector accounts for two-thirds of the 30 biggest losers over the same time frame. As shown below, since 9/2, the six worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 and ten of the worst twelve all come from Tech. Notably, though, these 30 stocks that have all fallen more than 12% since 9/2 are still up an average of 5.6% YTD. Were it not for the horrid YTD performance of the Energy stocks that made the list, the average YTD gain would be even higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/worstsince92.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Typical Early September Weakness Recovers Mid-Month Sells Off Month-End\n\n&gt; As of yesterday\u2019s close the market was down more than the historical average performance in September. DJIA was down nearly -3.3%, S&amp;P 500 was down -4.8%, NASDAQ was off 7.9%, Russell 1000 was down -5.2% and Russell 2000 lost 3.7%. Today\u2019s rally looks like the beginning of a textbook mid-month recovery rally However, the second half of September has historically been weaker than the first half. The week after options expiration week can be treacherous with S&amp;P 500 logging 23 weekly losses in 30 years since 1990. End-of-quarter portfolio restructuring, and window dressing can amplify the impacts of any negative headlines.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/75a927aee973e2c31a0d76ff0be15d59/fa78a7e1d90fbdef-fe/s500x750/8f217c04559740d2db6c24b7ea855ecd579ec195.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending September 11th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKS55-50q60))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 9.13.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1LCuH7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  9.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/IU3xGVJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 9.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EOC9Qwy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/faX2lNR.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/CdwssKa.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.18.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",

No one is better  equipped to supply nickel to Tesla than $VALE. During Tesla\u2019s Q2  earnings call, Elon [painstakingly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lvmOJGC_es&amp;t=37m39s) laid out how badly they were looking for a nickel producer.\n\n\u201cWell,  I\u2019d just like to re-emphasize, any mining companies out there, please  mine more nickel. Okay. Wherever you are in the world, please mine more  nickel and don\u2019t wait for nickel to go back to some long \u2014 some high  point that you experienced some five years ago, whatever. Go for  efficiency, obviously environmentally-friendly nickel mining at high  volume. Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time,  if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally-sensitive way.  So hopefully this message goes out to all mining companies. Please get  nickel.\u201d\n\n**&gt;&gt;&gt;THE STARS ALIGNED&lt;&lt;&lt;**\n\nThe  following points are largely circumstantial evidence, however when  stacked together create an extremely powerful narrative and points  toward the extreme likelihood of $VALE actually having lined up a *revolutionary* deal with Tesla.\n\n**Quotes from Tesla Q2 2020 Earnings Call**\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s  so much to be excited about. It\u2019s really hard to kind of fit into this  call, but the sheer amount of hardcore engineering, especially on the  autonomy and the manufacturing/engineering front is mind-blowing. And  then of course there\u2019s Battery Day, which is coming up pretty soon. And I  think that\u2019s really going to surprise people by just how much there is  to see.\u201d-Elon Musk\n\n\u201cYeah. The real  limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price.  That\u2019s the real limit. So that\u2019s where \u2014 we\u2019re going to talk about \u2014 a  lot more about this on Battery Day because this is a fundamental scaling  constraint. And any part of that supply chain or processing at the cell  level will be a limiting factor. So whatever it may be, anywhere from  mining to refining \u2014 there\u2019s many steps from refining to cathode and  anode, cell formation. Whatever the choke point is, that will set the  growth rate. And so we expect to expand our business with Panasonic,  with CATL, with LG, possibly with others, and there\u2019s a lot more to say  on that front on Battery Day.\u201d-Elon Musk\n\n\u201cWell,  I\u2019d just like to re-emphasize, any mining companies out there, please  mine more nickel. Okay. Wherever you are in the world, please mine more  nickel and don\u2019t wait for nickel to go back to some long \u2014 some high  point that you experienced some five years ago, whatever.

So hopefully this message goes out to all mining companies. Please get  nickel.\u201d-Elon Musk\n\n\u201cLike the thing  that bugs me the most about where we are right now is that our cars are  not affordable enough. We need to fix that. So we\u2019re all making  progress in that regard, just sort of steadily gaining progress. So  yeah, we need to not go bankrupt, obviously. That\u2019s important, because  then we\u2019ll fail in our mission. But we\u2019re not trying to be super  profitable either, obviously, profitability is like 1% or something,  just 1% or 2%. It\u2019s not crazy. Last quarter, it was only like 0.1%. So  we want to be profitable. Like I think just we want to be like slightly  profitable and maximize growth, and make the cars as affordable as  possible, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to achieve.\u201d-Elon Musk\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nBattery Breakdown\n\n[Battery Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/c7y5dnf6qpn51.png?width=1569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aad56c9de0e857425b200fe5be9a57456dabb22e)\n\n**Philippe Houchois \u2014 Jefferies \u2014 Analyst**\n\n\u201cYes,  good afternoon. Thank you. You mentioned a few times about the  constraint to growth is battery capacity still. And I was hoping you  could clarify the scope of the Berlin plant you\u2019re building right now.  Will there be \u2014 the battery capacity consistent with the amount of  assembly volume you expect to come out of Berlin? And if not, will you  be able to source your battery requirements out of Europe? Will you have  to import batteries from outside Europe to ensure production in Berlin?\n\nElon Musk \u2014 Chief Executive Officer\n\nOkay.  We can\u2019t say too much about this, except that there will be local cell  production, and that will serve the needs of the Berlin factory.

Historically, we all know  mines have run into trouble with being friendly toward the environment.  Today more than ever, a company's concern for the environment must be  vocally expressed and physically acknowledged. If not, the reporters and  media will bash Tesla for not being environmentally sensitive. Elon  Musk understands this and is aware that the nickel company Tesla chooses  must at least appear as if they are environmentally \u201csensitive\". Vale\u2019s  website has information on how they are [sustainable](http://www.vale.com/EN/investors/information-market/annual-reports/sustainability-reports/Sustainability%20Reports/Relatorio_sustentabilidade_vale_2019_alta_en.pdf) and [conscious](http://www.vale.com/esg/en/Pages/Home.aspx) of the controversies surrounding the mining industry.\n\n\u201cGiven  Tesla\u2019s focus on sustainability, the company is likely to prefer to buy  from miners of higher-grade nickel sulphide, which requires less power  to process than laterite ore, said Lachlan Shaw of National Australia  Bank.\u201d-Reuters, Yilei Sun, Melanie Burton\u201cThere are three key suppliers -  Brazil's Vale VALE3.SA, which operates in Canada using some hydropower,  Russia's Norilsk Nickel GMKN.MM and BHP Group's operations BHP.AX in  Western Australia. **\"**[**Vale**](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/please-mine-more-nickel-musk-urges-as-tesla-boosts-production-2020-07-23) **is in the box seat,\"** he said.\u201d-Reuters, Yilei Sun, Melanie Burton\n\nJust  the appearance and attempt to be environmental is enough to scare away  most journalists who are looking to make a hit piece on Tesla.

Actually, it is happening now and it will only go exact in 2022. There are also indications (transiting Neptune opposite natal Neptune) that there is a lot of deception in the media and things related to communication (Post Office). That deception will end at the same time as the Pluto return in February of 2022. So, if you can mark your calendar ahead, you might want to be out of the market by the end of 2021. January-February will be a disappointing time for the markets and a lot of things will come to a head involving secret enemies of the US and big reveals.

        "selftext": "Wells Fargo has seemingly gone from one of America's most reliable and respected banks to one of its most maligned and mistrusted companies in a mere four years, and the stock price has certainly reflected that fact. Since September of 2016, when the public first became aware of the company's fake accounts scandal, shares have dropped by over 45%, the company is on its fourth different CEO, they announced a dividend cut for the first time since the great recession, they've been fined $150 million to go along with a $3 billion legal settlement, and regulators have instituted an unprecedented asset cap on the bank as a punishment. It's gotten to the point where even Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, loyal shareholders for over 30 years, have reduced their position by over 60% since the end of last year.\n\nBuy the stock.\n\nMany investors seem to have an aversion to buying stocks in companies that are struggling, despite this sentiment going directly against some of the most timeless investment advice ever from Benjamin Graham: \"the intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists\". Perhaps this quote didn't do well enough to acknowledge that pessimists have *reason* to be pessimistic in most cases. A good investment, therefore, isn't a company with no struggles, but one whose struggles are overstated within the market price. This is the case with WFC.\n\nWhile the bank's asset cap and the federal funds rate hitting 0% again have been major headwinds for Wells, this presents the best buying opportunity to get into the very favorable financials industry since the Great Recession. For the first time in what feels like forever, the bank has management in place with a realistic view of the challenges faced by the company and an actual plan to overcome those challenges and once again return to growth. New CEO Charlie Scharf has outlined plans to remove the asset cap, cut costs by $10 billion (for what's already amongst the most capitally efficient banks in America), and repair the bank's reputation in the eyes of consumers.\n\nWhile we're on the subject of Scharf, I'd like to convey just how impressive his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is, and how excited WFC shareholders should be about the hire. Scharf began his management career working alongside business legends Jamie Dimon, Sandy Weill, and Bob Lipp, helping the three build Commercial Credit, which turned into Travelers Group, then Citigroup. After following Dimon in his move to Chase Bank, Scharf eventually became the CEO of Visa, where he had a phenomenal run before stepping down to work at the Bank of New Yerk Mellon. There, at BNY, he was referred to as the \"best CEO of the bank since Alexander Hamilton\". During his time with Visa and BNY, he likely worked closely at times with Warren Buffett, as Berkshire Hathaway had large stakes in each company. As a board member at Microsoft, he probably spent much time working alongside another legendary capitalist in Bill Gates. To put it simply, Scharf has spent his entire career learning from legends and titans of industry, and success seems to follow him wherever he goes. If anyone can turn around the trajectory of Wells Fargo, it's Charlie Scharf.\n\nFrankly, however, I'd likely be bullish on the stock regardless of the CEO's credentials. In the words of Peter Lynch \"Go for a business that any idiot can run - because sooner or later any idiot is probably going to run it.\" Since the global financial crisis, all banks with over $50 billion in assets go through regular stress tests from the Federal Reserve. Banks are probably the most regulated companies in American capitalism. To put it bluntly, it's damn near impossible to destroy a company that's micromanaged by the federal government at every turn, and in the event that it does happen, Wells Fargo is designated as \"too big to fail\" and would be the recipient of a government bailout in a heartbeat. Scharf's technical experience and leadership ability are bonuses, not requirements.\n\nSo, with all of that being said, what do WFC's future prospects actually look like? The remainder of 2020 and the whole of 2021 are likely to be very tough times for the entire economy, and banks are no different in that regard. Furthermore, given the asset cap restricting the growth of the bank, Wells likely won't return to 2019 levels of earnings until 2023. Wells Fargo is a stock for long-term investors to say the least. After that, however, let's presume that under the visionary leadership of Scharf and by factoring in share buybacks, the bank increases earnings per share at a rate slightly above average for the broader banking industry (typically 9% per year), and grows by 9.5% per year. If everything goes according to plan, the bank's EPS could grow beyond $10 by 2030. \"If everything goes to plan\" is a very dangerous game to play when investing, I will concede, but if my prediction is accurate, and we assume a future P/E of 15.5, the stock would increase to a level of $155+/share by that point, signaling upside of about 560% by 2030 before factoring in dividends. That equates to over 20% annualized ROI.\n\nI'll say it again: buy the stock.",

        "selftext": "While Square is currently looking up at the [top-100 stock](https://assetdash.com/), it\u2019s not so far-fetched to think that the company could easily surpass many of the size of many of today\u2019s biggest banks and financial institutions. At the time of this writing, Square has a market cap of $69 billion, while a financial giant like JPMorgan Chase is more than 4.5 times bigger, valued at $313 billion. As a payment processor, Square could even target Visa, and its $420 billion market cap. Will Square take all of Visa\u2019s customers tomorrow? No. But, as technology proves to be invaluable to the financial world, Square will slowly begin to eat away at the customer base held by outdated, bloated financial institutions.\u00a0\n\n## Square innovates away the competition\n\nThere is no denying that digital banking is the future of commerce. It\u2019s not just that the coronavirus pandemic has forced the hand of so many consumers and businesses [into digital banking](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/17/current-sees-insane-growth-during-pandemic-as-essential-workers-sign-up-for-accounts.html), it's that Millenials and Gen Z don\u2019t just view mobile banking as a nice feature, they see it as an absolute need. According to a PWC study, 67% of Millenials are already using, or are considering using mobile banking, compared to 60% of Gen X and 46% of Baby Boomers. Luckily, this is where Square excels. The company has invested heavily into mobile banking and payment processing solutions. It has been helping companies process payments with a smartphone since 2010 and has improved on its offerings since then.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that Square is ahead in digital banking, unlike some of its counterparts, Square is ahead of the curve in digital currency adoption as well. The company already [has a patent](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-accepted-everyw-square-wins-134507802.html) on technology that allows merchants to accept payments in cryptocurrency.\n\n## Next stop, banking\n\nRecently, the company received approval from the FDIC to open its own bank, [Square Financial Services](https://squareup.com/us/en/whats-new/bank). By 2021, Square is expected to provide small businesses with an array of banking products. Banking is the next logical move for Square, which will easily be able to integrate mobile banking, point-of-sale (POS) and its other technology directly with its financial service offerings.\n\n##",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 9, 2020**\n\nStocks shot up today and recovered some losses after sharp declines in big tech stocks. After several red days, shares of Amazon (AAPL), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and other big companies rallied. On a sour note, reopening stocks (travel, cruise lines, airlines, hotels, etc) were down after AstraZeneca (AZN) announced it had its COVID-19 vaccine trial paused.\n\nThe S&amp;P finished 2.08% up, the Nasdaq was 2.92%, leading the day, and the Dow finished 1.68% up. The volatility index (VIX) was down 4.8%, indicating increased risk appetite in traders.\n\nToday, it was announced that AstraZeneca, a forerunner in the development of the COVID vaccine announced a pause of their experimental trial after one patient became more ill, pledging to make safety a priority and take the time necessary to let science prevail. This setback comes in stark contrast to politicians and governments who seem to imply a cure is just around the corner. Shares of AstraZeneca sank 2%, while those of companies competing to develop a Covid-19 vaccine including Moderna (MRNA) and Novavax (NVAX) rose.\n\nUS oil prices plunged nearly 7% today, after Saudi Aramco, the largest oil producer in the world, announced it would be slashing its selling price to Asia and the United States, per Bloomberg. \"Oil demand globally is really sluggish. All of the low hanging fruit from the global oil recovery has already happened,\" said Michael Tran, managing director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAsia-Us cargo rates are at the highest since March lows. For bulls evidence of a rebounding economy, for bears activity is fueled by liquidity and the shoe has yet to drop.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* After falling nearly 20% in the week, Tesla (TSLA) stock roared back today, finishing the day 10.9% up.\n* Big Commerce (BIGC) reported earnings today. While estimates were beaten, investors were not impressed. Stock is down 10% today (4% during session (6% after-hour)  \n\n   * EPS of -$0.38 v -$0.43 estimate\n   * Revenue of 36.3 million v 35.6 million estimate\n* Facebook (FB) underperformed the market, finishing a modest 0.94% up.\n* Precious metals were up today, with gold miners ($GDX) leading, up 4.34%. Silver was up 1.58% and gold was 0.92% up.\n* McConnell announced plans to unveil the new $300B relief bill and took procedural steps needed to set up a vote \"as soon as this week.\" Schumer and Pelosi said \"Republicans bill which doesn't come close to addressing the problems and is headed nowhere\"\n* Analyst Upgrades:  \n\n   * $MSFT Microsoft had a nice boost by Morgan Stanley $MS who raised its price target from $230 to $245\n   * $PTON Peloton had Price Target raised by Wedbush from $66 to $100\n   * $RPD Rapid7 Target raised by $MS Morgan Stanley $55 to $60 (nice stock check it out)\n   * $SFIX Stitch Fix initiated by Deutsche Bank at BUY with pt $34\n   * $SPCE Virgin Galactic Upgraded by Credit Suisse from $22 to $24 and NEUTRAL to OUTPERFORM.\n\nNotable Earnings for Tomorrow Thur Sept 10: Chewy CHWY (AH), Dave &amp; Busters PLAY (AH), Oracle ORCL (AH), Peloton PTON (AH)\n\nInteresting recent CEO purchase transactions: CWH $3MM, VST $750k, BKR $1MM, FRG $4.5MM, IVZ $3MM, SDC $10MM, PLAG $1.7MM",

        "selftext": "Title says it all.\n\nAt this point, $3,000 per year in tax deductions (single filer *and* married) is a drop in the bucket for almost anyone with assets invested in the market.  Between the volatility in March, June, and today, I'm sure many of us will have enough deductions to carry forward for the next few years, if not the remainder of our expected lifespan.\n\nFrom what I can tell, this $3k limit has been in set for at least [30 years](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/71031/1000519-Capital-Gains-Taxation.PDF) and never adjusted.  Assuming this deduction matched average inflation of around 3.22%, the limit should be closer to $7,750.  I believe it should probably $10k at least, if not higher.  And the limit should be doubled for joint married filers.\n\nThe past few years have shown that unless you put everything into real estate or the stonk market, you're going to suffer a loss due to inflation.  Earning .0042069% on your savings is a joke.  I keep thinking that the $.01 that gets deposited in my checking account each month is a rounding error, or someone from Nigeria just checking to make sure the account is active before their prince deposits the $12 million I was promised from that email I received.\n\nI'm not sure what needs to happen to effect this change, but of all the strings that have been pulled in recent years related to income taxes, it seems negligent to have left the $3,000 limit static.\n\n[I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it any more!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUY05_ZwFzg)",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 14th, 2020.\n\n# **Investors will look to the Fed to soothe the market next week, but that may be a tall order  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/11/investors-will-look-to-the-fed-to-soothe-the-market-next-week-but-that-may-be-a-tall-order.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Markets are looking to the Federal Reserve to be a soothing force when it meets in the week ahead, but stocks could remain choppy if the central bank disappoints and as investors focus on the election and the economic recovery.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is expected to end Wednesday with minor tweaks to its statement and some clarity on how it plans to use forward guidance. The Fed also updates its economic and interest rate outlook, including forecasts for 2023 for the first time.\n*****\n&gt; But Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential Financial, said the stock market could easily be disappointed because the Fed is unlikely to offer more clarity on monetary policy, such as plans for bond buying.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is concerned the Fed is not going to give us explicit readings on their plans for monetary policy,\u2033 she said. The Fed\u2019s extraordinary policies have been an important factor behind the stock market\u2019s 50% surge from the March 23 low, and it\u2019s also seen as a major factor limiting the depth of the market\u2019s sell-off.\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the Fed is not likely to tweak much and it continues to buy $80 billion a month in Treasurys. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do anything to the markets either way,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were volatile in the past week, falling hard, rallying, falling and rallying again. That left the S&amp;P 500 with a weekly decline of about 2.5%, its worst week since June. The harder hit Nasdaq was down about 4.1% for the week, its worst weekly decline since March. The quadruple expiration of options and futures at the end of the coming week could add to the volatility.\n*****\n&gt; Bank of America strategists said the bond market is watching the Fed for any balance sheet adjustments and the changes to its forward guidance, which includes the Fed\u2019s recent tweak in its inflation policy. The Fed changed its policy of focusing on a target inflation rate to an average rate, meaning it may not tighten policy if inflation overshoots its 2% target.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe see risk the rates market is underwhelmed by the guidance provided by the Fed, which would support higher back-end rates and a steeper curve,\u201d the Bank of America strategists noted. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slid in the past week, touching 0.67% Friday, and it could move higher, meaning bonds may sell-off, if the Fed does not clarify policy around its bond buying program.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the stock market is hoping for a dovish Fed. \u201cThe market needs that now because fiscal policy is going nowhere,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; BTIG strategist Julian Emanuel said the market could focus on the fact that Congress failed to make headway on fiscal stimulus, if the economic data begins to disappoint.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales for August are expected Wednesday morning, as the Fed meets. They are expected to rise by 1%, and that should be an important look at whether the lack of enhanced unemployment benefits, which expired July 31, impacted consumer spending. Among other things, Republicans and Democrats could not agree how to replace the $600 weekly payment to the unemployed.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cDepending on the polls and the economic data, the probability of stimulus rises and falls,\u201d said Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur view is that next week is just going to be lots of back and forth with the potential for a further extension of the range for the downside, if the political narrative gets more inflamed,\u201d said Emanuel. Emanuel expects the market to remain choppy and fall further into the month of October, as investors worry about the uncertainty around the presidential election.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s meeting this week is its last before the election, and analysts expect Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to sound reassuring that the Fed will do whatever it takes to support the economy. Powell holds a briefing after the meeting Wednesday, and he is expected to also be asked about the potential for higher inflation. The Fed has said it is more concerned about disinflation, but recent inflation data has been hotter than expected, though still well below 2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere is a tug of war between those who say buy chips now because inflation is moving higher, versus those why are saying deflationary forces are still weaving their way into the economy,\u201d said Krosby.\n*****\n&gt; Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said he expects the Fed to sound reassuring but it\u2019s not likely to discuss a target for bond purchases or the yield curve controls some investors were hoping for. Yield curve control would mean the Fed would try to manage interest rates by targeting its purchases of specific Treasurys. For instance, it may focus on trying to keep longer duration yields lower, and buy the 10-year.\n*****\n&gt; Chandler also noted the Fed\u2019s $7 trillion balance sheet has recently declined by about $100 billion from its peak, and its bond purchases are falling behind the European Central Bank.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy sense is the Fed is going to keep saying it\u2019s not worried about inflation. Its bigger worry is downside risks. They\u2019ll repeat their call for fiscal stimulus which after this week seems less likely,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Chandler said the stock market could remain choppy in the coming week, but he does not expect a sharp selloff. The dollar could decline, if the Fed sounds dovish, and that is a positive for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t think a 10% pullback [in Nasdaq] has caused enough pain to have people capitulate. This is just an ordinary correction, and we\u2019re going to make new highs,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N5HwCxp.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jr7e4gT.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/z7gtiCt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tgPKm6Y/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LUUHMDE.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CWgjO92.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/c37y9mp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Eau1B5A.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Mp84zhth/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SHieVRq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/fTBYdV6v/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/05GY8WnF/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/qMk8gsZR/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election Charts You Need To See: Part 1\n\n&gt; First off, our thoughts go out to everyone who was impacted by the tragic events of September 11, 2001\u201419 years ago today. It is a day to reflect and remember those who were lost.\n\n&gt; One of the top requests we\u2019ve had here at LPL Research is for more charts on the election. Over the next week, we will share some of our favorite charts on this very important subject.\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s how the S&amp;P 500 Index performs under various presidents and congressional makeups. The best scenario has historically been a Democratic president and Republican Congress, while a Republican president and Democratic Congress has been the weakest.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Building on this, a split Congress historically has been one of the best scenarios for investors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The best scenario under a Republican president is a split Congress, a potential positive for 2020 that has played out after the massive reversal in the stock market since March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Looking at the four-year presidential cycle shows that stocks haven\u2019t been down during a year the president was up for a re-election since FDR in the 1940s, another bullish tailwind for 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s another look at this, as stocks historically have done much better when there isn\u2019t a lame duck president.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Active Managers Do an About Face\n\n&gt; The National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) has an index which tracks the exposure of its members to US equity markets. Each week, members are asked to provide a number that represents their exposure to markets. A reading of -200 means they are leveraged short, -100 indicates fully short, 0 is neutral, 100% is fully invested, and 200% indicates leveraged long. Two weeks ago, in our Bespoke Report, we highlighted the fact that the exposure index had moved to one of the highest levels in its 15-year history. Now, just two weeks later, these same active managers have reigned in their exposure considerably as this week's reading dropped from just under 100 to 53.1.\n\n&gt; This week's drop was the second-largest one week decline in the index's history and just the 10th time that the index lost more than a third (33 points) in a single week. The most recent occurrence was back in early March in the middle of the Covid crash, and every other prior period where the index saw a similar drop, the S&amp;P 500 was also down every time by an average of 2.3%. Therefore, it's not much of a surprise to see the big drop this week given the big declines in the market. But what about going forward? Do big drops in the NAAIM Index mean a bounce back for markets or further declines?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/091120-NAAIM.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Most and Least Heavily Shorted Stocks in the Russell 1,000\n\n&gt; Below is an updated look at the most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000. Each of these 30 stocks has at least 15% of its equity float sold short.\n\n&gt; At the top of the list is Nordstrom (JWN) with 38.66% of its float sold short. With a YTD decline of 61.86%, the shorts have crushed it with JWN this year.\n\n&gt; With its huge portfolio of office and retail real estate, Brookfield Property REIT(BPYU) has the second highest short interest in the Russell 1,000 at 33.7%. BPYU is down 35.7% YTD.\n\n&gt; There are plenty of other well-known companies on the list of the most heavily shorted stocks. Examples include American Airlines (AAL), Virgin Galactic (SPCE), LendingTree (TREE), Wayfair (W), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), ADT, TripAdvisor (TRIP), Beyond Meat (BYND), and Kohl's (KSS).\n\n&gt; One name that is no longer on the list of most shorted stocks is Tesla (TSLA). When we provided an update on short interest back in February (a pre-COVID world), Tesla (TSLA) had more than 17% of its float sold short, but that number is all the way down to 8.3% as of the most recent filing.\n\n&gt; These 30 stocks with the highest short interest are down an average of 3.01% since last Wednesday (9/2) when the S&amp;P 500 made its last closing high. That's actually a little bit better than the 3.55% average decline for the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000. And year-to-date, these 30 stocks are up an average of 0.60% versus an average gain of 0.81% for the rest of the index. That's not much of a difference!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/most-heavily-shorted.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a list of the 30 least shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 as a percentage of equity float. None of these stocks have more than 0.71% of their float sold short, and they're mostly made up of more conservative names in the Health Care and Consumer Staples sectors.\n\n&gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) has the lowest short interest as a percentage of float in the Russell 1,000 at just 0.36%. Microsoft (MSFT) -- one of the key mega-cap Tech names -- has the second lowest short interest, followed by Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Medtronic (MDT).\n\n&gt; Somewhat surprisingly, Amazon (AMZN) is the sixth least shorted stock in the entire Russell 1,000. While AMZN is still thought of as a high-flying momentum name by many investors, its short interest levels tell a much different story, painting it as more of a non-cyclical stock like Pepsi (PEP), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), or Coca- Cola (KO).\n\n&gt; While the 30 most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up 0.60% YTD, the 30 least shorted stocks in the index are up much more at +8%. This group has MSFT, AMZN, HD, and AAPL to thank for that strong performance!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/leastshorted.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Lessons Learned About Rising Rates\n\n&gt; While the direction of the 10-year Treasury yield over the last cycle was decidedly lower, as shown in LPL\u2019s Chart of the Day, there were still six extended periods where it rose at least 0.75%, and in two of those it rose almost 2%. Looking ahead, economic growth below potential, slack in the labor market, and an extremely supportive Federal Reserve (Fed) may limit rate pressure in the near term, but with interest rates already low and massive stimulus in place, we believe the overall direction is likely to be higher.\n\n&gt; \u201cEven in a falling rate period there are lessons from the last cycle about rising rates,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cAmong them: Careful when the Fed stops buying and sometimes the best defense is a good offense.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; While every economic cycle is unique, the last cycle highlighted these key takeaways about periods of rising rates:\n\n&gt; * **Careful when the Fed stops buying.**  The two drivers of rising rates last cycle were economic growth and Fed bond purchases, also known as quantitative easing (QE). The Fed buys bonds to keep rates down, but the start of Fed buying has actually been the time when rates rise\u2014likely on expectations that the purchases would help strengthen the economy. These periods also often followed large rate declines either because markets anticipated the start of Fed buying or the economy was faltering. The takeaway: unless the economy is really taking off, any rising-rate period may pause for an extended period, or even reverse, when the Fed backs off bond purchases.\n&gt; * **Sometime the best defense is a good offense.** Lower-quality, more economically sensitive bond sectors actually performed well during periods of rising rates during the last cycle. Rate gains were largely driven by economic improvement rather than a large pick-up in inflation, and that\u2019s typically a good environment for sectors like high-yield bonds and bank loans. The downside is that these are much riskier bond sectors and don\u2019t provide the potential diversification benefits of higher-quality bonds during periods of stock declines.\n&gt; * **Don\u2019t expect TIPS to provide much resilience because of their inflation adjustment.** Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are high-quality bonds that have provided a little extra insulation against rising rates compared to similarly dated Treasuries when inflation expectations increased. TIPS prices are adjusted for inflation, but even with the adjustment, they are still very sensitive to rates.\n&gt; * **Investment-grade corporates can both hurt and help.** If credit spreads narrow when rates are rising, investment-grade corporates can post some solid gains in a rising-rate environment, but if spreads are holding steady or even widening, they can be very sensitive to changes in Treasury yields, potentially (although not often) even more sensitive than Treasuries.\n&gt; * **Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)** have not provided as much insulation as corporates, but they also have had less downside. While MBS have certainly outperformed Treasuries during periods of rising rates, they have not performed as well as investment-grade corporates. But they also have come with less downside, losing only 1.4% in their worst performing period compared to a 4% loss during the worst period for corporates.\nWith the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher. We are playing some offense with our equity exposure, which allows us to emphasize a focus on higher-quality bonds. Among bond sectors, we are emphasizing MBS and still prefer investment-grade corporates over Treasuries. History may not repeat, but if it rhymes, this positioning may help add resilience to a fixed income portfolio if rates extend their move off recent lows.\n\n&gt; With the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher.

Below we take a look at the best and worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 since the 9/2 high for the S&amp;P. For each stock, we also include its YTD total return and its percentage change from the 3/23 COVID Crash low through 9/2.\n\n&gt; Capri Holdings (CPRI) is up more than any other stock in the Russell 1,000 since 9/2 with a gain of 17.43%. Even after the recent gains, however, Capri -- the holding company for brands like Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo, and Versace -- is still down 52.9% year-to-date.\n\n&gt; Only four other stocks are up more than 10% since 9/2 -- Beyond Meat (BYND), PVH, Virtu Financial (VIRT), and Reinsurance Group (RGA). Interestingly, BYND and VIRT are also up big (~80%) year-to-date, while PVH and RGA are both down more than 35% year-to-date.\n\n&gt; What stands out the most about the list of winners is that only one Technology stock made the cut -- Sabre (SABR). Most names come from the two consumer sectors including cruise-liners like Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise (NCLH), Kohl's (KSS), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Six Flags (SIX), Foot Locker (FL), and Ralph Lauren (RL). Both UBER and LYFT also made the cut with gains of 6% since 9/2. The 30 biggest winners since 9/2 are still down an average of 20% year-to-date, while the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up an average of 1.46% YTD.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/bestsince92.png))**\n\n&gt; While only one Technology stock made the list of biggest winners since 9/2, the sector accounts for two-thirds of the 30 biggest losers over the same time frame. As shown below, since 9/2, the six worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 and ten of the worst twelve all come from Tech. Notably, though, these 30 stocks that have all fallen more than 12% since 9/2 are still up an average of 5.6% YTD. Were it not for the horrid YTD performance of the Energy stocks that made the list, the average YTD gain would be even higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/worstsince92.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Typical Early September Weakness Recovers Mid-Month Sells Off Month-End\n\n&gt; As of yesterday\u2019s close the market was down more than the historical average performance in September. DJIA was down nearly -3.3%, S&amp;P 500 was down -4.8%, NASDAQ was off 7.9%, Russell 1000 was down -5.2% and Russell 2000 lost 3.7%. Today\u2019s rally looks like the beginning of a textbook mid-month recovery rally However, the second half of September has historically been weaker than the first half. The week after options expiration week can be treacherous with S&amp;P 500 logging 23 weekly losses in 30 years since 1990. End-of-quarter portfolio restructuring, and window dressing can amplify the impacts of any negative headlines.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/75a927aee973e2c31a0d76ff0be15d59/fa78a7e1d90fbdef-fe/s500x750/8f217c04559740d2db6c24b7ea855ecd579ec195.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending September 11th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKS55-50q60))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 9.13.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$FDX** \n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$CBRL** \n&gt; * **$ASPU** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$DAVA** \n&gt; * **$BRC** \n&gt; * **$CMD** \n&gt; * **$ISR** \n&gt; * **$APOG** \n&gt; * **$ICMB** \n&gt; * **$HMY** \n&gt; * **$VNCE** \n&gt; * **$CSBR** \n&gt; * **$EARS** \n&gt; * **$AFIB** \n&gt; * **$OSH**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Mp84zhth/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/3JGV5KjX/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1LCuH7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  9.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/IU3xGVJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 9.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EOC9Qwy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/faX2lNR.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/CdwssKa.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.18.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # FedEx Corp. $232.79\n**FedEx Corp.

        "selftext": "At the start of this week, it was announced that ITV's stock had fallen out of the FTSE 100. This was in part due to a decrease in marketing revenue and also due to the fact that ITV has had to halt many of its longstanding TV programmes such as Coronation Street/Emmerdale/I'm a Celebrity. In response to this, the stock is now selling (as of 4/9/20) at just over 40% of what it was on the 31st of December (151 to 63). This correction seems dramatic considering the fact that the world will have to go back to normal in the next year or two (Even with this time frame I am being conservative) due to the drop in deaths in Covid-19 cases we are seeing despite lockdown measure being lifted. Therefore, it could be deduced from a study of their annual reports that ITV may be the perfect buy especially now that they are establishing their brand internationally and teaming up with the BBC as part of the BritBox venture. Furthermore, at the end of the year, they will be launching their Planet V marketing service which will align advertisers content with specific themes shown in episodes which will surely add value to the ITV brand. What do you all think of my logic? Is now the time to buy?",

        "selftext": "Now, to preface I'm an Aussie, so I'm not 100% familiar with WSB customs. But here is why OTCMKTS: LLKKF (Lake Resources) has been spiking up so hard over the past few days (78%). The equivalent to ASX:LKE, which is being heavily discussed on the ASX.  \n\nFor the uninitiated, LLKKF is Lake Resources and is dual-listed on the ASX (The Australian Stock Exchange). Now on the 15th of September LLKKF released a very interesting article, collaborating with Novonix (ASX: NVX), who are well-known to be very strongly affiliated with Tesla through renowned lithium-ion battery innovator Jeff Dahn (who has been working with Tesla since 2016), with many of NVX's employees emanating from Dahn's Laboratory and being previous Tesla Employees (https://smallcaps.com.au/novonix-tesla-collaboration-rumours-commercialisation-plans-research-breakthrough/). \n\nhttps://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20200915/pdf/44mn2fl8t3mqmv.pdf\n\nIn this article, they state that:\n\n*\"Clean Lithium Producer Lake Resources NL announced today further progress towards the development of sustainable, high-purity lithium, following confirmation that Hazen Research, and independent assay laboratory, is well advanced in producing initial larger samples of battery quality lithium carbonate.\"*\n\nAND\n\n*\"Under the agreement with Novonix Limited (ASX:NVX), lithium carbonate samples provided by Lake will be used together with commercial battery cathode precursor materials to form an NMC622 cathode and battery\". Novonix is currently developing 'million mile' battery technologies with revolutionary anode and cathode materials.\"*\n\nOk, so what does this mean. It means that LLKKF are planning to supply Lithium resources to NVX, who are in the process of designing million-mile battery technology (and possess a known affiliation with Tesla). But more importantly, LLKKF is one of the few Lithium Producers that can acquire 'green' lithium through disruptive technology, by using a direct extraction process (ESG), and is one of the handful of companies globally to do so. We also know that Elon has placed heavy emphasis on the demand for an \u201cenvironmentally friendly\u201d mine. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjnmXW02BK8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe-UVqf_Agw\n\nSo currently, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL), which supplies lithium iron phosphate batteries to Tesla Inc, will pay C$8.5 million ($6.5 million) for its stake in Toronto-based Neo Lithium. \n\nHowever, let's compare Neo Lithium to LLKKF.\n\n**NeoLithium**\n- The economic analysis of the PFS is based on average lithium carbonate pricing over the life of mine is ~US$11,882/t\n- Battery grade lithium carbonate with 99.599% purity achieved.\n- evaporation pond model (non-ESG)\n\n**LakeResources**\n- US$11,000/t\n- 99.961% purity\n- DLE - direct extraction model (ESG)\n\nNeo Lithium are developing evaporation pond operations, and aim to produce 99.5% lithium carbonate, and are located at higher altitude than the Kachi project. High altitudes cause significant power de-rating in fossil fuel generators.\n\n\u201dAccording to the feasibility studies of six lithium developers, recovery rates vary from 52% (Neo Lithium) to 90% (Standard Lithium). The expected recovery rate at Kachi is 83%. Lake Resources is expected to recover a third more of their lithium resource than Neo Lithium will theirs.\u201d\n\nThere is a BIG DIFFERENCE IN PURITY...and inconsistently, PFS\u2019s average Lithium Carbonate pricing:\nLLKKF only US$11,000/t for &gt;99.9%\nNeo Lithium US$11,882 for 99.5%\n\nThis presents a very powerful opportunity for LLKKF to provide Lithium to CATL, and by connection Tesla. Furthermore, the company that LLKKF is collaborating NVX, has known ties with Tesla as mentioned above, which gives them a direct line to Tesla. \n\nAnyways that's my Aussie DD. G'night from DownUnder.",

And so on. \n\nI say it in advance - all the shit talk about how its not a buyout does not matter - I don't care if ORCL would even lose money from the deal. \n\nWhat matters is how Trump is gonna pitch it to the public.\n\nCalls on ORCL.",

        "selftext": "Now listen up, this isn't going to be the best DD you've ever seen. I'm busy.\n\nThis company used to be called Uragold Bay Resources but changed its named to HPQ Silicon Resources, after spinning out its gold division.\n\nHere's an excerpt from their website:  \n\n\n&gt;HPQ Silicon Resources INC. is a TSX-V listed (Symbol HPQ) resource company that focuses on becoming a producer of nano silicon materials, and nanowires for use in silicon metal applications in diverse global market sectors.\n\nHPQ is working with Pyrogenesis on a game changing technology. Who's Pyrogenesis? They're an advanced plasma company that has contracts with the US military and many more companies.\n\nNow over a decade ago, there was a company named Timminco who claimed to be able to do what HPQ is seeking out to do.\n\nCheck out this stock's history:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TIMNF/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TIMNF/)\n\nIt went from a penny stock all the way to $30. \n\nThe issue this company had is that they could not scale on an industrial scale.  \n\n\n&gt;This was the place where Timminco Ltd., until recently a little-known producer of low-grade industrial metals, said it had solved the solar industry's supply problem. Here, in B\u00e9cancour, it had developed a proprietary process to produce solar-grade silicon much more cheaply than anyone else. That promise had propelled Timminco shares from less than 30 cents to more than $22 by the end of 2007, earning it plaudits as the top-performing stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange that year. The company's market value would soon surpass $3.5-billion. \n\nTimminco's chart alone made me invest into this company initially because it'd be incredible to be on such a ride.\n\nThe solar and battery industries are continually growing, and HPQ, like Timminco, are saying that they are able to produce solar-grade silicon at a much cheaper cost than current methods.\n\nOn a small scale, HPQ has shown that they are able to produce 2N to 4N silicon from low quality quartz metal which is incredible and will change the game forever... IF they are able to do it on an industrial scale.\n\nThere were many delays but the pilot plant is built. We have yet to hear their latest findings.\n\nIn the mean time, they have 2 NDA's signed with other companies in regards to their product. Many are hoping its Tesla. Could be, but it's not necessary for HPQ's success. Being able to convert low quality quartz into 4N silicon on a large scale will change the solar industry forever, making it much more affordable.\n\nTo finish things off, they have a partnership with a French solar company Apollon. Their latest NR suggests they will also be working on another industry:  \n\n\n&gt;HPQ and Apollon Solar Extend Agreement to Work on Porous Silicon for Batteries and Expand Collaboration to Include Hydrogen Production  \n&gt;  \n&gt; *The addition of manufacturing hydrogen by hydrolysis to our collaboration opens up a new and unique business opportunity that could represent a* [***second multibillion-dollar*** ***addressable market***](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=x7BsefzKh0RM5mLy50SQnfkrPrlAeJux1o3-uQWKZ3_dYuE0j_jnnjcsmUqeiwYn7xTHUf8PFoVtPfr72B95_DxDcpv8V8YCwlaVpphdgHSFXastUVEHmNn_-GfSPUzkAiuXx-mRLGmbnSu0ZjW3hw==)*for the PUREVAPTM\u00a0Nano Silicon (Si) Reactor (\u201cNSiR\u201d) nanopowders.\u201d* \n\nThis isn't going to be the most organized DD because I've got shit to do. I've been holding stock in this company for years now. I'm already in the positive but I figured I'd add something to this subreddit as I keep seeing the same tickers and this one is very different.\n\nIf you want me to post another pennystock that I'm in, please let me know.",

        "selftext": "First off just a disclaimer: I own HCAC commons. I am generally bullish on the company and I think the stock is a good buy with it trading so close to NAV. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe all know there's two major factors that drive a stock's price, especially with SPACs.\n\n1. Legitmacy as a company (Product, profitability, propeitary tech, etc.)\n2. Hype (Media presence, CEO's that excite the consumer, etc.)\n\nAnyone that has done any seblance of research on Canoo will generally conclude that the company has a lot of number 1. They are full of seasoned automotive veterans, capable engineers, and have produced amazing technology in a short amount of time (seriously, making your own powertrain from scratch is a huge undertaking).\n\nVeteran traders and investors will tell you that number 1 is the only thing you should be concerned with in the long term. In general, I believe this to be true and still think it applys here. However, for us interested in SPACs, Canoos complete and utter lack of number 2 should be concerning. \n\n**One question: how can a company that strives to be an innovative \"lifestyle\" brand geared towards young city consumers be successul if it fails to promote itself in the ways that are important to the people that would be subscribing to it?**\n\nBefore you say: \"well they're going to make money selling technology to other OEMs (such as Hyundai).\" Let me ask you this, why would they make the subscription model and car/bus/thing such a talking point if they didn't fully intend to have the subscription service a large part of their revenue?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMissed hype opportunity 1: Jay Leno's Garage\n\nHow many start ups can you name that get a complete segment featuring their flagship model and technology with the worlds most famous auto-enthusiest? This entire video is a CRINGE-fest. Jay Leno tried his hardest to make the conversations interesting and compelling but the entire thing fell flat. By the way people at Canoo talk about their product, you'd think they don't give two shits. They are THAT boring. This is again because Canoo has lots of number 1, none of number 2. Watch the video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FIViMSeigM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FIViMSeigM) \n\nMissed hype opportunity 2: Social Media and Skateboard day\n\nDo you know how many people follow Canoos twitter? Any guesses? A little over 5000. Their instagram is much better at over 17k but their outreach is still less than impressive. They've been advertising their \"Skateboard day,\" NONE of which include anything about how to watch, what might be possibly included, etc. The post annoucing Skateboard day has 700 likes; there's over 700 people from this subreddit alone online as I type this. They're being secretive about this for what? What ground-breaking news could they possibly share tomorrow that will somehow reach the masses? My guess: Skateboard day will come and go with a VERY small pump to the stock just becuase there is no press on this event. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are some of the biggest issues I took with, but in my opinion there should be a complete overhaul of their marketing team. For a forward looking, innovative brand, they're doing very little to market it as such. I wanna hear thoughts from major HCAC bulls, maybe I'm missing some key things.",

The announcement will be coming in 1-3 weeks, with current upside potential being a solid swing play, or long hold.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Who is Worksport?**\n\nWorksport (WKSP) is a Toronto based company that manufactures high quality, cost-effective tonneau covers for truck beds. It is the revenue-generating subsidiary of Franchise Holdings International and holds the patent to the TerraVis System which is the solar-power tonneau cover for truck beds.\n\nSource: [Worksport Website](https://worksport.com/us/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Well, what is a tonneau cover and why is it important?**\n\nTonneau covers are the #1 accessory purchased for pickup trucks. As of 2019, Pickup trucks are the #1 selling automotive in the United States making up 19% of all vehicle sales in 2019. There are currently 56 million pickup trucks on the road with roughly 15 million new trucks are sold annually. 80% of all pickup trucks have after-market tonneau covers.\n\nSource: [Interview with CEO Steven Rossi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGR8Ws2-7Pg)\n\nSource: [Investor Presentation](https://franchiseholdingsinternational.com/media/investors-deck/)\n\nSource: [https://thedailychronicle.in/news/710880/truck-tonneau-covers-market-rising-demand-growth-trend-insights-for-next-5-years/](https://thedailychronicle.in/news/710880/truck-tonneau-covers-market-rising-demand-growth-trend-insights-for-next-5-years/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWorksport's mission is to design and engineer tonneaus best suited to the new and upcoming power-efficient light truck models that hold several U.S. Patents for their proprietary soft and hard-folding systems. Worksport also owns IP/patents on the plastic molds, aluminum dies, processes, and associated tools in building their tonneau systems.\n\nThey are also currently the only company that offers a B2B (business to business) and B2C (business to customer) focused on the light truck market and offering solar-power generating tonneau cover. Their main competition, Truck Hero, makes up a large part of the market sector but does not offer a competitor to the TerraVis system. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What\u2019s so important about the TerraVis system?**\n\nThe TerraVis System is currently the only after-market vehicle accessory that generates, stores, and transfers solar-power to the vehicle or external batteries. Worksport holds the patent for the solar-tonneau system and is currently filing sub-patents for various components of the system.\n\nHere are two videos of the system:\n\n[Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_9JP8t8jvw)\n\n[Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lInSYqxM2gY&amp;t=1s)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What\u2019s the hype?**\n\nWorksport announced they have entered into a $70 million OEM agreement with a U.S. based EV truck manufacturer to deliver their TerraVis system, with the likelihood of additional revenue moving forward. An official statement from the U.S. based EV Truck manufacturer on their purchase of the TerraVis tonneaus will be coming in mid-September. \n\nSource: [Global News Wire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/03/2088486/0/en/Worksport-Enters-into-US-70-Million-OEM-Agreement-for-TerraVis-with-US-Based-EV-Truck-Manufacturer.html)\n\nSource: [Nasdaq Announcement](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/worksporttm-enters-into-us-%2470-million-oem-agreement-for-terravistm-with-us-based-ev)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Who will it be? (Buy the Rumor, Sell the News)**\n\nThere are currently three rumors on who Worksport is contracted with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRumor 1: Rivian (Amazon backed-company)\n\nThe CEO of Worksport, Steven Rossi has previously corresponded with Rivian\u2019s founder RJ Scaring and Worksport\u2019s parent company FNHI has posted several articles praising the company in what would seem like a mutually beneficial partnership. \n\nSource: [https://franchiseholdingsinternational.com/best-renewable-energy-stocks-tesla-rivian-fnhi/](https://franchiseholdingsinternational.com/best-renewable-energy-stocks-tesla-rivian-fnhi/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRumor 2: Telsa\n\nElon Musk was quoted in late August stating that a solar-panel system on the Cybertruck would generate roughly 15 miles of range per day. This is an almost identical amount to what the TerraVis would provide. Additionally (and probably more compelling), Tesla will be holding it\u2019s acclaimed \u201cBattery Day\u201d on September 22nd, directly in the window of when the partnership should be announced. \n\nSource: [https://twitter.com/WorksportLtd/status/1300455472089239554](https://twitter.com/WorksportLtd/status/1300455472089239554)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRumor 3: Bollinger Motors\n\nOn Sept 4th, the CEO of Worksport retweeted an old update from Bollinger Motors Twitter (from July 27th) which stated \u201cLet\u2019s make something completely different than anyone else\u201d. \n\nSource: [https://twitter.com/StevenRossiWKSP/status/1301843534018945024](https://twitter.com/StevenRossiWKSP/status/1301843534018945024)\n\nAlthough these three are the strongest RUMORS, there are an array of other EV manufacturers that would still provide a huge upside for Worksport (Ford, GM, Lordstown, Nikola, etc.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why buy now?**\n\nCEO of Worksport tweeted this weekend to \u201cbe on the lookout\u201d for another Tuesday announcement. So this upside play could happen quicker than expected.\n\nSource: [https://twitter.com/StevenRossiWKSP/status/1302223503861710848](https://twitter.com/StevenRossiWKSP/status/1302223503861710848)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Positions: [40,000 shares](https://imgur.com/U2alARs)",

Alibaba's financial/payment platform, Ant financial, spun off years ago. What's so great about them? Imagine purchasing shares in Visa and PayPal simultaneously. Theyre virtually the only game in town in China. Theyre seeking more than 30 billion in their IPO, making this the largest IPO in history with way more upside than Aramco ( 2nd largest IPO ever). They've filed for an IPO but they've refused to list on the NYSE. How do you buy? Thats a two-fold answer....if you only have Robinhood or Webull than you're fucked (sorta). You need a legitimate platform like Etrade or Charles Schwab. If you give a shit, you'll figure it out. Whats the second way to buy you ask? Alibaba has a 30% stake in Ant and they're destined to rise alongside Ant. Pick a call and strike date at least 90 days out. Your upside using option 1 is much higher buy option 2 will still make you a solid return. Please post the gain porn if you follow my advice. I'll do the same.\n\nTLDR: Read it fuckface",

It shows the percentage increases when compared with August 2019. The charts show the width of the uptrends. The main point of interest is the increase in sustained volume on the charts, when compared with past years.\n\n* \"Generac propane generator\" - up 442% this year\n* \"Generac propane\" - up 245% this year\n* \"propane generator\" - up 21% this year\n* \"patio heater\" - up 236% this year\n* \"propane tank refill\" - up 11% this year\n* \"outdoor space heater\" - up 300% this year\n* \"propane tank\" - up 137% this year\n* \"propane\" - up 10% this year\n* \"propane grill\" - up 34% this year\n* \"gas stove\" - up 15% this year\n* \"gas stove near me\" - up 22% this year\n* \"portable stove\" - up 69% this year\n* \"propane camping stove\" - up 138% this year\n* \"propane camp stove\" - up 57% this year\n* \"suburban propane near me\" - up 90% this year\n* \"propane torch\" - up 18% this year\n* \"propane tank delivery near me\" - down 22% since this time last year, but higher volume overall\n\n**Google Trend Charts**\n\nIf you pull up these trend charts on google you will see that the seasonal spikes usually peak during Sept-Nov which is peak hurricane season. This year is different! This year we are seeing the spike come in late July and early August. A full month early! And not only is the spike starting early, but for some of these terms it is already higher than the previous peaks for the last five years!\n\n**Articles and Excerpts**\n\n* **Space &amp; Outdoor Heaters to Benefit from Outdoor Living Trends**  \n\"As temperatures drop, consumers will seek ways to make their outdoor living spaces more comfortable. In particular, [patio heating products (fire pits, fireplaces, and radiant heaters)](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2872700-1&amp;h=89755242&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freedoniagroup.com%2Findustry-study%2Foutdoor-furniture-grills-3811.htm&amp;a=patio+heating+products+(fire+pits%2C+fireplaces%2C+and+radiant+heaters))  \n, already a fast-growing outdoor living product, is expected to see a boost in demand.\u201d [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/what-new-covid-consumer-trends-can-you-expect-this-fall-301103813.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/what-new-covid-consumer-trends-can-you-expect-this-fall-301103813.html)\n* **Amid ventilation worries, schools mull outdoor classes during coronavirus pandemic**\n\n\"Some schools have equipped tents with propane heaters\u2026\"\n\n[**https://www.fox5dc.com/news/amid-ventilation-worries-schools-mull-outdoor-classes-during-coronavirus-pandemic**](https://www.fox5dc.com/news/amid-ventilation-worries-schools-mull-outdoor-classes-during-coronavirus-pandemic)\n\n* **Transitioning Outdoor Dining to Fall is a Focus of Merchants' Meeting**\n\n[http://www.towntopics.com/wordpress/2020/08/19/transitioning-outdoor-dining-to-fall-is-a-focus-of-merchants-meeting/](http://www.towntopics.com/wordpress/2020/08/19/transitioning-outdoor-dining-to-fall-is-a-focus-of-merchants-meeting/)\n\n* \u201cFire pits are also in style\u2026 But they\u2019re going fast. A spokesperson for Wayfair said searches for patio heaters are up more than 70 percent in the last five weeks compared to this time other years. (Fire pit searches are up 60 percent).\u201d\n\n\u201cWe even see customers buying two and three, you know, or multiple heaters at a time,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause they want to stay outside as long as possible and they know that as November hits, you can\u2019t go anywhere. They can at least go outside.\u201d\n\n\u201cAndy Starr, of restaurant supplier [Boston Showcase Company](https://www.bostonshowcase.com/)\n\n, which has had clients such as Davio\u2019s, Grill 23 &amp; Bar, and Uni, said that in normal times the company wouldn\u2019t keep a surplus of patio heaters in stock. But because of the pandemic, it brought in a supply to have them on hand.\u201d\n\n[https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/08/23/lifestyle/next-hot-pandemic-purchase-is-heat-lamp/](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/08/23/lifestyle/next-hot-pandemic-purchase-is-heat-lamp/)\n\n* \u201cThe pandemic appears to be boosting demand for warmth on the patio, whether at the end of an electrical cord or a fire poker. Galanter &amp; Jones typically enjoys 20% year-over-year growth in sales; in 2020, it\u2019s seen a spike of 37% over 2019. Searches for \u2018outdoor fireplaces\u2019 and \u2018fire pits\u2019 on home-goods site Perigold are up 72% year over year.

That said, this is really a niche in the larger [energy sector](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/energy/?utm_source=nasdaq&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=7b32b5d4-f130-4f3d-83b6-afa6ef487268)  \n, accounting for just 5% or so of the household energy market. Suburban estimates that its market share is about 5%, making it the third-largest propane distributor in the United States. The top three only account for around a quarter of the market.\u201d  \n[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-ge-vs.-suburban-propane-partners-2020-08-02](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-ge-vs.-suburban-propane-partners-2020-08-02)\n* Chief Executive Officer Michael A. Stivala said, \"The financial results for the fiscal 2020 third quarter were exceptionally strong for Suburban Propane \u2013 representing the highest level of Adjusted EBITDA for any third quarter in our history\u2026 an increase in residential demand more than offset softness in the commercial and industrial sectors during the third quarter.\"... \u201cRetail propane gallons sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 of 75.4 million gallons increased 2.2% compared to the prior year third quarter.\u201d [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/suburban-propane-partners-lp-announces-third-quarter-results-301107183.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/suburban-propane-partners-lp-announces-third-quarter-results-301107183.html)  \n\n* \u201cIn fact, in our residential sector, volumes increased more than 21% over the prior year. As a result, the physical 2020 third quarter was an exceptionally strong quarter for Suburban Propane. Adjusted EBITDA of $32.2 million, was $12.1 million or 61% higher than the prior year third quarter and, in fact, represented the highest level of adjusted EBITDA for any third quarter in our history. During the quarter, we also repaid more than $35 million under our revolving credit facility from excess cash flows, which resulted in a significant improvement in our leverage metrics compared to the second quarter.\u201d  \n\u201cFrom a customer mix perspective, residential volumes increased 21% compared to the prior year, whereas commercial and industrial volumes decreased 9%. In the commodity markets, wholesale propane prices remain relatively low compared to historical levels, but increased steadily during the quarter with the price of propane, basis Mont Belvieu, rising from $0.27 per gallon at the start of the quarter to $0.46 per gallon at the end of June.\u201d  \n\u201cTotal gross margins of $146.4 million for the third quarter increased $10.9 million or 8% compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher propane volumes and higher average unit margins. Overall, propane unit margins increased $0.09 per gallon or 5.2% compared to the prior year due to favorable volume mix and from the year-over-year decrease in commodity prices\u2026 With respect to expenses, despite the 2% increase in volume sold, combined operating and G&amp;A expenses decreased $1.1 million or 1% compared to the prior year.\u201d  \n\u201cNet interest expense of $18.5 million for the third quarter decreased $400,000 compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in benchmark interest rates on borrowings under our revolver. Total capital spending for the third quarter of $5.6 million was $2.1 million lower than the prior year, due to a lower level of spending on vehicles and tanks. Turning to our balance sheet. During the third quarter, we repaid more than $35 million under our revolver with cash flows from operating activities.\u201d  \n\u201cIn the early part of the fourth quarter, our collection activities continue to improve and are nearing the historical levels that we would generally experience for this time of the year. While we're encouraged by the improvement, this is something that we continue to closely monitor. From a leverage perspective, the increase in adjusted EBITDA coupled with the debt repayment during the third quarter resulted in our consolidated leverage ratio improving to 4.83 times at the end of June compared to 5.22 times at the end of the second quarter.\u201d  \n\u201cOur borrowings under revolver at the end of Q3 were $109.7 million, which was $17.5 million lower than June 2019 and $3.8 million lower than the level at the beginning of the fiscal year. We remain well within our debt covenant requirements. We'll continue utilizing excess cash flows in a balanced fashion to strengthen the balance sheet and to invest in strategic growth.\u201d  \n\u201cWhile we may experience continued softness in demand from our commercial and industrial customers in the near term, our efficient and flexible business model leaves us well-positioned to support our customers and local communities as they recover. Interestingly, what we are also seeing is a recognition that propane is a part of the solution in the recovery as a result of its clean burning attributes and the portability and dependability of propane to support new applications as businesses and local communities adapt to the new social distancing guidelines with more outdoor activities.\u201d  \n[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/suburban-propane-partners-l-p-sph-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcript-2020-08-06](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/suburban-propane-partners-l-p-sph-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcript-2020-08-06)  \n\n* \u201cSince most RV appliances run on propane \u2013 whether it\u2019s a propane-powered cooktop, furnace, grill, refrigerator, hot water heater or generator \u2013 higher RV sales inevitably lead to higher propane sales.\u201d  \n\u201cThe results of a survey conducted by Ipsos, in partnership with RVIA, reinforce what the RVIA is hearing from dealers. According to the survey \u2013 which examines consumer interest and planned action on travel choices in light of the pandemic \u2013 46 million Americans plan to take an RV trip in the next 12 months. To put that in perspective, there are currently 11 million RVers, says Geraci.\n* In addition, 20 percent of U.S. survey respondents indicated more interest in RVs as a recreational travel option in the aftermath of COVID-19 \u2013 the highest of any option tested \u2013 over car and tent, cruise, car and rental stay, and air and rental stay.\u201d  \n\u201cFor the short term, at least, propane marketers should expect to sell more gallons to RV customers...\u201d  \n\u201cThough RV manufacturers do produce all-electric options, the vast majority of RVs \u2013 both motorhomes and towable campers \u2013 use propane to power appliances, says Geraci of the RVIA.\u201d  \n\u201cPropane can also fuel generators that power lights and air conditioning units... In addition, propane may benefit from a trend in RV design toward an enhanced home-like experience with more appliances like washers, dryers and outdoor kitchens. These options provide additional burner tip opportunities for propane. Larger RVs, for example, are using two furnaces, which require more propane, notes Bruce Hopkins, vice president of standards with the RVIA.\u201d [https://www.lpgasmagazine.com/surge-in-rv-sales-presents-opportunities-for-propane/](https://www.lpgasmagazine.com/surge-in-rv-sales-presents-opportunities-for-propane/)  \n\n\n**Videos**\n\n* Mark Rachel, Propane Industry, LP Gas Magazine (\u201cUptrend in pricing\u201d/\u201dStay well ahead of the game\u201d/\u201dFlatten the demand curve\u201d) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgVL51u7g60](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgVL51u7g60)  \n\n* Mark Rachel Vid 2 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYNXCiD0OF0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYNXCiD0OF0)  \n\n\n**Stock Pick**\n\n**Suburban Propane Partners**, L.P. (SPH)\n\n* Third largest propane distributor in the US.\n* Propane supplier for retail users, RV parks, and retail sellers (for grills, heaters, etc.)\n* The **ONLY** publicly traded propane distributor in the US. (Ferrellgas is publicly traded but they are probably going bankrupt. Amerigas is owned by UGI and is only a fraction of their market cap.)\n* Small market cap ($800M)\n* Q3 gross margins increased 8% over Q3 2019.\n* Very low profile company that does not seem to be on Wall Street's radar yet.\n* Next earnings report comes out in November. Could be a good earnings play.\n\n**Phone Calls**\n\n* Called a few Suburban Propane offices around the country to ask about their services and found the following.\n* Most recommended a 250gal tank for a 3 bed/2 bath home, with just one appliance using propane.\n* Normally 3-4 refills per year.\n* Installation price = $125, with one year refill contract\n* Suburban Propane can also install propane tanks and pipes for Generac propane generators and provide refills.\n* Recommended tank size for a 22KW Generac generator is 250-1000gal, depending on usage.\n* To power the average home, a 22KW Generac generator will use about 2gal/hr. If used for 10hrs/day, that is 12.5 days with a 250gal tank.\n* In a normal year, most Generac users will only need one refill. In bad hurricane areas this can be 1-4 times per year.\n* Price quotes ranged from $2.09/gal to $2.18/gal ($522.5 - $545 per refill, with 250gal tank)\n\n**Negative Factors**\n\n* Suburban Propane does not directly fill small propane tanks used for grills, space heaters, etc. (It supplies the companies who do)\n* Suburban Propane has high debt levels\n* Suburban Propane just slashed the dividend in half (now 9.4%)\n* Profit margins are thin",

        "selftext": "Hi,  \n\n\nI've read a few times that a diversified porfolio of small-cap securities tends to, statistically at least, beat the total market. Ben Felix discusses this at length in many videos, where he often refers to the value factor or the value premium. [Example here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MVSsVi1_e4).  \n\n\nMy question is related to how one invests in this. I could imagine that an ETF that tracks small-cap equities has a fatal flow compared to owning the underlying securities, which is that the moment the companies do well and provide amazing returns, they may exit the small-cap definition and thus one ends up having an effect by which amazing companies exit your ETF.  \n\n\nDoes this happen at all? how does one invest in small cap effectively?",

He was telling me how efficient these drivetrains are with motors on the axles, and locomotives have electric motors and they pull hundreds of millions of pounds of cargo and they're so incredibly efficient. It's incredible. So I was six years old when I said I gotta build a locomotive semi-truck, and today, that's what we have. We have the most advanced semi-truck that's ever been built in the world. It's cheaper to drive than a diesel. It's four times more powerful than a diesel.  It's got 2,000 horsepower and it's the safest truck that's ever been built.\"*  \n  \nSorry Trev, I was an idiot to believe Hindenburg Research.  \n  \nPositions: NKLA 69C 1/15/2021, TSLA 10P 1/15/2021",
