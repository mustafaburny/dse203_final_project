        "selftext": "**Disclamer**: This isn\u2019t a fear mongering post about the virus itself. To put it into perspective the Swine Flu epidemic of 2009 has over 110k confirmed cases and close to 4000 deaths in the US alone yet many people don\u2019t even remember that. But that\u2019s for a different discussion in a different sub.\n\nI\u2019m currently in Shanghai now, from my observation people in the West are not spending enough time talking about how devastating this virus has been to the Chinese economy and its certain global ramifications.\n\nLet\u2019s take the city of Shanghai for example. It\u2019s not one of the more heavily impacted cities, it\u2019s not quarantined and people can mostly come and go freely. Many businesses are still open, from restaurants to malls.\n\nHowever for the first time ever I saw an Apple store with more employees than customers, and an open Starbucks with absolutely zero customers inside. The streets on a Saturday afternoon were about as empty as it would be at midnight on a regular weekday. All of this is happening during what\u2019s supposed to be the  busiest week for consumer spendings in China.\n\nThe worst part is this doesn\u2019t seem like it will change any time soon. Shanghai just announced that they will extend the CNY holidays by another week and people will like remain fearful for the coming weeks, if not months if we don\u2019t see a dramatic turnaround of the virus situation.\n\nWhat this means is that any Western company that relies significantly on China for revenue would see their first quarter earning absolutely *crushed*, especially considering their forecasts were done with the assumption of this quarter being the best quarter of the year. For example I\u2019m foreseeing Apple miss their Greater China\u2019s revenue by as much as 50% this quarter, and it would be even worse for companies like GM, Ford and the airlines.\n\nFurther more this will impact the global manufacturing and supply chain significantly. I don\u2019t know enough to model out a detailed scenario but my gut feeling tells me a prolonged manufacturing shutdown across major Chinese cities would be more than a little disruptive in that regard.\n\nI\u2019m discounting the impact of the virus if it were spread to other countries in any significant numbers, but even considering the situation in China alone it\u2019s extremely worrying.",

        "selftext": "The year is 2017, my parents had a successful real estate business with over a dozen rental properties and several fix and flip projects in production. Our assets totaled a million and a half after paying off all loans if we ever liquidated everything. Which we did, and that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nMy oldest brother made the brilliant decision that because he lost his job, he should start day trading. He quickly made $30k on Apple by yoloing his saving in shares before an Apple products release event. Excited by this, he made an entire PowerPoint presentation convincing the family to get into day trading. We were reluctant at first, and I wish it stayed that way.\n\nIn the background he worked with my parents in setting up a family company and opening trading accounts and buying courses. Keep in mind my parents will do anything he says, completely wrapped around his finger. During this time I was getting into the house flipping business in full swing. Working on my parents properties and going to auctions for future projects. I had already set up in my mind that I was going to be a real estate investor because it was the only work I actually enjoyed doing, my parents were very profitable, and even after the 2008 housing market crash, when we lost everything, they were able to bounce back.\nThen one day everything stopped, my parents stopped working real estate and with no capital of my own I couldn\u2019t continue doing it myself. \n\nThey liquidated most of their assets and set up trading accounts with TD. They tried setting up weekly quotas and profit targets, which looking back, were really unrealistic. We needed 20k per month and sometimes more to cover loans from the very last rentals that hadn\u2019t sold just yet. So naturally while they were on the market the quota for the month was 20k...for inexperienced day traders. It dawned on me that money is easy to make every month when a tenant gives it to you rather than we ourselves have to endure risk to make it, but my parents didn\u2019t listen to me, it had to be my brothers way.\n\nYou can probably guess what happened. Loss after loss made our account grow smaller and smaller; and the smaller it got the more we had to risk to make bigger profits. Which only happened once where I made nearly 50k trading Netflix on its highest volume day in 2018. That quickly gotten absorbed by bills. But. By 2018 we were already down some 200k and our bills had been quickly eating up our saving. All the way to the point we starting taking loans just cover expenses and continue trading. Then one day I lost 80k on netflix when it\u2019s earnings made it drop nearly a hundred dollars. If it went up well I\u2019d be into real estate again. I nearly had a heart attack and stayed in bed for I don\u2019t even know how long. If it weren\u2019t for my girlfriend I think I might have killed myself.\n\nWe were forced to live in our last property for a few months before selling it to avoid foreclosure and then my entire family moved into a 1 bedroom apartment my brother still had in Pasadena. Which is an urban city so the rent was 3k. Which was nearly impossible to pay. We did Uber Eats deliveries every single day to just try to make enough money to eat and did some trading with money we borrowed from our extended family. All of our credit scores were shot and there was nothing left to borrow on. Then we sold our very last property and made 100k on the sale. Which we lost.\n\nNearly all of our losses were on options, and they were a direct result of our trading strategy, which was laughable. They set guidelines for the option expiration, loss tolerance, and investment amount(no swing trading). Which hey sounds great why not. Except that when our expenses were so great, the low risk meant we were burning more than we were making, the stress made me make some good and bad trades in an attempt to save my family from ruin. On some trades I would have made literal hundreds of thousands if my parents and older brother didn\u2019t force sell my positions because they couldn\u2019t stomach swing a loss(16k in HD $215 strike bought at $201 and it reached $215 a day before expiration which would have been a $170k profit because instead was forced to be a $2k loss). It really kills your heart to see how much money you could have made, not because you took profits too early, because no one believed you and took a loss on your behalf.\n\nWith no more options we packed up and moved to Maryland were my older brother got a 100k plus job coding websites. Things were good for a while and with no rush to cover rent or bills I was actually able to grow a small account from 4K to 17k. All good things must come to end sadly. He developed MS because of the stress of losing hundreds of thousands in a few years and his relationship was failing as well. These things affected his ability to learn new programing languages or work efficiently so his job fired him. Then it was up to me to make enough to cover the expenses and slowly I saw the account cannibalized to 0. They blame me almost exclusively for losing all the money by the way.\n\nWe moved back to California being forced to stay within the same apartment complex company because no where else will accept us. Now my brother is suicidal, he\u2019s also diabetic and he\u2019s tried killing himself by overdosing on insulin. His hope is at 0. I\u2019ve matured more than any young adult should have from this ordeal so I feel like I can keep going. But moral is low. My parents work nearly 14 hours a day driving for Uber eats. I can\u2019t really help because I had my ankle fused back in July. My other brother doesn\u2019t live with us anymore because of all the chaos that happened. My parents have real estate licenses and they are trying really hard to find clients. I wish there was more I can do. I learned I should have fought more for our family to continue real estate investing. Nothing made us happier than flipping houses. If I had the opportunity to flip a house I\u2019m sure we could jumpstart that career with my parents\u2019 experience. I\u2019m not against trading even after losing everything, sadly it took that much for me to do it half decently. I\u2019m sticking to vertical spreads on etfs and precious metals, which brings in some profits every few weeks but not enough to make living. Sometimes I\u2019ll use around $50 on near expiration out of the money calls of puts to try to get lucky. Sometimes the temptation to let my whole account ride on naked options is strong. Not because I want to be rich, but because I just want my parents to stop working so hard in something they don\u2019t even enjoy doing at their age. I wanted to share my story because I saw how some of you guys shared similar experiences, and some of you were the exceptions that won in the end. Invest in real estate, it\u2019s profitable if you work with someone who has experience and the market hasn\u2019t tanked. I\u2019m going to Texas in a few days to propose to my girlfriend and bring her back to California. If she says yes it\u2019ll be the highlight of my life.\n\nTLDR; Stocks bad, Real Estate good",

        "selftext": "Hi gang,\n\nI posed two different models in the last 6 years that I'm continually revisiting and updating based on new data that's available to me.\n\nHere's the first one below from 6 years ago where I attached a $450 price target by end of 2018\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1k15cb/my_model_of_tsla_through_2013/?st=k5h2987i&amp;sh=78a9694b\n\nHere's the second one I posted a year later with a price target of $800 by end of 2020\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1yn1kx/my_revised_model_of_tesla_tsla_by_2023/?st=k5h26rti&amp;sh=43f78d64\n\nIt appears that my models are running roughly a year behind of where my assumptions are ending up, so I figured I'd share my latest model for your viewing and entertainment pleasure.\n\nIn no way am I trying to insinuate that my models are somehow predicting where Tesla's price is going to end up - I'm simply sharing my thought process with you fine folks in the investing community to gather feedback and understand different points of view.\n\nSee below model:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUPfQhpFfax8lYC4iyvYT-gD_i9LIRkngFB_o6MZXA8/edit?usp=sharing\n\nMy broad assumptions:\n\n* There will be a 90,000,000 global new vehicle market in 2028\n* Roughly 50% of those sales will be electric\n* Tesla will capture 17% of the EV market which is roughly 7.6 million cars a year\n* I'm assuming a new vehicle introduced in 2025 that will capture the truly affordable car market that will be designed in China and released for worldwide consumption (average of $20k per car without autonomous features). This is called Cybercar in the model\n* Autonomous vehicle revenue will begin to kick in around the year 2025\n* By 2028, roughly 33% of Tesla's new fleet sales (7.6 * .33 = 2.3m) will be generating some level of revenue for the company as autonomous revenue. For this model I'm assuming $7.3k of sales from autonomous per unit on average at 80% margin\n* I'm assuming roughly 1% dilution YoY\n* I'm assuming ~300k Tesla operated RoboTaxis manufactured yearly by Tesla to cover gaps in coverage in the self driving network\n* I'm assuming Tesla Energy to grow to generate similar levels of sales from the Energy business by 2028 as compared to Auto\n* i'm assuming a total operating income % of sales of 17.3% on $508b of revenue by 2028\n* I'm assuming a 38 P/E multiple on $87b of yearly earnings by 2028\n\nThat covers all the big picture stuff as it pertains to what the model takes into account.\n\nThe price is obviously eye popping and would give Tesla a market cap of ~3.5 trillion. However, the way I think about this company is drawing a parallel to Apple, which is a Hardware company that has a SaaS (Software as a Service) component bolted on top of it selling units that generate vastly more $ per unit sold, and is entering an entirely disrupted market in the last 100 years that is about as large as it gets on the auto side - and then you add energy on top of it.\n\nLet me know your thoughts.",

I'm thinking about either investing only in one mutual fund and/or total market ETF and 1-3 individual stocks that would only make up 10-20% of my portfolio(V, MSFT and AAPL most likely). My other strategy would be investing in 10-20 blue chip stocks with with high revenue, low debt and decent dividend payouts (WFC, MO, CCI for example). What strategy is best for very long term growth? \n\nIn regards to the first strategy, if I'm going very long in a Roth IRA wouldnt a mutual fund be better than an ETF? Should I do one or both?\n\nIn regards to the second strategy, since Roth IRA isnt taxed, does it make more sense to go after blue chip dividend stocks or growth stocks?\n\nThanks in advance!",

I am pretty well diversified, I think, with appropriate weights in Canadian banks and other financials, power generation and similar infrastructure, transportation through CNR, CargoJet and EIF, Some American tech (Googl and Goog, and Apple) then a few \"others\" including Badger Daylighting, Magna.  Some of these represent choices made a long time ago that I am happy with, but lately my strategy has been to find both a decent dividend (2% or higher) and an opportunity for growth (these once the fundamentals have been assessed, of course, and in the context of a company that I understand and whose leadership and direction make me happy).\n\nI have cash I need to put into play, or it is just going to go into a high interest account or a GIC.  Would prefer Canadian as this helps balance out my partner's portfolio.  Man, I am having problems finding Canadian stuff to buy.  In many cases excellent stocks that fit my parameters look to me as though they have already had their run.  \n\nI am old (!!) so pure growth plays don't make a bunch of sense to me at this point.  But I am not dead (!!!) so fire and forget dividend plays also don't particularly appeal. \n\nSo after all that ... what are your top picks, fellow Canucks?

Expect a late game grand slam, and if the market hasn't already been swayed in favor of the tech giants and earnings week, AAPL will convince them otherwise. Game 2 will also consist of AMD batting .320 like it always does, and even if it slumps early, it'll be back to hitting .320 by the end of the week. \n\nGame 3 could be a huge game for TSLA.. can TSLA really continue to bat a red hot .700 for a whole series and keep knocking in RBIs at a godly pace? My bet is yes. But it will be MSFT who brings home Game 3 and carries the team through the rest of the week.

FB will choke, going 2-31 this series.\n\nGame 4 is just a continuation of team earnings game 2 and 3 victories and AMZN shines with a 3-5 day with a few RBIs, nothing incredible but enough to seal the victory for team earnings. Regardless of how game 5 plays out, the series was won here.\n\n\nMSFT 150c's and 160c's\nTSLA 6/2020 700c\nAMD 1/2021 30c and couple hundred shares\nAlways holding shares of GOOG\n253 shares of TQQQ\n\nMSFT will be MVP.",

        "selftext": "**Earnings Watch:  Nearly half of index, 14 out of 30 companies, expected to report  holiday-season results in busiest week of the season, which also  includes Facebook, Tesla and Amazon**\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average increased more than 22% in 2019 and  is already up 2.2% through three weeks of 2020, but it is about to face  its biggest test of the young year, and potentially many years.\n\nNearly half of the 30 Dow  [DJIA, -0.58%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia?mod=MW_story_quote) components are scheduled to  report results from the holiday season in the coming week, which will be  by far the busiest week of the earnings season.\n\nThere are 14  Dow companies expected to report, the most companies from the blue-chip  index to report in a single week since at least 2014, a group that  includes two trillion-dollar market caps in Apple Inc. [AAPL, -0.29%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl?mod=MW_story_quote) and Microsoft Corp [MSFT, -1.01%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/msft?mod=MW_story_quote) Plenty of non-Dow  companies will throw their numbers in as well \u2014 141 of the S&amp;P 500  companies are expected to report, including Facebook Inc. [FB, -0.83%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fb?mod=MW_story_quote), Amazon.com Inc. [AMZN, -1.22%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn?mod=MW_story_quote) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc [AMD, -2.63%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amd?mod=MW_story_quote) \n\nThe 85 members of the S&amp;P 500 that have reported results thus far  have seen net income fall by 0.3% on average from a year ago, though  Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub said it\u2019s  tough to make broader inferences from early reports given different  sectors tend to post results at different parts of the earnings cycle.  More than a third of S&amp;P 500 that have reported so far sit in the  financials sector, which could skew those results.\n\nThe  FactSet consensus currently calls for net income to fall by 1.9% for  the S&amp;P 500, based on a blend of reported results and analyst  projections, which would mean [the current earnings recession ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/earnings-recession-is-expected-to-swallow-all-of-2019-after-holiday-forecasts-disappoint-2019-11-22)would swallow all of 2019\u2019s results.\n\nHere\u2019s what to watch for in the week ahead. \n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-dow-is-about-to-face-its-stiffest-test-in-years-2020-01-25](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-dow-is-about-to-face-its-stiffest-test-in-years-2020-01-25)",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 6th, 2020.\n\n# **Geopolitical tensions could hold back stocks in the week ahead, as investors await jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/03/geopolitical-tensions-could-hold-back-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Geopolitical concerns could continue to weigh on stocks in the week ahead, leaving investors wondering whether Middle East tensions will be the catalyst for a much anticipated market pullback.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks sold off Friday, the second trading day of the year, after a rally to new highs on Thursday. The market was slammed after the U.S. killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, sparking a rally in oil prices and raising concerns Iran will take some retaliatory action.\n*****\n&gt; The big event in the coming week is the December employment report, expected to show 160,000 payrolls were added and average earnings rose 3.1% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. The jobs report is especially important after December\u2019s ISM manufacturing data Friday was surprisingly negative and the weakest in more than a decade.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the four-day week at 3,235, with a loss of 0.2%, after Friday\u2019s 0.7% decline. Treasury yields retreated on Friday, as buyers moved into the safety of bonds and the 10-year yield was at 1.78%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis was a textbook rationale for a bout of profit taking, but that said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s dramatic,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cNonetheless, the question will be when do buyers come in ... Much will depend on this weekend and next week in terms of headlines from both the White House and Iran.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Some analysts have been looking for a minor selloff in stocks after the fourth quarter\u2019s 8.5% gain in the S&amp;P 500. But whether Friday\u2019s decline is the start of something bigger is unclear.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt could be, but only in retrospect will you know for sure,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.\n*****\n&gt; Boockvar said if Iran takes some minor action, the market could shrug it off, oil could lose its gains, and stocks could move higher again.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe may see Treasurys continue to get a big bid, gold get a bid and the safe-haven currencies get a bid. If we go into things next week and all things are quiet, the market will pay attention to the data,\u201d Krosby said.\n*****\n&gt; Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities, expects to see Treasury yields lower initially. \u201cI think short-term, the geopolitical risk is probably going to override any fundamental views that people have of the marketplace,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; But there could be a catalyst for some Treasury selling with the issuance of high level of corporate bonds in the coming week. Faranello expects the year to start off strong, with corporate treasurers looking to raise about $30 billion to $35 billion in the debt market.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said they will be looking closely at the jobs data after Friday\u2019s surprisingly weak manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management, which was expected to have been better because of the trade agreement.\n*****\n&gt; Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, said the survey actually took place before the trade deal was announced, and he\u2019s waiting for the results of the next couple of reports.\n*****\n&gt; He expects to see 165,000 jobs added in December, off of 266,000 in November, which was in part skewed by the end of GM\u2019s strike. \u201cI think there\u2019s a little upside risk. It seems like we saw a pretty strong Christmas season,\u201d he said, adding there could have been more hiring than was factored into seasonal adjustments.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aoDnUW7.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/6x4NtiW.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/I3ZNEuH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/QqYTbUD.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3Ltxt2.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CyHtJoF.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RO92K5i.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SEszd5M.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Trp0mo0.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/V19lVTd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tlPjW9c.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/aicevVU.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical January Trading: Volatile Last 20 Years\n\n&gt; Yesterday major indexes continued their recent trend of strength on the first trading day of 2020. While today the market has turned weaker on escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. This type of volatility was once quite rare in January. However since 2000, the S&amp;P 500 has declined ten times in twenty years in January. This recent weakness can be seen in the above January seasonal pattern chart.\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, Only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the eighth trading day. Greatest weakness has appeared just after mid-month, the eleventh trading day. Mild average losses on or around the eleventh trading day quickly swell to over 2% for DJIA and nearly as much for S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82a79e9eb21df6d414fd0ec1c7725b4d/e48bbc4e7f5b7041-e9/s500x750/6a964dc4a15e1c9ab0fcc9ccc451f6e642aacff5.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Banner Year for US Equities\n\n&gt; 2019 was surely a banner year for US equities. With a total return of 31.5%, the S&amp;P 500's gain in 2019 was nearly three times the historical average 12-month return of 11.7%. That's strong! In the chart below we compare the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to its average annualized returns over those same time frames since 1928. While the one-year return sticks out like a sore thumb, we would note that the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns over the last two, three, and ten years are also above average. Almost as notable as the fact that the one year return has been so much stronger than average is that the S&amp;P 500's two-year return is less than two percentage points above its historical average. That just shows how bad 2018 was! Looking further out, the only time frame where returns are below average is over the last twenty years where the 6.1% annualized gain is almost five percentage points below the historical average. Over a full twenty years, that's a difference of tripling your investment versus making eight times your investment!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below compares how current returns during the above time frames rank on a percentile basis relative to all other periods. The S&amp;P 500's one-year return ranks in the 85th percentile which is pretty extreme. For the two, five, and ten year periods, though, current returns are much more middle of the road. Conversely, as stretched as extreme to the upside that the one-year return is relative to all other periods, the twenty-year return is even more depressed to the downside. At just 4.6, more than 95% of all other 20-year periods have been better than the last 20.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns-Percentile.png))**\n\n&gt; Finally, as mentioned above the last year has certainly been a strong one, and it follows a year where returns had been abnormally poor. The chart below shows the rolling 12-month total return for the S&amp;P 500 going back to 1990. The gain of 31.49% over the last year was the strongest for the S&amp;P 500 in six years coming up just shy of the 32.39% gain in 2013. Last year at this time, though, the S&amp;P 500 was down over 4% on a total return basis in the prior 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns-Percentile-rolling.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 2019 and 2020 Dogs of the Dow\n\n&gt; The Dogs of the Dow strategy is a simple, hands-off investment approach that says to buy the 10 highest yielding stocks in the Dow 30 at the start of each year. With the calendar turning over from 2019 to 2020, below is a look at how the Dogs strategy performed in 2019. As shown, the 10 Dogs posted a total return of 19.38% in 2019, which was below the 25% return for the Dow and well below the 28% that the 20 non-Dogs returned. The biggest winner in the Dogs in 2019 was JP Morgan (JPM) with a gain of 47.27%, but Pfizer's (PFE) decline of 6.92% really hurt overall performance.\n\n&gt; The 20 non-Dogs were led by Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Visa (V), and United Tech (UTX), while Walgreens Boots (WBA) and 3M (MMM) were the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019.

Eight of the ten Dogs from 2019 remain on the list, while 3M (MMM) and Walgreens Boots (WBA) -- the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019 -- have replaced JP Morgan (JPM) and Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) -- the two biggest gainers of the Dogs in 2019. Dow Inc. (DOW) is the highest yielding Dog at 5.12%, followed by Exxon (XOM), IBM, and Verizon (VZ), which all have dividend yields above 4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/2020dogs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Full Year 2019, Q4, and December Asset Class Total Returns\n\n&gt; Below are the final total return performance numbers for key ETFs across asset classes in 2019. For each ETF, we also include its performance in Q4 and December.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rallied 2.9% in December and 8.99% in Q4 to finish the full year up 31.22%. The Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) was by far the best performing US index ETF in 2019 with a gain of 38.96%, and it was the third best ETF in the entire matrix. The title of best performing ETF in 2019 goes to the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector ETF (XLK), which rallied 49.86%. Remember, 40% of XLK is made up of just Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which gained 89% and 58% in 2019, respectively. The Russia stock market ETF (RSX) was the second biggest winner in the matrix with a 2019 total return of 40.79%.\n\n&gt; Everywhere you look across the equity landscape, there were big winners in 2019, but the weakest area of the market was the Energy sector ETF (XLE). Even still, XLE managed to put up double-digit percentage gains on the year at +11.74%.\n\n&gt; In the commodities space, we saw oil gain 32.61% in 2019, which actually bested the gain for the S&amp;P 500. Gold (GLD) and silver (SLV) both put in solid gains in the mid-teens, while the perpetually losing natural gas ETF (UNG) was the only ticker in the matrix that fell across all three time frames (December, Q4, and full year).\n\n&gt; Looking at fixed income, the aggregate bond market ETFs (AGG and BND) posted total returns of 8%+, while the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) gained 14% on the year. Q4 and December were tough for fixed income, however, as rates moved higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/assetclass1231.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Almanac: Average Performance Slips in Presidential Election Years\n\n&gt; January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations typically propels stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but fifth on the S&amp;P 500 and sixth for DJIA since 1950. It is the end of the best three-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.\n\n&gt; DJIA and S&amp;P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2016 as both indices suffered losses in ten of those seventeen Januarys with three in a row, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and then again in 2014 to 2016. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&amp;P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1931 respectively. Last year, January was downright stellar after the worst December since 1931 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; In election years, Januarys have been weaker. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 slip to number #8 while DJIA average performance dips negative. NASDAQ slips to #3, but average performance remains respectable at 1.7%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/891a38b2171ab08b547127db29f12536/f4d2c822df56176c-4f/s400x600/8f8fe64b2da5c123c7e073095dd8b656e1066429.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 3rd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqDWuo8kiFU))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.5.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wTk5RDVRtE))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$CMC** \n&gt; * **$WBA** \n&gt; * **$BBBY** \n&gt; * **$STZ** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$CALM** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$ANGO** \n&gt; * **$AZZ** \n&gt; * **$KBH** \n&gt; * **$UNF** \n&gt; * **$MSM** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$SCHN** \n&gt; * **$SNX** \n&gt; * **$AYI** \n&gt; * **$GBX** \n&gt; * **$HELE** \n&gt; * **$SAR** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$NTIC** \n&gt; * **$LNN** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$KRUS** \n&gt; * **$FC** \n&gt; * **$SLP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Trp0mo0.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/lNG07hG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/Y1KO0R4.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DNOQOhD.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.7.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QorVd8K.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xTrYEcQ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.8.2 0Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TRPytQz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/owUNbSh.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RXUjAgC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/m5AQPKl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/v60Cw2n.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.10.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $229.38\n&gt; **lululemon athletica inc.

        "selftext": "So, 2019 was a bit of a rocky year. I started off making an immense amount of money, lost all of my gain shorting Qualcomm on news of their apple settlement in April.  Took me months to recover, but I got stupid towards the end of the year shorting apple, thinking it HAD to go down and constantly in denial. Big share counts too. like 5 to 10000 shares short day trading\n\nThere would be enormous sums of trades to show in the whole account- but I did much better, ironically, in my account where I only day traded options.\n\nMy biggest lessons: cut the loss quickly.  Don't wait, don't guess. If I had done this, i would be much more green.\n\nLesson two: don't let a bias overrule you. I did this w apple towards the end of the year. Fortunately I did not get carried away and start buying puts as it was going up too. CNBC pushed it higher , and I ignored this. I could have easily flipped the trade.\n\nLesson three: listen to your instincts.  Don't get flustered or become a deer in headlights. I repeated these errors again on numerous occasions. Do not become fixated on a past price where you may have had a paper profit. Stock doesn't care about prior levels.\n\nAlso, I noticed the increasing effects cnbc can have on stocks. Lower float unusual options plays, and the time I lost on apple they kept talking of a super cycle.  This just caused me to lost 40k on a short in one day. I could have covered much sooner.\nNot a terrible year, but I repeated these mistakes more times than I should have.\n\nResults below:\n\nhttps://ibb.co/mJM6SzQ\n\nhttps://ibb.co/Qjxf026",

Now hear me out retards before you start throwing your prebuilt HP Pavilion Gaming Desktops at me.  \n  \nYes we all know that AMD blows shintel out of the water in literally every way and the new stuff makes literally every Intel laptop look like a Chinese knockoff of the 1986 IBM PC Convertible. But look at the news and see who it really affects. Do you think $BECKY is going to buy a 64 core AMD Thundercock? Fuck no, $BECKY knows your eyes can only see 32 cores at a time. And you can be sure her favorite movie studios won't be either because we know in Frozen 3: Iced Caramel Macchiato, that new scene with Elsa doing coke off of Olaf's ass is going to be rendered with 4 year old workstations. Emperor Mickey Mouse is not going to fork out a fucking penny for that shit for several more years because he wants to max out those gains.  \n  \nNow let's get to the more important thing, laptops. Who are the primary audience for new laptop purchases? It's fucking $BECKY. We all know that you're not trading in your 3 year old AMD Ryzen Lenovo for another 10 years when you run out of Indian sweatshops capable of recovering your 1TB hentai collection because they cant find flex tape strong enough to hold your broken down cum stained piece of shit laptop together. Do you think $BECKY cares that AMD's new processors are 5 quadrillion times better than anything that ever made Bob Swan edge in his sleep? Hell fucking no. $BECKY needs her apps and all her friends hate when Shaun sends a green SMS from his lenovo anyway. She can't live without Pages and Keynote, and knows exactly how to turn on Microsoft remote desktop to get help when she can't find a tab she closed on Safari. And you know the fucking second she gets a dent in the cover or spills 1ml of her Matcha Green Tea on the keyboard of her 2019 MacBook Pro and it makes a little sticky noise, she's taking that bitch in to the Apple Store where they convince her to buy a brand new one in full. She will be in tears as she pulls out your Surge Mastercard and buys that 2020 Macbook Air along with the $420.69 Airpods pro deluxe that comes in a box with that cute emoji sticker.  \n  \nDon't say I didn't fucking warn you. $BECKY is coming, but you won't be.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 6th, 2020.\n\n# **Geopolitical tensions could hold back stocks in the week ahead, as investors await jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/03/geopolitical-tensions-could-hold-back-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Geopolitical concerns could continue to weigh on stocks in the week ahead, leaving investors wondering whether Middle East tensions will be the catalyst for a much anticipated market pullback.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks sold off Friday, the second trading day of the year, after a rally to new highs on Thursday. The market was slammed after the U.S. killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, sparking a rally in oil prices and raising concerns Iran will take some retaliatory action.\n*****\n&gt; The big event in the coming week is the December employment report, expected to show 160,000 payrolls were added and average earnings rose 3.1% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. The jobs report is especially important after December\u2019s ISM manufacturing data Friday was surprisingly negative and the weakest in more than a decade.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the four-day week at 3,235, with a loss of 0.2%, after Friday\u2019s 0.7% decline. Treasury yields retreated on Friday, as buyers moved into the safety of bonds and the 10-year yield was at 1.78%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis was a textbook rationale for a bout of profit taking, but that said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s dramatic,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cNonetheless, the question will be when do buyers come in ... Much will depend on this weekend and next week in terms of headlines from both the White House and Iran.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Some analysts have been looking for a minor selloff in stocks after the fourth quarter\u2019s 8.5% gain in the S&amp;P 500. But whether Friday\u2019s decline is the start of something bigger is unclear.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt could be, but only in retrospect will you know for sure,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.\n*****\n&gt; Boockvar said if Iran takes some minor action, the market could shrug it off, oil could lose its gains, and stocks could move higher again.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe may see Treasurys continue to get a big bid, gold get a bid and the safe-haven currencies get a bid. If we go into things next week and all things are quiet, the market will pay attention to the data,\u201d Krosby said.\n*****\n&gt; Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities, expects to see Treasury yields lower initially. \u201cI think short-term, the geopolitical risk is probably going to override any fundamental views that people have of the marketplace,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; But there could be a catalyst for some Treasury selling with the issuance of high level of corporate bonds in the coming week. Faranello expects the year to start off strong, with corporate treasurers looking to raise about $30 billion to $35 billion in the debt market.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said they will be looking closely at the jobs data after Friday\u2019s surprisingly weak manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management, which was expected to have been better because of the trade agreement.\n*****\n&gt; Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, said the survey actually took place before the trade deal was announced, and he\u2019s waiting for the results of the next couple of reports.\n*****\n&gt; He expects to see 165,000 jobs added in December, off of 266,000 in November, which was in part skewed by the end of GM\u2019s strike. \u201cI think there\u2019s a little upside risk. It seems like we saw a pretty strong Christmas season,\u201d he said, adding there could have been more hiring than was factored into seasonal adjustments.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aoDnUW7.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/6x4NtiW.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/I3ZNEuH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/QqYTbUD.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3Ltxt2.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CyHtJoF.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RO92K5i.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SEszd5M.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Trp0mo0.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/V19lVTd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tlPjW9c.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/aicevVU.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical January Trading: Volatile Last 20 Years\n\n&gt; Yesterday major indexes continued their recent trend of strength on the first trading day of 2020. While today the market has turned weaker on escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. This type of volatility was once quite rare in January. However since 2000, the S&amp;P 500 has declined ten times in twenty years in January. This recent weakness can be seen in the above January seasonal pattern chart.\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, Only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the eighth trading day. Greatest weakness has appeared just after mid-month, the eleventh trading day. Mild average losses on or around the eleventh trading day quickly swell to over 2% for DJIA and nearly as much for S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82a79e9eb21df6d414fd0ec1c7725b4d/e48bbc4e7f5b7041-e9/s500x750/6a964dc4a15e1c9ab0fcc9ccc451f6e642aacff5.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Banner Year for US Equities\n\n&gt; 2019 was surely a banner year for US equities. With a total return of 31.5%, the S&amp;P 500's gain in 2019 was nearly three times the historical average 12-month return of 11.7%. That's strong! In the chart below we compare the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to its average annualized returns over those same time frames since 1928. While the one-year return sticks out like a sore thumb, we would note that the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns over the last two, three, and ten years are also above average. Almost as notable as the fact that the one year return has been so much stronger than average is that the S&amp;P 500's two-year return is less than two percentage points above its historical average. That just shows how bad 2018 was! Looking further out, the only time frame where returns are below average is over the last twenty years where the 6.1% annualized gain is almost five percentage points below the historical average. Over a full twenty years, that's a difference of tripling your investment versus making eight times your investment!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below compares how current returns during the above time frames rank on a percentile basis relative to all other periods. The S&amp;P 500's one-year return ranks in the 85th percentile which is pretty extreme. For the two, five, and ten year periods, though, current returns are much more middle of the road. Conversely, as stretched as extreme to the upside that the one-year return is relative to all other periods, the twenty-year return is even more depressed to the downside. At just 4.6, more than 95% of all other 20-year periods have been better than the last 20.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns-Percentile.png))**\n\n&gt; Finally, as mentioned above the last year has certainly been a strong one, and it follows a year where returns had been abnormally poor. The chart below shows the rolling 12-month total return for the S&amp;P 500 going back to 1990. The gain of 31.49% over the last year was the strongest for the S&amp;P 500 in six years coming up just shy of the 32.39% gain in 2013. Last year at this time, though, the S&amp;P 500 was down over 4% on a total return basis in the prior 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns-Percentile-rolling.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 2019 and 2020 Dogs of the Dow\n\n&gt; The Dogs of the Dow strategy is a simple, hands-off investment approach that says to buy the 10 highest yielding stocks in the Dow 30 at the start of each year. With the calendar turning over from 2019 to 2020, below is a look at how the Dogs strategy performed in 2019. As shown, the 10 Dogs posted a total return of 19.38% in 2019, which was below the 25% return for the Dow and well below the 28% that the 20 non-Dogs returned. The biggest winner in the Dogs in 2019 was JP Morgan (JPM) with a gain of 47.27%, but Pfizer's (PFE) decline of 6.92% really hurt overall performance.\n\n&gt; The 20 non-Dogs were led by Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Visa (V), and United Tech (UTX), while Walgreens Boots (WBA) and 3M (MMM) were the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019.

Eight of the ten Dogs from 2019 remain on the list, while 3M (MMM) and Walgreens Boots (WBA) -- the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019 -- have replaced JP Morgan (JPM) and Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) -- the two biggest gainers of the Dogs in 2019. Dow Inc. (DOW) is the highest yielding Dog at 5.12%, followed by Exxon (XOM), IBM, and Verizon (VZ), which all have dividend yields above 4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/2020dogs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Full Year 2019, Q4, and December Asset Class Total Returns\n\n&gt; Below are the final total return performance numbers for key ETFs across asset classes in 2019. For each ETF, we also include its performance in Q4 and December.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rallied 2.9% in December and 8.99% in Q4 to finish the full year up 31.22%. The Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) was by far the best performing US index ETF in 2019 with a gain of 38.96%, and it was the third best ETF in the entire matrix. The title of best performing ETF in 2019 goes to the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector ETF (XLK), which rallied 49.86%. Remember, 40% of XLK is made up of just Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which gained 89% and 58% in 2019, respectively. The Russia stock market ETF (RSX) was the second biggest winner in the matrix with a 2019 total return of 40.79%.\n\n&gt; Everywhere you look across the equity landscape, there were big winners in 2019, but the weakest area of the market was the Energy sector ETF (XLE). Even still, XLE managed to put up double-digit percentage gains on the year at +11.74%.\n\n&gt; In the commodities space, we saw oil gain 32.61% in 2019, which actually bested the gain for the S&amp;P 500. Gold (GLD) and silver (SLV) both put in solid gains in the mid-teens, while the perpetually losing natural gas ETF (UNG) was the only ticker in the matrix that fell across all three time frames (December, Q4, and full year).\n\n&gt; Looking at fixed income, the aggregate bond market ETFs (AGG and BND) posted total returns of 8%+, while the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) gained 14% on the year. Q4 and December were tough for fixed income, however, as rates moved higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/assetclass1231.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Almanac: Average Performance Slips in Presidential Election Years\n\n&gt; January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations typically propels stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but fifth on the S&amp;P 500 and sixth for DJIA since 1950. It is the end of the best three-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.\n\n&gt; DJIA and S&amp;P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2016 as both indices suffered losses in ten of those seventeen Januarys with three in a row, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and then again in 2014 to 2016. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&amp;P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1931 respectively. Last year, January was downright stellar after the worst December since 1931 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; In election years, Januarys have been weaker. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 slip to number #8 while DJIA average performance dips negative. NASDAQ slips to #3, but average performance remains respectable at 1.7%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/891a38b2171ab08b547127db29f12536/f4d2c822df56176c-4f/s400x600/8f8fe64b2da5c123c7e073095dd8b656e1066429.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 3rd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.5.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$CMC** \n&gt; * **$WBA** \n&gt; * **$BBBY** \n&gt; * **$STZ** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$CALM** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$ANGO** \n&gt; * **$AZZ** \n&gt; * **$KBH** \n&gt; * **$UNF** \n&gt; * **$MSM** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$SCHN** \n&gt; * **$SNX** \n&gt; * **$AYI** \n&gt; * **$GBX** \n&gt; * **$HELE** \n&gt; * **$SAR** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$NTIC** \n&gt; * **$LNN** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$KRUS** \n&gt; * **$FC** \n&gt; * **$SLP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Trp0mo0.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/lNG07hG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/Y1KO0R4.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DNOQOhD.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.7.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QorVd8K.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xTrYEcQ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.8.2 0Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TRPytQz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/owUNbSh.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RXUjAgC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/m5AQPKl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/v60Cw2n.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.10.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $229.38\n&gt; **lululemon athletica inc.

When you buy a call from your brokerage, they hedge their delta risk with positions in the underlying, i.e. they buy $TSLA. As the price of the underlying increases, the delta on the contracts increases and they need to buy more shares. There's similar upward pressure when there's short interest, as bears get margin called and have to buy shares to cover their positions. The fact that brokerages are buying up shares to hedge leveraged bull positions decreases the supply of shares in the market too. This is what happened during the famous Volkswagen short squeeze.\n\nIf the company fails to make a profit or misses its margins or people just decide to profit take, it could trigger a MASSIVE sell off, as clearing houses reduce their delta exposure as the underlying falls and the masses of retail investors panic sell.",

        "selftext": "Beating the market is hard. Most hedge Funds can't do it. And most Amateur investors get destroyed by the S&amp;P500. \n\nThe last 10 years I've been able to beat the market. I'm not a genius. And no I didn't destroy the market and make crazy returns. But enough to make it worth while. So how did I beat the market?\n\nFirst of all my default is S&amp;P500 Index. Which is the market IMO. Buy it and hold and you are the market. Next I look for stocks are woefully undervalued. These don't come very often in this environment. \n\nThe first couple years my picks were okay. These stock picks only made up about 10-15% of my portfolio. Then in 2012 I saw Apple. Bought a couple shares. Then in 2013 it was undervalued massively. It had a PE of 11 and a PE of 8 if you took out cash. Crazy. So I loaded up on Apple. At one point Apple was 40% of my portfolio.\n\nFrom 2012-2019 I didn't have any sizeable positions in any other individual stock. With Apple basically doubling the return of the S&amp;P500 the last 7 years I easily beat the market. I found this is the best way to beat the market. \n\n1. Buy S&amp;P500\n\n2. Buy individual stocks only if they are grossly undervalued. This is a rare event. Only happens once every 5 years or so.\n\n3. Invest new money into S&amp;P500\n\nOf course there are other ways to beat the market. You could go 100% all individual stocks but that is more risky are requires way more time to monitor dozens of companies. I'd rather just focus on 1 or 2 companies and go in deep.",

        "selftext": "\nIt might be a crowded trade, but the stock is still cheap, relative to the online retailer\u2019s free cash flow.\n\n\u201cBuy Amazon\u201d isn\u2019t the world\u2019s biggest stock-picking clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s close. There are 49 analysts who cover the shares, and 47 of them are positive, with two neutral, according to FactSet. Only Alibaba Group Holding of China and ICICI Bank of India boast more endorsements.\n\nAnd after a record-setting run-up, Amazon\u2019s stock isn\u2019t obviously inviting. A $1,000 stake at the close of the stock\u2019s first day of trading in 1997 has turned into more than $950,000. The shares today, at $1,875, go for 69 times projected 2020 earnings.\n\nStill, buy Amazon.com (ticker: AMZN). The stock price looks sensible when compared with free cash flow, which is swelling quickly. Some growth initiatives are only now paying off. Don\u2019t expect a 35% gain this year, as Amazon has averaged, compounded, since going public. But don\u2019t rule it out, either.\n\nAmazon\u2019s reputation for operating near break-even has long been outdated. Founder Jeff Bezos has emphasized free cash flow over accounting earnings from the start, and Amazon has generated free cash since 2002. The company has tended to invest much of that cash for growth, and the result is that earnings have been positive only since 2014, and only meaningfully so since 2018. Now the numbers are reaching escape velocity.\n\nWhen 2019\u2019s results are released, Wall Street expects Amazon to report that revenue increased by 20%, to $279.1 billion; that earnings rose slightly, to $10.4 billion; and that free cash flow ballooned by 28%, to $24.9 billion. In 2020, free cash flow is expected to expand even faster, by 36%, to $34 billion.\n\nWithin five years, the consensus view is that Amazon will become the biggest free cash generator in America, passing some companies that aren\u2019t exactly standing still, like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). The simplest reason is that Amazon\u2019s investment spending can\u2019t keep up with its growth rate forever.\n\nAmazon launched Prime in 2005, with its free two-day shipping for members, and vast opportunities for the company to put capital to work building speedier infrastructure. Not long after, Amazon Web Services went into cloud computing, another path for investment. Both ventures have proved to be lucrative, with Prime spurring increased spending by shoppers, and AWS yielding generous profit margins.\n\nLast year, Amazon said that it would spend to shorten free Prime shipping to a single day. There are early signs of that paying off, too. Cowen analyst John Blackledge estimates that Prime membership grew 13% during the fourth quarter, versus a year earlier. That compares with 3% growth a year ago and would be the third straight quarter of acceleration.\n\nNow, consider another of Amazon\u2019s growth initiatives: advertising. A recent search for \u201cmen\u2019s tennis rackets\u201d on Amazon.com yielded editorial recommendations and a racket listing labeled \u201cAmazon\u2019s Choice.\u201d But nothing was more prominently displayed than the three sponsored racket listings near the top\u2014except for the paid ad for portable nets just above them.\n\nAdvertising doesn\u2019t require vast investments in fleets and data farms, and it looks like another boon for Amazon\u2019s growth. Ad revenue will rise 36%, to $17.6 billion, in 2020, and by 2025 will top $46 billion, predicts Cowen\u2019s Blackledge. Assuming a 35% operating margin for the business, he estimates that advertising and AWS will together account for 90% of operating income this year.\n\nThat has important implications for shareholders. First, it bodes well for the competitiveness of a store when it doesn\u2019t have to rely on its retail margins for the bulk of profits. Second, the advertising ramp provides another rich source of funds to invest in growth. Third, with Amazon passing the anniversary of its spending boost for Prime one-day, it is unclear that it will need that extra spending. As things stand, growth in capital expenditures is expected to decelerate from over 25% last year, to 16% this year, to under 10% in 2021.\n\nAmong 10 analysts who have estimated Amazon\u2019s free cash flow out to 2021, the lowest says $32.7 billion, the highest says $57.5 billion, and the average is $43.7 billion. Out to 2024, there are only three estimates, averaging $82.8 billion. Apple, in comparison, is expected to produce close to $63 billion in free cash during its current fiscal year through September.\n\nIf distant estimates for Amazon are feasible, or even if they are only moderately overblown, the stock could continue outperforming. At less than 30 times estimated 2020 free cash flow, it is cheaper than the shares of Visa (V), Nike (NKE), or McDonald\u2019s (MCD). From here, 20% annual gains for the next three years could leave the stock priced at a humbler 25 times free cash flow.\n\nA government crackdown against powerful tech titans is a risk, but Amazon may have a better \u201cwho me?\u201d defense than some of the others. Its market share in the public cloud is less than half, and falling, as Microsoft and others catch up. In e-commerce, more than half of its sales are from third-party merchants who pay to use its services. And in online advertising, it\u2019s a pipsqueak next to Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB).\n\nAll told, Amazon is popular with stockpickers for good reason. It\u2019s not too late to join the crowd.\n\nSource: Barron's",

        "selftext": "Back at it again with another recommendation. Hopefully you guys are swimming in tendies for SBUX!\n\nTo address the concerns: Apple going up 34% on the 3 month chart and 13% on the monthly is not a huge concern for me mainly because of these gains are supported by the integration and expansion of  Apple's service revenue and wearables (airpods/watches) revenue as part of it's core investment strategy. I think it's a healthy move to diversify and branch out from the flagship iPhone revenue which generates some 60% of it's revenue. Apple looks to be staging a great foundation for the development of the service platform which aims to help provide an insurance for customers at a relatively reasonable price ( which I assume will become even more affordable and therefore, profitable as they scale this area). Numbers in last fiscal quarter also suggest a growing revenue share in this area. As per the wearables technology, the watches are becoming increasingly adapted to the active lifestyle market, which is an attractive combination of both technology and sports. I don't see a big competitor in this space as Apple has already established such a strong foundation in this product and the dominance of it's competitors are disproportionately favorable for Apple.\n\nOn second thought, the airpods are also a great technology that they can expand on. Recently there is some buzz on earphones as a health product, by integrating technology that can monitor heart rate and blood pressure through the ear canal via the airpods. This makes a great deal of sense as the skin is much thinner in the ear passageway compared to the wrist that the watch monitors off of. Would be really cool to see if they can work with something like this, and perhaps even integrate a voice recognition system and a translating software (like Google) to make the airpods more than just convenient, but highly accessible. \n\nI'd assume that ER will do commensurately better than the previous year, and we should be seeing some great numbers to support this growth. ALSO! integration of AMD technology into their new macbooks are going to be big for gamers and tech enthusiasts who have largely been accustomed to the Intel processors for ages. AMD is also a grow and developing company and their potential in unison with Apple can be a game changer for the software/high performance gaming market that Apple can also enter into. So, cheers to that my friends! Goodluck!",

        "selftext": "Ok, so--first thing in the morning when the market opens, I'll usually yolo all my cash into some put credit spreads on SPY or AAPL or some shit expiring at the end of the week.\n\nThen, you ask: what do I do now while I wait for tendies?\n\nI usually look at the screen, those options that I sold some poor fucker quickly depreciating to zero. I like that feeling, that feeling that I just scammed someone of their hard-earned cash. I particularly like to imagine that this person saved up a lot of money and finally entered the stock market to just lose it all to Papa Theta. This usually makes me kinda hard, actually. Especially when I think of all those poor peasants I'm sending to rot on the streets because of my epic options plays. Just the thought of them shivering in the cold, slowly dying, their cash in my pocket--it's enough to get me to blow my load twice (sometimes even thrice) in a day.\n\nAnd this, my friends, is how I have amazing hands--I almost always let my options expire worthless as I'm too busy jacking off to poor people. Usually the joy and pleasure that I get from this practice is worth more than any money amount that I might have lost.",

        "selftext": " ***Apple Is the Most Valuable Company in the World (Not just by Market Cap).***\n\n*The   reason why Apple is objectively, within the constraints of the   corpora-paradigm we operate in, the most valuable company in the world   is simple:*\n\nThe social media tech giants, who began and *enabled* the ***hyperacquisition of society itself (the enablers)***;   the reason why the brightest minds in the world understand Apple is so   valuable, is because they are the only modern tech giant that can  resist  the inevitable collapse of social media (and the markets they\u2019ve   co-opted) once regulations are imposed. That is because Apple\u2019s  product  is not the people, unlike the vast majority of the  corporate-tech empire  that dominates the financial markets, to their  great misfortune. They  thought people could be convinced to ***underestimate their own value.***\n\nTake  Silicon Valley, home of the richest, brightest minds of the American  experience. ALL OF THEM who have new families, take the time to ensure  that their kids get as little screen time as possible, and understand  the value of humanity, and human worth.\n\nThankfully,  political narratives are in play that may have paradigm shifts in the  way markets, (as well as economies, and the philosophic underpinning  they rely on) operate in the future\n\nApple\u2019s   value, is that it has the power to not only resist the regulatory   collapse of social media, but it has the largest financial cash reserves   to re-invest back into society (for who\u2019s good?), or whatever it wants   to emerge from the ashes of the financial reawakening.\n\nIt\u2019s   the same reason why the Omaha Guru, the Wizard of Finance is so  heavily  invested in Apple, and why he also (coincidentally, I\u2019m sure)  operated  under the same financial philosophy of prioritizing great free  cash flow  reserves.\n\nApple\u2019s  value can\u2019t be  measured purely by the market. It\u2019s measured by how  resilient they\u2019re  going to be in the upcoming regulation of social  media and the markets  they\u2019ve taken over.\n\nOutcomes  that  are out of all of their hands, and in the hands of the people.  People  who are becoming increasingly aware of the dangers of social  media, and  aware of the dangers of Corporatism in politics, and the  link between  both issues.\n\nThe link is there, and people are aware, and that\u2019s that makes Apple so valuable.\n\nSo  Apple is the company to invest in, if you see a future where social  media becomes more scrutinized and regulated (it already is).\n\nRegulation  is not enough however, and people know that the mere existence of an  instrument that can be so easily exploited for tyranny should be viewed  with extreme skepticism. Particularly if it seems to mobilize dissent  against that skepticism.\n\nIf and when the next recession hits, one thing's for sure: Apple has the has statistical odds of coming out on top.",
