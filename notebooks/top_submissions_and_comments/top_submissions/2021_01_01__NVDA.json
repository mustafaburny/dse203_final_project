        "selftext": "**1, Brand loyalty and the NIO COMMUNITY**\n\nif you think tesla owners are cult followers, you have yet to seen Nio owners. Nio spent years and tons of money building and maintaining the Nio community that I have never seen any car manufacturer has done in the world. They built and are still building luxurious \"Nio house\" that both serve as dealerships on the first floor AND a place for Nio owners to hang on the second floor all over China. Instead of going to starbucks/library/sending their kids to day cares, many Nio owners go to Nio house to spend their weekend or send their kids to Nio house to meet the kids of other Nio owners. When you purchase a Nio car, you also join a big family.\n\n[There are tons of well designed Nio houses like this one in China ](https://preview.redd.it/jtfwd9j80ha61.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63191752b59e6a5661087aaf45048221e6c6922f)\n\nTo give you autists an example how much Nio owners love their Nio cars and their community, Nio community in Shenzhen rented a fucking plane to fly to Chengdu to watch the Nio day. The pilot, co-pilot, flight attendants and all passengers aboard are all Nio owners. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hvny4zba1ha61.jpg?width=473&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a2611b9f328006ad5a4c34775ca787104e05d55\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey also developed an app (similar format as reddit) for Nio owners. They can post what they love OR hate about their Nio cars and William Li constantly checks the app for owners feedbacks. The fact that they don't just delete the negative posts right away but allows them to exist or even being upvoted to the front page and William Li himself would promise improvements shows their confidence and their determination on building this user-centered brand reputation.  \n\n[The Nio APP](https://preview.redd.it/pcnoj06shha61.jpg?width=591&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1eda62ddf16e8b0ba0dfa5ddb5f0be1430b3620c)\n\n*Processing img s1af28zshha61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, I have yet to seen a single Nio owner who doesn't like the Nio service and does not recommend their family/friends to buy a Nio, it really is a cult. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2, Battery swap**\n\nI saw a lot of retards here shitting on the battery swap, and those people are dumb af. First you need to understand that not every Chinese lives in a house like most Americans do and a lot of them don't have charger installed at home or a fixed parking spot to park their cars. If they do have a fixed parking spot, Nio cars have fast charging and CAN be charged at home just like Tesla. For those who dont have this privilege, do you think they'd prefer to spend 5-10 mins to get their battery swapped on the way home once a week OR find a public charging station and sit there for 2 hours waiting for their cars to get fully charged? \n\nNot to mention that all Nio cars share the same battery size, meaning the battery are upgradable. Say all the sudden you want to do a road trip, not only you don't have to worry wasting time charging your battery along the way, you can also rent a bigger size battery from Nio for a short time for longer range.  When solid state battery tech are mature, old Nio models can just buy a new battery comparing to buying a new car.(It's truly future proof)  No other EVs can do those. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wje1sek45ha61.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbff76cc058b08c0d2b976e9a85b294cdc6dab6b\n\n**3,How Nio are perceived as a brand and how Nio is positioning themselves in the Chinese EV market.** \n\nChina, for the past two decades, are gradually transforming from producing cheap shit for quick money to building quality products like Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo etc are doing. However, there still ARE tons of people who would choose an established foreign brand over Chinese brand simply becasue of the subpar quality of Chinese products in the past, and it's an uphill battle for Chinese brands to gain the trust of Chinese consumers, especially the new emerging Chinese middle class with crazy buying power. \n\nTesla, on the other hand, have a huge fan base in China. I test drove Tesla model 3, Nio ES6, Xpeng P7, and Tesla model X. My objective verdict is, in terms of comfort and localization, Nio and Xpeng are both fantstic cars(better than Tesla in many aspects) and great value whereas Teslas are better driver's car with interior and build quality felt much cheaper. However, due to the high price of Model S and Model X and Tesla being a pioneer of EV, Tesla are viewed as a top brand in China. Even though Model 3 and Y both are aimed at the lower end market in China and have relativly poor build quality and way worse localization than Xpeng and Nio, the Tesla badge alone is worth a lot in many Chinese consumers' eyes, which is why Tesla are selling so well here and has higher demand by the day. \n\n*Processing img xomq27pa9ha61...*\n\nWith the relase of Nio ES8, ES6, EC6 and now ET7, Nio's strategy here is smart imo: they are trying to eat up the lunch of BMW, AUDI, Merc and even Porsche instead of releasing lower end cars to compete with Tesla in price. Because if say there is a a \"Nio ET3\" with similar price as Tesla Model 3 (40k USD) in the market rn, the majority of the Chinese buyers will take the Model 3 for the Tesla badge. And in my experience, Nio has done a great job stealing owners of high end German cars with their great service, the Nio community, and their great cars. Two of my neighbors who used to drive Audi Q7 and BMW 7 series swtiched to Nio ES6 and bascially became Nio salesman/saleswoman lol, and that speaks for the quality of Nio products. While there are many retards who are using the price of Tesla Model 3/Y to trash on Nio online, Nio ES8 ES6 EC6 ET7 will sell well as the demand for luxurious EV is there in China and Nio is pretty much the only option. I believe eventually Nio will release a 40k USD car in a year or two, but I like their strategy now. \n\n[My neightbor's ES6](https://preview.redd.it/kb0aut7ebha61.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43854d812406010c570e2693dffe77349f3393a4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4, The Chinese EV market** \n\nSome of you retards already know this, but the majority of you don't, so let me give you some info on why the Chinese gov is pushing EV and how they are doing it. China is huge, but the natural resources per capita is low, especially oil. We heavily rely on the oil import from Russia and the middle East, and without them the the domestic oil supply is unsustainable. Electricity, however, is another story. Not only we have much greater coal reserve, the Chinese gov are pushing clean energy like crazy (hydro power, wind power, nuclear power etc), the amount of hydro power generated by Chinese dams are more than every single country's entire grid except the US and India.  While charging stations in the west are privately owned, Chinese goverment are literally pouring money into building all the infrastructure preparing a shift from ICE cars to EV. When CPC are determined to do something, they will get it done. Meanwhile, in mega cities like Beijing and Shanghai, the waitlist for owning an ICE car is literally several years while you can buy and register an EV right away with government subsidies. I think CPC will roll out more and more strict policies on owning ICE cars and eventually indirectly ban them. Even if 1 percent of Chinese drivers choose to buy a Nio in the future, that's still a HUGE number. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j0kmy2q7eha61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c51284b5bd30f44fc3e3b179b99c3f4ad76ddb0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img pdotyiewdha61...*\n\nOverall, I'm really bullish on not just Nio, but also Xpeng, Li Auto, BYD, CATL etc and think Nio has a very bright future if things go right. \n\nWith the European expansion in the foreeable future, great leadership under William Li, great relationship between Nio and CATL and Nio and Nvidia, great products and great service, the cult of Nio community, and increasingly and inevitably more Chinese customers swtiching to EV, Nio has all the potential be the Huawei of Chinese auto manufacturer.  Buy Nio(Xpeng, BYD, CATL) stocks/leaps as much as you can and diamond hand them. it's going to be a wild ride but you will thank me in a few years with your multi baggers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: NIO to the fucking moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Listen up.. \u201cIf you think BB moon\u2019d after this week, you\u2019re a rough brained retard. Our astronauts John Chen and Tom Eacobacci are literally in the break room; Chen\u2019s unpacking some homemade Yangzouh Fried Rice from his wife, Tom is microwaving stale coffee and asking Chen if he\u2019s going to change his name to Cha Ching after he becomes a Billionaire in 2023. Chen smirks as he cracks open his wheel of fortune cookie... the point is, rocket is still fucking grounded. I repeat, the rocket is grounded.\n\nListen retards, did you miss AMD? Did you miss NVDA? Did you miss trash ass Cringecoin? Hell, did you even miss TSLA? Are you seething with FOMO up to your ears and out of your assholes watching these stocks mint fresh millennial millionaires while you twiddled your thumbs thinking \u201cGeE WiZ tHeY haVe To CoMe DoWn EveNtuAlLYyyyYyyYy\u201d\n\nPro tip: they never came down...\n\nThese rockets went to the fucking moon and left your ass behind on planet Earth, living a shitty wage life flipping burgers, while the retards that boarded these rockets are on the moon laying on beach chairs, sunglasses on, and rubbing sunscreen with SPF 9000 on their smooth brains because they got front row tickets to the sun... FRONT ROW TICKETS TO THE FUCKING, SUN... this is the present state of affairs.\n\nThere is, lucky you, however, another rocket with the inscription BBC fueling up and selling tickets to the moon AS WE SPEAK.\n\nCurrent position: missionary with 10,555 shares and reverse cowgirl with some calls. I\u2019m holding unrealized profits of about $110k and realized profits of about $100k.\n\nHowever, if you ask me 10 years from now my biggest regret in life... I will tell you two things: 1, not getting my wife her bf earlier on, and 2, booking $100k profit too soon in BB.\n\nMay Lord Chen forgive my moment of weakness. Learn from me. Buy and walk away. Buy and hold. Do not be tempted to sell before the moon. To not sell when the rocket is still in the stratosphere.\n\nMoon is $50 IF THE STOCK JUST TRADES ON PAR WITH ITS FUCKING PEERS, MOON CAN EASILY BE $100+ IF YOU FACTOR IN VERTICALS, ECONOMIC MOAT, and a $450-750 billion Auto Data Market as stated in Mckinsey &amp; Company\u2019s report on Monetizing Auto Data. Yes that\u2019s not a mistake, the overall revenue pool from Global Auto Data monetization could be as high as $750 BILLION in 2030. This is the market BB has cornered and is about to squeeze by the balls. QNX was always the crown Jewel of all their verticals. This was always the master plan for the turnaround. We are on the fucking cusp of one of the greatest turnarounds in history.\n\nListen, I don\u2019t think some of you rough brained retards realize what is happening:\n\nAsk yourselves: why is the EV sector so hot? Why is every large tech corporation trying to get a piece of this Auto pie?\n\nYou wanna know why? Because when the computer first came out it took the space of entire fucking floors in a building to do simple calculations... when the cell phone first came out, you needed a fucking brief case just to carry it and looked like an absolute tool making a phone call, stopping everything you\u2019re doing, laying down your suitcase, opening it, taking out the brick, extending a massive antenna, LMFAO, what fucking tools boomers were... anyways, now look at the modern laptop and smartphone. Look at the revolutions these products went through to become cemented into our lives. Look at the markets these products opened up for us.\n\nNow, what current item is undergoing this type of revolution? You guessed it, you smooth brained criminal you, the Automobile. What was once dinosaur machinery unironically running on dead dinosaurs, is now making the revolution on the scale that computers and phones went through to become what they are today.\n\nAnd guess who created a business moat anticipating this move 10 years in advance? Guess who cemented their ISO SAFETY CERTIFIED AUTO OS into 175 million automobiles as of today, hint hint: it\u2019s the same company that\u2019s so criminally undervalued and just took on AWS as their partner to scale up their business for next phase of the turnaround: Revenue Growth.\n\nBlackberry. It\u2019s Blackberry. Babe berry. Member berry. The blacker the berry... the sweeter the juice boys.\n\n\u201cwhAt aBoUT GoOgLe aNd APpLe or TSLA TaKiNg OvEr the Auto OS mArKet\u201d\n\nListen retards, BlackBerry\u2019s MOAT is bullet proof. You know why?\n\nBecause what\u2019s the one thing Google, Apple, and TSLA have in common? They\u2019re actually in the fucking auto business.\n\nYou think Mercedes or Toyota wants to cede even more profit in the auto business to competitors by adopting their OS and giving them a boost? Do you know how cutthroat and ruthless the corporate world is?\n\nLet me demonstrate with the ol\u2019 lemonade stand analogy. Let\u2019s say you setup a lemonade stand outside your house and all the kids are going nuts for your lemonade. Next thing you know, Jimmy from next door opens a lemonade stand, and throws in a Jolly Rancher inside each lemonade he makes. You\u2019re fucked. Jimmy just took your business, your friends, your girl and her bf.\n\nYou need to level the playing field by adding Jolly Ranchers to your lemonade... so how will you do this? Are you gonna go up to Jimmy\u2019s stand and straight up buy Jolly Ranchers from your mortal enemy? Is that what a smooth brained person would do?\n\nNO, you would walk your ass down the street to a neutral third party convenient store, buy fucking Jolly Ranchers from them, and while you\u2019re at it, buy some cough syrup and add that as well to your lemonade. Because fuck Jimmy, that\u2019s why.\n\nSpeaking of lemonade...\n\n\u201cwHat iF ShiTrOn TaKeS a ShIT oN BB?\u201d\n\nAndrew Left although the gayest bear of them all, actually saw BB potential years ago calling it the next NVDA. He was early on that call, but he was right.\n\nBack to the lemonade moat:\n\nListen retards, Blackberry is not a competitor to any auto maker the same way Apple, Google, and TSLA are. You think auto makers are going to use their competitors OS? Or you think these non techy auto dinosaurs like Mercedes and Toyota are gonna reinvent the wheel and create their own OS. Fuck no. Don\u2019t be so rough brained and fall for that gay bear \u201cDD\u201d\n\nBlackBerry is a third party corporation that all auto makers can form an auto cartel around with Papa Chen as the cartel lord. A couple automakers MIGHT create their own OS because they\u2019re a fucking tech company to begin with, and they have the scale and reach to do so, but don\u2019t think for A FUCKING SECOND their competitors are gonna just line up to use it and cede more their profits to them. These other Auto OS (if made) will be specific and unique to that companies own car. Think. Use that smooth brain.\n\nBlackberry has effectively become the gate keeper of the Auto Data Market.\n\nAlso this is a tough fucking market. Cars are one of the most data rich endpoints in the world that need securing. This isn\u2019t like a laptop, you click the wrong link, and next thing you know you have a million Hentai pop ups. The car is more serious. You click the wrong link; and you\u2019re dead.\n\nAre you getting the picture now? Do you see why Cylance was bought? Do you see why BlackBerry\u2019s moat is so secure?\n\nCylance has just been integrated into QNX and was shown off at CES. How many of you missed that fine detail?\n\nNot only does QNX now act as the gatekeeper of all auto data, it fucking protects the super sensitive endpoints using AI driven cyber protection that gets better and better the more the data grows, which it will, exponentially.\n\nAutomakers are lined up like school boys on Easter Sunday ready for deliverance from Papa Chen as he blesses them with QNX.\n\nRemember when Chen said: \u201cwhen better days come, we\u2019ll be ready to execute\u201d\n\nBetter days are here. This is what he was talking about. They\u2019ve positioned and prepared themselves for 10 years to become the Auto Data Gatekeeper once the technology was ready. The foresight on Papa Chen... Absolute Genius.\u201d\n\nCredits fo the DD: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l37ktg/bb_weekend_due_diligence_confirmation_bias/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",

        "selftext": " \n\nSo you bought $BB at $11 pre-market friday. Smart move my fellow degens \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 strap in, cause you're in for a ride to the moons of fucking pluto.\n\nTL;DR Blackberry/AWS IVY will be in every single vehicle produced after 2022. EV or ICE, self-driving or boomer driving, it doesn't fucking matter. It \ud83d\ude80 will \ud83d\ude80 be \ud83d\ude80 in \ud83d\ude80 every \ud83d\ude80 single \ud83d\ude80 one \ud83d\ude80 Oh, and Blackberry QNX is fun too.\n\nBefore you start reading, I'd suggest grabbing a snack and a drink. Cause I'm about to drop a fucking novel.\n\nYou've probably heard Blackberry QNX a few times around other DDs but you're wondering wtf is it and who the hell is even using it. QNX is an Real Time Operating System (more on this later) meant for vehicles, and it's been around for a really long time. Currently there are at least 175m cars running around with QNX. As for what cars those are, I'll keep it short: Apple Car Play was developed on QNX.\n\nSo why haven't we heard more about Blackberry in recent years since there's so many QNX cars around? 2 reasons. 1: Dumbasses like you thought it was a phone company. 2: QNX is so ahead of the fucking game that boomer auto manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes were too stupid to use it effectively. For the last few years it's just been used to turn on your car's radio. *But things have changed now.*\n\n**Zombie cars and QNX**\n\nQNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. *What the fuck does that even mean nerd?* For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.\n\nBlackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally could develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.\n\nFast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot *program* but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?\n\n[SONY?](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGWdfOT_GLnUXiZBQr4m4lDr6V0nzG6pkRMU6WLRNhsLRKDJHY4MAwxHb-HWZr3pDmEfBYyleSgqSAIjoeXMqU6MfKVSgBbWY5t8brOzZ61dAfzBMOQezOwKfHLLecBdHNEqSjqSskM_c-uUKa-IndxUGWi_Ay9pQMD4kj0iDqvI) Blackberry QNX.

If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? [Li Auto](https://en.desaysv.com/index.php?id=4974) But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using [Nvidia](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/nvidia-announces-world-first-functionally-safe-ai-self-driving-platform) DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both [Canoo](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/blackberry-to-power-autonomy-systems-in-canoos-next-generation-electric-vehicles) and [Hyundai](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/hyundai-autron-selects-blackberry-qnx-to-power-next-generation-adas-and-autonomous-driving-software-platform) makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. *But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.*\n\nYou might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nLinux is also an open source OS and this becomes a huge problem when we talk about zombie cars.\n\nThat's right. *Motherfucking zombie cars*. You know that scene in \"Fate of the Furious\" where Charlize Theron straight up just hacks all the cars in the city and starts slamming them into buildings? Yea, this is a legitimate fear of the U.S. government and Linux is not going to pass any safety regulations. And you better believe after SolarWind and FireEye hacks, Cybersecurity is the hottest topic right now when it comes to national security. You better believe the U.S. Government won't just allow open source OS flowing around millions of autonomous driving cars that can be hijacked at any time of day.\n\nYou know who does have MULTIPLE government certifications already though? Blackberry bb. I won't get it, but you can read [u/josh\\_moworld](https://www.reddit.com/u/josh_moworld/)'s post right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/) to get a better idea Blackberry's history with the U.S. government and security.\n\nThe best part about it all is, Blackberry designed QNX to be 100% POSIX compliant. In dumbass terms it basically means any LINUX based program can be ported over easily. Come join the dark side, Elon.\n\nNow that you're pretty much caught up to speed on QNX, let's move over to IVY and why I believe IVY will be Blackberry's return to the throne \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n**Blackberry x AWS IVY**\n\nIVY is a co-development between Blackberry and Amazon and it is a 50/50 partnership. That's right; Jeff Bezos, the second richest man in the world and king of predatory business practices chose to partner with a company that has a $5.5b market cap. All hail, John Chen \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc51\n\nSo what is IVY? Basically IVY cloud-based software that OEMs can install into their QNX vehicles (or any OS) and read sensor data from the vehicle's DCUs (domain controller units). These are basically sensors that give you data such as: times that you unlocked and locked your car, your car's wheel speed sensors, wiper arm sensors, tire pressure etc. In a Tesla, which is loaded with sensors, you will also see: sentry mode data, when an small object hits your car while parked, how hard you step on the accelerator, how hard you brake etc.\n\nIVY basically captures this data and in real time sends it to OEMs for them to analyze. Cars are going to be fitted with more and more sensors (regardless of if they have autonomous systems or not) and the data that IVY provides is very helpful. This allows OEMs to see their customer's car preferences or driving styles and can further develop their future vehicles to match customer's interests. Also, since the data is transferred in REAL TIME, things like horrible weather conditions, traffic updates, and icy roads can be communicated to all vehicles within the OEM network so that people can be notified ahead of time.\n\nBut you know which industry would *love* this? Insurance companies. OEMs can gather all the safety data that IVY delivers and actually PROVE to insurance companies that their cars are safer. You know how Tesla had to come up with their own auto insurance? That was because Insurance companies were charging crazy high rates for Tesla's that had auto pilot. They didn't know exactly how to rate the risk, or who would take the blame. With Blackberry IVY, OEMs and insurance companies can partner together and have reliable data to work off of.\n\nBest part of it all, IVY is extremely scalable and is a subscription based service. There isn't an exact price announced yet, but you know if Jeff Bezos is involved then there will definitely be a lot of profits flowing in from IVY.\n\nFor me, I'm long-term on $BB with some options to take advantage of the recent hype. I plan on holding shares until I see an actual competitor to QNX and IVY... which I've looked all over the internet and I can't find any. And honestly, Blackberry's security suite has so much to offer this isn't even the complete DD. I've just been typing for too long and figured it was a good time to stop. Maybe I will write another post in the future.",

        "selftext": "TLDR: Gamestop is fielding PC build kiosks at a number of stores, BUY GME SHARES ROCKETS OUTBOUND\n\n\nToday I went into Gamestop with the intent of browsing around and using a $25 gift card I got for Christmas like a year ago. I have not been inside a physical GME store since at least 2018 when I bought an Xbox. I immediately noticed that they have a much wider variety of merchandise, everything from games to PC hardware to toys and clothing. So on that note I was looking to buy a new PC gaming headset since I noticed they \"have\" a ton of them. I grabbed one and went to check out. The manager informed me that they don't actually have them in stock or available to order- in fact, most of the items in the store were just display boxes for promotional purposes. I thought this was weird, but she explained that:\n\n**1- They sell in-store items so fast that if they didn't display empty boxes the store would look entirely empty. She gave an example of 200 packs of pokemon cards that sold out completely within 24 hours**\n\n**2- They are reluctant to fill the store with generic items that don't move fast, because that store specifically, among \"3-4 others in the state\" are going to be totally redesigned to accommodate for what she described to me as \"PC building stations\".**\n\n**3- They have been absolutely crushing it with sales and store interest due to COVID. She stated that people are buying things that she has never sold before, like niche Wii remotes and other items.\"**\n\nNow, we have speculated for some time that GME is going to pivot to PC parts and hardware. I noticed that they do stock some PC peripherals and a few components like graphics cards (older models, they had an NVIDIA 1660 in stock) and PSUs. \n\nHOWEVER, I haven't seen or heard anything regarding a full-on build station. The way she described it to me, is that customers will be able to totally spec out a PC gaming rig, and have it shipped directly to their house. She said there will likely be a dedicated store employee there to assist customers and provide advice. THIS IS FUCKING HUGE. Currently, you have to be pretty \"in-the-know\" to spec out a gaming PC properly, and the pricing makes it unrealistic for a lot of gamers. On top of that, I think there is a perception that you need a lot more technical skill to get into PC gaming. What GME is doing will allow the PC gaming market to bust wide open and become more accessible for a lot more people. And finally, some sort of agreement or deal with the big manufacturers (as hinted) would make this even more lucrative!\n\nShe also said that there is a huge push from upper management for store employees to get knowledgeable on PC gaming and hardware- she said management is pushing hard for the company to step into the future. Meanwhile during the 30 minutes I was in the store, probably 10-15 customers came through and bought at least minor items. Keep in mind this is in a strip mall in a Midwestern rust belt town- certainly does not fit the \"Next blockbuster!1!!!\" thesis.\n\nPersonally I believe this is a very bullish move from Gamestop- and bodes well for the future on top of the other well-established information out there. GME is and continues to be an excellent value play, not even accounting for the upcoming short squeeze. It sounds like the vision from Cohen and others at the top is already filtering down to the people charged with carrying it out. I plan to buy at least 50 more shares on Tuesday.\n\n\nPositions: 250 shares @22.30 cost avg, 2x 4/19/21 $30c, 2x 01/29/21 $50c\n\n(Somebody on mobile add the rockets pls)",

        "selftext": "I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.\n\n**How is \"Hype\" calculated?**\n\nWell, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit\n\n**How can I use this list?**\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits.

We are on the fucking cusp of one of the greatest turnarounds in history. \n\nListen, I don\u2019t think some of you rough brained retards realize what is happening: \n\nAsk yourselves: why is the EV sector so hot? Why is every large tech corporation trying to get a piece of this Auto pie? \n\nYou wanna know why? Because when the computer first came out it took the space of entire fucking floors in a building to do simple calculations... when the cell phone first came out, you needed a fucking brief case just to carry it and looked like an absolute tool making a phone call, stopping everything you\u2019re doing, laying down your suitcase, opening it, taking out the brick, extending a massive antenna, LMFAO, what fucking tools boomers were... anyways, now look at the modern laptop and smartphone. Look at the revolutions these products went through to become cemented into our lives. Look at the markets these products opened up for us. \n\nNow, what current item is undergoing this type of revolution? You guessed it, you smooth brained criminal you, the Automobile. What was once dinosaur machinery unironically running on dead dinosaurs, is now making the revolution on the scale that computers and phones went through to become what they are today. \n\nAnd guess who created a business moat anticipating this move 10 years in advance? Guess who cemented their ISO SAFETY CERTIFIED AUTO OS into 175 million automobiles as of today, hint hint: it\u2019s the same company that\u2019s so criminally undervalued and just took on AWS as their partner to scale up their business for next phase of the turnaround: Revenue Growth. \n\nBlackberry. It\u2019s Blackberry. Babe berry. Member berry. The blacker the berry... the sweeter the juice boys. \n\n\u201cwhAt aBoUT GoOgLe aNd APpLe or TSLA TaKiNg OvEr the Auto OS mArKet\u201d \n\nListen retards, BlackBerry\u2019s MOAT is bullet proof. You know why?\n\nBecause what\u2019s the one thing Google, Apple, and TSLA have in common? They\u2019re actually in the fucking auto business. \n\nYou think Mercedes or Toyota wants to cede even more profit in the auto business to competitors by adopting their OS and giving them a boost? Do you know how cutthroat and ruthless the corporate world is? \n\nLet me demonstrate with the ol\u2019 lemonade stand analogy. Let\u2019s say you setup a lemonade stand outside your house and all the kids are going nuts for your lemonade. Next thing you know, Jimmy from next door opens a lemonade stand, and throws in a Jolly Rancher inside each lemonade he makes. You\u2019re fucked. Jimmy just took your business, your friends, and your girl and her bf. \n\nYou need to level the playing field by adding Jolly Ranchers to your lemonade... so how will you do this? Are you gonna go up to Jimmy\u2019s stand and straight up buy Jolly Ranchers from your mortal enemy? Is that what a smooth brained person would do? \n\nNO, you would walk your ass down the street to a neutral third party convenient store, buy fucking Jolly Ranchers from them, and while you\u2019re at it, buy some cough syrup and add that as well to your fucking lemonade. Because fuck Jimmy, that\u2019s why. \n\nSpeaking of lemonade... \n\n\u201cwHat iF ShiTrOn TaKeS a ShIT oN BB?\u201d\n\nAndrew Left although the gayest bear of them all, actually saw BB potential years ago calling it the next NVDA. He was early on that call, but he was right. \n\nBack to the lemonade moat: \n\nListen retards, Blackberry is not a competitor to any auto maker the same way Apple, Google, and TSLA are. You think auto makers are going to use their competitors OS? Or you think these non techy auto dinosaurs like Mercedes and Toyota are gonna reinvent the wheel and create their own OS. Fuck no. Don\u2019t be so rough brained and fall for that gay bear \u201cDD\u201d \n\nBlackBerry is a third party corporation that all auto makers can form an auto cartel around with Papa Chen as the cartel lord. A couple automakers MIGHT create their own OS because they\u2019re a fucking tech company to begin with, and they have the scale and reach to do so, but don\u2019t think for A FUCKING SECOND their competitors are gonna just line up to use it and cede more their profits to them. These other Auto OS (if made) will be specific and unique to that companies own car. Think. Use that smooth brain. \n\nBlackberry has effectively become the gate keeper of the Auto Data Market. \n\nAlso this is a tough fucking market. Cars are on of the most data rich endpoints in the world that need securing. This isn\u2019t like a laptop, you click the wrong link, and next thing you know you have a million Hentai pop ups. The car is more serious. You click the wrong link; and you\u2019re dead. \n\nAre you getting the picture now? Do you see why Cylance was bought? Do you see why BlackBerry\u2019s moat is so secure? \n\nNot only does QNX act as the gatekeeper of all auto data, it fucking protects the super sensitive endpoints using AI driven cyber protection that gets better and better the more the data grows, which it will, exponentially. \n\nAutomakers are lined up like school boys on Easter Sunday ready for deliverance from Papa Chen as he blesses them with QNX.\n\nRemember when Chen said: \u201cwhen better days come, we\u2019ll be ready to execute\u201d\n\nBetter days are here. This is what he was talking about. They\u2019ve positioned and prepared themselves for 10 years to become the Auto Data Gatekeeper once the technology was ready. The foresight on Papa Chen... Absolute Genius.  \n\n[The Ultimate DD by Mckinsey &amp; Company \u2014 Read This and Get your Pee Pee Hard knowing BB will effectively be the gatekeeper of this New Market](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/automotive%20and%20assembly/our%20insights/monetizing%20car%20data/monetizing-car-data.ashx)",

        "selftext": "**In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of AMD\ud83d\ude80, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone! Let\u2019s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles &amp; PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.\n\nThe company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.\n\nSo, guys, let\u2019s go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.\n\nThe [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing &amp; Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn\u2019t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can\u2019t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.\n\nBoth of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing &amp; graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn\u2019t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation &amp; amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation. \n\nThey have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest &amp; tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.\n\nThe company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 &amp; Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nTheir product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel\u2019s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.\ud83d\ude80\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world\u2019s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.\n\nThey have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also [working](https://ibb.co/D9dDDYs) with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings &amp; Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.\n\nAMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/N2YQFS9) \ud83d\ude80, which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/QH8RTCN) has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would [create](https://ibb.co/qJM6Gn4) synergies. [They](https://ibb.co/PcNhH58) are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it\u2019s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.\n\nAMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they [expect](https://ibb.co/RpcwXYr) an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nI used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA. \n\nFor the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.\n\nSo, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach. \n\nIf we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nFor my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.\n\nI think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high [demand](https://ibb.co/vQFwyRd) the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage &amp; digital currency mining.\n\nFor their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.\n\nThis means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest &amp; other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax. \n\nI [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.\n\nSo, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.\n\nI like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.   \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \n\nI think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, [THIS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40. \n\nSo [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nI think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more &amp; more chips that also keep advancing in technology. \n\nThe company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/NCtxnFq), with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once [Intel](https://ibb.co/pjHdVFQ) also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it\u2019s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years &amp; a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all. \n\nAMD hasn\u2019t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it\u2019s a psychological resistance rather.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it\u2019s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nOne last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their [shares](https://ibb.co/zZcxm95) held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.\n\nSo, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think [Lisa SU](https://ibb.co/X2nVGTF) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the [company](https://ibb.co/WtBf4yF) has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel\u2019s performance.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

To just pick a bunch of high risk, high reward long term opportunities, and invest in all of them. If any one or multiple of them pan out, then it'll easily make up for the losers.\n\nSo far I've decided to just completely ignored index funds. Instead I'm just DCAing into whatever I find has huge long term potential based off of what reddit, youtube, motley fool or ARK has hyped up. 80% of my portfolio is in BTC, ETH, TSLA, SQ, LMND, DKNG, uranium stocks, and ARK ETFs.  I'm planning on adding solar and marijuana ETFs.\n\nI've also decided not to sell a single stock no matter what happens, until I have enough to just put everything on VT/VTI and live off of that.\n\nHas anyone else pursued this strategy for the past 4-5 years? If so how did it pan out? When I look at old posts from 2-3 years ago it seems that AMD, MSFT and NVDA were the ones that were hyped up. But I can't really tell because I'm only looking at what was most upvoted and using search terms like \"what are your top picks for the long term\".",

I've even got some massive returns from a few ideas I got solely from watching (MSTR +132% AMZN +73%, TGT +81%, NVDA +63%).\n\nWhich takes us to this week where CNBC has been a constant whipping boy on r/wallstreetbets. \n\nMost of Reddit seems to completely reject CNBC's report that Melvin has [closed](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/hedge-fund-targeted-by-reddit-board-melvin-capital-closed-out-of-gamestop-short-position-tuesday.html) out their short positions.

Your a chump if you answered phones.\n\nTLDR up front, BlackBerry has pivoted away from making phones and instead is in the software sector. Some big names that they have include, **Nvidia**, **NIO**, **Xpeng**, **Ford** and 19 out of the 25 EV companies now use QNX.\n\n**Software**\n\nBlackBerry has gone away from the phones business and has reinvented itself to become the main player in Automobile OS systems. They have lock and key in this market since many OEMs don't want to start from the ground up making the software themselves. As of June,2020 they have the QNS software in over[175 million cars](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-175-million-vehicles-301081594.html). Nvidia uses BlackBerries QNX for the base of its [self-driving car](https://channeldailynews.com/news/nvidia-to-build-its-ai-self-driving-platform-on-blackberry-qnx/58048). Sony is also partners with Nvidia and BlackBerry for the car they are [making.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/) Not to mention the companies that use QNX are subscription based, so reoccurring revenue. This is speculation on this part but Hyundai is using QNX and has partnered with Apple, and QNX is apple car play compatible already.\n\n \n\n**Fundamentals**\n\nBlackBerry recently just sold all of there phone [patents](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-sells-90-patents-to-huawei-covering-key-smartphone/) to Huawai showing that they are no longer in the phone sector. Big Boys have been adding more BB to there pockets and the last 13F was on the 15th (1/15/21) (Fin---tel)\n\n[https://gyazo.com/d9894e59a75885c1506dd3a2ef576ebe](https://gyazo.com/d9894e59a75885c1506dd3a2ef576ebe) I had pictures to show it but the braindead bot removed it.\n\n \n\nOther big short inst---itutions have a hard on for keeping this low, BB was in the top 20 most shorted stocks but GME was number 1. Just this Friday(1/15) Shorts and Tutes sold alot.\n\nThe **50 dayMA crossed the 200dayMA** in December and has held since then. Also check out that 188million green.\n\n[https://gyazo.com/867fd62c67d9dfc59d832e94ca51ddbd](https://gyazo.com/867fd62c67d9dfc59d832e94ca51ddbd)  (Orange=200day)(Blue=50day)\n\n \n\nMorningstar and CFRA both put $BB with a fair value price of 6.40, so you can assume that is the absolute bottom. (copied from [u/ThegreatLoudini](https://www.reddit.com/u/ThegreatLoudini/))\n\nThey also have **more cash** **than Debt**.\n\nBlackberries Future is looking good.\n\n3/19 12c\n\nFuck you retarded bot.",

        "selftext": "Everyone knows that NVDA and NIO are partnering to develop EVs, but I haven't seen near the hype about NVDA that I have with NIO. Maybe people don't realize it, but along with the chips that NVDA will be providing, the AI provided by NVDA is crucial. Autonomous driving relies heavily on AI, and data is currently the most valuable asset in the world. \n\nLooking at some TA, NVDA has been consolidating in a flat base pattern (weekly chart) for several weeks now. The flat base pattern was formed on low volume, and there hasn't been much institutional distribution from the stock. It's basically been waiting for a catalyst to explode and this should be it.\n\nOf course, NVDA options are expensive as shit so I'm looking at shorter-term otm options with decent volume to buy at market open.

I'm Samik Chatterjee, the analyst at JPMorgan here. For the next company at the tech forum, we have the pleasure of hosting BlackBerry. BlackBerry has transformed from a smartphone manufacturer to a leading security-focused enterprise software and services provider. The BlackBerry\u2019s portfolio competes in a number of interesting markets, including cyber security, automotive software and critical event management.\n\nToday, we will be focusing more on BlackBerry's automotive software, which is QNX. It is my pleasure to introduce Steve Rai, BlackBerry's Chief Financial Officer; and John Wall, BlackBerry's Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions. And thank you both, Steve and John for attending and participating in this conference. Look forward to an interesting discussion.\n\nI will probably just start you off here, Steve, in a sense,* we- before we dive into Q&amp;A for the benefit of investors, reengaging with the BlackBerry story, who probably know BlackBerry from a smartphone days more, can we just start with a high-level overview of the business today?\n\nSteve Rai\n\nSure.* Thank you, and pleased to be here today. So, while we don't build phones anymore, we absolutely continue to leverage the strong software and security heritage of the company. Our trusted software platform, which we call Spark, can connect, secure and manage every endpoint in the IoT landscape.\n\nSo, it leverages next-gen threat protection, intelligent security, and provides a single pane of glass to manage the environment. Further, through AI and machine learning, it continues to get smarter and provides excellent return on investment. So, this area represents a $38 billion and growing addressable market.\n\nBeyond securing enterprises, our solutions also enable critical infrastructure such as securing utilities, automotive safety through QNX, which as John will speak to, and securing people through our AtHoc critical event management solution.\n\nWe've got deep credentials which have been hardened in the regulated space. At nearly all of the G20 governments and top 10 global banks as well as the top 9 automotive OEMs, we've got them as customers. Our solutions are equally applicable and provide significant value to enterprises of all sizes.\n\nSo, I believe all this and the strong financial position of the company, of course, sets us up very well to serve the markets that we\u2019re in*. And it plays right into the macro trends that we're seeing, including an ever-increasing mobile and work-from-anywhere workforce, rapid IoT proliferation, and an ever-increasing threat landscape, which, of course, the unprecedented cyberattacks of 2020 underscore, and the evolution of vehicles and smart city infrastructure that John Wall will speak to.\n\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\n\nQ - Samik Chatterjee\n\nSo, before I kind of move on to some of the other markets, let's kind of hit on QNX and the inbuilt software offering here. For those who are less familiar with QNX, John, maybe if you can kind of explain what it does, that would be helpful?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nAbsolutely, I'd love to. So, QNX has two, what I would call, foundational products. One is the real-time operating system called Neutrino, and the other is our hypervisor that provides virtualization of CPUs. Both are microkernel-based. These are deeply embedded products that are particularly suited to safety critical applications.\n\nWe've been able to reach the highest level of certifications for both those foundational products in the automotive field, medical and industrial. We've achieved ISO 26262 ASIL D and we've achieved 61508 ASIL C and -- ASIL 3, sorry, which is the highest level of safety. And that means that our products are designed for mission-critical. In automotive, in particular, that means our products are designed for things that control steering, braking, anything that controls the vehicle.\n\nSo, examples of this within automotive is obviously ADAS, which is active safety, digital cockpit, which is a new trend where we are seeing the consolidation of infotainment systems and other in-cabin functions such as digital cockpits, get consolidated to one hardware module and using our virtualization to separate safety and non-safety systems, the infotainment being non-safety. But also in other markets such as MRI scanners for medical, medical robotics, nuclear power plants, oil and gas. So, if you've ever seen a wind turbine on your travels across various parts of the world, more than likely QNX is running in those systems to control the pitch of the blade, which is very important for keeping the system stable. So, those are just a few examples.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nGot it. John, you did mention kind of the safety aspect becoming one of the key enablers here. Maybe if you can broadly hit on what are the overall trends in autos and kind of where and how are those impacting QNX's addressable market?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nAbsolutely. So, I mean, I think everybody is aware of the macro trends. We have connectivity. Cars are getting more connected. We have electrification and we have automation, so autonomous drive or levels towards autonomous drive. So, what we're seeing within a vehicle is software is starting to play a bigger and bigger role. There are some studies that say that by 2030, 50% of the vehicle's BOM will be electronics, and of that, 30% would be software.\n\nSo, what we're seeing as a trend is the car today is made up of a lot of what we call ECUs, and these are electronic control units. And these today are typically single function. So, you can think about it in terms of door locks is an ECU, my transmission controller is an ECU, my digital instrument cluster is an ECU, and so on and so on.\n\nSo, what we're starting to see within a car is a consolidation of these ECUs into what we call domain controllers. And domain controllers will handle multiple functions on one module. And these domain controllers are typically high-performance compute platforms. So, when you think of these, you think of Qualcomm, Samsung, NVIDIA, things that would run in your computer or things that would run in your smartphone. And this is a sweet spot for QNX, since the QNX products run on high-performance compute platforms, not on the lower end 8-bit and 16-bit single function ECUs.\n\nNow, as more of these systems migrate to these domain controllers, there's an element of safety that's required because these things are either controlling chassis, they're controlling functions within the vehicle. Outside of the infotainment, most of these modules have a safety function. So, this again is a sweet spot for QNX.\n\nWe saw this trend developing four or five years ago, maybe five* or six years ago. We saw that infotainment was moving more and more to Android, but we also saw that the car was moving towards this grouping of domain controllers. And we knew there would be an opportunity to get more in the vehicle, more software sockets within the vehicle. So, we really started focusing our efforts on safety and security knowing that as the car evolves, we have more opportunities within the vehicle to hit many more modules as opposed to just infotainment, for instance.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nGot it. You recently announced BlackBerry IVY, a co-development and co-marketing agreement with AWS. So, how is this different to what QNX is currently doing?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nActually, this is quite different from what QNX has been doing traditionally. So, we announced IVY, which is the intelligent vehicle everywhere. So, IVY is a cloud-connected and cross platform that is multi-OS, multi-cloud, in-car software that allows automakers to access a vehicle sensor data in compliance with safety and security requirements to process that data with updatable code to create new vehicle insights and then share those insights with developers through a consistent and simple in-car API mechanism.\n\nSo, essentially, what we've done here is we've looked at how do we make vehicles look common from an API perspective? How do we access vehicle data in a way that is consistent from car brand to car brand? This is a very tall order, because vehicles are still pretty bespoke as far as their electrical architectures. No two cars from different OEMs look exactly the same. They use different sensors. They have different architectural layouts.\n\nSo, the idea with IVY is to create a middleware, I would say, translator that goes into the vehicle. At the bottom end of IVY, we are talking directly to sensors within the vehicle. But then, we use either machine learning or other processing to normalize that data into what we call synthetic sensors.\n\nAnd as an example that I'd like to you look at is if you think of a smart city and you think of a smart city that wants to know the conditions of their roads during the winter, a synthetic sensor within a vehicle could be a combination of wheel, speed sensor, antilock brake sensor, temperature sensor and potential camera input. And with those four sensors, you could normalize the data into a synthetic sensor that would allow the smart city to know, do I have an icing condition? Do I have cars slipping in a certain part of my route?\n\nNow, imagine the power of this, if the way to access that data was consistent from carmaker to carmaker. So, the real power behind IVY is to make sure that we grow an ecosystem that allows scale and allows app developers to create common applications, smart cities to access common data across different car brands. And so, the idea here is to ensure that the carmakers have the best ability to monetize their data or to save money by being able to do things like analytics of how their cars are behaving on the road. The idea is to grow an ecosystem that will become a de facto standard in the industry.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nWhat is the level of commitment that it slightly* brings to this, particularly -- I mean, obviously, I'm guessing investors will be looking at what\u2019s the level of commitment of AWS to this?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nRight. So, it's a 50-50 joint development. And something I didn't stress enough in the last question, just to be clear, this is OS and cloud agnostic. No dependency on AWS cloud and no dependency on QNX. This is truly a generic piece of middleware to create this ecosystem. So, obviously, we're doing development on QNX. We expect QNX to be the high runner within the vehicle because of our dominant position in the car. I mean, this is part of the reason that AWS is very interested in working with us.\n\nWe have a very good pedigree. We're in over 175 million cars. We've been doing this. This is our bread and butter as working within the vehicle. We have exceptional record of delivery. We've never held up a start-up production, and we have very, very strong relationships with the top automakers.\n\nNow, obviously, AWS is a leading cloud provider. They're an unrivaled provider of ML tools. So, they have a lot of the data expertise to do analysis of the data to create these synthetic sensors. And first and foremost, they're a massive company that has the ability to drive an app ecosystem.\n\nFrom a commitment perspective, it's -- as I mentioned earlier, it's a 50-50 development. This type of a relationship with Amazon is very rare. They do this with customers. They don't typically do this with partners. I think, we have a very, very strong alignment on the direction of IVY with the exact same goals, and that's to drive this ecosystem and to provide an app ecosystem within the vehicle and off the vehicle that is common across OEMs and brands. And I think that is really the thread that binds us.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nIf I kind of think back almost like three, four years ago, I do kind of remember some start-up companies, private companies that were trying to harmonize the data across coming from different vehicles. So, are companies already doing this? Why would IVY be different on this front?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nYes. That's a great question, and there are lots of companies doing this. This is -- we haven't invented anything new here. Carmakers are very interested in monetizing their data. They know there's a lot of value in their data, especially as the car continues to evolve towards autonomous drive and active safety, lots of sensors within the vehicle, one of the most complex IoT endpoints. So, they know there's a lot of value in their data.\n\nI think, the challenge has been, each carmaker is creating a bespoke solution, and there's really no scale to it. And since there is no scale or very little scale, it creates I think a challenge to really get application developers out there ideating on what the next big thing could be. I think, you'd like to be able to see the ability to leverage the ecosystem from the phone. Lots of people have great ideas out there. And I think the more people that have the ability to access this ecosystem, the more great ideas the carmakers will get.\n\nI think, the other challenge with some of the bigger players in this area has been ownership of the data. So, from -- right from the beginning, BlackBerry and Amazon have made it very clear. We have no desire to own the data and we have no desire to control the data. That's solely in the hands of the OEM. And that's really not an area that we're looking to get involved. The real purpose of this collaboration is to create that de facto ecosystem that will really get the ecosystem out there, developing ideas and applications that are going to be cool for the car.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nSo, I have like almost 15 questions here, and since I have 15 minutes remaining, let me start tackling some of them. So, let me start with the ones that relate to IVY. A couple of similar ones. What do you think the TAM is that IVY will open up for carmakers? And on similar lines, there is a question which is -- give me one -- yes, when do you intend to provide tangible color around the commercial opportunity that IVY represents? So, I'll let you guys tackle those two together.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSteve, do you want to take that?\n\nSteve Rai\n\nYes, I'll start. So, the first vehicles to have IVY are expected to come out in 2023. So naturally, leading up to that time, we expect to be engaged with the OEMs and potentially with Tier 1, Tier 2 suppliers working on this and generating professional services revenues along the way. We're targeting a subscription or usage-based model, in other words, building a recurring revenue stream. And so, that's sort of the time frame I think to address that part of the theme.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nTwo follow-up questions on IVY and more related to automakers. So, again, I'll just combine them for everyone's benefit here. Is BlackBerry QNX or IVY going to be in the new vehicles that NVIDIA and NIO will be working on together? The second question on similar lines is IVY something Tesla will consider?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nYes. Those are great questions. Obviously, I think, everybody -- I think, most people know we have a very strong relationship with NVIDIA as we announced a few years ago that QNX is the foundational OS of their DRIVE OS offering. I don't know that we can make any comments at the moment about specific OEMs as we made the announcement on December 1st. What I can say is the reaction by OEMs to the announcement has been overwhelming. We've already had a workshop with one OEM prior to Christmas.\n\nSo, there is a lot of excitement about the ability to create this ecosystem. When people think about the ecosystem in the past, they've thought about, well, the carmakers are going to have to get together, they're going to have to create a kind of a unified architecture for the vehicles to be able to create this ecosystem. Try to think of it kind of in terms of iOS or Android -- not iOS or Android, but something like that, but that's appropriate to the automobile. This is kind of really taking -- this is really looking to take a shortcut and really create that app ecosystem before the car makers have had the ability to necessarily unify their architectures.\n\nTo the point of Tesla, Tesla could definitely be a customer of this.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nOkay. Is it possible to implement back into the captive market of 175 million QNX current users? So, I'm guessing they are -- it's asking about IVY. So, is it -- yes, so is it possible to implement IVY back into the captive market of QNX users?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nAbsolutely. I mean that\u2019s -- in a lot of cases, that's the intent. There are very few carmakers that we are not working with, especially today when we look at our move towards more of safety software within more modules within the vehicle, especially when it comes to ADAS, autonomous drive, chassis control, digital cockpit. We're very dominant in the digital cockpit market. So, I believe that, that's obviously going to be the case, but I also think it's going to open up new customers. And I mean, that's a very strong reason why we made this OS independent and cloud agnostic is we wanted to address our current customers, but we also wanted to address carmakers that are not our customers that are running different operating systems or have different architectures or have different cloud solutions. We wanted this to go to our existing customers and to open up new customers.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nGot it. A ton of new questions on QNX, but before I get to that, one question that came in is the patents for sale, which kind of coincides with a news release, I think I saw saying that BlackBerry\u2019s selling to 90 patents to Huawei. And I'll just give you an opportunity to answer that question as well as comment in terms of anything that's been announced recently.\n\nSteve Rai\n\nSo, if that question is referring to what has been in the press in terms of some of the broader rumors about the portfolio, I'm not going to comment on those rumors. Regarding Huawei, there was a very small number of patents that are no longer relevant to the business. So, small sale, not part of our recurring transaction. And certainly, it was permitted under the applicable rules. So that's it.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nSo, moving to QNX, let me take this one. Could you outline the content per vehicle opportunity for QNX on an EV and separately on AV? And if you don't want to give dollar per car, could you suggest the number of QNX RTOS, I apologize, I don't know the acronym and hypervisor installs for EV and AV versus internal combustion engine vehicles. So, essentially, I think, in a nutshell content for vehicle for QNX on EV and AV separately?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nYes. I don't know that I really look at them all that separately. One has a battery manager, one has an engine controller. I think -- so I'll try to answer it more generally speaking, and then I will make a comment to EVs. So, generally speaking, the ability for QNX to be used in more places within the vehicle is what drove our decision to focus on safety.\n\nTraditionally, if you look back at where QNX was playing in automotive 10 years ago, the opportunity was typically a telematics box, an OnStar or an infotainment unit. And at the time, we were very dominant in infotainment and in telematics. If you -- so you kind of add two potential sockets there that we were fighting for, and for the most reason, those were the most -- those were the two high-performance compute platforms with telematics box and the infotainment box. I think as we see this consolidation of ECU to domain controllers, the opportunity has gone up dramatically. You have domain controllers that are handling gateway. So, you have a gateway functionality within the vehicle, you can do that almost like a router, that's going to manage safety systems and non-safety systems within the vehicle, the different buses. You have chassis controllers, you have ADAS controllers, you autonomous drive controllers. You have the digital cockpit, which is probably the first consolidation that's been happening within the vehicle, where we're taking cabin functions such as digital instrument cluster and infotainment and merging that onto one high-performance compute platform, using our hypervisor.\n\nSo, I think, without actually throwing out numbers, as far as the dollar amount, from an opportunity within the vehicle, there is definitely going from 2 or 3 opportunities to 5 or 6 or 7 opportunities within the vehicle. To us with IVY is just one more, a different function.\n\nNow, having said that, from an EV perspective, I think we put a status during earnings before Christmas that I believe we're in 19 of 25 of the top EV producers and that we have a 61% market share of working with EV customers. And one of the reasons that EV is interesting is in a lot of cases, it's clean sheet. They're starting with new architectures, and they're able to move to these new domain controller type architectures more quickly.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nIs Automotive Grade Linux a strong competitive threat? Who is the most significant competitive threat in terms of the auto ecosystem? And how is QNX superior to these over time?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nRight. So, I would say that we have two groupings of competitors. We have the traditional under-the-hood safety-based operating systems. And those are Green Hills and Wind River. Green Hills is very well-known in aerospace and defense, and so is Wind River. I think, we've been quite successful against those two.\n\nAnd then, on the other side of the spectrum coming more from consumer side and coming more from high-performance compute platform, you have Linux in all forms, whether it's AGL or Ubuntu or something else. It doesn't really matter.\n\nNow, the advantage that QNX has over Linux is that those Linux distributions are not safety certified. Safety certification is a lot of work. It's very hard to achieve. It's especially hard to achieve when you look at a product like Linux that -- part of the beauty of Linux as it moves very fast, and it's contributed to by the community. But that's also -- it's Achilles\u2019 heel when it comes to safety because safety requires due diligence around safety cases, design, knowing the providence of where the software came from, a lot of testing, a lot of impact analysis.\n\nSo I mean, our view is we take all the competition seriously. And we're just trying to continue to push our product forward to be better performance and a higher level of safety against all our competitors. And we believe that will help keep us in the lead.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nIn the couple of minutes we have remaining, let's take a couple of questions on IVY here. First question, and I\u2019ll again kind of club them together. How will the IVY app store ecosystem be monetized? And then, a second question, can you talk about the dollar investment and the time investment, how are you splitting that as it relates to development of IVY?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nI'll answer the second piece first. As I mentioned earlier, it's a 50-50 investment by both, Amazon and BlackBerry. It's a significant investment. But, we're not providing any numbers. But, there is a significant investment in doing this.\n\nAs far as monetizing from the OEMs and the app store and how that's going to look, we're just starting to have those conversations with the OEMs. I don't know that we have a clear picture on this. Based on the discussions we've had with the OEMS, we know there's a lot of value there. And the idea of providing a more comprehensive and more standardized SDK and API across car brands is only going to make that more valuable. But, we haven't gotten into all the nuts and bolts of what this is going to look like, except that we know that the OEM is going to control the data, and it's going to control the access to the data.\n\n**Samik Chatterjee\n**\nOkay. Last one, let me squeeze this one in. Where do you see the biggest catalyst for your loyal shareholders?\n\n**Steve Rai\n**\nWell, I think, the trends that I spoke to in my opening comments are really what position -- all of the Company's technology, the way that it's come together and the drivers that we have play in very directly to these trends, and the trends being proliferation of IoT, security, all of the concepts that John described in the auto sector as well as the general embedded space. And those are things that the Company is just ideally suited for in terms of the expertise and the solutions that we have.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nGreat. That's all we have time for. Steve and John, thank you both for taking the time to attend the conference. And it was a pleasure hosting you and great discussion. Thank you.\n\nSteve Rai\n\nThank you, Samik.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n\ud83d\ude80\n\ud83d\ude80\n\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "I don't know much, but I know tech and AMD has A LOT going for it right now.\n\n[*Obligatory do your own research and draw your own conclusions statement.*]\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\n- Both Sony and Microsoft are using custom AMD APUs in their latest consoles. (APU = CPU + GPU combined into one.) In case you've been living under a rock for the past 8 weeks, both the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X have been selling like hotcakes, with fresh inventory being depleted within minutes. \n\n- AMD has been the underdog vs Intel in the consumer desktop CPU space for as long as I can remember. But for the first time in 15 years, [AMD is winning in terms of market share](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-overtakes-intel-in-desktop-cpu-market-share-for-the-first-time-in-15-years). Intel has been able to stay competitive with their latest generation of CPUs by offering significant discounts. Despite this, AMD's CPUs still remain in higher demand and sell out almost instantly (at MSRP). \n\n- AMD owns Radeon, which is their brand of Graphics Cards. These compete directly with Nvidia's RTX GPUs. Performance wise, they're up there with NVDA, but still lagging a bit in the ray tracing department which most will agree is the future. Key word being future, it's not a big deal *yet*. And thanks to the pandemic these too also sell out super quick. \n\n- AMD's next generation of mobile CPUs will be launching soon. Just like their desktop lineup, you can expect these to outperform their Intel counterparts as well. AMD's previous mobile generation of 4000 series chips crushed Intel - the biggest problem was availability. People wanted the AMD chips but for whatever reason, they were found mostly in the mid-range and lower end gaming laptops. I expect the availability issue to improve greatly this year. As we can see, certain manufacturer's like Asus are already featuring the AMD SKUs in their [top of the line gaming laptops](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ROG-Strix-Scar-17-ditches-Comet-Lake-H-for-an-unlocked-Ryzen-9-5900HX-with-liquid-metal-and-RTX-3080-Mobile.514702.0.html). \n\n**RISK FACTORS**\n\n- While speaking purely from a monetary standpoint, overall I think the pandemic has been a net positive for tech companies like AMD. However, AMD's own fearless leader Lisa Su recently said: [\"...the COVID environment has increased shipping and freight costs, which are hard to avoid. As we get into a more normal environment, this should improve. This also matters for our planned graphics updates through the first half of the year, as we have a lot of product coming to market.\"](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16409/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-interview-on-2021-demand-supply-tariffs-xilinx-and-epyc)\n\n- Unable to keep up with demand: [AMD and NVIDIA confirm that GPU stock levels will remain non-existent for the foreseeable future](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-and-NVIDIA-confirm-that-GPU-stock-levels-will-remain-non-existent-for-the-foreseeable-future.514957.0.html).\n[Microsoft has asked AMD for help in combating Xbox Series X stock shortages](https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-has-asked-amd-for-help-in-combating-xbox-series-x-stock-shortages)\n\n- Apple has already started producing their own in house ARM processors for both their laptops and desktops. This doesn't really affect AMD (yet) because [Apple has been using Intel chips in their laptops and desktops for the past 15 years.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/why-apple-is-breaking-a-15-year-partnership-with-intel-on-its-macs-.html#:~:text=Menu-,Apple%20is%20breaking%20a%2015%2Dyear%20partnership%20with,on%20its%20Macs%20%E2%80%94%20here's%20why&amp;text=Apple's%20new%20laptops%20and%20desktop,can%20improve%20laptop%20battery%20life.) And despite being a massive company, Apple only makes up about [13% of the PC market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/576473/united-states-quarterly-pc-shipment-shareapple/#:~:text=In%20the%20fourth%20quarter%20of,the%20fourth%20quarter%20of%202020.). AMD is still Apple's partner for discrete graphics, but that could change soon. This is definitely something you'll want to keep your eye on though because other titans like [Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/article/microsoft-processors-int/microsoft-working-on-in-house-chips-for-its-servers-pcs-idUSKBN28S2Y1), [Google](https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/04/google-is-making-its-own-chips.html), and Amazon are all either working on, or producing their own in house chips. In my opinion, this is not nearly as bad as it sounds. Let's break it down by company.\n\n - [Microsoft currently uses Intel-based processors for the majority of its Azure cloud services, and most of the company\u2019s Surface lineup run on Intel chips, too.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report#:~:text=Microsoft%20has%20worked%20with%20AMD,move%20away%20from%20just%20Intel.&amp;text=Microsoft%20co%2Dengineered%20an%20ARM,a%20couple%20of%20months%20ago.) Only some of Microsoft's laptops run on AMD hardware. \n\n - [Google is readying its own in-house processors for use in future Pixel devices, including both phones and eventually Chromebooks, too.](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/google-said-to-be-preparing-its-own-chips-for-use-in-pixel-phones-and-chromebooks/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADHPvna5MKFbSAnwNIPsW4kMhD7zhe-7IJtk0AzQP1Rrer78Olm_S_019orsNcQA9Ezk_sCz0z8My1nHGdTap_0-SYZtHKs1U9v9ni-AGkuJzp3cOHYUDSEu7b90qMQIDsc-PC8tFFceJElhUcPhJ3ctKtatuQcLkrIF1VotSBz1#:~:text=The%20Axios%20report%20says%20that,machine%20learning%20and%20Google%20Assistant.) Again, because Google currently relies more on Intel CPUs this is not a big blow to AMD's bottom line. A quick check of BestBuy's inventory shows [47](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?_dyncharset=UTF-8&amp;id=pcat17071&amp;iht=y&amp;keys=keys&amp;ks=960&amp;list=n&amp;qp=parent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Celeron%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i3%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i5%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i7%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20m3%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20m7%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Pentium&amp;sc=Global&amp;st=chromebook&amp;type=page&amp;usc=All%20Categories) Chromebooks with Intel SKUs and only [7 with AMD parts](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?_dyncharset=UTF-8&amp;id=pcat17071&amp;iht=y&amp;keys=keys&amp;ks=960&amp;list=n&amp;qp=parent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20A4%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20A6%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20Ryzen%203&amp;sc=Global&amp;st=chromebook&amp;type=page&amp;usc=All%20Categories).\n - The chips that Amazon is producing are for their [cloud computing business](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/amazon-apple-chips-intel-arm.html). These were also replaced by Intel.\n\nAMD has earnings coming up on the 26th which I think they're going to shatter. I probably would not recommend trying to play off of that though as ERs can be quite unpredictable, especially if the news is positive. Personally, I think AMD is going to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 after ER, but I'm not betting on that. Which is why my current position (30% of my portfolio) is LEAPS: (x2) Jan 2022 90c.\n\nMy conservative 6 month PT for AMD is 110. Also open to hearing any other potential risks I may have overlooked. To be on the safe side I'm only including 6 rockets.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "# And the breakouts and \ud83d\ude80 of next week:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.\n\n**How is \"Hype\" calculated?**\n\nWell, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit\n\n**How can I use this list?**\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending (like spotting those \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80).\n\nAs an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not, or to use some automated brokerages like [Quantbase](https://www.getquantbase.com) with algo-investor models based on these sentiment analyses. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits.

        "selftext": "U.S. safety regulators have asked Tesla to recall 158,000 vehicles over media control unit failures that cause the touchscreen displays to stop working, following a months-long investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe Office of Defects Investigation unit of the agency determined that the failure of the media control unit is a safety issue since functions like the backup camera and defogging and defrosting setting controls stop working as well as audible chimes, which are used when the turn signal indicator is activated and to alert drivers while the vehicle's Autopilot advanced driver assistance system is engaged. Reports of the MCUs suddenly failing have been a topic for years in Tesla forums.\n\nThe failure is caused when the memory storage in a flash drive used in the used in these vehicles reaches capacity, investigators concluded. The only solution is to replace the physical piece of hardware. Vehicles affected include Model S sedans built between 2012 and 2018 as well as Model X SUVs in 2016 through 2018.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company did provide information to NHTSA, which is contained in the report. Tesla confirmed to NHTSA that all units will inevitably fail given the memory device\u2019s finite storage capacity. Tesla provided its own statistical model showing the number of projected weekly MCU repairs from 2020 to 2028. The automaker estimated that replacement rates for MCU failures will peak in early 2022 and gradually decline until (near) full part turnover has been accomplished in 2028, according to the report.\n\nThese vehicles are equipped with an NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor with an integrated 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory device. Part of this 8GB storage capacity is used each time the vehicle is started. The eMMC NAND cell hardware fails when the storage capacity is reached, resulting in failure of the MCU, the agency said.\n\nThe eMMC NAND flash device's lifespan based upon the number of program/erase cycles, after which the MCU fails due to memory wear-out. Investigators determined that the expected usage life rating for the 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory device is about 3,000 Program-Erase cycles, after which the eMMC NAND flash memory device would become fully consumed and no longer be operational. At a daily cycle usage rate of 1.4 per block, accumulation of 3,000 P/E cycles would take only 5 to 6 years, the agency said.\n\nThe agency has officially requested that Tesla initiate a recall to notify all owners, purchasers, and dealers of the subject vehicles of this safety defect and provide a remedy.\n\nhttps://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-asks-tesla-recall-158-000308276.html",

The transition from fossil fuels and the acceleration of decarbonation through government enacted incentives gives Star Peak a terrific tailwind to begin building upon in 2021.\n\nThe biggest upside for Star Peak over other recent acquisition mergers is actually the minimal downside this stock offers. With ~$525 million of cash available and no debt on Stem's balance sheet, Star Peak has very little negatives IMO, Not to mention the stock has taken a bit of a dump recently so now may not be a terrible time to get in - at the end of the day though there will be volatility, and this is definitely not something to enter if you are worried about the price dropping in the near term. If star peak can play their cards right, I will leave the upside potential here is massive\n\nGood luck hombres! \n\nPositions: long shares: STPK, Nvidia, Google, BlackBerry, many more stonks. \n\nVIX 27P, exp 10Feb",

Should they be bullish, like on WallStreetBets, or buy at market value and wait for the gradual increase.\n\nNio is a Fully electric car manufacturer, located in the World\u2019s Biggest E-Car industry, China. The Chinese Government has poured millions to billions from both investors and China. People are excited about this new opportunity. A green car, that has long range, cheap and powerful. Nio\u2019s ES8 SUV, is 23,000 dollars cheaper than the Tesla alternative. Although the Tesla alternative has a bigger battery and higher top speeds, they both have relatively the same range, ES8 is 580km and Model X is 597km. When deciding which one is better, it\u2019s easy to think that Tesla is better with the better distance, but for value, Nio is far better. Nio has also released other 7 seater cars, such as the Nio 2019 ES8 that has an advertised range of 610km, that have better ranges than the Model X but is a cheaper car (by around \\~$3,000). Nio has also developed a battery system that doesn\u2019t require you to buy a brand new car every single time a new battery is released like other major EV manufacturers. Their battery system allows you to park into their battery houses and a machine will swap out the almost dead battery within your car, for a newer and fully charged battery. They also have a battery charging option where you can fast charge your Nio car at home or at a station but the Battery Swapping system is a lot quicker and only uses around 5-10 minutes to fully replace the battery. Nio also offers an option to swap out your current battery and rent or buy a bigger Nio sized battery. Their battery is undoubtedly great quality as the provider of the battery, CATL, also provides the battery to Tesla\u2019s, Audi\u2019s and many more car manufacturers. The only downside is that they most likely aren\u2019t on the priority list of battery purchasers because companies like Tesla help develop new batteries but Nio only buys them. This might be a slight downside to buying Nio because you never know if they will have batteries but since they\u2019re both under Chinese governments, they can find a way. During the Nio battery day, they claimed that they will adopt a new CATL solid state battery, which improves their battery life for their ev cars, especially their newest car model, the Nio ET7, a sedan unveiled yesterday during the Nio Day event. Their new car will have a distance of 1000 kilometres with the new CATL battery. Chances are, this will be a far better car than Tesla\u2019s Sedan Models at a cheaper price. This will attract many buyers within the biggest EV market, which will drive the price of the stock up, increasing your gains probability. Another aspect of the Nio environment which definitively increase their overall production, is their customers. Nio customers are offered many Nio houses which is like a Private Club, only for Nio car owners. Many Chinese owners send their kids to these private clubs with them to talk with others, and the quality of the cafes and the services in what some people would call a Nio cult, is very high. These houses look like modern day mansions to meet others and during the Nio day event, a Nio community in Shenzhen flew everyone who was part of it, to the Nio day event on a private plane. Now that is what you call loyalty. This loyalty, would most likely translate to more sales and more customers purchasing their cars because existing customers would recommend this car to join such a fantastic community. This would help them increase their sales targets, if not surpass them. The Nio community would act like a domino effect to increase sales and if this effect keeps occurring, their stocks can definitely hit higher prices within a few months. Nio has also produced an app that allows Nio owners to showcase their Pros and Cons of the Nio cars, and executives and designers can take their ideas and implement them into new cars, which makes the Nio ecosystem even friendlier and better. Finally, Nio during their presentation, unveiled a new partnership for their A.I. driving system. The partnership is with NVDA, Nvidia Corporation. This would make their cars, more secure, faster and smoother transitions within their A.I screens and better sensors because Nvidia is a fairly powerful chip manufacturer and can allow Nio to analyze more information, within a shorter time (I.e. better turns, snappier system). This would make everything in the car, better than it is now and allow for better self-driving systems which would better their rating and their product visualization. \n\nIn conclusion, in a growing EV market in China and everywhere else, Nio is bound to increase their stock price, especially with the attitude towards, customers and their innovating technology. They have cheaper prices than competitors, and many investors in China and America are willing to pour billions of dollars into the company to develop better technologies, industries and attention towards the EV market. Evs are the future, and Nio is most likely, a future proof company as long as the CCP supports it. Nio has a growing trend in stock price so hurry before it\u2019s too late to purchase shares of Nio. Nio undoubtedly will hit over 65 dollars within the next two weeks because the Nio day news will be welcoming to all investors.\n\nthis is my opinion on nio so listen or not, there it is. good luck with ur gains u geniuses .",

        "selftext": "This is my first DD so I hope it goes well.\n\nCC Neuberger Principal Holdings I (PCPL) has an agreement to merge with E2OPEN.\n\n**What is E2OPEN?**: E2OPEN is a cloud-based, artificial intelligence, on-demand SaaS platform company. E2OPEN is the largest cloud-based provider of networked supply chain applications. More than 70,000 partner companies and 200,000 users, many of the biggest companies in the world use the E2OPEN network today.\n\n**Who are E2OPEN's customers?**: Some of their customers include Google, Facebook, AMD, Nvidia, Intel, HP, IBM etc. [Complete list taken from the investor presentation.](https://i.imgur.com/FfcVX7o.png)\n\n**Who is leading the SPAC?**: The founder &amp; CEO of PLPC is Chinh Chu. A billionaire with 30+ years of investment experience, including 25 years at [Blackstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blackstone_Group). He has created 3 SPACs since 2016. The first SPAC, CF Corp, raised $1.2 billion and successfully merged with Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Life. The second SPAC, Collier Creek Holdings, raised $475 million and successfully merged with a company in the consumer sector. And now we have his most recent, third SPAC, PCPL. It has raised $414 million and will merge with E2OPEN. This man was also in charge of taking Dun &amp; Bradstreet private in a large $7.2 billion deal. Before joining Blackstone in 1990, this man also worked in the Mergers &amp; Acquisitions Deparment at Salomon Brothers. His experience is undeniable. \n\n**Backstory**: E2OPEN used to be a public company. Their stock price went as high as $28. They were bought by a private company and were taken off the market in 2015. Ever since they were taken private, E2OPEN was able to grow from $80M in revenue 5 years ago to $335M in 2020. They have acquired a handful of companies and continue to do so. E2OPEN's revenue is about four times what it was in 2015. The percent of revenue that is subscription-based, which is always a key metric for a SaaS company, was 80% in fiscal 2020 and is expected to grow in 2021. It also stands to benefit as companies automate their supply chains further in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**The potential negatives:** Their estimated revenue for next year is about +10%. There was an additional funding from instutions through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) of $175M which will be used to pay down existing debt. E2OPEN traded publicly before they were acquired by another company. Their stock price went as high as $28 but also went as low as $8. They were then acquired by Insight Venture Partners and have grown since. \n\n**The Merger**: SPAC shareholders will own 20% of the shares. The merger has a valuation of $2.57B. Upon closing of the transaction with E2OPEN, the ticker will change from 'PCPL' to 'ETWO'.\n\n**TL:DR:** A cloud-based SaaS platform company with customers from some of the biggest corporations in the world today, has a definitive agreement to merge with 'PCPL'. PCPL is run by a billionaire with an unbelievable resume that has already had two previous successful SPAC mergers and this is his third SPAC. The company's revenue has grown massively and their revenue today is about four times higher than it was in 2015. The percent of their revenue that is subscription-based is 80% and is expected to grow in the future. \n\n**Disclaimer:** I own 420 shares of PCPL. Invest at your own risk. As of this writing the price of PCPL is **$10,84.**",

        "selftext": "# While there are many more companies that are discussed much more than TSMC (NYSE:TSM) on here, such as Apple, AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, etc, TSMC is a hidden gem that is getting ready to take off over the next few years. Here's why:\n\nTSMC was founded in 1987 with the intent of bringing Taiwan into the global tech market. Morris Chang, who previously worked at Texas Instruments for over 30 years, is the founder and former CEO of TSMC and widely regarded as the \"godfather of computer chips\". TSMC is currently the world's largest semiconductor producer, with over half of semiconductor revenue from TSMC. Other notable competitors include GlobalFoundries (AMD used them for Zen and Zen+, switching to TSMC for Zen 2 and Zen 3), Intel, and Samsung. TSMC is a pioneer in the pure-play foundry business, meaning that they do not produce any chips for their own products. Instead, they manufacture and sell chips to companies, meaning that those who choose to source chips from TSMC do not have to build expensive silicon fabrication plants to manufacture their own chips. TSMC currently operates 10 different silicon fabs, manufacturing over 10,000 different products using over 250 distinct technologies to cater to 499 different customers in 2019.\n\nNot only is TSMC the largest semiconductor foundry, it is also a pioneer in advancing semiconductor production and performance. Currently, TSMC has 7 customers for its new 5nm chips, including Apple, for A14/X chips and ARM-based chips for Mac products, Qualcomm and MediaTek for 5G smartphone chips, AMD, for next-generation Zen 4 CPUs, Bitmain, Intel, and NVIDIA. TSMC is also currently engineering its N4 chips, built on a 4nm process node, its 3nm chips, and its 2nm chips, which will use new GAAFET (Gate All Around Field Effect Transistor) technology instead of the traditional FinFET technology.\n\n**So who are some of TSMC's biggest and most notable customers?**\n\n# Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nApple is the world's largest company in terms of market capitalization (2.17 Trillion), and has become widely popular due to its heavy and cohesive integration between its products and widespread use by many prominent figures. Currently, it offers many products such as laptops, phones, smart watches, smart TV products, fitness products, and more. It also offers many services and software products, which all integrate with each other via iCloud, continuity software such as Handoff, and more. Recently, Apple has confirmed that they are cutting support for Intel CPUs on their Mac products in a few years, meaning they will shift to using entirely Apple Silicon chips for all of their Mac products. This is in addition to Apple using their own chips for all other products that they currently produce - iPhones, iPads, smart watches, etc.\n\nApple is one of TSMC's largest customers, and that is only expected to grow as they ramp up production for their M1 and next generation ARM chips for Macs. Apple's M1 chips are a strong competitor to AMD and Intel CPUs, especially if they can scale well up to 32 and 64 cores. They are extremely efficient and consume drastically less power than x86-based CPUs (Intel and AMD CPUs), meaning that thermal requirements are much lower. Macs have typically been targeted by PC enthusiasts as an overpriced, underperforming lineup, but we may see that change as Apple's new chips perform extremely well.\n\nApple reported a yearly revenue of 274.5 billion US Dollars in 2020, roughly a 5% increase from 2019. Since Apple relies on TSMC for their chips, and Apple's Mac lineup is likely to become more popular, I would expect that TSMC's revenue from Apple will increase more than we've seen in previous years.\n\n# Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nAMD has certainly made a huge return since Lisa Su became CEO in 2014 and the production of Ryzen, which was widely popular due to its high core counts and high price to performance compared to Intel. Now, Ryzen has developed into a strong all-around player, sporting high core counts and great single thread performance. Currently, AMD Ryzen 5000 desktop CPUs outperform Intel's current generation Comet Lake CPUs in games, which is the first time that AMD has surpassed Intel in gaming performance.\n\nAMD has slowly been regaining market share, both in the PC enthusiast side and the server side. In the past two years, AMD has doubled their server market share from 4.5% to 8%. This may not seem like much, but considering that server upgrades are not frequent and those who buy Intel server CPUs are more likely to stick with Intel, that is a massive increase. On the PC enthusiast side, AMD CPUs have accounted for 84% of CPUs sold on mindfactory.de, a German PC Retailer. This is a massive increase considering that in 2016, before the release of Ryzen, Intel accounted for roughly 75% of CPU sales on mindfactory.de.\n\nAMD launched their Zen 3 chips in 2020, which was followed by huge demand and a shortage of these CPUs. This was in part due to demand at TSMC not being able to keep up with AMD's orders. Zen 3 CPUs perform extremely well, and next-generation Zen 4 CPUs, which will be on TSMC's 5nm process, point to a shortage of fab space at TSMC.\n\n# Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nQualcomm is a semiconductor company that creates wireless technology chips, CPUs, software, and services related to wireless technology. Their most prominent products include their Snapdragon CPUs, used in phones from some of the largest smartphone companies such as Samsung, LG, OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. They also produce application specific processors for things like cameras, IoT devices, kiosks, robots, and a lot more. Additionally, Qualcomm offers desktop CPUs, such as their Snapdragon 8cx. Qualcomm also produces various connectivity chips for things such as WiFi (onboard chips in laptops, desktop Wifi cards, routers, modems, etc), Bluetooth, and internet connectivity chips on smartphones.\n\nCurrently, Qualcomm relies on TSMC for the production of its Snapdragon chips. Although Samsung beat out TSMC for the production of Qualcomm's upcoming 5G chips, mobile chips accounted for 44.8% of Qualcomm's total revenue in 2020, while RF Front End chips (smartphone internet connectivity chips) accounted for just 9.8% of Qualcomm's total revenue.\n\n# NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA has been a long time customer of TSMC, dating all the way back to 1998 when NVIDIA switched over to TSMC's 350nm process for the Riva TNT. Since then, TSMC has manufactured nearly every NVIDIA chip up until RTX 3000 series, also known as Ampere. NVIDIA decided to switch to Samsung's 8N 8nm process node, likely due to financial reasons or fab capacity reasons.\n\nHowever, NVIDIA is allegedly moving back to TSMC to manufacture more Ampere GPUs using their 7nm process. There could be a few reasons for this - TSMC might have offered NVIDIA a deal, or capacity for 7nm fabs may have opened up due to large customers such as Apple and AMD shifting more focus towards TSMC's 5nm process.\n\nNVIDIA's RTX 3000 series GPUs, also known as Ampere, are a massive improvement in the GPU space compared to previous generations and just for performance in general. The RTX 3070 performs similarly to an RTX 2080ti, where the former has an MSRP of 499 USD and the latter has an MSRP of 999 USD. In addition to much greater price/performance, Ampere GPUs also heavily increase ray tracing performance so games that can take advantage of ray tracing hardware are actually playable. They are extremely popular, and currently Ampere GPUs are selling anywhere from 200 to upwards of 1500 dollars of their MSRP. NVIDIA is also huge in the AI/Computing space, teaming up with NIO for AI-based self-driving computation, Photoshop, for neural filters, and also  powers some of the fastest supercomputers in the world. In regards to AMD, NVIDIA blows the new RX 6000 series GPUs out of the water for things like streaming performance and workstation performance.\n\n# Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nWhile Intel has traditionally manufactured most of their products (Internet connectivity products, processors, chipsets, etc), Intel is reportedly shifting a fair amount of their chips to TSMC. Recently, Intel announced they would use TSMC for 7nm Xe graphics chips on their CPUs. In October of 2020, Intel CEO Bob Swan said Intel would decide by January whether it was going to expand its 7nm production, outsource it to a foundry, or both. Intel has severely underperformed in the CPU space compared to AMD, but if they decide to shift some production to TSMC, this could mean that Intel will make a strong return into the CPU space and strong entry into the GPU space.\n\n# Cool, but what does this mean?\n\nAgain, TSMC is the largest foundry, outclassing the likes of Samsung, GlobalFoundries, and other similar companies. There is an insane amount of demand for TSMC's chips, and they are extremely competitive compared to other manufacturers. TSMC has customers such as Apple, AMD, and Qualcomm, which all have great products and are only expected to grow with the release of new technology such as CPUs or 5G networking. Many of its customers are expected to have massive growth over the coming years, meaning that TSMC will reap some of those profits.\n\n# Ok, but why should I buy now?\n\nI mean, TSMC is already up over 100% over the past year, isn't it too late to buy in?\n\nWhen you consider its most important clients, all of them are going to use TSMC for future products that are important to their respective segments. Apple has just begun their venture into producing their own CPUs for Mac products, the release of DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 is right around the corner with AMD's Zen 4 processors, set to release late 2021 or 2022, Qualcomm producing next generation Snapdragon CPUs (and we may see 5G production shifted to TSMC), Intel actually producing competitive CPUs once again (which might be with TSMC), and NVIDIA continuing to dominate in the computing space and the GPU space. Considering that all of these things are happening in the next few years, TSMC is getting ready to take off.\n\nPositions: Currently holding 4/21 calls, will definitely roll calls and load up on more once we get closer to expiry",

        "selftext": "In early Q1 P-C-P-L is merging with E2open. E2open has disruptive AI / Cloud technology for the supply-chain industry. They are widely used by big name customers including Google, Microsoft, Boeing, Walmart, Coca Cola, UPS, AMD, NVIDIA, Abbott, and dozens of others.\n\nWhat differentiates them from other (more boring) supply chain management companies is the way they use AI to predict changes in supply and demand. Basically, E2open allows companies to see 10 steps ahead into the future to forecast how much inventory they will need based on hundreds of variables (geopolitics, resource availability, etc). This saves companies hundreds of millions in waste. CEO Michael Farlekas  compares it to working at a lemonade stand and being able to know ahead of time exactly how many lemons you will need. Obviously this will save you from wasting money on lemons that would spoil. E2open is the only company that integrates this type of AI technology with a vast data Cloud network.\n\nE2open uses a subscription model to make consistent sustainable revenue from their 1000+ customers. There are multiple services they offfer, but over 50% of their customers only use 1 service. What's nice is that existing customers go on to utilize more and more of their services as they realize the value it adds to their companies. Google for example paid E2open twice as much over the course of 2 years. E2open makes additional revenue from new customers, and also by strategic value-adding acquisitions. The SPAC deal is allowing E2open to clean up their balance sheet so they can add value to their software portfolio (and charge higher premiums to existing customers) and continue making acquisitions.\n\nE2open has been growing at a rapid clip since they were taken private in 2015. In 2015 they made $80M in revenue and in 2020 they made $335M. That's 420% growth in 5 years, or roughly +84% growth per year.\n\nIn the last 5 years they increased their revenue +420% by value-adding acquisitions they've made over the last decade --- Icon (2013), Serus Corp (2014), Terra Technology (2016), Orchestro (2016), Steelwedge (2017), Zyme (2017), Entomo and Birch Worldwide (2018), Inttra (2018), and Amber Road (2018) --- and integrating these different services to create a beautiful comprehensive end-to-end platform.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, their projections for 2021 are much lower at only +10% estimated revenue growth, which is the main reason most would argue P-C-P-L is trading so close to the NAV. However, 10% growth is actually really solid when you look at their margins and consider that 80% of their revenue is recurring with excellent customer retention. Institutional investors especially will appreciate E2open as the reliable revenue generating machine that it has  become. \n\nI'm also still optimistic about valuing E2open as a growth stock and feel the 10% is a low-ball estimate based on comparisons to the median growth of other supply chain management companies. I'm suspecting E2open will consistently  outperform expectations on a quarterly as the SPAC capital equips them to capitalize on their services, continue making acquisitions, and ultimately tap into millions in white space opportunity.\n\nEven if E2open maintained a 10% growth rate  and if this were factored into its valuation, $11/share is still too damn low. E2open compares itself to Descartes, Kinaxis, Manhattan, and Spscommerce. With a median of 10.7x revenue, E2 was only at 7x, and with a median of 34.7x, E2 was only at 21.3x, meaning E2open has a much higher upside than its peers.\n\nInstitutions will bring the stock price up to par with it's peers and I believe the low ball projected growth is a conservative number that they will completely destroy when you consider their growth of +400% over the last 5 years. While 10% is perfectly fine for a company like E2open, I'm expecting the trend of the last 5 years to continue in 2021 and we'll be seeing some exciting numbers. \n\nMy PT pre-merge is 15 and 25 EOY assuming their projected 10% revenue growth. If E2open surpasses 2021 expected revenue as I'm suspecting and they have major quarterly beats, I'm holding until 50.\n\nDisclaimer: This is my largest position. I'm in 2500 shares at 10.87.",

        "selftext": "**In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of AMD, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone! Let\u2019s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles &amp; PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.\n\nThe company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.\n\nSo, guys, let\u2019s go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.\n\nThe [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing &amp; Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn\u2019t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can\u2019t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.\n\nBoth of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing &amp; graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn\u2019t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation &amp; amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation. \n\nThey have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest &amp; tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.\n\nThe company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 &amp; Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.\n\nTheir product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel\u2019s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world\u2019s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.\n\nThey have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also [working](https://ibb.co/D9dDDYs) with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings &amp; Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.\n\nAMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future\n\nThe one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/N2YQFS9), which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/QH8RTCN) has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would [create](https://ibb.co/qJM6Gn4) synergies. [They](https://ibb.co/PcNhH58) are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it\u2019s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.\n\nAMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they [expect](https://ibb.co/RpcwXYr) an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.\n\nI used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA. \n\nFor the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.\n\nSo, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach. \n\nIf we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.\n\nFor my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.\n\nI think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high [demand](https://ibb.co/vQFwyRd) the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage &amp; digital currency mining.\n\nFor their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.\n\nThis means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest &amp; other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax. \n\nI [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.\n\nSo, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.\n\nI like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.   \n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets\u2026 I think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, [THIS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40. \n\nSo [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nI think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more &amp; more chips that also keep advancing in technology. \n\nThe company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/NCtxnFq), with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once [Intel](https://ibb.co/pjHdVFQ) also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it\u2019s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years &amp; a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all. \n\nAMD hasn\u2019t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it\u2019s a psychological resistance rather.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it\u2019s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.\n\nOne last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their [shares](https://ibb.co/zZcxm95) held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.\n\nSo, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think [Lisa SU](https://ibb.co/X2nVGTF) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the [company](https://ibb.co/WtBf4yF) has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel\u2019s performance.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "So out of 3 hours of dance music there is maybe about a quarter of an hour of content worth talking about\n\nNIO sees itself as a direct competitor to Tesla, and even compared its products and prices to those of Tesla (until today the company said that there is room for all players in the EV field and did not treat Tesla as a competitor)\n\nNext generation of battery replacement\n\nThe company currently has about 100 new replacement stations, which are supposed to park the vehicle, replace it with a new one and return it to the owner, all autonomous without human contact. As a result the exchange will be larger (up to 312 exchanges per day) and the company expects 500 such stations by the end of the year\n\nNew battery\n\nOne of the most important innovations in the field of EV. New claims to have a new battery with 150 KW / H. The Catch - only at the end of 2022 (which is still faster than  QuantumScape  QS plans)\n\nNew vehicle\n\nNIO has introduced the ET7 which will be the company's next saden. The vehicle looks good and elegant. The price is in the $ 58K range without the battery (looking at Tesla right in the eye). The vehicle will be released in early 2022.\n\nLoyalty Program\n\nNIO is trying to keep its customers in a loyalty program and has given discounts (even significant ones) to existing car owners for future bookings.\n\nAutonomy\n\nAdded more high-quality cameras (11 in total) (8MP with 6 times more resolution than Tesla's). 120 degrees for the lIdar sensors ,. And all this information will be won by an ADAM processor from none other than NVIDIA, which New claims is better than Tesla's (7 times faster data processing!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBottom line TL/DR\n\nIn my opinion this event slightly disappointed the investors. Speaking of the event almost everywhere we talk about NIO in the last year and what we got was not a significant breakthrough but the launch of a car and some landmarks in the future with lots of dancing and music.\n\nThe really interesting stuff is still at least one year from today (and the battery is almost two years old).\n\nIn my opinion, the biggest winner of the event is actually NVIDIA (NVDA), which following the hype, was introduced as one of its better processors and was compared to a pioneer company in the field with 7 times the data processing capacity.\n\nIn my opinion the loser could be QuantumScape (QS) in light of NIO's schedule which indicates a battery in Solid State technology at the end of 2022, about a year before QS.",

        "selftext": " In the past 2 months, discourse in r/SPACs has progressively degraded. Nowhere is that more true than for CCIV and ACEV. In an attempt to contribute to meaningful conversation on the topic and valuation of SPACs, I\u2019ve decided to try my hand at a DD. While I do not know if Michael Klein will give you Lucid or DirectTV, I do know a thing or two about the tech industry, particularly involving machine learning and consumer-focused services at scale. Despite that, I am not a hardware engineer, and instead of depend on these smart people in order to write efficient code that performs and scales.\n\nThis post began with an attempt to explain semi-conductors, ASICs, FPGAs, and more, but I figured that most people aren\u2019t interested in the precise technology that underpins Achronix. Instead, all the background information can be summarized into the following points:\n\n* Achronix makes FPGAs\n* Moore\u2019s Law is the observation that the number of transistors in a chip roughly doubles every two years, thereby increasing the processing power of chips\n* Moore\u2019s Law has been progressively dying, as we reach the practical limit on the number of transistors that can fit in any given chip. Increases in processing power are expected to slow to just 3% per year for the next twenty years\n* The rate of data collected and processed is expected to triple in the next five years. Global connectivity is also ever-increasing\n* FPGAs are an attractive option for hardware acceleration to help remedy the processing power problem that arises from the end of Moore\u2019s Law\n* Microsoft has applied an FPGA-based approach to Azure, Bing, and Microsoft 365 for big performance gains\n* AWS, Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu also all offer products supported by FPGAs in their cloud computing services\n* Custom FPGAs provide the opportunity to bridge some of the performance gaps with ASICs \n\nYou can find out more in the following two articles, which indicate compelling reasons to use FPGAs in hardware acceleration, but the discussion is more technical in nature ([here](https://www.networkcomputing.com/data-centers/using-fpgas-survive-death-moore%E2%80%99s-law-part-1) and  [here](https://www.networkcomputing.com/data-centers/using-fpga-survive-death-moore%E2%80%99s-law-part-2)).\n\nWhere does this put Achronix? Well, Achronix achieved profitability for the first time in 2016, the first year it began licensing its IP, which was a first in the industry. This offered an attractive option to consumers, as it allowed them to pay for exactly the specifications that they needed, instead of paying large amounts for Specs they ultimately did not need. These licenses, branded as Speedcore, allowed custom FPGAs to be placed on in System on a Chip (SoC) designs. Aside from being more cost-efficient, this customization also leads to increases in speed and power efficiency. If you\u2019re one of the few people around here that cares about fundamentals, the BusinessWire article states that Achronix has \u201can *estimated 2020 revenues of approximately $105 million, 79% gross margins and 35% operating margins with migration to next-generation products driving an estimated revenue CAGR of 20% to 25% from 2020 to 2025\u201d*\n\nNext, we enter the realm of Machine Learning. In a number of benchmark tests, FPGAs outperform GPUs in machine learning training and inference. As we move towards online systems that do machine learning and image analysis at real time, small differences in latency will represent big increases in performance. \n\n* Bench mark FPGA vs GPU: [source](https://inaccel.medium.com/faster-inference-real-benchmarks-on-gpus-and-fpgas-fa3df04d51d7)\n* Cool, unrelated example of a robot with a 100% win-rate in rock, paper, scissors as an example of hyper-low latency tasks: [source](https://www.wrpsa.com/university-of-tokyo-create-rock-paper-scissors-playing-robot/)\n* Market-size for FPGAs in artificial intelligence will grow by 3x in the next four years to $5.2 billion: [source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/achronix-introduces-ground-breaking-fpga-family-delivering-new-levels-of-performance-with-adaptability-for-high-bandwidth-data-acceleration-applications-300853464.html))\n\n This is one manner in which custom chips will represent a huge advantage. The benchmark indicates higher performance, and it was conducted on a non-customized chip. Further, even the standardized Speedster series is designed to support AI/ML applications, and is likely to be particularly performant in those applications for that reason ([source](https://www.eejournal.com/article/punching-above-their-weight-achronix-beats-the-odds/)). This is excellent for their positioning to take on outsized market share of the growth of the FPGA applications in AI.\n\nHaving already discussed machine learning, here are some of the other catalysts for significant growth in the FPGA industry\n\n* Growth of Edge Computing\n   * Edge computing is a form of distributed compution\u00a0that's done at or near the source of the data, instead of using remote data centers\n   * The edge computing market is anticipated to be worth $43.4 billion by 2027, indicating a CAGR of 37% from its base value of roughly $4 billion in 2020.\n   * FPGAs have strong applications for Edge Computing: ([source](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8485850)), ([source](https://ren-fengbo.lab.asu.edu/content/are-fpgas-suitable-edge-computing-0))\n   * Edge computing has applications related to 5G, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things\n* The creation of a library to support machine learning on FGPAs by traditional developers\n   * This is a black swan event, and it would do for FPGAs what CUDA did for GPUs. It would open up formerly niche technology that chip-makers focused on to a consumer technology that machine learning enthusiasts could leverage. \n   * This would change the way we view FPGAs and serve as a Black Swan event. This would allow one of the FPGA companies to rise to the standing of Nvidia. While there is no guarantee that it would be ACEV, this rising tide would certainly lift all ships. As with all Black Swan events, this will look obvious in hindsight.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s great that ACEV is profitable, and it\u2019s great that it has Intel as a customer, but with the growth of the FPGA in the computing industry, ACEV resembles QS and BFLY more in potential upside than it does THBR (which although is in the same industry will have growth correlated with a totally different set of catalysts). \n\nFun facts: \n\n* The coworker that told me that Moore\u2019s Law was dead was one of the primary contributors to the first GPU at Nvidia\n* I gave up on writing this early to play with my dog \n\nTldr: FPGAs have the potential to support \u201cthe next big thing\u201d in half a dozen domains. From 5G and ML to Internet of Things and Edge Computing, the application of this technology for performance gains across networks is massive. These chips are optimized for AI/ML, but they also license custom chips to companies, which has been highly lucrative, as well as more performant from the companies in question. More and more companies will be interested in FPGAs, and when they are, they will have an incentive not to support a competitor in Intel and instead get high performance chips from Achronix. ACEV is the rare company that has survived the Xilinx/Intel duopoly, and this is not a coincidence. The growth of FPGAs will allow them to thrive, caused by their size-agility advantage, novel approach to licensing their technology, and top notch IP.\n\nTldr if you\u2019re from WSB: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "I understand a lot of people are bullish on Nio long term. But can we discuss the fundamentals here? \n\nGranted, the latest $1.3 billion offering isn\u2019t exactly equity offering at least in the short term but Nio has raised close to $4 billion in a matter of 2 months? Purpose of the latest offering is to strengthen Nio\u2019s cash and b/s positions instead of supporting growth initiatives. For early Nio investors, they would remember Nio was once running out of cash in early 2020 prior to being bailed out by government funding. Should we be concerned with Nio\u2019s cash burning history?\n\nNio\u2019s release of its first sedan was delayed on multiple occasions partly due to the pandemic. Based on the latest timeline, it won\u2019t be released until Q1, 2022. Also, ET7 is a premium sedan instead of a mass market sedan. While I understand Nio goes for luxury branding, It seems to me Nio\u2019s decision to hold off on mass market vehicle is because it cannot yet handle the production volume of a mass market vehicle. As of now, Nio is still not vertically integrated and still has to pay JAC a fee for every vehicle produced and compensate JAC for any operating losses for the first 3 years of the joint venture. Li commented that Nio will consider a mass market vehicle rollout under a different brand when costs start coming down. I don\u2019t see that plan coming to fruition within a year or 2 and I question Nio\u2019s ability to able to scale quickly going forward. \n\nSolid state battery announcement is great but Nio is adopting someone else\u2019s battery tech with no control on the production pipeline given Nio\u2019s battery partner(s) also partners with other major auto manufacturers. On top of that, solid state battery is not proven to be commercial feasible yet and earliest expected deliveries is Q4, 2022.\n\nI like their directions in self driving by partnering with Nvidia and incorporating LiDAR in self driving. But we probably won\u2019t witness the self driving upgrades until ET7 is released. Again, none of these developments are come to fruition in the near term. \n\nAs a holder of 160 shares of Nio, I\u2019m concerned about Nio\u2019s ability to execute long term growth initiatives.",

        "selftext": "TLDR:\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 $ACEV\n\nIf you like all the buzzwords like EV, autonomous driving, LiDAR etc, you will like ACEV. I think this is one of few long term plays. I might hold it pfor long time. \n\n**How does a Chip Company has anything to do with EV**\nIt will benefit all the cars including EV. One of the challenges that autonomous driving cars face is the huge amount of Data coming from sensors and cameras for self-driving. Traditional CPUs are bad at processing these data(that\u2019s why you need GPU to play fortnight or roblox). Neutral networks require huge computing power and the computation has to be done locally. Therefore cars need something more powerful to handle the data crunching. That\u2019s where FPGA comes in. FPGAs are specialized chips that will speed up the computation of Data and AI. Achronix is one of the few if not only upcoming player in the high-end FPGA space. If FPGA is indeed the future, then every car on the street will have a FPGA chip. Achronix has something called embedded-FPGA, which is specialized for this type of application due to high integration capability with other chips and lower power consumption.\n\n**Is FPGA the only solution to Autonomous Driving**\nNvidia and AMD have different opinion on this subject matter. Jensen Huang thinks ASIC will dominate self-driving while AMD\u2019s 35B Xilinx purchase signals a different approach. Xilinx has a platform that\u2019s dedicated to self-driving cars. I personally stand with Su Bae because confirmation bias. \n\n**How does the Financial Look**\n100m 2020E revenue with 160m uncancellable orders. Billions more in potential pipeline. High gross margin(2021E 76%)  and Ebit Margin(2021E 32%). Even if we take into account high R&amp;D cost, Anchronix is already a profitable company. On contrast, It will take a Normal EV company many many year to reach profitability. The proceeds of the SPAC transaction will fund their further R&amp;D which will further their revenue and profit. Achronix has 37mm estimated net income for 2020. Assuming a 2 billion valuation at 10$. The company is trading at 2020 P/E of 54. This is pretty insane. I haven\u2019t seen a SPAC with positive P/E. (Besides the retarded mortgage play) Nvidia is trading at P/E of 90, AMD is trading at 126 and they are established companies. WTF is going on here. However I do have to admit their revenue is jumping around for the past years. My take is that they did not smooth out their financial like the public companies. With larger adaption of self-driving cars and 5G, I do see the revenue will explode. I do not think the lack of diversity of customer base is cause of concern. If QS can moon without a single customer for the next 5 years, why shouldn\u2019t ACEV moon? \ud83e\uddd0\ud83e\uddd0 Besides they are already diversifying their customer base as we speak.\n\n**What can Anchronix Chips do besides Autonomous Driving acceleration?**\nHere are more buzzwords you will like AI, cloud, 5G infrastructure, cyber security etc. In the age of big data, FPGA is critical for these applications that require flexibility and intense computation. Equity and Futures market makers use FPGA for the trading due to its superior speed. \n\n**Price Target**\nIf the scammy THBR can reach 13. Then 13 will be the floor for ACEV. I do see it go to 30 (at 200 2020P/E multiple) easily as soon as we have some catalysts and people start to notice this hidden gem. The only reason THBR gets some traction is because they mentioned a lot about EV. I do see ACEV will go a lot farther than THBR.\n\n**Catalysts for Moon**\n1.\tCathie Wood is buying all sort of SPACs. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if she buys some ACEV given acev\u2019s industry and applications\n2.\tSigning big contracts (this would diversity their revenue risks due to concentration) \n3.\t5G and other EV/Cars related plays will trigger ACEV to moon. The LiDAR companies are not specially EV related but they are also part of the EV play.\n4.\tFundamental is solid. With 20-25% CAGR growth, P/E aka the valuation will get cheaper and cheaper\n5.\tBig buyout by big corporation like Nvidia or even some Chinese company that doesn\u2019t give a fuck about price tag. ACEV is valued at 2b. Xilinx got bought our at 35B (way bigger revenue tho) \n\nDisclaimer: \nI am not an expert of chips but I know a rocket when I see it. You just gotta trust the rockets \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nI am holding about 2000 shares. I will not add more because THCB will moon very soon. ACEV is a long term play \nIf you remember my previous posts, I haven\u2019t sold my THCB holdings yet and I will continue to add THCB until It reaches 120k USD.",

        "selftext": "*Heads up: This is gonna be a long one, so grab a drink and a snack.*\n\n**TLDR:** I got a bunch of money to invest. I invested near the all-time highs, and now I'm scared that we're gonna see a big correction because of what's happening with GME, and I don't know what to do.\n\nHi everyone! I'd firstly like to say thank you to anyone who's taking their time to read this. I really appreciate it! So without further ado, here's my situation:\n\nAround 2 weeks ago, I got a large sum of money (at least to me) of $20,000. I was told that I could do anything I wanted with it and of course, I decided that it would be a good idea to invest! I've never invested with this much money before, so I was, and still am, very nervous about losing it. I decided to invest in what I consider to be \"safe\" stocks (obviously, there's risk in everything, but I think the stocks I chose are not too awfully risky). Unfortunately, I had no idea what would happen with GME, and I've missed out on that rocket ship since I didn't have any cash left when it took off, and I had no clue what was happening with it at the time. So far, these are the stocks I've invested in:\n\n**AMD: 33 shares @ $96**\n\n**APPL: 24 shares @ $132**\n\n**AAL: 100 shares @ $14**\n\n**DAL: 31 shares @ $38**\n\n**MSFT: 15 shares @ $231**\n\n**NVDA: 7 shares @ $517**\n\n**XLNX: 21 shares @ $150**\n\n**and VOO: 3 Shares $347**\n\n**Total (including leftover cash): $19,891 (down $1000 from $20,891 last week.** ***ouch*****)**\n\nMy investment \"strategy\" that I had in my head when I was choosing all of these stocks a few weeks ago was that I'm just starting college, and I'm fortunate to have all of my expenses covered. Because of this, I don't really have anything to spend money on right now, so instead of just having $20K sitting in my bank account, I thought it'd be a good idea to invest it. I plan to hold onto these stocks for the next 5 years while I'm in school so that by the time I graduate, I'll have a nice sum of money to start my life with.\n\n**Here is my concern:** I've seen some talk on this sub recently that we might see a correction to the markets as a result of this whole GME thing. This worries me because when I bought all of these stocks (2-ish weeks ago), I got most of them (except for AAL, and DAL) at/or really close to their all-time highs. I'm sure that in 5 years, I'll have made a decent amount of money from this investment, but I'm wondering if it might not be worth it to cover my $110 loss and sell some of my stocks so that I can buy back in if the market ends up dropping. If I were to do this, I'd sell everything except AAL, DAL, MSFT, and APPL.\n\nThis is where I'd like your guy's advice. I have no idea what to do right now, and I'm worried that my emotions are making decisions, which never ends well. I keep going back and forth in my head on whether or not I should hold onto what I have and wait or if I should sell and re-invest in the dip. If I do sell, I'll have roughly $10,200 to work with. My thought is to split that into two $5k portions. I'll split one evenly back into AAL, DAL, APPL, and MSFT and the other $5k that I'd put into much higher risk stuff with the chance of making some big returns on them at the risk of losing it all.\n\nI'd love to hear what you guys have to say about this, and if you guys have any suggestions on stocks you think will do very well, I'd love to hear about it! (obviously, anything I invest in is my own responsibility, and I'll do my own research on any suggestions given) Thanks!!",

        "selftext": "To further look into the history of Citron Research, I read the Wikipedia page on Andrew Left. Now I know how Wikipedia as a source can be biased and inaccurate, but there are several pieces of information here worth looking into.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew\\_Left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left)\n\nContrary to everyone here saying that Citron has been wrong on every stock he shorted, WSJ says \n\n&gt;111 Citron short-sale reports spanning from 2001 to 2014, there was an average share-price decline of 42 percent in the year after Left's report was released. Of those shares, 90 were lower one year later while 21 gained, according to data from S&amp;P Capital IQ. \n\nSource [link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-short-who-sank-valeant-stock-1445557157)\n\nNow this may be old data from 2001-2014 and his predictions may have become progressively worse ever since. I just want to look at the possible selection bias of PLTR, BB, TSLA, NVDA and every other one of his failed shorts.\n\nHowever, here's where I think the juicy part is. Consider Andrew Left's checkered past:\n\n&gt; Left's first job was with Universal Commodity Corp, a high-pressure [commodities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_market) brokerage firm that hired salespeople to make [cold calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_calling) and push \"questionable investments.\"[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left#cite_note-reut-12) Left quit in March 1994, after 9 months with the company. When the [National Futures Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Futures_Association)  sanctioned the firm in December 1998, Left, along with every other  former employee, was sanctioned for three years along with being  required to take an ethics-training course \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Left became active in [short selling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance))  by the age of 24. He has cited his experience with Universal Commodity  Corp as the reason he started short selling stocks promoted by  boiler-room scams. \n\nHe has a lot of experience with securities fraud and uses that knowledge to short stocks with illicit activity. This is where he may have made successful predictions. Yet this is not without controversy. Many firms have sued Citron for defamation and deliberately crashing their stock prices:\n\n&gt; Qihoo 360 has threatened to take legal action against Citron Research, as has former [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) China chief Kai-Fu Lee, now the chairman and CEO of Innovation Works.[\\[41\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left#cite_note-wantchinatimes1-41)[\\[42\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left#cite_note-42)  In 2012, posted a detailed, point-by-point rebuttal, via Sinocism, to  Chinese investment platform Xueqiu.com, which also suggests that Citron  had taken advantage of reader unfamiliariarity with Chinese languages  and markets. Lee stated that, \"Since Citron has already made big bets on  these recommendations before their reports are published... Citron\u2019s  recommendation doesn\u2019t have to be right; Citron just needs to mislead  their readers to follow their recommendations!\u201d \n\nSounds eerily familiar to what's happened to GME today? I don't think it's a cooincidence. As far as I'm concerned, there is no fraud or illicit activity happened with GME, or the other meme stocks that he tried to short. He simply made the wrong bets, took positions in fields outside his expertise (fraud), and lost a lot of money. Now he is using his experience with fraud against us, deliberately pushing GME down so he doesn't get squeezed.\n\nPoint is, maybe sometimes Citron is right to short a stock when the company is engaged in fraud. But every wsb stock he tried to short was based on his conviction that it was overvalued, and he was totally wrong.\n\nGoing into tomorrow, I hope everyone exercises some caution. He seems to know what he is doing with market manipulation. Maybe trim positions a little at the top, and buy the dip once his dump ass twitter stream starts at 11:30. I'm bullish as anyone else on this sub, just thought this background info might prove useful as I don't see anyone else bringing it up.\n\nTL;DR Be careful, shitron seems to have a lot of experience with fraud and market manipulation. Obviously don't paper hand, but tomorrow might be a good opportunity to manage position and buy the dip on GME.\n\noh and for good measure heres some rocket emojis \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "As a relative newcomer to (active) investment, I\u2019m interested in people\u2019s investment strategies regarding the FAANG, and rationale for trying to pick the next potential members.\n\nIn terms of how I rate the FAANG (and Microsoft) currently -\n\nI\u2019m bullish on Amazon, Apple and Microsoft. \n\nAmazon in particular seems set for further massive growth with AWS and delivery innovations. Apple continues to successfully move into new product lines, whilst dominating the top end consumer devices market, and continuing to offer at least some competition to Microsoft in the business space. Microsoft continues to monopolise the business space, and grow Azure. I have confidence all will continue to successfully innovate into new market segments. For example, I think Apple TV will get stronger, and Apple Music will begin taking a bigger bite out of Spotify\u2019s market share.\n\nWhilst it remains mired in controversy, and Biden appears keen to try and reign in their data privacy and targeted advertising, I\u2019m confident on Facebook. I continue to view negative press as a good opportunity to buy the dip. While they could be massively constrained, and customers *could* just move onto other platforms (as I\u2019ve often heard touted), they continue to have a large moat around social media. Noones managed to knock them off yet. WhatsApp remains very popular (particularly here in Western Europe), and I think there would need to be a new player with a better overall user experience in either category to actually affect Facebook\u2019s moat. People may move to apps like Signal and Telegram in greater numbers. Facebook continues to compete and arguably has pulled ahead of Google in the advertising space. It\u2019s also pivoted well into gaming (with Oculus), and the online marketplace (albeit competing more with eBay and Craigslist, rather than Amazon or Baba). I can see it faring equally well on payments.\n\nGoogle continues to hold market dominance of the search and mapping space. I can\u2019t see it losing this. It\u2019ll also continue to remain competitive in advertising and operating systems, particularly for advertising revenue when society returns to the \u201cbefore times\u201d and more people are using it for everyday life. That said, Google has often tried and failed to innovate (see: \u201ckilledbyGoogle\u201d). It seems to have stagnated, in the company\u2019s inability to capitalise on some of their innovations. While it still retains some competition in areas like consumer electronics (Chromebools), the cloud and smart tech; it isn\u2019t close to dominating those markets. I think Google will remain a very strong company for some time, and I\u2019d pile in if it looked like a successful project was on the horizon - as we may yet see from self-driving cars and AI. \n\nNetflix will also likely retain its moat for some time to come, given the quality of the product and its user interface. Competition exists, but it\u2019s a long way from seriously eating into their market share. They have had some (expensive) flops, but they continue to generate good content - particularly in documentary making. That said, for me to invest I\u2019d want to see evidence of a pivot into trying to dominate another market segment. While Google has probably tried to compete in too many different areas of the market, Netflix hasn\u2019t at all. Will it eventually look to monetise the targeted data it has collected on its customers?\n\nOutside of the FAANG, Tesla has been a meme stock for its meteoric rise and potential to monopolise the EV space - though it remains to be seen whether it will continue to innovate, and hold this monopoly. If it can, it could well achieve FAANG-level market dominance.\n\nWhat do people think are realistically the (large, medium or small cap) companies that have the potential to enter this level of market dominance? I\u2019ve seen good cases made for NVIDIA, Square and Roku dominating their markets. Do you think this will be FAANG level, with the same ability to innovate?\n\nThere are clear trends that are likely to shape the future - EV and the wider renewable energy market, further environmentally-focused markets like meat alternatives, genomics, medical cannabis, payments and AI. How do people pick companies that are likely to dominate in these areas at this point, when there are so many players in the various areas? \n\nDo you also look at growth stocks in these areas, or areas like sports betting that are likely to take off in the US market, as solid investments (with the obvious risks) - given the potential to become large cap companies and dominate their sectors? I\u2019ve seen the bull case for DraftKings, but much like areas such as genomics and medical cannabis, there are legislative hurdles to overcome, and other companies could rise to fill that space. While DraftKings is leading a lot of the sports betting push, it doesn\u2019t have the largest market share, and when you look at Western Europe, you see how much competition there is; with no clear sector dominance. Are you looking to invest in a company that, by the potential to grow into a big player, could still see a huge return on investment, or are you trying to calculate and determine which companies could completely dominate their markets?",

        "selftext": "**Stocks finish at all time highs to close out the first trading week of 2021. What is my opinion on the NIO stock after their latest event? DraftKings &amp; PENN soar after the latest New York developments, let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/zr3x08Q) leading the way up over 1% and finished the week 2.4% up, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/9ghJQfk) also gaining more than half a percent on Friday and 1.8% for the week while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/w4Xrnvk) rose by 56 points and finished 1.6% higher in the first week of 2021, with all 3 big indexes finishing at new all-time highs. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/vdYffjm) dropping below 22 again, despite a mid-day spike, as the volatility index dropped more than 23% since the high on [Tuesday](https://ibb.co/C8xQvsN).\n\nWe saw an average [DAY](https://ibb.co/VTPKM80) of trading to close out the week, with average volume and an almost equal number of companies that were advancing compared to the declining ones, as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/gDFHxLf) finished in the green, with consumer Discretionary &amp; Real Estate Leading the way, while the more value heavy industries lagged. For the week though, Energy outperformed, rising by more than 9%, Technology finished flat despite a very bad start to the week after the Georgia election and Real Estate lagged behind, losing 2.5% for the week, as we saw Large-Cap growth companies outperform on [Friday](https://ibb.co/b24dvCn), but in this fresh 2021, small &amp; mid-caps have outperformed.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/G0YW732) from Friday, with big gainers coming mostly in the consumer cyclicals, with Tesla, Alibaba &amp; MercadoLibre posting big gains, while the biggest losers were in the gold industry.\n\nIn [THIS](https://ibb.co/MBH11mV) short year though, we can see the huge outperformance of the Energy Sector, the Banks and some other names like Tesla &amp; TSM.\n\nWe also got some economic data, with the latest Redfin report showing a 13% increase in home sale [PRICES](https://ibb.co/HV9CqQg) over 2020, as [ACTIVE](https://ibb.co/5nwRLMB) listings of homes for sales keeps on dropping. The listings have seen a 32% decrease since last year to a new all-time low, though, the average sale to list [PRICE](https://ibb.co/vcX1Jpw) ratio finally declined to 99.3%, as the housing market was red hot since June.\n\nWhile December nonfarm payroll [declined](https://ibb.co/GT72GvR) by 140K, worse than then 75k gains expected and is the first month since April that brings jobs losses with most of the [JOBS](https://ibb.co/hKwgGqN) losses coming from the leisure and hospitality business which has been hit hard again, losing almost half a million jobs, while the unemployment rate did inch lower to 6.7%.\n\nSo, this week pretty much starts of the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/7GPMmkJ) season again, with the most interesting ones for me being, Aphria as a read on the cannabis sector, Delta Airlines for a read on how the Airlines are recovering and JP Morgan on Friday, while on the economic front we will see a lot of interesting [DATA](https://ibb.co/X5FVfBB), mostly starting on Wednesday with the Consumer price index and the Federal Budget, while we continue these with the jobless claims on Thursday and more numbers about the economy on Friday.\n\nThis week we will also have some [IPOs](https://ibb.co/HKJXY8K) with the most interesting coming from Affirm Holdings, while I really expect to see what Biden [SAYS](https://ibb.co/rpTRtKN) on Thursday as this may be key to a further stimulus or fiscal package.\n\nSo, NIO [DAY](https://ibb.co/MBB053y) came and left me with rather somewhat of a disappointment, though I don\u2019t expect most investors to really look at this, so they will probably jump on the stock again this week, so here is a quick recap of what they announced and what is my opinion on NIO:\n\nThey announced the first flagship sedan mode, the ET7 which will be [AVAILABLE](https://ibb.co/0jkgfTm) in 2 trim levels with 70 or 100KW battery starting from around $70K and $78K, but the good thing about NIO, and their main competitive advantage is the battery as a service. So, they will make this new sedan available for the same price with either battery pack if you do use the BAAS model at a price of $58K.\n\nThey also announced the next gen battery swap stations that can do over 300swaps/day, more than 3x the capability of the current one, as they also plan to build another 400 stations that would bring them to a total of almost 600 by the end of the year.\n\nThe \u201cnew battery technology\u201d that they announced was the actual thing that disappointed me. So, they announced a 150KW battery with a claimed range of over 600miles, but that should be in perfect conditions, so expect the actual range to be somewhere in 400mile range, pretty much in line with Tesla\u2019s current capabilities. The Launch [DATE](https://ibb.co/9WK8dJW) for the car is still only Q1 2022 while for the \u201cNew Solid-State battery\u201d the timeline is for it to be available by the end of 2022. So, the bad thing is that everything is still at least 1 year away and we have to see if the claimed range for the new battery is real.\n\nAnd there are a couple of big warning signs here with the new battery technology, they actually avoided saying they designed, created or engineered this new tech battery, by saying they will [ADOPT](https://ibb.co/dDDpkm5) this new technology. So, it seems they will adopt this new technology from their current battery supplier CATL. This is an issue as this battery will be available to other manufacturers like Hyundai, Mercedes BMW will get their hands on, so this will not actually be something innovative, ground-breaking or a proprietary solution.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t know how big this new Sedan thing is, because the Sedan market is really dying around the world. This new ET7 isn\u2019t competition for TESLA 3, it\u2019s targeted for competition against the model S, which is already a dying segment as you can see from Tesla\u2019s [SALES](https://ibb.co/smr7vNN).\n\nBut on some more positive news, they did announce something better in my opinion, with their Self-Driving Feature, [INCLUDING](https://ibb.co/ss65yw6)11 8megapixel cameras, as their collaboration with [Nvidia](https://ibb.co/C5bNBGK) will produce a super-computer that will generate up to 8Gigabyte/s of data, with the Nvidia CORE estimated to be 7x better than Tesla\u2019s current computer. Though [THIS](https://ibb.co/M61cLRm) doesn\u2019t have an official release date and will probably come with the ET7 next year, so, another disappointment as this comp against Tesla will not be a huge advantage once Tesla does upgrade their computers as well.\n\nSo, for short the main competitive advantages that [NIO](https://ibb.co/3c5Q80j) has right now are that they use the subscription model for both the battery swap technology and for the full-self driving feature which costs around $100/month. This is are very good and smart recurring revenue streams, as they make the entry price for the car much lower and also provide a stable flow of revenues. But\u2026 I am disappointed in the \u201cnew battery technology\u201d and have to wait for more developments. If this is a common technology that will be used by other car manufacturers, this is effectively not that big of a deal, but if somehow this is their own technology, that would possibly have better implications for the company. So, guys, I own both Tesla &amp; NIO, and I think I might hold off right now on buying any more due to different factors. I think that Tesla has a good future, but this huge run-up has made it a good target for 10-20% correction at any point in the short-term future, while for NIO I expect this to rise in the next couple of days, and I am waiting for it to cool off a little before adding any more to my position. So, yeah, short-term I think both of them have some downside risk, but in the long run, I expect Tesla to trade at over $1000 and NIO to trade over $100.\n\nIn some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zJwMGgq), we saw gambling stocks like DraftKings and PENN rising on Friday after New York filed bills to legalize online betting in the state. [DraftKings](https://ibb.co/N2sDnH6) also just announced they will bring new stuff like drone racing betting, which is mind-blowing, that they are extending into such things. This is a continuing trend in the US and should be watched for future developments, as gambling will be legalized pretty much all over the US in the near future I believe, and I also expect this sector to be joined by the pot [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/Sf97NmW), even if it\u2019s really hard to believe there will be a nationwide bill to legalize it, I expect there will be some improvements for the sector, and companies like Aphria which are closer to profitability should benefit from this.\n\nOn some more sad new, we also saw a 27-year-old Boeing plane [crash](https://ibb.co/dg9yW5j) in Indonesia, this is very sad news, but as the stock market goes, this issue seems to be unrelated to [Boeing](https://ibb.co/bJwt3Lt) right now. Indonesia has seen the most deaths in the past decades, with over 104 accidents, as this country is known for bad maintenance, pilot training and air-traffic controls problems.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget, as I said in my earlier posts, don\u2019t jump on these high-flying small cap stocks at all-time highs, this is a very good moment for this companies to raise cheap capital by issuing shares, with the latest example being [BLNK](https://ibb.co/pbG62F6).\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/f9RV9NM) are pointing to a bad open right now, with all 3 big index futures down, as the DOW futures are down over 200 points\n\n\ud83d\ude4fThank you everyone for reading!\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGeorgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,\u201d said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. \u201cIt\u2019s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s a binary event,\u201d said Mills, adding it\u2019s of growing interest to markets. \u201cThe general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us \u2026 The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat totally dominates [trading] because it\u2019s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending\u201d by Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; # By the numbers\n&gt; A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&amp;P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.\n*****\n&gt; There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump\u2019s task force.\n*****\n&gt; In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. \u201cWe suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,\u201d RBC strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,\u201d the strategists noted.\n*****\n&gt; Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden\u2019s presidency.\n*****\n&gt; However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state\u2019s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.\n*****\n&gt; Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I don\u2019t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cAXzkxf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnhSggu.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/5egoYkS.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/UlNY0Um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/z4wSKuc.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/32Ma7rG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mRJqU8A.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/J7B4Njx.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JJmAiwp.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1ARzFfu.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021\n\n&gt; Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.\n\n&gt; A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. \u201cTurns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&amp;P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-12.31.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We wish everyone a happy and safe New Years Eve and we\u2019ll see you in 2021!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days\n\n&gt; In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&amp;P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&amp;P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**\n\n&gt; The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&amp;P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds-Annual-Spreads.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology\n\n&gt; With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!\n\n&gt; In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&amp;P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.\n\n&gt; On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth Dragging on Small Caps\n\n&gt; In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks\u2014proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)\u2014are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**\n\n&gt; As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**\n\n&gt; As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**\n\n&gt; Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness, but they have held up significantly better.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-RTY-Decile.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hQIRBYI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  1.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZAbC0jw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wKzyMxp.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BUFtffd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cDQHHqx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NhUT413.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7p03h4M.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Micron Technology, Inc. $75.18\n**Micron Technology, Inc.

        "selftext": "So far I'm going with Jeff Bezos' investing philosophy he outlined in one of his interviews. To just pick a bunch of high risk, high reward long term opportunities, and invest in all of them. If any one or multiple of them pan out, then it'll easily make up for the losers.\n\nSo far I've decided to just completely ignored index funds. Instead I'm just DCAing into whatever I find has huge long term potential based off of what reddit, youtube, motley fool or ARK has hyped up. 80% of my portfolio is in BTC, ETH, TSLA, SQ, LMND, DKNG, uranium stocks, and ARK ETFs (weighted to ARKG). I'm planning on adding solar and marijuana ETFs.\n\nI've also decided not to sell a single stock no matter what happens, until I have enough to just put everything on VT/VTI and live off of that.\n\nHas anyone else pursued this strategy for the past 4-5 years? If so how did it pan out? When I look at old posts from 2-3 years ago it seems that AMD, MSFT and NVDA were the ones that were hyped up. But I can't really tell because I'm only looking at what was most upvoted and using search terms like \"what are your top picks for the long term\".",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end 2020 on the high note with Tesla closing over 700$. Is Lemonade overvalued? FuboTv keeps on crumbling while NIO posts great sales numbers, let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of the last trading day of 2020, as we saw both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/bHgX2sf) and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/D471c7X) finish up over 0.60% and finishing at record highs, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vzGgSBb)  finished barely up for the day, gaining .14%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/2YrvMpT) finishing just down for the day, but it\u2019s still up from a [week](https://ibb.co/LxdGJ8c) ago, as the volatility still remains way above the [levels](https://ibb.co/XbWkzW4) before March when it rose to over 80.\n\nWe just about saw a positive ratio of companies [advancing](https://ibb.co/5TwrM2m) to close out the year as the volume was belove average with just 100 new highs, as we saw 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yyrTGGP) finishing in the green with Utilities, Financials, Real Estate &amp; Health Care gaining more than 1% while Energy was the only sector to finish the day with a loss.  \nWe also saw most factor groups [finishing](https://ibb.co/dmvNJgL) the day in the red with only Large-Cap Value companies posting a gain of .3%, as you can see in Thursday\u2019s [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/wBGr7cR) with gains all around the board, while losses were concentrated in the Biotech and Oil &amp; Gas industry.\n\nHere is the weekly [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/zQWD12B) with names like Alibaba, Shopify, Palantir, Square and Zoom being some of the biggest losers, while TESLA continued to push higher as Tesla finished the month of [December](https://ibb.co/ZX09X8Z) with a gain of more than 20% as you can see here, while many of the other big tech names also had a strong month, with most of the losses being concentrated in the communication sector and of course Alibaba which was hit by a lot of negative news.\n\nWe also [finished](https://ibb.co/r5JRk5b) the year with most sectors in the green as you can see here, led by Technology, Consumer Cyclicals and Communications. But gains were had in most other sectors as well, except the Financial, Travel and Energy sectors, which finished the year down.\n\nThe biggest [losers](https://ibb.co/nDgRs1S) in the SP500 which finished the year up more than 16% were by far stocks like Carnival, OXY, Norwegian Cruise Line, United Airlines and many more others. The Nasdaq 100 wasn\u2019t safe either despite jumping almost 50% in 2020, having the best gains in 11years, with companies like Walgreens, Fox and Intel posting losses of over 17%, while the Dow was the laggard finishing just over 7% up for the year as Boeing, Chevron and Intel dragged the index lower.\n\nWe also saw huge [winners](https://ibb.co/n7yP7cM)  in 2020, as the SP500 was led higher by stocks like Apple, Nvidia, PayPal, Amazon and many others that posted huge gains. While the Nasdaq 100 jumped to record highs lead by Tesla which posted an incredible year with other stocks like Moderna, Peloton &amp; Zoom also rising by more than 300%. The Dow also had big winners but still lagged as the biggest gainers here were the tech giants Apple &amp; Microsoft joined by some other stocks like Nike, Disney &amp; Salesforce.\n\nWe also got some economic data since Thursday as Macau\u2019s gaming [revenue](https://ibb.co/NWBrC3s) continued the slow recovery, but the visits in the travel dependent region were 20% higher in the Holiday period compared to the start of December, which may be another positive sign for the Macau Gambling business.\n\nMeanwhile we also received the latest jobless [numbers](https://ibb.co/Km8px8X), which dipped below 800K again, 19K less than last week and more than 40K less than expected, as the continuing jobless claims also fell to just over 5.2M more than 100K better than expected and the previous [report](https://ibb.co/gJLQYPB).\n\nWhile this [week](https://ibb.co/mDnXFZY) we start to receive important economic data that alongside the results of the Georgia runoff election might push the market either to more gains, or if the results and data don\u2019t show up as investors &amp; analysts expected it, we might see an increase in volatility again which will lead to a market pullback or correction, which in my opinion would be a good time to go out and find deals to buy again.\n\nWe also really don\u2019t get any significant [earnings](https://ibb.co/60QM77h) releases this week, with most of the interesting ones like Micron, Walgreens &amp; Bed Bath &amp; Beyond coming on Thursday.\n\nSo, in some other stock market news, Tesla topped [expectations](https://ibb.co/g9048Ry) of 163K deliveries in Q4 again but did finish just shy of the 500K mark. The company delivered more than 180K vehicle in the last quarter, as we saw [Tesla](https://ibb.co/th7Hhnc)  pricing the model Y at just over $50.000 in China and are expecting to start deliveries this month as they keep expanding their sales in the world\u2019s biggest car market, as they are targeting to make this their biggest market surpassing the US. Tesla closed over 700$ for the first time and if you want to see my opinion on this stock, check out my prediction on Tesla [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kci2lk/my_tesla_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/).\n\nSome other EV makers from China also posted sales numbers with [Li Auto](https://ibb.co/LYCSs1N) increasing deliveries five-fold year/year with a 32% increase month/month in December, while [XPENG](https://ibb.co/Zc7FSQC) also announced record delivery numbers up 35% month/month and more than 300% year/year for December. We also saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/4VWGX78) posting a monthly deliveries record of just over 7K, up over 120% year/year and finishing the year with over 43K deliveries, which were also up over 110% year/year, as they are also planning on revealing some new sedan models and their latest developments on self-driving and other technologies next week.\n\nMeanwhile we saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/dKh6kx0) take a ride after another short-seller released a statement, pointing out to the final lock-up period after the IPO, as a moment that will bring huge selling to this stock, despite the [company](https://ibb.co/YWksq6g) needing just over 4 years to reach the first million customers, less than 5 times the time it took companies like StateFarm, Geico and Allstate to reach their first million. I personally am an investor in this company, and I really like what they are doing, so I am not going to sell my shares anytime soon.\n\nGuys, personally I can\u2019t wait to see the sales numbers and how the services business is growing for [Apple](https://ibb.co/cx07jJs) as the top-of-the-line products keep having great demand, but we do have to see what happens in the US-China relations, as this could impact the Apple revenue stream, this after the New York Stock Exchange has [started](https://ibb.co/599nrxc) the process of delisting telecom giants from China. You can check out my prediction on Apple [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kmzvqv/apple_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell_aapl/)\n\nWe also saw a [memo](https://ibb.co/qyBfzrq) from DELTA\u2019s CEO, as he expects the company to return to positive cashflow in the spring, as they are planning to start paying down debt as soon as that happens to reduce the burden the company has taken on since March 2020.\n\nMeanwhile [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/Dg5jZ6x) continues its sharp decline after a number of firms have started to short the stock pointing to insane valuations and outlook. Fubo plunged again almost 16% Thursday and is down almost 50% in the past week as the IPO lockup period expired, more than tripling the shares float.\n\nAnd on last piece of news that just came out is that [Roku](https://ibb.co/gM8Z4Bv) is looking to buy the content catalog from Quibi, this would give a boost to Roku\u2019s exclusive programming, as the stock has seen an immediate reaction and is up over 3.5% in pre-market trading.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/zf9tMYZ) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 leading the way to start off the year as we wait to receive the first economic [data](https://ibb.co/f24tRCS) this year in the early morning, while the global stock [markets](https://ibb.co/sjvZMrx) started on a positive note except Japan.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

        "selftext": "#1) Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ)\n\nThe Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ) follows the immensely well known Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) by investing in the 101st to the 200th largest NASDAQ listed companies. These companies are less mature than those in the NASDAQ 100 but with high growth potential.\n\nThe top holdings of QQQJ include Roku Inc (ROKU), Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (CRWD), The Trade Desk Inc (TTD), Zscaler Inc (ZS), Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN), Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO), Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (ODFL), Fortinet Inc (FTNT), and Coupa Software Inc (COUP). Many of the most popular growth companies are included in this new ETF.\n\n#2) VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF tracks the semiconductor industry--one of the hottest industries of 2020. It isn\u2019t hard to be bullish on semiconductors when they are required by virtually all companies. Electric vehicles have put the spotlight on many semiconductor companies in the race for autonomous driving.\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has top holdings including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Nvidia Corp (NVDA), ASML Holding (ASML), Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN), Intel Corp (INTC), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (MU), and Analog Devices Inc (ADI). Semiconductors have had a killer year and the outperformance will likely continue in the future as demand for semiconductors increases.\n\n#3) Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM)\n\nSalesforce.com, Inc (CRM) develops cloud computing solutions for customer relationship management (hence the ticker \u201cCRM\u201d). Salesforce recently announced it was acquiring Slack Technologies (WORK) for over $27 billion. This deal was one of the largest acquisitions announced in 2020. Salesforce has fallen almost 15% since the acquisition announcement on fears it is overpaying in the Slack acquisition.\n\nHowever, Salesforce has continued to crush earnings estimates in the last quarters of 2020 with analyst consensus that this growth can continue. Salesforce operates in a growing market and continues to be the number one choice for customer relationship management.\n\n#4) Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY)\n\nArray Technologies, Inc. (ARRY) is in the business of solar tracking solutions and services. The Company currently provides the DuraTrack solar tracking system and SmarTrack which is software that automatically adjusts module angles to compensate for environment changes.\n\nArray is quickly growing revenues with earnings and free cash flow remaining positive since 2019. The Company has stated its plans for continued growth and its willingness to make acquisitions. Array Technologies is a direct bet on the future of solar energy which will likely benefit under a democratic Whitehouse. This Company allows investors to invest in the future of solar without investing directly into solar panels.\n\n#5) Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX)\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) focuses on the treatment of cystic fibrosis through several drugs and has several ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of other diseases. Vertex collaborates with an impressive list of companies, including CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), Moderna (MRNA), and Merck &amp; Co. (MRK).\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has proven itself to be competent in developing market-leading drugs and securing lengthy patents on its treatments. The Company will continue to dominate the cystic fibrosis space in the future due to limited competition.\n\n**Honorable mentions:** CSIQ, AMZN, MSFT, PENN, ABBV, AZN, FUSE\n\n----\n\n**Note:** I hold positions in all of the mentioned companies and exchange traded funds. Many of these companies are valued at high multiples due to their growth potential. This is not financial advice; invest at your own risk.",

So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/zr3x08Q) leading the way up over 1% and finished the week 2.4% up, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/9ghJQfk) also gaining more than half a percent on Friday and 1.8% for the week while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/w4Xrnvk) rose by 56 points and finished 1.6% higher in the first week of 2021, with all 3 big indexes finishing at new all-time highs. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/vdYffjm) dropping below 22 again, despite a mid-day spike, as the volatility index dropped more than 23% since the high on [Tuesday](https://ibb.co/C8xQvsN).\n\nWe saw an average [DAY](https://ibb.co/VTPKM80) of trading to close out the week, with average volume and an almost equal number of companies that were advancing compared to the declining ones, as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/gDFHxLf) finished in the green, with consumer Discretionary &amp; Real Estate Leading the way, while the more value heavy industries lagged. For the week though, Energy outperformed, rising by more than 9%, Technology finished flat despite a very bad start to the week after the Georgia election and Real Estate lagged behind, losing 2.5% for the week, as we saw Large-Cap growth companies outperform on [Friday](https://ibb.co/b24dvCn), but in this fresh 2021, small &amp; mid-caps have outperformed.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/G0YW732) from Friday, with big gainers coming mostly in the consumer cyclicals, with Tesla, Alibaba &amp; MercadoLibre posting big gains, while the biggest losers were in the gold industry.\n\nIn [THIS](https://ibb.co/MBH11mV) short year though, we can see the huge outperformance of the Energy Sector, the Banks and some other names like Tesla &amp; TSM.\n\nWe also got some economic data, with the latest Redfin report showing a 13% increase in home sale [PRICES](https://ibb.co/HV9CqQg) over 2020, as [ACTIVE](https://ibb.co/5nwRLMB) listings of homes for sales keeps on dropping. The listings have seen a 32% decrease since last year to a new all-time low, though, the average sale to list [PRICE](https://ibb.co/vcX1Jpw) ratio finally declined to 99.3%, as the housing market was red hot since June.\n\nWhile December nonfarm payroll [declined](https://ibb.co/GT72GvR) by 140K, worse than then 75k gains expected and is the first month since April that brings jobs losses with most of the [JOBS](https://ibb.co/hKwgGqN) losses coming from the leisure and hospitality business which has been hit hard again, losing almost half a million jobs, while the unemployment rate did inch lower to 6.7%.\n\nSo, this week pretty much starts of the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/7GPMmkJ) season again, with the most interesting ones for me being, Aphria as a read on the cannabis sector, Delta Airlines for a read on how the Airlines are recovering and JP Morgan on Friday, while on the economic front we will see a lot of interesting [DATA](https://ibb.co/X5FVfBB), mostly starting on Wednesday with the Consumer price index and the Federal Budget, while we continue these with the jobless claims on Thursday and more numbers about the economy on Friday.\n\nThis week we will also have some [IPOs](https://ibb.co/HKJXY8K) with the most interesting coming from Affirm Holdings, while I really expect to see what Biden [SAYS](https://ibb.co/rpTRtKN) on Thursday as this may be key to a further stimulus or fiscal package.\n\nSo, NIO [DAY](https://ibb.co/MBB053y) came and left me with rather somewhat of a disappointment, though I don\u2019t expect most investors to really look at this, so they will probably jump on the stock again this week, so here is a quick recap of what they announced and what is my opinion on NIO:\n\nThey announced the first flagship sedan mode, the ET7 which will be [AVAILABLE](https://ibb.co/0jkgfTm) in 2 trim levels with 70 or 100KW battery starting from around $70K and $78K, but the good thing about NIO, and their main competitive advantage is the battery as a service. So, they will make this new sedan available for the same price with either battery pack if you do use the BAAS model at a price of $58K.\n\nThey also announced the next gen battery swap stations that can do over 300swaps/day, more than 3x the capability of the current one, as they also plan to build another 400 stations that would bring them to a total of almost 600 by the end of the year.\n\nThe \u201cnew battery technology\u201d that they announced was the actual thing that disappointed me. So, they announced a 150KW battery with a claimed range of over 600miles, but that should be in perfect conditions, so expect the actual range to be somewhere in 400mile range, pretty much in line with Tesla\u2019s current capabilities. The Launch [DATE](https://ibb.co/9WK8dJW) for the car is still only Q1 2022 while for the \u201cNew Solid-State battery\u201d the timeline is for it to be available by the end of 2022. So, the bad thing is that everything is still at least 1 year away and we have to see if the claimed range for the new battery is real.\n\nAnd there are a couple of big warning signs here with the new battery technology, they actually avoided saying they designed, created or engineered this new tech battery, by saying they will [ADOPT](https://ibb.co/dDDpkm5) this new technology. So, it seems they will adopt this new technology from their current battery supplier CATL. This is an issue as this battery will be available to other manufacturers like Hyundai, Mercedes BMW will get their hands on, so this will not actually be something innovative, ground-breaking or a proprietary solution.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t know how big this new Sedan thing is, because the Sedan market is really dying around the world. This new ET7 isn\u2019t competition for TESLA 3, it\u2019s targeted for competition against the model S, which is already a dying segment as you can see from Tesla\u2019s [SALES](https://ibb.co/smr7vNN).\n\nBut on some more positive news, they did announce something better in my opinion, with their Self-Driving Feature, [INCLUDING](https://ibb.co/ss65yw6)11 8megapixel cameras, as their collaboration with [Nvidia](https://ibb.co/C5bNBGK) will produce a super-computer that will generate up to 8Gigabyte/s of data, with the Nvidia CORE estimated to be 7x better than Tesla\u2019s current computer. Though [THIS](https://ibb.co/M61cLRm) doesn\u2019t have an official release date and will probably come with the ET7 next year, so, another disappointment as this comp against Tesla will not be a huge advantage once Tesla does upgrade their computers as well.\n\nSo, for short the main competitive advantages that [NIO](https://ibb.co/3c5Q80j) has right now are that they use the subscription model for both the battery swap technology and for the full-self driving feature which costs around $100/month. This is are very good and smart recurring revenue streams, as they make the entry price for the car much lower and also provide a stable flow of revenues. But\u2026 I am disappointed in the \u201cnew battery technology\u201d and have to wait for more developments. If this is a common technology that will be used by other car manufacturers, this is effectively not that big of a deal, but if somehow this is their own technology, that would possibly have better implications for the company. So, guys, I own both Tesla &amp; NIO, and I think I might hold off right now on buying any more due to different factors. I think that Tesla has a good future, but this huge run-up has made it a good target for 10-20% correction at any point in the short-term future, while for NIO I expect this to rise in the next couple of days, and I am waiting for it to cool off a little before adding any more to my position. So, yeah, short-term I think both of them have some downside risk, but in the long run, I expect Tesla to trade at over $1000 and NIO to trade over $100.\n\nIn some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zJwMGgq), we saw gambling stocks like DraftKings and PENN rising on Friday after New York filed bills to legalize online betting in the state. [DraftKings](https://ibb.co/N2sDnH6) also just announced they will bring new stuff like drone racing betting, which is mind-blowing, that they are extending into such things. This is a continuing trend in the US and should be watched for future developments, as gambling will be legalized pretty much all over the US in the near future I believe, and I also expect this sector to be joined by the pot [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/Sf97NmW), even if it\u2019s really hard to believe there will be a nationwide bill to legalize it, I expect there will be some improvements for the sector, and companies like Aphria which are closer to profitability should benefit from this.\n\nOn some more sad new, we also saw a 27-year-old Boeing plane [crash](https://ibb.co/dg9yW5j) in Indonesia, this is very sad news, but as the stock market goes, this issue seems to be unrelated to [Boeing](https://ibb.co/bJwt3Lt) right now. Indonesia has seen the most deaths in the past decades, with over 104 accidents, as this country is known for bad maintenance, pilot training and air-traffic controls problems.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget, as I said in my earlier posts, don\u2019t jump on these high-flying small cap stocks at all-time highs, this is a very good moment for this companies to raise cheap capital by issuing shares, with the latest example being [BLNK](https://ibb.co/pbG62F6).\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/f9RV9NM) are pointing to a bad open right now, with all 3 big index futures down, as the DOW futures are down over 200 points\n\n\ud83d\ude4fThank you everyone for reading!\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

Nvidia said that more than 70 laptop manufacturers would offer gaming laptops that use the company\u2019s next-generation Ampere architecture. Nvidia said its new gaming laptops would be priced at $999 for the RTX 3060 model, $1,299 for the RTX 3070 model, and $1,999 for the RTX 3080 model.\n\nAs many gamers found this past holiday season, however, those list prices were pretty much meaningless as resellers scooped up available RTX 30-series cards and sold them at much higher prices, and remaining 30-series cards were only available from manufacturers who were bundling the cards into pre-made gaming rigs. Supply problems were so bad, especially as many new games that required fast hardware were released, that even Nvidia\u2019s older 20-series generation of cards saw significant markups from resellers.\n\nThis new product launch, however, should be a little easier given that laptop chips make better use of constrained foundry resources, Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, told MarketWatch in an interview.",

        "selftext": "* The market was a bit mixed today compare to yesterday's - but tech continued its skyrocket after yesterday's bullish inauguration run. AAPL extended their rally to close the day up 3.67% to $136.87, nearing ATH once again thanks to some more positive comments from analysts this morning. Morgan Stanley up their AAPL PT from $144 to $152, while Bernstein notes Apple's strong iPhone 12 demand cycle. In other big tech moves, FB closed up 2% to $272 as Evercore ups their PT from $320 to $355; AMZN trimmed their earlier morning gains but still closed the day up 1.34% to $3,300; finally, after running up 6% yesterday, GOOGL retreated from a morning high that almost touched ATH to close the day at 0.22%.\n\n* GME euphoria roars along unabated as WSB continues to go all-in on the gaming retailer. With intraday moves of over 13%, GME is as volatile as ever. Shares initially traded red in the morning but soon rally to as high as $42 when it became apparent Citron's video was postponed yet again (damn hAxOr!), but the stock soon went red once the video was uploaded. Suffice to say, Citron's video on YouTube immediately accumulated thousands of dislikes while not revealing anything material that the market wouldn't know about already - and shares recovered after an initial dive. Through the rest of the day, shares bounced from low $40s to the ~$42 sell wall, but eventually broke through during power hour and closed the day up 9.99% to $43 - a relatively strong bullish close considering GME hasn't closed above $40+ since last week's big pump. Support appears to be around $35-$37 and resistance is around $42-$43.\n\n* Morning numbers had jobless claims falling slightly by 26k to 900k for the week ending in Jan 16 with consensus being 910k. Housing Starts saw another strong month with a 5.8% increase to 1.67m in Dec. Finally, Philly Fed manufacturing index showed a strong uptick with numbers at 26.5 vs the consensus of 12, representing an 11-month high. \n\n* Airlines took a beating today with UAL leading the charge. With steeper than expected rev miss from their ER, UAL closed the day down -5.7% to $42.69. DAL closed down -2.28%, JBLU -2.37%, LUV -0.91%, and AAL closed down -2.10%.\n\n* In an unexpected move, INTC released their earnings early before the market closed and the stock traded with strength to close the day up 6.46% to $62.46. After digesting the numbers, shares retreated in AH to a current -2% to around $61. INTC reports Q4 EPS of $1.52 while consensus was $1.10 (hence the pump minutes before close) and they also projected Q1 EPS of $1.10 while consensus is at $0.93. The blue-chip semiconductor company is also upping its quarterly cash dividend by 5% (boomers love their dividend). The sector performed well today with AMD up 3% and NVDA up 3.75%.\n\n* IBM took a heavy beating, with AH currently at -6.4% to $123 as the large IT company reports fell short of the street's expectation. While adjusted Q4 EPS was $2.07 beating the consensus of $1.79, revenue was $20.37 bil vs $20.67 expected. Especially troubling was IBM's cloud segment, producing 6.84 bil instead of the consensus of 7.18 bil.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land BB traded red for most of the day but edged out a flat close to 0.47% to $12.85 (though it is retreating again in AH as of writing at -1.87%). ICLN closed up 4.41% to $32.66, filling the gap from last Friday's sell-off. Meanwhile, MT continues being pressured and closed the day at -1.49% to $23.\n\n* More notable ER movers: STX reported ER and while numbers were decent, shares are retreating AH to -4.83%. WDC follows suit AH to -2.45%. TAL, the Chinese after school online learning platform, rocketed up 15% for the day after reporting a strong quarter. Shares of other Chinese ADRs in the sector also performed strongly with GSX (a Citron short) up 11.62% and EDU up 6.95% for the day.\n\n* The DOW closed down 0.04% or -12 pts, Nasdaq up 0.55% or 73 pts, SPX up 0.03% or 1 pt (look at all those gains), and RUT close down -0.89% or -19 pts.\n\n* Notable numbers tomorrow: PMI at 9:45 AM ET with existing home sales soon to follow at 10 AM ET.\n\n(Yesterday's recap: none. got busy enjoying AMZN scalp gains.

        "selftext": "So I\u2019m not sure to flair this as DD or discussion as I\u2019m not sure myself, first time posting here.\n\nI know this stock hasn\u2019t been talked about for some time here, but I\u2019d like to know your opinions.\n\nAtm I might be drunk so definitely ask for clarification. Shoot it down ifI\u2019m stupid, I\u2019m ok with that. Failure is part of the learning process.\n\nAt the moment it\u2019s pretty clear that the ARM deal, as the P/E of 115 would suggest, probably in a relatively rational market is one of the few things that would justify its current value. \n\nAnd as some of us would know from a few months ago, this deal can\u2019t go through without the approval of the Chinese and Europeans, the biggest being of course the Chinese.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know why the takeover is a big deal: ARM is a British company who controls the biggest share of patents on IP cores: \u201ca reusable unit of logic, cell or integrated circuit layout design\u201d acoording to Wikipedia, so they\u2019re makig their revenue by selling their patented chip designs, thus being integral to a huge part of the semiconductor industry. \n\nWhat people fear is that this would mean a near-monopoly in this semi-conductor industry by Nvidia: e.g. ARM delivers around 90% of the smartphone chips. Given the fact that Nvidia is trying to grow in the data centre and AI development sectors, ARM is pivotal in this. It would be like getting a scientist in Civilization V: a huge boost in comparison to their competitors, of which INTL consistently underperforms and AMD is still not yet on the level if it comes to GPU\u2019s.\n\n\nGiven the fact this would give Nvidia a lot of power in China: ARM has a joint venture in China and being a US company they might not trust this deal carries a big risk. Even though Softbank, ARM and Nvidia were confident that this deal would go through the 18-month paperwork that is this takeover, but since Jack Ma has been gone missing, things might look different.\n\nI\u2019ve seen people here saying it\u2019s the CCP being butthurt, but I\u2019ve got a different view of it, and I thought it was the Washington Post that thought the same: the CCP wakes up to the danger that the big tech and data companies provide as they present a enormous threat to their power. Being dependent on Western technology and Biden still willing to continue the hard line (albeit in a more subtle way) of Trump towards China the stance towards US companies doesn\u2019t change. The stance of the CCP towards tech companies in general might. And thus the initially already unsure deal becomes even more unsure, as the Brits fear that the takeover will lose jobs and knowledge in their country. \n\nI\u2019d like to hear your thoughts on this: how has the Jack Ma incident changed the CCP\u2019s stance on technology? And how does it affect the Western companies? There might still change a lot in the temaining 15 months but I myself do expect a harder line towards Western tech companies in China. I\u2019d love to hear your arguments against and for.\n\nBull case: I\u2019d say they\u2019re leading in some very potential big industries and they are very able to convert that lead: the competition is still far away. With ARM they will consolidate this.\n\nBear case: When looking at the P/E it\u2019s overvalued and potential upside is priced in and it seems that due to the wait of the approval the stock atm is going sideways, and there might be resistance against the deal. I\u2019ve not mentioned it earlier but also the Europeans don\u2019t seem too happy with this, not to mention China which I did mention.\n\nI hope you\u2019ve become any wiser of this, questions or sources do ask.\n\nFor those who ask positions I\u2019ve been owning 2 shares since June/July bc I\u2019m poor.",

        "selftext": "Don\u2019t call me crazy yet, let me explain.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been on this subreddit or know anything about meme stocks, you know about the stocks that have skyrocketed recently. GME, AMD, PLTR, AAPL, TSLA, NVIDIA, CRSR, etc. \n\nThere is a stock that almost all the big tech companies, EV companies, and meme stocks had in common. TSM\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing) makes computer chips. You definitely own at least one TSM chip, whether you know it or not. \n\nHere is a list of a few of the companies that manufacture their chips with TSMC: (from [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20leading%20fabless%20semiconductor%20companies%20such,such%20as%20Allwinner%20Technology%2C%20HiSilicon%2C%20Spectra7%2C%20and%20Spreadtrum.))\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD), Apple Inc., Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx,  Altera,Texas Instruments. \n\nIt would take me years to research every single product that TSMC manufactures, but here are a few of the most significant ones that I found:\n\n\nAMD:All AMD chips are manufactured by TSM any reason to buy AMD is also a reason to buyTSM \n   AMD CPU\u2019s: This also includes AMD Ryzen Processors which are the most bought CPUS on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189) As well as the processors that go into many laptops. \n   AMD Graphics Cards: Apple uses AMD Graphics card in their Mac products. They are also in many windows PC\u2019s and laptops, and they are used by miners. \n   Xbox/PlayStation Internals: The PS5 and Xbox Series both use AMD CPU\u2019s and Graphics, which are manufactured by TSM. \n\nApple: Apple manufactures All of its processors at TSM. TSM made chips are in every iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, Air Pod, etc. the new M1 Apple in house silicon Macs are also made by TSM. \n\nNvidia: Nvidia is the world largest GPU company. They also make self driving processors for Tesla, Nio and other companies. \n\nQualcomm: Qualcomm makes Arm processors. Qualcomm processors power everything from Samsung phones to smart TV\u2019s to Amazon Alexa. \n\nXilinx: they make most of the 5G processors that go in towers and phones. Samsung Phones use Xilix cellular chips. \n\nTexas Instruments: they make your fucking calculator. \n\nThere are many many more companies that TSM manufactures chips for. They are also on a more advanced process mode than any other company in the world. Do some of your own research and find out what other products TSM makes. \n\nSee how many products in your life are powered by TSM. \n\nChances are, A TSM manufactured chip could be inside your phone, your computer, your TV, your smart speaker and other smart home devices, your wifi router, your cars radio/gps, your cars self driving system (if your car has it). Your wireless headphones, the cell tower in your neighborhood. Even your calculator.\n\nThe \u201ccloud\u201d is also powered by TSM. The servers that google, Amazon, one drive, Spotify, Palantir, etc. \n\nIf you can find just one area of technology that does not, at some point, use TSM manufacturing, comment it below. \n\nIf you can\u2019t then buy some fucking shares. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

Bullish on these tickers but given the number of positions in the portfolio I only have a cursory understanding of those businesses so I'm trying to trim the number of stocks I own - going for quality over quantity.

Looking for suggestions on what should go and feel free to suggest other positions not on this list that may be better than some of the positions I already have for long term growth.

        "selftext": "Just a little back story to meet the minimum legnth to post. Skip to the next paragraph if you don't care. I started trading in June 2020, after a few months I tried options, and made $3000 on AMD calls. Cool, first one really is free. I then made a string of failed TSMC and Nvidia calls, so I basically lost that three grand. Late September I was about 2k profit with more AMD calls, and then the day before I was going to close, Trump got Covid abd everyone lost their minds. Most recently I have some success with QCOM calls, and brought in about $3000. Could have been about 6k but I played it safe and pulled out too early.\n \n\n//\n\n\nAnyway, riding high on that small success, I decided I would give puts a try. I saw that Intel had an earnings call today, and in the last 2 quarters, their stock dropped about 10% immediately after. So the share price was around 58 and I wanted to be safe so I bought 10 \u00d7 01/22 $57 Put at about 100 each. Throughout the day as I saw that they were losing value, so I kept averaging down. I ended up with 72 puts, which were left worth $16 at close. I was hoping so hard that people would react the same way as they did to Intel's previous 2 earnings reports, but they sure did not. I also was justifying putting so much in because surely everyone was just buying the rumor/hype for earnings, and then the would see the news. It's not looking like it. Unless INTC drops about $5 before 4 pm tomorrow, I just wasted almost $4K. I don't think I will ever graduate from Small Street Bets... the closest I've got was about 14k. If/WHEN these puts expire worthless, I'm sitting at about 4k, and that is only because they are shares.\n\n\n//\n\n\nTLDR: I'm a retarded. Thanks.",

IDEX just acquired 100% of privately held Timios Holdings Corp. in an all-cash deal. Timios currently has 285 employees and operations in 44 states and has booked over $60 million in YTD revenues, including over $8 million in October 2020. Ideanomics increased its stake in California-based Solectrac. With this investment in Solectrac, Ideanomics expands its global footprint in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, specifically in the category of specialty commercial vehicles. We see IDEX taking one or more of its EV divisions public via IPO or SPAC. This makes a lot of sense as there are two divisions \u2013 electric vehicles and fintech.

        "selftext": "Bottom line up front: assuming the deal goes through at the stated timeline and price point, and using conservative estimates of both companies' growth trajectories, AMD will be trading at no less than $150/share by spring 2023, representing 24% gain per year for 2.5 years, using the January 7 closing price of $95.16. If its price multiples increase to fall within the range of NVDA, QCOM, QRVO, upside is $300 to $450 per share by mid-2023 (or higher, if you want to use a more aggressive growth trajectory). \n\n \\-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are two assumptions in play that are by no means a done deal that are serving as the basis for my calculations. They are:\u00a0\n\n1) They will complete the deal as planned by the end of 2021, meaning they will meet unspecified pre-conditions and receive regulator approval  \n2) The all-stock purchase will be completed for the stated price of $35 billion.\u00a0\n\nIf those assumptions hold true, then the following is also true:\u00a0\n\nThe current fair market value for AMD stock, if XLNX's current market cap and outstanding shares are folded into the mix, is $100.96/share, based on today's XLNX price, or $101.14 based on the year-end $35 billion purchase price. The latter represents a 6.33% increase over the 7 January 2021 AMD closing price of $95.16/share. This is only based on up-to-date market cap figures and most-recent-quarter earnings figures, which are a good three months out of date at this point.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, in the press releases and earnings calls where the CEOs discussed the merger, one of the points that came out was that the companies have a lot of overlap when it comes to their business operations and R&amp;D. Within 18 months of the merger, or late spring 2023, that means they will be able to [cut $300 million in annual expenses](https://www.crn.com/slide-shows/components-peripherals/the-35b-amd-xilinx-acquisition-7-big-things-to-know/2), simply through synergy of eliminating functional overlap. Given the following from the most recent quarterly reports, covering 3 months of operations ending 26 Sep 2020:\u00a0\n\n1) XLNX net earnings were $193.8m, or $775.2m annualized  \n2) AMD net earnings were $390m, or $1.56b annualized  \n3) Combined earnings are $2.33b\n\nThat means that net earnings will be increased by 13%, just in cutting overlapping expenses. That means that, assuming today's earnings and today's share prices, and combining the financials of both companies, the fair market value for AMD as of early- to mid-2023 is $114, based on annualized earnings numbers that are already three months old.\u00a0\n\nUsing conservative extrapolation of recent growth trajectories, and using today's price multiples\\*, it's conservative to estimate that AMD will be trading for $150/share by June 2023. Based on the current share price of 95.12, that's an annualized growth of 23.96%.\u00a0\n\n\\*If for whatever reason there's a market downturn in this time, AMD's performance could live up to these numbers, but the price multiples could decrease. This represents nearly all remaining risk of inaccuracy, outside the stated assumptions.\n\nPlease fire away at this. Poke your holes and make your arguments. I'm getting ready to heavily shift my portfolio's center of gravity into AMD based on all this, so if any of you know a good reason not to, I'd love to hear it.",

        "selftext": "**EV &amp; Auto Tech Pie**\n\n[https://prnt.sc/xcy5px](https://prnt.sc/xcy5px)\n\nI searched long and hard for a suitable ETF and while a few keep getting mentioned like CRIV and iDRV I couldn't access these on the platforms I use. So I came up with this selection, which ranges from popular EV manufacturers like Tesla and Nio to battery and component stocks. They've performed very well individually and the great thing about this pie is that I can re-adjust the weightings when needed. Currently Tesla and Plug Power are very prominent due to current growth but it won't last forever and then I will be moving more into the component space (e.g. batteries and lithium)\n\n**5G, Semiconductors &amp; Microchips Pie**\n\n[https://prnt.sc/xcy8h4](https://prnt.sc/xcy8h4)\n\nI follow Fool.com who were heavily promoting 5G stocks but I didn't want to pay for the subscription. I did my own research and this is a collection of stocks I have been investing in for around 1 year and they've all seen excellent growth. This is the pie that I'm most confident about long-term. With the exception of AMD and Nvidia Who are fairly well-known, many of these of stocks aren't known very well in terms of the brand names involved but they play a significant role in our lives and I expect will play an even greater role in the years to come. I'll be updating this soon with a couple of additional stocks that I've been tracking.\n\nYou'll notice a pattern as many of the companies feature across pies, especially in the semiconductor/chip space. The ones below are more speculative based on my research. I don't have as much experience investing in these sectors but I feel they have great potential and would really like to get feedback on these:\n\n**Hydrogen &amp; Fuel Cell Energy Pie**\n\n[https://prnt.sc/xa4nmv](https://prnt.sc/xa4nmv)\n\nThis one is linked to my EV pie but with more of a broader focus on energy solution suppliers working in the Hydrogen space.\n\n**Uranium Mining &amp; Energy Pie**\n\n[https://prnt.sc/xa4lsr](https://prnt.sc/xa4lsr)\n\nMany of these stocks are near an all time low given uranium/nuclear power's lack of popularity historically, but times are changing and demand for uranium and nuclear is growing so I can only see this going up in the years to come.\n\n**Crypto, e-Payment Platforms &amp; Blockchain Pie**\n\n[https://prnt.sc/xa4me0](https://prnt.sc/xa4me0)\n\nMany of the players here are well know and are getting on board with crypto in a big way, e.g. Visa, PayPal, DocuSign, etc. Others provide the chips and hardware to make bitcoin/crypto mining possible, e.g. AMD and Nvidia. Then I've included some of the companies actually involved in the bitcoin mining. I know less about these companies so have given them a lower weighting.",

FuboTv keeps on crumbling while NIO posts great sales numbers, let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of the last trading day of 2020, as we saw both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/bHgX2sf) and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/D471c7X) finish up over 0.60% and finishing at record highs, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vzGgSBb)  finished barely up for the day, gaining .14%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/2YrvMpT) finishing just down for the day, but it\u2019s still up from a [week](https://ibb.co/LxdGJ8c) ago, as the volatility still remains way above the [levels](https://ibb.co/XbWkzW4) before March when it rose to over 80.\n\nWe just about saw a positive ratio of companies [advancing](https://ibb.co/5TwrM2m) to close out the year as the volume was belove average with just 100 new highs, as we saw 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yyrTGGP) finishing in the green with Utilities, Financials, Real Estate &amp; Health Care gaining more than 1% while Energy was the only sector to finish the day with a loss.  \nWe also saw most factor groups [finishing](https://ibb.co/dmvNJgL) the day in the red with only Large-Cap Value companies posting a gain of .3%, as you can see in Thursday\u2019s [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/wBGr7cR) with gains all around the board, while losses were concentrated in the Biotech and Oil &amp; Gas industry.\n\nHere is the weekly [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/zQWD12B) with names like Alibaba, Shopify, Palantir, Square and Zoom being some of the biggest losers, while TESLA continued to push higher as Tesla finished the month of [December](https://ibb.co/ZX09X8Z) with a gain of more than 20% as you can see here, while many of the other big tech names also had a strong month, with most of the losses being concentrated in the communication sector and of course Alibaba which was hit by a lot of negative news.\n\nWe also [finished](https://ibb.co/r5JRk5b) the year with most sectors in the green as you can see here, led by Technology, Consumer Cyclicals and Communications. But gains were had in most other sectors as well, except the Financial, Travel and Energy sectors, which finished the year down.\n\nThe biggest [losers](https://ibb.co/nDgRs1S) in the SP500 which finished the year up more than 16% were by far stocks like Carnival, OXY, Norwegian Cruise Line, United Airlines and many more others. The Nasdaq 100 wasn\u2019t safe either despite jumping almost 50% in 2020, having the best gains in 11years, with companies like Walgreens, Fox and Intel posting losses of over 17%, while the Dow was the laggard finishing just over 7% up for the year as Boeing, Chevron and Intel dragged the index lower.\n\nWe also saw huge [winners](https://ibb.co/n7yP7cM)  in 2020, as the SP500 was led higher by stocks like Apple, Nvidia, PayPal, Amazon and many others that posted huge gains. While the Nasdaq 100 jumped to record highs lead by Tesla which posted an incredible year with other stocks like Moderna, Peloton &amp; Zoom also rising by more than 300%. The Dow also had big winners but still lagged as the biggest gainers here were the tech giants Apple &amp; Microsoft joined by some other stocks like Nike, Disney &amp; Salesforce.\n\nWe also got some economic data since Thursday as Macau\u2019s gaming [revenue](https://ibb.co/NWBrC3s) continued the slow recovery, but the visits in the travel dependent region were 20% higher in the Holiday period compared to the start of December, which may be another positive sign for the Macau Gambling business.\n\nMeanwhile we also received the latest jobless [numbers](https://ibb.co/Km8px8X), which dipped below 800K again, 19K less than last week and more than 40K less than expected, as the continuing jobless claims also fell to just over 5.2M more than 100K better than expected and the previous [report](https://ibb.co/gJLQYPB).\n\nWhile this [week](https://ibb.co/mDnXFZY) we start to receive important economic data that alongside the results of the Georgia runoff election might push the market either to more gains, or if the results and data don\u2019t show up as investors &amp; analysts expected it, we might see an increase in volatility again which will lead to a market pullback or correction, which in my opinion would be a good time to go out and find deals to buy again.\n\nWe also really don\u2019t get any significant [earnings](https://ibb.co/60QM77h) releases this week, with most of the interesting ones like Micron, Walgreens &amp; Bed Bath &amp; Beyond coming on Thursday.\n\nSo, in some other stock market news, Tesla topped [expectations](https://ibb.co/g9048Ry) of 163K deliveries in Q4 again but did finish just shy of the 500K mark. The company delivered more than 180K vehicle in the last quarter, as we saw [Tesla](https://ibb.co/th7Hhnc)  pricing the model Y at just over $50.000 in China and are expecting to start deliveries this month as they keep expanding their sales in the world\u2019s biggest car market, as they are targeting to make this their biggest market surpassing the US. Tesla closed over 700$ for the first time and if you want to see my opinion on this stock, check out my prediction on Tesla [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kci399/my_tesla_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/).\n\nSome other EV makers from China also posted sales numbers with [Li Auto](https://ibb.co/LYCSs1N) increasing deliveries five-fold year/year with a 32% increase month/month in December, while [XPENG](https://ibb.co/Zc7FSQC) also announced record delivery numbers up 35% month/month and more than 300% year/year for December. We also saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/4VWGX78) posting a monthly deliveries record of just over 7K, up over 120% year/year and finishing the year with over 43K deliveries, which were also up over 110% year/year, as they are also planning on revealing some new sedan models and their latest developments on self-driving and other technologies next week.\n\nMeanwhile we saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/dKh6kx0) take a ride after another short-seller released a statement, pointing out to the final lock-up period after the IPO, as a moment that will bring huge selling to this stock, despite the [company](https://ibb.co/YWksq6g) needing just over 4 years to reach the first million customers, less than 5 times the time it took companies like StateFarm, Geico and Allstate to reach their first million. I personally am an investor in this company, and I really like what they are doing, so I am not going to sell my shares anytime soon.\n\nGuys, personally I can\u2019t wait to see the sales numbers and how the services business is growing for [Apple](https://ibb.co/cx07jJs) as the top-of-the-line products keep having great demand, but we do have to see what happens in the US-China relations, as this could impact the Apple revenue stream, this after the New York Stock Exchange has [started](https://ibb.co/599nrxc) the process of delisting telecom giants from China. You can check out my prediction on Apple [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kmp7x1/apple_aapl_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/)\n\nWe also saw a [memo](https://ibb.co/qyBfzrq) from DELTA\u2019s CEO, as he expects the company to return to positive cashflow in the spring, as they are planning to start paying down debt as soon as that happens to reduce the burden the company has taken on since March 2020.\n\nMeanwhile [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/Dg5jZ6x) continues its sharp decline after a number of firms have started to short the stock pointing to insane valuations and outlook. Fubo plunged again almost 16% Thursday and is down almost 50% in the past week as the IPO lockup period expired, more than tripling the shares float.\n\nAnd on last piece of news that just came out is that [Roku](https://ibb.co/gM8Z4Bv) is looking to buy the content catalog from Quibi, this would give a boost to Roku\u2019s exclusive programming, as the stock has seen an immediate reaction and is up over 3.5% in pre-market trading.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/zf9tMYZ) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 leading the way to start off the year as we wait to receive the first economic [data](https://ibb.co/f24tRCS) this year in the early morning, while the global stock [markets](https://ibb.co/sjvZMrx) started on a positive note except Japan.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

FuboTv keeps on crumbling while NIO posts great sales numbers, let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of the last trading day of 2020, as we saw both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/bHgX2sf) and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/D471c7X) finish up over 0.60% and finishing at record highs, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vzGgSBb) finished barely up for the day, gaining .14%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/2YrvMpT) finishing just down for the day, but it\u2019s still up from a [week](https://ibb.co/LxdGJ8c) ago, as the volatility still remains way above the [levels](https://ibb.co/XbWkzW4) before March when it rose to over 80.\n\nWe just about saw a positive ratio of companies [advancing](https://ibb.co/5TwrM2m) to close out the year as the volume was belove average with just 100 new highs, as we saw 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yyrTGGP) finishing in the green with Utilities, Financials, Real Estate &amp; Health Care gaining more than 1% while Energy was the only sector to finish the day with a loss.  \nWe also saw most factor groups [finishing](https://ibb.co/dmvNJgL) the day in the red with only Large-Cap Value companies posting a gain of .3%, as you can see in Thursday\u2019s [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/wBGr7cR) with gains all around the board, while losses were concentrated in the Biotech and Oil &amp; Gas industry.\n\nHere is the weekly [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/zQWD12B) with names like Alibaba, Shopify, Palantir, Square and Zoom being some of the biggest losers, while TESLA continued to push higher as Tesla finished the month of [December](https://ibb.co/ZX09X8Z) with a gain of more than 20% as you can see here, while many of the other big tech names also had a strong month, with most of the losses being concentrated in the communication sector and of course Alibaba which was hit by a lot of negative news.\n\nWe also [finished](https://ibb.co/r5JRk5b) the year with most sectors in the green as you can see here, led by Technology, Consumer Cyclicals and Communications. But gains were had in most other sectors as well, except the Financial, Travel and Energy sectors, which finished the year down.\n\nThe biggest [losers](https://ibb.co/nDgRs1S) in the SP500 which finished the year up more than 16% were by far stocks like Carnival, OXY, Norwegian Cruise Line, United Airlines and many more others. The Nasdaq 100 wasn\u2019t safe either despite jumping almost 50% in 2020, having the best gains in 11years, with companies like Walgreens, Fox and Intel posting losses of over 17%, while the Dow was the laggard finishing just over 7% up for the year as Boeing, Chevron and Intel dragged the index lower.\n\nWe also saw huge [winners](https://ibb.co/n7yP7cM) in 2020, as the SP500 was led higher by stocks like Apple, Nvidia, PayPal, Amazon and many others that posted huge gains. While the Nasdaq 100 jumped to record highs lead by Tesla which posted an incredible year with other stocks like Moderna, Peloton &amp; Zoom also rising by more than 300%.

        "selftext": "**In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of AMD, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone! Let\u2019s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles &amp; PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.\n\nThe company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.\n\nSo, guys, let\u2019s go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.\n\nThe [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing &amp; Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn\u2019t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can\u2019t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.\n\nBoth of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing &amp; graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn\u2019t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation &amp; amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation.\n\nThey have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest &amp; tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.\n\nThe company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 &amp; Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.\n\nTheir product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel\u2019s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world\u2019s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.\n\nThey have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also [working](https://ibb.co/D9dDDYs) with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings &amp; Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.\n\nAMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future\n\nThe one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/N2YQFS9) , which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/QH8RTCN) has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would [create](https://ibb.co/qJM6Gn4) synergies. [They](https://ibb.co/PcNhH58) are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it\u2019s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.\n\nAMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they [expect](https://ibb.co/RpcwXYr) an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.\n\nI used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA.\n\nFor the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.\n\nSo, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach.\n\nIf we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.\n\nFor my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.\n\nI think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high [demand](https://ibb.co/vQFwyRd) the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage &amp; digital currency mining.\n\nFor their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.\n\nThis means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest &amp; other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax.\n\nI [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.\n\nSo, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.\n\nI like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168. \n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets\n\nI think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, [THIS](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40.\n\nSo HERE \\[ [1](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) / [2](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) / [3](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) / [PT](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) \\] is  the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nI think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more &amp; more chips that also keep advancing in technology.\n\nThe company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/NCtxnFq), with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once [Intel](https://ibb.co/pjHdVFQ) also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it\u2019s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years &amp; a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all.\n\nAMD hasn\u2019t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it\u2019s a psychological resistance rather.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it\u2019s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.\n\nOne last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their [shares](https://ibb.co/zZcxm95) held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.\n\nSo, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think [Lisa SU](https://ibb.co/X2nVGTF) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the [company](https://ibb.co/WtBf4yF) has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel\u2019s performance.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!
