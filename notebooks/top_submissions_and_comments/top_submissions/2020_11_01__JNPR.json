If not,\n\n**JIH:**\n\n* JIH has almost $350 million available. Proterra valued at $1.1 billion. JIH wants to acquire a company in the $1 billion+ range.\n* JIH team (4/5) all top-level Honeywell vets and over 14 current and previous Proterra employees all came from HW including current COO Josh Ensign (worked at HW for 11 years)\n* From Juniper website: Juniper focuses on companies within the industrials sector, such as those within aerospace and defense, automation, construction, and industrial technology, among others. Which fits the profile of Proterra. [https://www.juniperindustrial.com/](https://www.juniperindustrial.com/)\n* JIH team was an integral part of Goldman Sachs first SPAC: Vertiv Holding.

Proterra valued at $1.1 billion. QELL wants to acquire a company in the $1 billion+ range.\n*  cofounder and past CEO till 2019\uff0c Ryan Popple (still is Proterra executive director now) is a director on QELL. Since Proterra has been trying to go IPO thru a SPAC when Popple was still the CEO \n\nEither of these could get Proterra if they go public. Also heard Lucid motors is an option or either one. Which one would you guys go into?",

        "selftext": "Through my research these guys have one of the best spac management teams assembled within the Spac Universe.\n\n4 out 5 individuals of the management team consist of the Executive team of Honeywell from last 20 years who brought Honeywell from an old laggard business to a thriving company which just re-entered the Dow a month ago.  The management team consists of the CEO of Honeywell from 2002-2017 and another CEO from Pittway an aquistion who was the CEO of Honeywells automation business (2000-2017) building $84 Billion in Shareholder value in his division alone.\n\nDave Cote - 80 aquistions under his belt.\nRoger Fradin - 60 aquistions\nBrian Cook - 60 buy-and-sell side transactions\nMark Levy - 10 aquistions\n\nAfter leaving Honeywell in 2017/18 a couple of these guys  launched another Spac from GS Aquistion Corp now IPO'd last year called Vertiv.  They are taking what they learned for their own now.\n\nThese guys now have come together for another venture in for something similar to Honeywell.  They are targeting to create or buy an Industrial company in Aerospace, Oil &amp; Gas, or Automation Solutions.\n\nThey have raised approx. $345M and are targeting something around $1-2 Billion.\n\nThey launched the Spac in September 2019 and have until September 2021 to aquire a target.\n\nIve made a video talking about it more in depth for those interested.  In my opinion, would be a great company to speculativily buy waiting for their aquistion announcement.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/brGZS9Mm0SE",
