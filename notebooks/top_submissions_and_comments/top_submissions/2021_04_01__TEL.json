        "selftext": "Procter &amp; Gamble\n\n\u201cThe commodity cost challenges we face this year will, obviously, be larger next fiscal year. We will offset a portion of this impact with price increases. Our Baby Care, Feminine Care, and Adult Incontinence businesses have announced price increases in the United States that would go into effect in mid-September. The exact timing and amount of increases vary by brand and sub-brand in the range of mid-to-high single digits.\u201d\n\nHoneywell\n\n\u201cAnd for us, inflation is taking hold. There is no doubt about it. We knew it. We see it, it's real. And if you don't stay on top of it, the two areas where -- and this is not a surprise. Steel, semiconductors, copper, ethylene, those are the four elements that we saw substantial inflation in Q1\u2026. I don't think things are going to abate. The short cycle is definitely hard. We all read the same articles around semiconductors and what's going on there. And I think we're going to have to just stay ahead of it. But we do expect that inflationary environment this year and we're going to be to stay ahead of it.\u201d\n\nKimberly Clark\n\n\u201cI'd like to start the call today with a few brief remarks. Our first quarter results and outlook have been impacted by supply chain disruption, faster-than-expected consumer tissue de-stocking, and a sharp rise in input costs. While I'm not pleased with the results and our outlook, we're taking decisive actions to manage through the short-term challenges we face.\u201d\n\nCoca-Cola\n\n\u201c\u2026 we're closely monitoring upward pressure in some inputs, such as high fructose corn syrup, PET, metals and other packaging materials as they impact us, as well as our bottling partners.\u201d\n\nPepsiCo\n\n\u201cIn terms of '21, there is certainly higher input inflation, but it's been factored into the '21 guidance, notably in terms of agricultural and packaging. In addition to that, we have also factored in the higher freight and transportation costs that we're experiencing out there right now.\u201d\n\nNestle\n\n\u201cI would like to caution against excessive margin growth expectations based on these strong sales growth. We now see broad-based inflation across our various commodities, packaging materials and transportation costs. Not all of these items can be hedged and our hedging cover for a number of commodities will run out over time. We are raising prices where appropriate, but usually there is a time lag associated with pricing.\u201d\n\nDanone\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to inflation, you're absolutely right to say that we have seen an accelerating inflation since the start of the year, which is impacting us, I would say, across the different ingredients, which is on milk, but also other dairy ingredients, on plastics, on sugar, but also, as I said, on logistics and transport. And we are reaching now a very strong mid-single digit level when it comes to inflation.\u201d\n\nBoston Beer\n\n\u201cOn the freight, clearly, this is -- there's a factor that you probably have heard that on other calls in the industry. There's a real shortage of drivers and of trucks. So the ratio between available trucks and loads have significantly worsened. And that's what we see in the rate. To the point that we've broken it out really in the earnings release separately because the impact is significant. And it really depends, right. We have contracted rates, but then you don't get the truck and you have to go deeper into it. So we've seen the impact on multiple levels. One is the input costs are going up \u2026it's coming into are our cost and materials and that's ingredients, the packaging materials. So we see it there.\u201d\n\nCelanese\n\n\u201cI mean, we're certainly feeling the inflationary factor. I think, the good news is, we anticipated this coming back in fourth quarter of last year already and started moving prices in engineered materials to reflect this, and of course, that price ultimately still gets reflected more quickly. So although it is an inflationary pressure, we've been able to push that through in our pricing and basically maintain the same level of variable margin.\u201d\n\nCrown Holdings\n\n\u201c\u2026we thought it would be well to remind you that delivered aluminum in North America sits around $1.28 a pound versus $0.75 a pound last year at this time. So an increase of 70% and as we contractually pass through the LME and the delivery premium reported revenues will reflect both volume increases and the higher aluminum cost this year.\u201d\n\nSteel Dynamics\n\n\u201cDespite record first quarter 2021 shipments for our steel fabrication segment, first quarter operating income was $10 million compared to sequential fourth quarter earnings of $25 million. Lower earnings were the result of metal spread compression as higher average selling values were offset by significantly higher steel input costs.\u201d\n\nMattel\n\n\u201cWe're not going to talk about specific pricing actions or timing. But we are evaluating price adjustments for the recent increases in input costs and I would also want to point out that despite the cost inflation we're it seeing and the impact it's having on gross margin.\u201d\n\nWhirlpool\n\n\u201cSo while the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, we are confident that sustained strong consumer demand and our previously announced cost-based pricing actions will offset the impact of global supply constraints and rising input costs.\u201d\n\nSnap-On\n\n\u201cLook -- yes, well, look, we've got material inflation in these numbers. We can't see them, can you? Right. And so part of the thing is you got -- you kind of got an interesting cocktail of reduced travel, controlled costs, material inflation floating through this. And the general managers in our businesses are balancing all these, like balls in the air. And so yes, we might see some, but we're not -- at the same time, we can also price. And I think the tools group has got another price increase going out. They just announced in April, early April, they announced the price increase, so they're going to have one coming up.\u201d\n\nGATX Corporation\n\n\u201c\u2026we buy cars both on the spot market and through our supply agreements that the majority of which is through the supply agreements. So certainly, the increased price of steel is increasing the cost of a car across the board.\u201d\n\nDover Corporation\n\n\u201cI get it that the Fed doesn't want to recognize inflation, but there is inflation and it's not just a raw materials because raw materials are in the subcomponents that we buy from our vendors who are trying to pass along the same kind of price increases that goes into our bill of materials and everything else. And clearly at the assembly level on labor availability is becoming a problem and that is beginning to start to move up labor costs over time. So, it's now gone from, it's a capital good size that are buying a lot of raw materials now it's moving into the assembled components portions of the business that is going to have to accommodate that over the balance of the year. On top of that, as I mentioned before, logistics costs we ship a lot of product that's FOB, so we're not, it's more inbound logistics costs then it is outbound logistics costs. But freight costs are going up because you're going to add. I mean, God forbid, you have to air freight anything right now. It's a bit of a negative.\n\nSonoco\n\n\u201cOur Industrial segment was hit the hardest with price/cost challenges, due to the higher OCC costs internationally as well as higher-than-expected inflation and operating costs like energy and freight.\u201d\n\nTE Connectivity\n\n\u201cCertainly, we're feeling the biggest inflation right now is on the freight side. The freight inflation has been significant and as we battle through there and there's a variety of reasons for that, including higher air freights and so forth in terms of that and that's not unique to TE. Certainly, I think that's been -- is well publicized across the overall supply chain. We are -- as we move towards the second half of the year, we are seeing a little bit higher input costs, particularly with the resins and some of that pretty directly attributable to the weather issues that were in Texas here earlier this past quarter. And then, the copper prices as we've continued to monitor those, we've seen those creep up. In some cases, we have hedges in place in terms of how we hedge our metals cost.\u201d\n\nBadger Meter\n\n\u201cI mean even Just in the first quarter, we saw the input cost go from $3.60 to today $4.20 and that's after March having been a relatively favorable change that obviously has been erased here in the month of April. So I think it's what we've been saying all along in terms of the continued price focus and the opportunity and the market acceptance of being able to pass some of those increases through in today's dynamics and in today's environment. We're going to continue to do that, and we're going to do that to a degree that we're able to -- we believe we'll be able to offset the majority of the cost pressures. And I don't see that changing dramatically as we move forward.\u201d",

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. I also currently hold shares in PLTR; no options whatsoever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What is Palantir?\"\n\n \"At Palantir, we build software that lets organizations integrate their data, their decisions, and their operations into one platform. Our software empowers entire organizations to answer complex questions quickly by bringing the right data to the people who\u00a0need\u00a0it. \" - per [palantir.com](https://palantir.com)\n\nPalantir, in simple terms, collects and analyzed data used for problem-solving and creates and implements cybersecurity solutions to protect institutions. Oh, and they've also been contracted with the US Department of Defense for quite some time now\n\n[https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/israel-linked-cia-funded-palantir-goes-public-making-espionage-mainstream-40230](https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/israel-linked-cia-funded-palantir-goes-public-making-espionage-mainstream-40230)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Palantir seems to be involved in too many sectors. They need to pick a niche and stick with it\"\n\nThat is the most common bear argument that I have heard amongst various investment subreddits. I'm here to explain why that is not the case, and, in fact, only serves to strengthen the argument for Palantir.\n\nPalantir's roots in espionage are a huge factor to consider. Think about how paranoid people are about their phone \"always listening to them\". Think about Snowden and the NSA's surveillance. This is the level of tech that we are talking about here. \n\nThis company isn't something like Google AdSense. This is some next-level shit. We're talking about statistical data analytics, unlike anything you have ever seen.\n\nUnsure what I mean by that? Think of Palantir like this-\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/?sh=319eba526668](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/?sh=319eba526668)\n\nTLDR- Target hired a statistician to help create a customer-suited coupon campaign using statistics to see where each customer was traveling in the aisles, and what they were buying. After his daughter was sent various coupons for new or expecting mothers, the girl's father expressed his distaste for Target, thinking they were attempting to coax her into teen pregnancy. As it turns out, his daughter was ACTUALLY PREGNANT and didn't tell her father.\n\nThat is the power of statistical data analytics right there.\n\nPalantir is not \"involved in too many sectors\". They have the potential to provide a helpful service to all of these sectors and are not closing the door to expansion.\n\n\"How are they going to be involved in all of these sectors?\" you may ask\n\nAcquisition and buyouts of Israeli tech startups.\n\nIsreal is quickly becoming the world leader in cyber security, tech development, fintech, and data analytics.\n\nWatch this video- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca-C3voZwpM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca-C3voZwpM)\n\nPalantir has ties with Isreal from back in its old CIA days. On top of the fact that many potential partners (Google, Facebook, Apple to name a few) already have established entities in Tel Aviv.\n\nIsreal will become crucial in the cybersecurity space for years to come.\n\nI recommend watching this documentary to further gain knowledge on the type of people that we're dealing with here-\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5h8GfxIWVY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5h8GfxIWVY)\n\n\"So, what does this mean for Palantir?\"\n\nI believe that the price targets put on Palantir are only scratching the surface for what this company is capable of. Because of their enormous potential in data analytics, I believe that almost any industry will be able to benefit from Palantir's technology. Take a look at their website and look at all of the sectors and plans for each, and you'll begin to understand that in order to make this happen, they will have to expand massively.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Long Palantir. Will expand. Innovative Israeli technology will cause Palantir to become tech giant for many years to come.\n\nBullish Palantir (for long, not for calls as the stock is very unpredictable but the company is great)\n\nBullish Israeli innovative technology\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther Tickers I recommend looking into-\n\nMVIS, BB, SNPR, ACEV, SENS, AONE, TSEM, RWLK, SPCB, NSPR",

        "selftext": " THIS IS PURE SPECULATION !\n\nTicker : COOL\n\nWarrants : COOLW\n\nTrust Size : 400 Million\n\nIPO Date: 12/17/2020\n\nTwo Sister Spacs registered March 29, 2021\n\nCorner Growth Acquisition 2, Applied Tickers (TRONU, TRON, TRONW)\n\n[http://archive.fast-edgar.com/20210330/ATB2C22C8Z22UJZ222992ZZZ9TVAH2S2X232/](http://archive.fast-edgar.com/20210330/ATB2C22C8Z22UJZ222992ZZZ9TVAH2S2X232/)\n\nCorner Growth Acqusition 3, Applied Tickers (RADDU, RADD, RADDW)\n\n[http://archive.fast-edgar.com/20210330/ATBEC22C8Z22UJZ2229A2ZZZ9TVAZ2S2X232/](http://archive.fast-edgar.com/20210330/ATBEC22C8Z22UJZ2229A2ZZZ9TVAZ2S2X232/)\n\n* Notice a specific theme with the tickers. COOL, RADD, And TRON implies that these guys will attempt to land exciting and possible meme-able Tech targets. This may also result in a disappointment if they land a boring and non exciting target. 3rd Spac RADDU Spac size is in ballpark of the 1st sister Spac COOL as well which may point to COOL being in close talks with a target already.\n* COOL is headquartered in Palo Alto California but has offices and connections in California, New York , Tel Aviv Israel , and Toyko Japan. COOL management is essentially DAG Ventures/Corner Ventures. These guys have been finding and investing in cutting edge tech companies for over 15 years. They have invested in almost 200 companies, and helped bring 30 companies public via IPO. See the excerpt below and click the link at the bottom of it, to see a list of select investments, select prior investments, and the team members. Select investments listed include companies like Fabric, BeeWise, [Healthy.IO](https://healthy.io/), LawGeex, and Nexar to name a few.\n\n**About Corner Ventures**\n\nCorner Ventures invests in the next generation of iconic technology companies. Since our founding in 2004 as DAG Ventures, we\u2019ve partnered with top-tier early-stage venture firms and entrepreneurs to create exceptional outcomes. In 2018, DAG Ventures was rebranded Corner Ventures as the firm\u2019s next chapter to continue building upon our legacy as a trusted partner and resource to founders, seed and Series A investors, and world-class innovators by providing unique insights, strategic growth capital, and access to global investors and commercial networks. From our offices in Palo Alto, New York, Tel Aviv and Tokyo, we work closely with our partners, portfolio companies and their respective founders to help navigate the transition from promising start-up to category-defining leader. We have invested in over 180 companies, with over 145 exits, including 30 IPOs. [www.cornerventures.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cornerventures.com&amp;esheet=52381785&amp;newsitemid=20210218006075&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.cornerventures.com&amp;index=1&amp;md5=8dff87c59fda68a23b6589772f2945ca)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy I think COOL may be in close talks and ready to announce a DA or LOI sooner than later:\n\nCOOL IPO date was 4 months and 2 days ago, and they are coming up on the 2021 Spac Announcement avg of 4.6 months. See [u/ChiefHoobyOfficer](https://www.reddit.com/u/ChiefHoobyOfficer/) post here for explanation of the 4.6 month average here [https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/kql53b/according\\_to\\_spacinsider\\_of\\_the\\_2020\\_ipo\\_spacsthe/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/kql53b/according_to_spacinsider_of_the_2020_ipo_spacsthe/)\n\nCOOL's 3rd sister spac (RADDU) is of similar trust size to Cool. This being combined with the IPO to Announcement timeframe makes its rather likely they will release news about a deal sooner than later. I will also touch on the fact that in choosing a ticker like \"COOL\" they may have registered there Spac with a few potential cool targets in mind. The ticker name COOL kind of reminds me of a situation with Northern Trust Acquisition Corp's \"STIC\" ticker which turned out to be BarkBox. I will admit that Corner Growth's ticker is what peaked my interest to research on this Spacs management team in the first place. Please keep in mind all of this could mean absolutely nothing and COOL could still take forever or the fully allotted time to find a merger. Based on all of this i would consider COOL commons (under $10 right now) are low risk at a great price for a possible short term bump in the future. The warrants are cheap right now but tbh i have no idea how much further they could drop if no deal is announced soon. The warrants are under a dollar but that doesn't mean they cant fall to .75 or .50 or whatever if no deal is announced soon. So yes Commons are the much better play risk wise here.\n\nWhy I believe COOL is one of the Spacs that is or at least was in talks with PLUS.AI :\n\nI will admit i dont have much to go on here just some slight connections and whole lot of hopium ! [Plus.Ai](https://plus.ai/)\n\nwas first mention in rumors with CCAC back in Nov 2020, via this article which is behind a paywall [https://www.theinformation.com/articles/chinese-self-driving-startups-plus-and-hesai-considering-going-public](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/chinese-self-driving-startups-plus-and-hesai-considering-going-public)\n\nBut since then Plus.Ai has been rumored to be in talks with multiple Spacs ranging from a trust size of 300 to 500 Million. So COOL fits perfectly with a 400 Million trust. Also note at the time of first [PLUS.AI](https://plus.ai/)\n\nrumor article (in Nov) COOL was not public yet, so [PLUS.AI](https://plus.ai/) could have originally been in talks w CCAC and started up talks with COOL later. See this March 8, 2020 article [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sequoia-backed-driverless-truck-startup-071153653.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sequoia-backed-driverless-truck-startup-071153653.html)\n\nNot only does the trust size fit but Plus HQ is in Cupertino California, and COOL is located in Palo Alto California. These two cities are mere 15-20 minutes driving distance from each other. Close enough to have face to face meetings farily easily even in this Pandemic era. I find it hard to believe that COOL wouldn't have at least attempted to engage in talks with being with PLUS, just based off the fact PLUS is a \"cool\" local tech company looking to go publics via Spac. Now this is very speculative i will admit but its no a reach to assume just based off this alone COOL could be in talks with [Plus.AI](https://plus.ai/). \n\nBut then there is as well \" Founded by a group of Stanford University classmates in 2016 \". So i did some digging and yes [Plus.Ai](https://plus.ai/) is very closely linked to Stanford. Their company Executives and Founders is made of a significant amount of Stanford Alumni.\n\nDavid Liu, CEO and Founder of Plus, Stanford, PHD in Electrical Engineering\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-liu-b2a75b/#](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-liu-b2a75b/#)\n\nHao Zheng, CTO and Co-founder, Stanford, Electrical Engineering\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/haozheng/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haozheng/)\n\nWen Han, CFO, Stanford, MBA Business\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/wenhanstanford/#](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wenhanstanford/#)\n\nShawn Kerrigan, COO, Stanford, PHD in Engineering, PHD Minor in Cs\n\nAll these executives are Stanford Alumni, and that's just the start. The company is full of employees that attended Stanford from top to bottom all the way down interns. Now how does this connect to COOL ??? Well the Co-Founder and Co-Chair of COOL is none other than John Cadeddu. John Cadeddu is also Stanford Alumni and graduated with a MBA in Business, same as [Plus.AI](https://plus.ai/)'s CFO Wen Han. Although Wen Han did attend and graduate Stanford much, much later then John this does make it more likely of a possible communication and or relationship between the two. As well the CEO and Founder of [PLUS.AI](https://plus.ai/) seems to be in a similar age range to John, but i cannot confirm this to be sure. I just know they both look 50ish, and David Liu began his attendance at Standford 4 years after John Cadeddu. As you can imagine Alumni to a prestigious Ivy League school like Stanford are usually very active with ongoing of the University. As well as [PLUS.AI](https://plus.ai/) seems to be the brainchild of Stanford overall. What Spac manager would take more honor in bringing such a company public via Spac than John Cadeddu. These are all speculative reaches but im inclined to believe John Cadeddu is doing everything possible to bring [Plus.AI](https://plus.ai/) public via COOL. Given the fact that John Caddeddu has been investing in tech companies and bringing them public via IPO for over 15 years in the tech sector, i believe that [Plus.AI](https://plus.ai/) has always been on his radar, especially when considering the Stanford Alumni factor. What realistic potential tech target would be cooler than Plus.AI ??? And if you were [Plus.AI](https://plus.ai/) and the offers were totally equal which ticker would you rather have CCAC or COOL ???\n\nPlease DO NOT FOMO into COOL, i am just \"reaching\" and again this could mean absolutely nothing. Don't expect COOL to merge with PLUS, but do know there is a realistic possible chance imo, which just means i think they were least in talks or are still in talks.\n\nDisclosure : 20,000 COOL warrants\n\nPS: im really curious to see what target they will land for TRON, that is one awesome ticker symbol ! Maybe Apterra would fit ??\n\nPPS: I also see \"Fabric\" as a potential merger target as well for COOL as Corner Ventures in currently invested in Fabric. Micro fulfillment is really ramping up and catching some steam. Fabric seems like it maybe ready to public soon and it competes with the likes of RAAC's Berkshire Grey.\n\nDisclaimer : I am not Financial Advisor nor is this financial advice.",
