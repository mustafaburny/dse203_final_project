        "selftext": "## Daily Synopsis \n* The S&amp;P 500 increased +1.77% today while the NASDaq added (+1.73%). The Russell 2000 rose by (+2.84%). The Dow ended in positive territory at (+2.02%)\n* The best performing sector was Industrials(+2.95%) while Energy(-0.57%)was the worst performer.\n* The positive price action also contributed to continued selling in longer-dated Treasuries, which steepened the curve in a trade that benefited the financials sector. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 0.88% to close at its highest level since June 8. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.7% to 93.51. \n* In the tech space, PayPal (PYPL 179.81, -7.95, -4.2%) and Skyworks (SWKS 138.80, -3.32, -2.3%) were notable laggards despite exceeding earnings expectations. PayPal, however, did issue downside Q4 EPS guidance. Arista Networks (ANET 249.49, +33.37, +15.4%) surged 15% following its upbeat earnings results and guidance. \n* Interestingly, the S&amp;P 500 came within 12 points of its 50-day moving average (3400) shortly before the close. The catalyst that could propel the benchmark index above the key technical level is, of course, the election. As an aside, trading volume was comparable to previous sessions. \n* Looking ahead, investors will receive the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for October, the ADP Employment Change Report for October, the Trade Balance Report for September, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.  \n## Index Summary\n **S&amp;P 500 :** (+1.77%); **NasDaq :** (+1.73%); \\\n**Russell 2000 :** (+2.84%); **Dow :** (+2.02%); \\\n**Vix :** 37.13 (-4.26%); [+6.6%]; {+24.08%} \n## Sectors Summary \n_Three highest sectors for today were -_ \\\n**Industrials:** (+2.95%); **Financials:** (+2.22%); **Consumer Discretionary:** (+2.2%) \\\n_Three lowest sectors for today were -_\\\n **Energy:** (-0.57%); **Utilities:** (+1.44%); **Health Care:** (+1.46%) \n## Commodities/Futures \n(1-day %), [5-day %], {10-day %} \\\n_**Currency -**_ \\\n**USD Index :** 94.145 (-0.69%); [-0.51%]; {+0.8%}\\\n **BC :** 13790 (+0.69%); [+2.81%]; {+7.05%} \\\n_**Precious Metals -**_\\\n**Gold :** 1892.5 (+0.87%); [+2.33%]; {+0.37%}\\\n**Silver :** 24.033 (+0.9%); [+3.9%]; {-1.53%}\\\n _**Farming -**_ \\\n**Soybeans :** 1052.25 (+0.97%); [+1.02%]; {-1.96%}  \n**Corn :** 397.5 (+0.69%); [+0.44%]; {-4.53%} \\\n**Coffee :** 105.35 (+0.66%); [+1.39%]; {+0.43%} \\\n_**Industrials -**_ \\\n**Crude :** 36.81 (+2.8%); [+4.62%]; {-5.04%} \\\n**Nat Gas :** 3.244 (-5.73%); [-7.36%]; {+2.93%} \\\n**Copper :** 3.077 (+0.68%); [+1.51%]; {-0.88%} \n## Dark Pool Summary - \nHighest Dark Pool buys by rank -\n1.
