        "selftext": "Disclaimer: you really shouldn\u2019t do this, especially if you are not 95% sure the direction the stock will go within a short timeframe\n\nI discovered this completely by accident but on think or swim, if you create an OCO (on cancel order) order with very little price incriminates, multiple orders can get filled regardless of whether or not you actually have the money in you\u2019re account. You still need the money to cover the first order but in the event subsequent orders get filled before the system can cancel, the contracts are yours. For whatever reason, TD Ameritrade lets the trade play out despite the lack of funds which is somewhat impressive. One response I got was, you\u2019re a grown up, it\u2019s you\u2019re account. If things go wrong it\u2019s on you but if it works out, we won\u2019t take you\u2019re gains. \n\nFirst time \nI was trying to get rid of my spy call at open back in June. They were worth maybe $1200 according to the profit option calculator but I didn\u2019t know for sure so I set sell orders for $12, $12.05, $12.10, etc up to maybe $12.30. $12 got filled, but I guess $12.05 got filled also so I was now naked the call despite my account not being approved for it. I called them up crying, begging to get out the trade, sides like man calm down, you\u2019re up $50 on the trade, leg up or down to create a spread and you\u2019re guaranteed to win no matter what. \n\nSecond \nLam research a week before earnings. I had a good idea lam would beat but wasn\u2019t willing to bet my life on it. My account balance got wiped out maybe 95% and only shot up after lam beat and the stock rose long enough for me to unload down some poor kids throat at the high. \n\nThird time\nNvda this Friday. Nvda will hit $500 and maybe $520. I had Oco to get $500c exp sep 4 ($932 each) I got filled multiple times against my account value. Unloaded this morning for 100% gain.... Kinda hoping the stock drops so I can get back in. The dumbest thing I did was hedge by selling $520c friday instead of manning up and waiting until Monday.\n\n\nThis usually happens to me on accident. But let\u2019s say you are bullish and just know a stock will jump, theoretically you could max out you\u2019re buying power with a single order, and hope you\u2019re other orders get filled before the system can cancel them. \n\nIf you are wrong, god help you! You\u2019ll be on the hook for a lot of money.\n\nIn the screenshot below you can see I was negative $1000 account balance.\n[screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/7GXVwiM)",

        "selftext": "This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares.

        "selftext": "ONTO &gt; AMAT, here\u2019s why. ONTO has a technological edge with their equipment and are way under valued. They are taking at about 21 P/E right now, but as they build out their portfolio, they expect to earn over $5/sh with increased margins. So, a FPE of closer to 7. AMAT is a great company, but they are already built out. ONTO has that TAM SAM gap to fill in addition to eating market share and the growing industry. I wouldn't be shocked if AMAT or LRCX buys ONTO, frankly. It would make sense.\n\nThey have Advanced node and advanced packaging. As customers move toward 3nm 6th gen dual layer, they need Atlas III. And with pattern control software with machine learning, they provide an end to end solution. So if Intel or Western Digital want to survive in their competitive marketplaces, they need to have the best tools to print the wafers. They are a small company, but they are #1 or #2 in their core markets. They win because they have the best tools.",

        "selftext": "I am seeing a shit load of new treads discussing the following-\n\n1. Fastly vs NET\n2. Hold Fastly or let go?\n3. What does Fastly do? \n\nSo I will clear up a few myths just in case. \n\nFastly is a CDN provider, which allows their clients to host their website on Fastly's servers. Fastly's business model is catered towards large enterprises that are looking at fastest (thus the name!) cold start time, i.e. time it takes to load a webpage on mobile/PC. Here are a few of their clients-\n\n1. **Clients doing very well during Covid**\n\n* Reddit\n* Shopify\n* Wayfair\n* Pinterest\n* Twitter\n* Stripe\n* Overstock\n* Shazam\n* Wealthfront\n* Etsy\n* Tiktok\n\n2. **Clients doing not so well during Covid**\n\n* Airbnb\n* Jetblue\n* Trip Advisor\n* Alaska Air\n* Kayak\n* Yelp\n* Kayak,\n* and many more....\n\nNotice first that their clients that are booming right now are very likely to continue booming for the next year or so. Once we are done with Covid (that is if), revenues will switch to clients in hospitality business, which typically have a strong business during normal times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFastly's USP is fastest cold start time, i.e., it is the best CDN in the market which allows the visitors on their client's website to load the webpage/apps faster than anyone else in the market right now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why is this USP so important**\\--well there are a few reasons why Fastly will continue to have higher growth rate.  I have noted a few down below-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Apple rolls out 5g iPhone later this year. They will require webpages to load faster. Fastly is the best CDN there is to handle that request. This does not mean that Akamai or NET are sitting out catching honeybee, but really means that Fastly is positioned to serve that switch to 5g better than NET or Akamai IMO.\n2. Fastly's business model is unique. It charges their customers based on the bytes loaded, which translates to the amount of time people spend on their customers' website. Thus, while I am spending 5-10 mins to write this essay, Reddit is getting charged by Fastly (pun intended!). Notice that this is a different business model than NET. NET offers a free subscription to begin with and has lower CDN hosting rate for those willing to host on their servers. Therefore, organizations which do not feel that speed is of concern to them as much, prefer to use NET. On the flip side, Fastly has a niche set of customers who value speed, because user experience on their website is of utmost importance to them. Imagine if I had to spend several 100 microseconds for a webpage to open, I would be pissed and may not go on that website, purely because of that reason.\n3. YoY growth based on investor's copy was 62%, which is great if you ask me. As long as it is staying above 50, my money is parked there.\n4. Bergman and Josh raised guidance for this year, during a time when a lot of CFOs are holing on giving guidance. Also of importance is that these folks in the C suite like to give a conservative guidance and beat it. In other words, promise less and deliver more. This leaves no question that next earnings should be a beat but do not take my word on it because who knows what happens tomorrow.\n\n**Influence of Tiktok on Fastly's revenue**\n\nCertainly one of the most important question that needs to be addressed because Tiktok constitutes 12% of the revenues. With the stock dropping like a rock after ER and then earnier today after Donny decided to ban it after 45 days, looks like a lot of the uncertainty is already baked into the price at this moment. Those who were uncertain unboarded the train today. That point is the exhaustion point where bulls come in and drive the stock higher (e.g., Chegg today).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI personally feel that Tiktok MSFT should be a done deal and they are waiting to announce this sometime this month. I am neither an insider nor do I happen to know the actually outcome. However, I do follow hedge fund option sentiment and I have noticed bullish calls inflow for MSFT this past couple days. While I am a peasant who is not connected to anyone involved with the deal, I am sure some of these whales are aware of the decision, which is part of the reason for that bullish call inflow for MSFT.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Should you dump FSLY or not?**\n\nEntirely up to you but I see a lot of growth in this company. Fundamentally, nothing has changed in how they operate. The company gave an upward guidance and that drives the stock in forward direction. Some sellers left the ship because a lot of RH investors have not seen losses in their life or some are not even aware of the potential of this company, except it became a meme stock lately and FOMO drove a lot of noobs in FSLY train.\n\nIt is always better to curtail losses. If you trust that they will continue to bring in revenues, I would dollar cost average on every dip. This ensures your average cost of the share is reduced significantly with any dip. Most fund managers actually add stocks to their funds when the stock is sitting at 30 day MA. Fastly had such a quick run up that the 30 day MA kept moving. All of that being said, I think it may rest for some time before beginning the next leg up. That could be a week, 2 weeks, or a month but you will have to be patient if you do not want to loose money. However, never panik sell on a red day because that is literally the day people like me buy from people who are selling. \n\nWould Monday bring a ray of light and we open green-\n\nNo one knows what happens but I would continue to DCA on every 5% drop. I remember when Square dropped a couple years ago, I kept DCAing and here I am sitting on gains. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this helped convince some of you.",

Their volume is projected to grow 7% within the next 10 years.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/priority-technology-holdings-inc-comments-121300286.html\n\nWhy is this a covid play?\n- U.S. Mint\u2019s production of coin also decreased due to measures put in\nplace to protect its employees\n- More stores are asking customers to use a card where PRTH comes into play\n- People fear cash money is dirty and can carry diseases\n-\u00a0 The Federal Reserve is projecting that we'll experience a gap between supply and demand that ranges from 2.3 billion to 3.5 billion coins each month through the end of 2020.\n\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/08/01/coin-shortage-us-how-long-will-it-last/5524835002/\n\n-Additional facts about PRTH\n- They already partner with Visa and Mastercard\n-They have specified partners to deal with specific types of businesses\n1.

Do chip in your thoughts about it!\n\nAAPL - 5.57%\nMSFT - 10.44%\nAMZN - 9.52%\nFB - 9.17%\nGOOG - 6.91%\nNVDA - 10.3%\nADBE - 13.54%\nASML - 9.07%\nTSM - 7.48%\nV - 9.35%\nMA - 8.64%\n\nI think majority of the stock selections are pretty mainstream, picked to mimic QQQ. I personally added TSM and ASML as I\u2019m a strong believer in semiconductors going forward.\n\nWhat differentiates the portfolio above and QQQ is the weights itself. Instead of adjusting it based on market cap, I\u2019ve decided to optimise the weights above with a sole focus - to maximise Sortino Ratio.\n\nBacktested portfolio since Sept 2012 vs QQQ:\nCAGR - 36.71% vs 20.06%\nStDev - 16.97% vs 14.97%\nBest Year - 57.78% vs 38.96%\nWorst Year - 5.52% vs -3.63%\nSortino Ratio - 4.17 vs 2.28\n\nBy analysing the numbers above, it\u2019s basically a less diverse portfolio with 11 holdings, higher StdDev but significantly higher returns, and a much more efficient fund. Even the worst year for it is still a positive return. \n\nYes I\u2019m aware that my findings are based on historical prices and it doesn\u2019t guarantee future returns",

        "selftext": "Since everyone has been talking about investing in SQ, I thought maybe we could start an open discussion about the risks of Square the business, whether or not we can continue to expect a skyrocketing share price in the years to come.\n\nI'll point out some things I'm iffy about, would like to get feedback on what you all think. Maybe there's things I'm not aware of.\n\n* Competitors. Square has a good product in an explosive growth industry, but I see their products easily replicable by Apple, Google, and PayPal. Should their business prove to have high demand and margins, there's no doubt FAANG giants will follow. Square has a head start, but do they have a competitive advantage? They have lots of commercial business data atm, but I'm doubtful of the value of that in today's market (more on that in my next point). They're beginning to collect consumer data, but imagine how much more data Visa and Mastercard has over them on that. Their technology is easily replicable by other big companies with enough resources to execute.\n* The limitations of the loan business. One of Square's most promising competitive advantages is that they provide loans to small businesses that show promising growth and room for expansion based on their revenue and profit which is logged into the Square system. There is an undeniable market of unserved small business owners that greatly benefit from this feature, but it's doubtful that this would unleash profits that wouldn't hit a low ceiling most of the time. For example, a hair salon can only purchase so many new salon chairs before they run out of customers to serve within that vicinity. Square could strike gold with a really profitable revolutionary small business, but I don't see why those businesses wouldn't be funded by VC's first before coming to Square. Even if they came to Square first, those businesses are one in a million. I do see Square making profits here, but not profits that would take them out of a niche player role.\n* The limitations of commercial business data. With current data limitations, it's impossible for Square's current technology to be an efficient evaluator of which businesses can achieve explosive growth and which ones will never escape low margins. There are too many non-numerical variables in determining a profitable business. Data technology and AI is not there yet.\n* Personal finance inertia. For Square to disrupt the banking industry, they need some clear advantage over banks. Why should we do the extra work of switching over if we are at an established bank? I'm not saying Square wouldn't be a better option than a traditional bank, but it takes a lot to turn the tide in an industry as conservative as the banking industry.\n\nFeel free to refute any of these concerns, maybe there's something really compelling to Square that I'm not seeing. If I'm wrong, I'd love to know.",

        "selftext": "So we've done pretty good in the last week and in yesterday's alerts with multiple alerts panning out really well e.g **$AAPL, $MELI, $SRNE, $NVAX, $SQ, $NKLA, $KNDI, $NFLX. $PDD** etc. I also posted a [detailed spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fT2P9JKxmnyZFFXEOl9QWBsqAqzTwYi-UXSPJ2InECw/edit?usp=sharing) with results from the last week. We had an accuracy of **75%** last week. Some alerts like **$TDOC** also did not pan out yesterday which just shows that the tool is not 100% perfect.\n\nThe tool is still very new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes.\n\nBullish    means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the current     close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means the stock is  expected to stay the same or go low in the next few days.\n\n# Bullish Alerts\n\n**$ILMN** \\- Bullish probability of 88.43%. I know this dropped hard today but the tool is bullish on it. If it starts to go back, it will be a good setup. If it continue going down, don't get in. **Risky setup, careful!**\n\n**$NVAX** \\- Bullish probability of 77.14%. I like that it dropped today. Either get in if it touches the support at $160 and bounces back or get in on a pull back at the moving averages ([https://i.imgur.com/EXdP8y1.png](https://i.imgur.com/EXdP8y1.png))\n\n**$LULU** \\- Bullish probability of 74.80%. Seems like a good setup, especially with a small pullback ([https://i.imgur.com/5misOTH.png](https://i.imgur.com/5misOTH.png))\n\n**$FSLY** \\- Bullish probability of 74.46%. This dropped right at its 50 MA. A good setup as long as the price stays above 50MA ([https://i.imgur.com/GS9bBot.png](https://i.imgur.com/GS9bBot.png)). Exit otherwise.\n\n# Bearish Alerts\n\n**$BAC** \\-  Bearish probability of 86.76%. I like it for a bearish setup if it can below the support of $25.2 ([https://i.imgur.com/wAiBWbo.png](https://i.imgur.com/wAiBWbo.png)).\n\n**$ZNGA** \\-  Bearish probability of 83.96%. This is at a very strong support level at $9.9. **Do not get in unless it breaks the support** ([https://i.imgur.com/kUJuBgr.png](https://i.imgur.com/kUJuBgr.png)).\n\n**$GILD** \\-  Bearish probability of 82.68%. Might go up a bit before going down further. Healthcare stocks are risky though so be careful.\n\n**$WDC** \\-  Bearish probability of 82.66%. Only a good setup if price stays below the support level of $37.8 ([https://i.imgur.com/8ky7k3v.png](https://i.imgur.com/8ky7k3v.png))\n\n \n\n**Note:**  A lot of time has gone into these tools and it takes time to write  these alerts, look at    charts, and post them here. Would love for you  guys to **try out our** [discord](https://discord.gg/X2hHeJ) **channel** where I post alerts from various tools, not just the options one. Please hit me up if you want to link, it's free to join.\n\n**If you don't like these alerts, please don't be a hater, just ignore them. They are not perfect and I know that.**",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, here's a trade I made on NFLX that I wanted to share with you guys. I wasn't able to post it then because I was banned: \n\nI sold a 1x3 ratio put spread 510/485p for a 4.80 credit (7/16 12 PM PST) and exited for a 16.80 net credit. Collateral: \\~17k.\n\n# Strategy:\n\nThe idea behind my strategy was that since NFLX ran pretty hard into earnings and had an impulsive selloff on 7/13, there was room for it to move to the downside if earnings didn't meet expectations. I wanted to make a long play to the downside, but I didn't want to pay to do it, AND if I was wrong, I still wanted to make some money. I chose the 485 as my short strike because it was a little bit below the 20 period moving average; I saw that it has been far above it for multiple days and had a lot of reactions on it. If NFLX were to move to the downside, I was pretty confident that it would move down to the 20 MA, or if it gapped down past it, it would at least try and test it again.\n\n# Managing the trade:\n\nMy exit strategy for if I was wrong was to roll the puts down and out as far as I can and keep the long put. I knew I was wrong if I saw that NFLX could not capture the 20 MA. I exited my position early for this trade for a few reasons: I saw that it was consolidating and could make a big move to the downside or upside soon, because it is monthly OPEX (potential for more volatility), have work to do and didn't want to have to be tied to my trading app, and because this was more leverage than I was comfortable with for my account size. Normally I have multiple units for trades (so like a 2x6, or 3x9) and take profits along the way.\n\nOrder: [https://imgur.com/a/Mh0iyhT](https://imgur.com/a/Mh0iyhT)\n\nDaily chart: [https://imgur.com/a/0TCtB0v](https://imgur.com/a/0TCtB0v)\n\nToday's 5 minute chart: [https://imgur.com/a/pkkc9FH](https://imgur.com/a/pkkc9FH)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this was interesting!",

        "selftext": "I want to discuss my strategy with you my beloved redditors and get some opinions for inspiration.\n\nPersonal situation: 30 yo married no kids\nI am a lawyer in germany. My wife has a very advanced understanding of work life balance and works only 24/h. She doesnt excpect me to work more then her. She values sparetime. Im totaly fine with it. I just have higher materialistic goals then her. \n\nI am working for 1 year now and i am partner in a small chancellery.\n\nTotal income after taxes wife (21k \u20ac) me (50k): 61k/y or 5k/m\nCost of living per month: 1.4k \n\nWe are both very ecenomical and are sitting a house at the beach till the summer of 2023 which allows us to only pay 300\u20ac/m of rent.\n\nMy goal is to be financialy free (1.5m in stocks + maybe 2-3 flats for renting to tourists) at the age of 50 with a payed off house. We want to build the house in 2022 so we can move in in 2023. \n\nOur house will cost us aproximatly 800k-900k. Its expensive here at the beach but we want the quality of life not to go down.\n\nI dont care about prestige. I will drive used cars worth 5k forever. If i have to show off in front of clients i rent a car or use the car of one of my partners and pay them something.\n\nIn 2019 we both finished the law exams and started working in august 2023.\n\nWe started with 10k cash 1 year ago. Started investing in Dec 2019.\n\nPortfolio:\n\n20k Cash\n\n40k stocks\n\nMSFT 12k (up 10%)\n\nAmzn 9k (up 72%)\n\nGoogl 6k (up 3%)\n\nMA 6k (up 13%)\n\nJPM 2k (down 5%)\n\nINTC 5k (down 17%)\n\nOPTION A: \nWe have the chance to buy a 71sqm flat 100m from the beach for 250k. Its build in 1970 and we need to invest 50k to make it a modern and flooded with light. \n\nMy father is an architect. He can help us for free. The price is ok'ish in this overheated market.\n\nOur plan is to use the flat as a vacation rental. This would pay for mortgage and all expenses and leave ~ 100 \u20ac/m of free cash flow. We can rent it for 150\u20ac/d in the summertime. I expect 160 booked days per year.\n\nPos: \n-we  create a steady small income stream\n- after 20 years we payed off the mortgage and have a nice asset\n- we use debt to create wealth which ensures we dont suffer under a possible hyperinflation in our allocation phase before we invest our money into our own house\n\nCons:\n- additional effort for renting the flat  via airbnb\n- i would have to sell all my stocks right now\n- risk of things like roof damage and other unforseen things\n- all savings are bound in the flat\n- maybe not enough savings until we plan to buy our own property in 2022\n- my own inexperience concerning this matter\n\nOPTION B:\n\nWe dont buy the flat and keep investing 1k/ month in etfs waiting for a nice entry points like in march and save up via this way until we buy our property.\n\nI am interested in your comments! \nSry for my bad english skills. \n\nHave a nice saturday",

        "selftext": "With TSLA remaining relatively range bound after earnings (with IV being a bit lower and thus slightly more likely to increase), I have been having some luck opening either 1550/1600 C or 1500/1550 C debit spreads whenever TSLA drops down to its 200 period MA for the 60 minute (\\~$1400). Then, when it gets some upward momentum and starts to either approach or breach above $1500, I ladder out of the spreads. \n\nI have only been doing this for a few weeks and am, as a result, looking for some inout from some of the autists around here who have more experience surrounding the inexorable, neutron star like gravity TSLA has for the most special of god's children.

        "selftext": "Hello! Would really appreciate if I could get your feedback on my current portfolio / any advice on how to improve :)\n\nA bit of background on myself: I am 29 years old from Singapore and had put in about half my savings into 'safe' Singapore stocks pre-COVID (mainly local banks and the STI ETF) because my friends / family recommended that I do this (instead of leaving my money in the bank) years back when I was just starting out and had absolutely 0 knowledge about investing. I am currently down about US$11k but plan to keep the $ in for long term anyway.\n\nOnly at the height of COVID, some time in March, did I turn my attention to overseas exchanges (big regret starting so late). Since then I have pumped in about US$85k and to date I am up around US$14k overall. I mainly started with small positions to test the waters but added to my positions / bought new stocks over the last 4 months.\n\nThis is my current portfolio w rough stock weightage:\n\nSE 21% FVRR 13% PINS 8% NIO 7% TCEHY 7% AMZN 4% NFLX 4% BABA 3% GOOGL 3% FB 2% PDD 2% JD 2% ATVI 2% DIS 2% WDAY 2% MA 2% XOM 2% BP 2% V 1% MCD 1% AIR 1% KO 1% HLT 1% MAR 1% CINE 1% CCL 1% NCLH 1% DAL 1% PLAY 1% UAA 1%\n\nDisclaimer:\n\n* I know I have far too many stocks and am spread WAY too thin... have been wanting to trim and consolidate for a while. Admittedly I didn't really know what I was doing at the beginning and just bought small positions in many stocks :'(\n* I got greedy and bought some really bad stocks during the early June offline rally (i.e. airlines, cruises and PLAY) and I am kicking myself now. But hoping not to sell off any at a loss if possible to hold longer and wait for spikes\n* I am extremely bullish on tech, esp e-comm (clearly), mainly because I have been working in this industry and closely following big tech since I graduated from uni. Witnessed and experienced first-hand the rapid growth of e-comm in Southeast Asia and am very aware of the untapped potential. Unfortunately I had neither the foresight nor the gall to buy these stocks earlier\u2026\n* All the money I have invested has been accrued from years of working, saving, and being stingy lol + profits from a small e-comm side business I run -- none from my parents!",

        "selftext": "This was posted on one of the Facebook Groups.  I figured I would copy it and share it here.  I have not seen this ticker mentioned on this board before.  Low Flow stock, but does not appear to be any active pump and dump going on.  Seems like this may be starting on an uptrend to fill some gaps.  \n\n\"NeuroMetrix, Inc., (NURO) is a healthcare company that develops and  markets products for the detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of  peripheral nerve and spinal cord disorders. One of their more  interesting products is Quell, a wearable device for relief of chronic  intractable pain, such as nerve pain due to diabetes and lower back  problems.   The company offers its products to consumers, retail  merchandisers, direct response TV promoters, health care professionals,  managed care organizations, endocrinologists, podiatrists, physicians,  neurologists, and physical medicine and rehabilitation centers, as well  as primary care, internal medicine, orthopedic, hand, and neurosurgeons.   While operating out of out of Woburn, MA. NeuroMetrix has a presence  in Europe, Japan, China, the Middle East, and Mexico. The company has a  strategic collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline. NeuroMetrix, Inc. was  founded in 1996.\n\nWhy do I like this play?  Well, there is no  pending catalyst.  Truthfully, the company has had some problems in the  past few years, but a reverse split and a few other moves have the stock  price moving in a favorable direction.  So, yes - - this is more of a  chart play...and I do love the chart. \n\nNeuroMetrix gained 4.65%  in the last trading day (Friday, 7th Aug 2020), rising from $2.15 to  $2.25 , and has now gained 3 days in a row. This is a LOW FLOW stock  (3.75m), so it can really move if volume takes over.  For example,  during daily trading it  fluctuated 7.08% from a day low at $2.12 to a  day high of $2.27.  The price has risen in 6 of the last 10 days and is  up by 14.21% over the past 2 weeks. Volume has increased in the last day  along with the price, which is a positive technical sign, and, in  total, 186 thousand more shares were traded than the day before. In  total, 722 thousand shares were bought and sold for approximately $1.62  million.\n\nIt will be exciting to see whether it manages to continue gaining or take a minor break for the next few days\n\n But looking more at the chart, one reason it has risen is the lack of  strong resistance. On a 4 HR chart the 9MA has crossed the 100 MA and  the stock began trading in confirmation this past week.  NURO blew past  resistence levels around 2.16.  The next resistence levels are low  $2.40s and high $2.50s.  After that, there is a big gap to fill before  getting to $3.35 and $6.20.   I am a big fan of \u201cU-Shaped\u201d charts that  fill gaps and I suspect that NURO is on that path. \"\n\nI am going to get in on this.  I like the upside potential. Anyone have any experience with this ticker or thoughts?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5v6xtg43vzf51.png?width=3000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd7f12136a445f8ef81827dab041d39fbe508627",

They make chips for a bunch of products like Cyber Security, Wireless Products, and Telecommunications. The thing is that they earnings on 08/04 Tuesday after hours. It is very obvious that are going to beat earnings. Why? Because look at the rest of the industry: Qualcomm, Intel, AMD, Qorvo, and IBM have all destroyed earnings. And since Intel just told everyone that they're too retarded to even make potato chips all the smaller time semiconductor competitors are making bank, example: AMD and QCOM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMicrochip isn't just your run of the mill small back water company. They actually make acquisitions of other chip companies and use their intellectual property to increase the quality and market share of their own chips. Microchip was found in 1989 and has since made 16 acquistions!!! \n\nYou may, for some reason, say that only big boy chip companies are gonna beat earnings. Well if you don't believe me think about the industries that depend on Microchip for their needs: online educational servicing companies, cloud servicing companies, cyber security companies, telecommunications companies, and just software/tech companies in general. What the hell do we already know about these industries from earnings season? We know they absolutely massacred earnings estimates as everything during COVID has gone tech. Yes, the age of actual industry is dead. Now there are only tech companies that get pumped because of sky high demand (looking at you Apple) and Amazon that sells random shit and still has a tech company valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and you know what's awesome because we have all this knowledge? MCHP is expected to post $1.43 EPS on tuesday, but last year on this quarter they posted $1.41 EPS. What a fucking joke, we should expect at least 40-50% growth in that number from COVID induced semiconductor demand. Not to mention, I think MCHP is gaining market share and could be a big player in a few years in the semiconductor industry. \n\nYou might be hesitant because of my last post on $TER, a chip supplier that many people played incorrectly. I say to you, fuck you. I made money on that play because I sold directly at market open after they destroyed earnings like my data said they would. So if you feel even the slightest FOMO look at these charts from last week: QCOM, QRVO, and AMD; and then tell me what you think MCHP (the same industry) will do!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; MCHP $107c 08/07",

        "selftext": "  \n\nI was introduced to options in 2005. \n\nA co-worker of mine, who happened to be a 9/11 Truther before that was a term, was all hyped up on the upcoming ER for Amgen. He went around the office on a manic high, telling everyone to buy short term OTM call options - or as we refer to them around these parts, FDs. \n\nAs part of our retirement plans, we each had Fidelity brokerage accounts. To enable options trading, however, you had to call Fidelity and answer questions about your level of financial smarts and how much money you had. The correct answers were, of course \"genius level\" and \"shitloads.\" I answered truthfully. My other coworkers did not. They got to options trading enabled. I did not.\n\nAmgen beat and some of these guys landed 8 baggers. My own officemate made $50k and promptly took his family to Disneyland. As you can imagine, I was dismayed that I missed out.\n\nFor the next few months, chasing the next big trade was all the rage, and our team could hardly get anything done. I got my account upgraded by answering the questions correctly, but every play the group made after Amgen was a loser. Because I never had that thrill of victory, I quickly lost interest, but the temptation to recapture those initial gains captivated some of the other guys. As the losses racked up, the trading group got smaller and smaller, eventually distilling down to the most degenerate off talking in the corner, the crazy Truther mumbling his false prophesies to his last few disciples. I lost about $1000 \u2013 which was no small change at that time in my life \u2013 but I know that some of the guys lost a lot more chasing that high.\n\nThat\u2019s still better than the snake oil the retail investment crowd is selling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor any market at any given time, Boggleheads and r/investing will tell you to just keep putting money in, no matter how badly you are getting fucked.\n\n*\u201c7% YoY in the market!\u201d* \n\n*\u201cThe greatest force in the universe is compound interest!\u201d*\n\n*\u201cIf you hold for the long term, you don\u2019t have to worry about volatility!\u201d*\n\nHere\u2019s the cold truth: the life advice Boomers give out is fucking outdated, designed for an analog world created by a Greatest Generation that coddled them, and that includes their financial advice as well.\n\nI am from the \u201c[Oregon Trail Generation](https://socialmediaweek.org/blog/2015/04/oregon-trail-generation/)\u201d, the last slice of GenX that actually grew up with computers. We are the cohort that witnessed the death of the American Middle Class that the Internet Age and Globalization, entering the workforce just as the dot-com bubble finally put it out of its misery.\n\nWhen I was 3, my grandfather retired from Boeing after 35 years. They gave him a platinum plated set of draftsman\u2019s tools, a brass desk clock and a lifelong pension.\n\nWhen I was 19, my girlfriend\u2019s dad was a consultant for Boeing. His job was to dig up dirt on upcoming retirees so they could be fired to deprive them of that pension.\n\nI did the *thing,* that good old American Dream \u2013 marriage, house, car, kids. I did what the \u201cexperts\u201d tell you to do: save a slice of each paycheck for retirement, invest in a college plan, buy a house as a solid investment. \n\nHere I am barely middle-aged, and I have worked through three major financial crises since I entered the workforce.\n\nI\u2019ve chased a runaway housing market, lowering my parameters every month because the prices kept rising faster than I could make for a down payment.\n\nTwice, I have had my retirement account fleeced, then had to draw down what was left to keep a roof over my head - paying a penalty to do so. \n\nI have been so upside down on a mortgage I\u2019ve considered burning the house down.\n\nSo I am here to tell you firsthand that *Save, Buy, Hold and Diversify* will not help you when the whole market collapses and you find yourself in need of that money, that a house is just an investment that you can live in while it drops in value, and that *Dollar Cost Averaging* is another way of saying *Getting Cucked.*\n\nI say, if you are going to make or lose 50% in the next 10 years, you may as well make or lose that 50% in the next 10 *hours.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn some ways, younger Millennials and Zoomers are better equipped to face these facts than us older folks. If you came of age during the GFC or later, you understand that the game is rigged. All that bailout money is moving around the market while you are struggling to make minimum wage in the Uber Eats gig economy. Unlike those of us who grew up in more stable times, you know in your bones the halcyon days - the ones you've only ever heard about - about are never coming back. \n\nNot for everybody, at any rate.\n\nSo enters RobinHood, and it drives the financial pundits absolutely berserk. Who are these fucking kids YOLOing on HTZ? Don\u2019t they know they are supposed to be investing that money into a passive index fund, or even better, one of those retirement-date funds with the massive expense ratios? It\u2019s fucking up the game for the rest of us! \n\nI have traded options on and off for years in the hopes of making a little pocket money. Fact is, when commissions were $8-$20 per trade (plus a fee per contract), there was no way a small-time retail investor could participate meaningfully. With free or no commissions, the calculus has changed, lowering the bar of entry for smaller investors who can enter and exit a position at any time with only the bid-ask spread the main concern.\n\nBoomers created a monster, and they have only themselves to blame.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike many of you, when March hit, I jumped in to puts and lost a bunch of money. This is because I was using an old way of thinking about options, the only one available to small-time retail traders just a few years ago: \u201cI hope that this security makes a huge break in a particular direction.\u201d \n\nAfter this loss and subsequent reflection, I determined that the money was there to be had, just that I was taking the wrong approach. I developed a new strategy, one that takes advantage of the simple fact that I can enter and exit a position without significant commission costs. I began to diversify my targets, and enter smaller positions on those targets, so that I didn\u2019t have everything riding on one or two plays. I developed exit strategies - and followed them! \u2013 so that I could take my wins or cut my losses quickly and move on to the next trade. \n\nAnd most importantly, I made it a point to withdraw my gains, if any, at the end of every week.\n\nSince April, I have executed no less than 20 trades per week if you count option expiry. In 15 weeks, I have doubled my account value. Not because of some one-off spectacular play or because I\u2019ve been a bull a bull market. In fact, I\u2019m a bear, but using a pretty neutral strategy. I doubled my money because I adapted to this new trading climate, found what works for me, and simply stuck to it.\n\nDo I think that makes me some some sort of fucking genius? Absolutely not. I\u2019ve made some smart, conservative plays that turned really goddamned sour. I\u2019ve made some truly retarded plays that turned out great. I\u2019ve had good weeks, bad weeks, and weeks that amounted to an incredibly stressful waste of time. I still make a bunch of mistakes - weekly, if not daily. \n\nI am still prepared \u2013 waiting, even \u2013 for my whole account to get wiped out due to a cacophony of bad plays. In the end, these are all gut decisions. Do I feel good about this? For each of them, only time reveals if I am right.\n\nBut if I have taken one thing away from what I have learned so far this year, it is this: *anybody can make rent money in the equities market now*. You do not have to have a massive account to overcome the burden of commissions, or have a huge investment in dividend stocks to realize a gains-based income. And thank God for that, because the job market is not going to save you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know the gain porn here is enough to make a man drool, and the loss porn is enough to make his balls retract into his stomach. Just understand those are always one-sided directional plays. It\u2019s all-in on a single ticker, a true YOLO, not unlike putting it on black at the roulette table. It\u2019s easy to get caught up looking at the massive gains and get stars in your eyes.\n\nBut forget the lambo and the gold-plated yacht for a moment and consider something more immediate, such as: \u201ccould I pay this month\u2019s phone bill with my gains?\u201d With the money you can pare off into a brokerage account, is it possible to avoid spending the the money you make doing whatever it is you do for someone else and make your phone service \u201cfree\u201d?\n\nFor example, if you have $1000 and you make a reasonably conservative play with an exit strategy of $100 gain and $100 loss (such as a deep OTM 45DTE bull credit spread on a decent stock that\u2019s been beaten up recently, with a hard exit 21DTE), the likelihood is very high. It is not guaranteed \u2013 you may end up down $100 from where you started. But what *is* guaranteed is that you will have to spend 8 hours flipping burgers or whatever at $12.50 an hour to make that $100 if you don't. (Yes, I know, *taxes \u2013* the point still stands).\n\nWhen you finally get to take that $100 out and pay the phone bill with it, it becomes very, very real. \n\nImagine getting to a point where your trading gains pay for the things you *need*, so you can spend the money you earn with your blood sweat and tears on the things you *want.*\n\nThis is what it means to have a \u201cS.M.A.R.T.\u201d goal \u2013 small, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-sensitive. When you conform your efforts to translate into something small yet meaningful to your life, it changes the perspective.\n\nBut even if you decide to take your bi-weekly retirement contribution and YOLO it on MU FDs, you\u2019ve got just as much of a chance of coming ahead with that as you do giving it to Mr. Market to hold for the next 20 years.\n\nBoomers will tell you \u201cmost day traders lose money!\u201d First, \u201cday trader\u201d is a specific term. But that aside, it is also true most businesses fail in the first year. In both cases, people get burned, give up and go back to what they know. They fail to plan, they fail to learn from experience, and they fail to persevere. \n\nThis is not an appeal to \u201cnot be average\u201d nor to keep \u201cchasing bad money with good\u201d - just to keep trying. Set your goals, manage your risk, hone your successes, and learn from your failures.\n\nAt no other time in history has it been possible for the average Joe to participate in the equities market with so little friction as commission-free mobile trading, and with so much leverage as weekly options. I know, because I\u2019m old enough to remember when stock quotes were in the weekly paper, and they were registered in one-eighths of a dollar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL,DR; T**o Hell with the haters like Cramer and his ilk. Keep learning and growing and trying to rake in tendies. The lambo isn\u2019t the goal - *financial freedom* is. An Ally savings account and a shit job the boss is trying his damnedest to offshore ain\u2019t gonna get you there. We live in a Merchant Republic awash in wealth, and you have the right \u2013 the obligation, even - to participate. Go get your fucking slice.\n\nI love you retards.",

        "selftext": "This is actually my first DD I've ever posted so fuck you and forgive me if this doesn't work out for you.  \nI've been looking at $PSTG for a while now and if my buying power wasn't so fucked from my decision to buy 8/7 UBER puts, I would have been already all over this play. \n\nWhat got me looking into Pure Storage was some unusual options activity alert. I've looked into this company before but didn't entirely understand what they do. Now after looking at them again, I'm still not exactly sure wtf they do....BUT I've gotten a better understanding. Basically what I got from this research is that these guys fuck with \"all-FLASH data storage solutions (enabling cloud solutions and other low-latency applications where tape/disk storage does not meet the needs).\"......and ultimately what this all means to me is these motherfuckers make those stupid fast laser money printers with the rocket ships attached. That's something I'm interested in.\n\nNow, here is the D^(aily)D^(ick) you all degenerates have all been fiending for:  \n*Fundamentally*:  \n[Pure Storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Storage) remains one of the few hardware companies in tech that is consistently growing double-digits, yet remains constantly cucked and neglected by investors (trading at 1.9x EV/Sales). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ek7ugjsewnf51.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9c7e72c95e450a105e44223937422d896eeeb21\n\nThe 36 Months beta value for PSTG stock is at 1.62.   \n74% Buy Rating on RH.   \nPSTG has a short float of 7.28% and public float of 243.36M with average trading volume of 3.16M shares. This was trading at around $18 on Wednesday 8/5 when I started writing this and as of right now, it's about $17.33. \n\nThe company has a market capitalization of \\~$4.6 billion. In the last quarter, PSTG reported a ballin'-ass profit of $256.82 million. Pure Storage also saw revenues increase to $367.12 million. As of 04-2020, they got cash money flowing at $11.32 million . The company\u2019s EBITDA came in at -$62.81 million which compares very fucking well among its dinosaur ass peers like HPE, Dell, IBM and NetApp. Pure Storage keeps taking market share from them old farts while growing the chad-like revenues of 33% in F2019, 21% in F2020, and 12% in F1Q21. \n\nChart of their financial growth since IPO in 2015:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gwlmy82v4nf51.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6508cd5f641da4086b70d8b8007da034e982fd7\n\nAt the end of last quarter, Pure Storage had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.274B, compared with $1.299B as of Feb 2, 2020. The total Debt to Equity ratio for PSTG is recording at 0.64 and as of 8/6, Long term Debt to Equity ratio is at 0.64.   \nEarning highlights from last quarter:\n\n* Revenue $367.1 million, up 12% year-over-year\n* **Subscription Services revenue** $120.2 million, up 37% year-over-year\n* GAAP gross margin 70.0%; non-GAAP gross margin 71.9%\n* GAAP operating loss $(84.9) million; non-GAAP operating loss $(5.4) million\n* Operating cash flow was $35.1 million, up $28.5 million year-over-year\n* Free cash flow was $11.3 million, up $29.0 million year-over-year\n* Total cash and investments of $1.3 billion\n\nI bolded the Subscription Services Revenue bullet because to me that's a big deal. Pure Storage keeps them coming back with products such as Pure-as-a-service and Cloud Block Store and everybody knows that the recurring revenue model is best model. Big ass enterprises buy storage from vendors such as Pure Storage in the cloud to prevent vendor lock-in by the cloud providers. $$$\n\nWhat are Pure Storage's other revenue drivers? Well these motherfuckers also have the products to address the growth of Cloud storage as well as products to drive the growth of on-prem storage. For on-prem data center, Pure sells Flash Array to address block storage workloads (for databases and other mission-critical workloads) and FlashBlade for unstructured or file data workloads. On-prem storage revenue is mainly driven by legacy storage array replacement cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/01su6chrwnf51.png?width=1129&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16e6a705f9392291bc0c3932c815802d9101365e\n\nSo far, it seems like Pure Storage's smart ass [CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHE7X5Gt71o) has been spot on with his prediction of the flash storage sector's direction. Pure Storage's \"Pure-as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store\" unified subscription offerings is fo sho gaining momentum it. This shit is catching on with enterprises, both big and small. COVID-19 increased the acceleration of our digital transformation and our subsequent shift to the cloud. The increased demand in data-centers is going to drastically help Pure Storage's future top and bottom line and to top it off, **NAND prices are recovering** (inferred from MU earnings). I expect Pure Storage to get some relief on the pricing front because of this which obviously in turn should improve revenues. \n\nPSTG's numbers look pretty good to me so far but are they a good company overall? Even when scalping and trading, I don't like to fuck with overall shitty companies so I always check for basic things like customer satisfaction, analyst ratings/targets, broad-view industry trends, and hedge fund positioning.. that sort of thing.   \n**Pure Storage stands out in all of these fields for me.**   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4n0e5nve5of51.png?width=373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=495416bb6f5a2dab77f3ac483ca4d9510b39037c\n\nCustomers like Dominos Pizza and many others all seem to be happy AF with no issues. I can hardly even find a negative review online. The products seems to be universally applauded. Gartner and other third party independent analysts also consider Pure Storage's product line-up some of the best in the industry. \n\nThe industry average for this sector is a piss poor 65.  \nPure Storage has a 2020 Net Promoter Score of [86](https://customer.guru/net-promoter-score/pure-storage)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3w51io8yvmf51.png?width=698&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f7d06825d0ad9d126216e5069af2f9c3636f86a\n\nEnterprises are upgrading their existing storage infrastructure with newer and modern data arrays that are based on NAND flash because they're forced to keep up with the increasing speed of the future of business inter-connectivity. This isn't changing because of the pandemic and this isn't changing in the future.. The newer storage arrays are smaller, consume less power, are less noisy and do not generate excess heat in the data center and hence do not need to be cooled like the fat fucks at IBM need to be. Flash storage arrays in general are cheaper to operate and are extremely fast, speeding up applications. Pure Storage by all accounts makes the best storage arrays in the industry and continues to grow faster than the old school storage vendors like bitchass NetApp, Dell, HPE and IBM. \n\nPure Storage\u2019s market share was 12.7% in C1Q20 and was up from 10.1% in the prior year - LIKE A PROPER HIGH GROWTH COMPANY.   \nHPE, NetApp and IBM, like the losers they are, lost market share.   \nAccording to [blocksandfiles.com](https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/07/03/gartner-all-flash-array-revenues-q12020/), AFA vendor market share sizes and shifts are paraphrased below:\n\n* \u201cDell EMC \u2013 34.8% (calculated $766m) vs. 33.7% a year ago\n* NetApp \u2013 19.3% at $425m vs. 26.7% a year ago\n* Pure Storage \u2013 12.7% at calculated $279.7m vs. 10.1% a year ago\n* HPE \u2013 8.4% \u2013 $185m vs. 10% a year ago\"\n\nPure has been gaining share almost every year since it began selling storage arrays in 2011. Pure Storage is consistently rated the highest for the completeness of vision as the following chart shows:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5agj17gcgnf51.png?width=428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da9c6389baccab85261d6e0f71b3474e84b90d3c\n\n**Hedge Funds are on this like flies on shit.** \n\nAlliancebernstein L.P. grew its position in Pure Storage by 0.5% in the 4th quarter. Alliancebernstein L.P. now owns 104,390 shares of the technology company\u2019s stock worth $1,786,000 after purchasing an additional 560 shares during the last quarter. \n\nLegal &amp; General Group Plc grew its position in Pure Storage by 0.3% in the 1st quarter.

Over the last 20 quarters, the company beat revenue 17 quarters by an average of $4.9 million or about 3%. Out of the three times that the company missed on revenues, once was due to supply fuck-ups at one of its distributors and the other two times were due to Average Selling Prices declining faster than the company forecasted. Higher-than-expected ASP declines (due to NAND oversupply) is one of the risks of the storage business...but then again NAND prices look to be recovering now if MU's earning isn't fucking with us and telling us fibs. Big money is forecasting revenue to be around $396 million, essentially flat year-over-year, and EPS of a disrespectful ass penny....Fuck that conservative ass guidance! I think PSTG is going to blow that shit out the water.  \nThis chart shows Pure Storage\u2019s past performance\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4xflpezdhnf51.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1660a80a1a1821ef8098791a8cee632e25f1445\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2fuen3n65of51.png?width=373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9737a8d2c2a04163f447cf6d0ee287b40235868e\n\nMy Prediction: After ER on **8/25**, Pure Storage will hit new 52 week highs.   \n$20.50  - $23.50 is my guess.

AAPL stock split enthusiasm and tiktok buyout rumors by MSFT(now canned) drove it past 325 eclipsing the stimulus paycheck pause\n\nLooking into next week, again for the SPY we need to think in terms of Geopolitik Say AMZN struck a deal in South Asia and MENA regions, they're set to dominate the ecommerce market there, oh just one problem. all the goods from vietnam / US can't get there because the South China Sea is being blockaded. Or GOOG invents an improvement to instant results, ie Mind Results, results pop up on your android even before you type anything, and it works on 50 different languages. Whoops won't matter if they are banned in Asia due to US loosing allies over there. Tiktok case is the reverse example of this.\n\nWho makes the most money ultimately comes down to who have MORE GUNS(and wins wars),  we will see how this play out over the next few months along with the rona pandemic.

That is because within countries there are laws and standards of behavior that govern, whereas between countries raw power matters most, and laws, rules, and even mutually agreed treaties and organizations for arbitration such as the League of Nations, the United Nations, and the World Trade Organization don't matter much.  Operating internationally is like operating in a jungle in which there is survival of the fittest and most anything goes.  That is what makes having a strong military so important.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Where the US Is in Its Big Cycle The stats seem to suggest that the US is roughly 75% through that cycle, +/- 10%.

My theory is that MU has been consolidating for a few years in order to prepare to break to new all time highs. The last time MU hit an ATH was at $97.50 in July 2000 (20 years ago).\n\nWith SPY only a few days away from new all time highs and QQQ &amp; SMH already printing new ATH daily, how does MU not follow?\n\nMy biggest concern is that I'm too early by a few weeks and theta decay is a bitch.\n\nCan anyone tell me what I'm missing?
