        "selftext": "I picked these to compare since they both run a subscription based model and have similar marketcaps (250 billion or so), and pe (54 or so) As of right now im leaning towards adobe, the reason is because they have few competitors, diverse products range. I believe they have better growth potential thanks to better pricing power and more user growth potential. (us&amp;international growth vs netflix primarily international) higher margins (40% vs 16%), stock buybacks (-1% vs +1% dilution), high switching costs better moat, much better balance sheet for adobe.\n\nOn a forward pe, adobe is about 10% more expensive (fwd pe of 44 vs 40) and marketcap wise it is about 25% higher. (adobe makes about 15% more profit) The main benefit for netflix is improving margins over time but I only see net profit margins going to 25% max.\n\nOne thing I want to add for adobe has over 100 products with 60% being creative cloud and that alone has 20-30 famous products like photoshop, primer pro, the stuff you know adobe for. document cloud and digital experience no one knows but that segment is growing like crazy whereas netflix makes 99% of revenue from one main product. the two segments for adobe is mostly business to business like digital marketing, digital signatures, data analytics, ai, ecommerce sales, publishing, and much more and makes 40% of sales and growing in a fast market where things are going more digital (think youtube, shopify, docusign). I just dont see much growth for netflix where pretty much in the us more than 70 million users out of 120 million households have it already.\n\nBut i put up an poll on whats better earlier elsewhere and everyone said netflix, but no one really explained why? is adobe underrated and should it replace netflix in faang, or is netflix still king and explain why it is better because i dont get the hype and why everyone still use faang for big tech synonym when they are several other growth tech companies like adobe that have much higher marketcap than netflix. anyways, what is your pick on whats the better company",

        "selftext": "**Preamble:** Every year Fortune publishes the top 100 companies to work for in the world. The results are based on an anonymous survey conducted on over half a million employees.\n\nI wanted to check whether companies where people are the happiest to work produced better returns for their shareholders when compared to the market. My hypothesis is based on two assumptions\n\na. An employee would create his/her best possible output when they truly love the place they work\n\nb. Companies with excellent culture would create a feedback loop to attract top talent by word of mouth and referrals.\n\nI feel that both of these factors would contribute to the company innovating over their competitors and creating outsized investor returns.\n\n**Data:** There are a lot of players that create the best companies to work for list. I chose Fortune as they are the most established company and have been doing this over the past 20 years. Their survey sample size is also very high (more than 5,00,000 anonymous responders), which would give us a fair representation and minimize the chances of false positives.\n\nFor this analysis, I took companies present in the best places to work for list in the last 10 years (2012-2021). But, not all the companies on the list are public and listed. So, the current analysis will only focus on the companies whose shares are listed.\n\nAll the data used in the analysis is shared in a Google sheet at the end.\n\n**Analysis Methodology:** Every year Fortune publishes its result on the 2nd week of February. I have considered two different ways to invest in the best companies to work\n\na. You invest in the company as soon as the list comes out and hold for 1 year and then sell and repeat this every year\n\nb. You invest in the company and hold (This is based on the assumption that company culture does not change year over year and once the company makes it into a list, it\u2019s a good long-term investment)\n\nReturns from the above strategies are then compared to the S&amp;P 500 returns \\[1\\] over the same period.\n\n**Results**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/az6njh8qp6b71.png?width=1032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a50a203b345c28a33c2ebed9f8928b4c3d77521\n\nThe companies in the best places to work consistently beat S&amp;P500 in stock returns. There is a noticeable difference in return as you move up the list with the best place to work (Rank-1) beating the market comfortably by 9.5% every year! \\[2\\]. \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/8m3qajdsp6b71.png?width=1035&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=538425ee2af64fd84f88833f4c3420b22f262b3c)\n\nThe difference in returns becomes more noticeable if you buy and hold the company for the long term. Here we can see a steady increase in returns as you move up the ranking ladder with the top company returning a whopping 131.5% more than the index over the last 10 years. This also validates our assumption that companies having great cultures create superior investor returns over the long term.\n\nNow that it\u2019s out of the way, we can dive deeper into the data and find out which stocks made the best returns and how your returns would have faired over the years.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/k1c3smbtp6b71.png?width=1034&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0de66bf0af94c3a84f8af06e06372f9a59bfe30)\n\nThe best long-term return among the top companies to work for was generated by Adobe! The stock has returned 1762% over the last 10 years. As expected, tech companies have generated the most amount of returns with Microsoft, Google, and Adobe all present multiple times.\n\nFor our final analysis, we can check if the returns were consistent throughout the years or was it just a few years that are contributing to the overall positive results.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/hkrqje8up6b71.png?width=1045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=393b458f8b3f1d6edf3c281c4f9f064fac942cd9)\n\nI think this graph shows one of the most important takeaways from this analysis. As we can see best companies to work for have beaten SPY by a considerable margin in 8 out of the 10 years (80%) of our analysis timeframe. Even in the years that our strategy did not beat the market, the difference between the returns was negligible.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNo matter how you slice it, the above analysis shows that companies that are exceptional places to work create exceptional returns to their shareholders.\n\nI think this ties in nicely with our initial hypothesis that companies having great culture will have happy employees that create the best possible results and also would attract top talent. Both of these in turn would lead to market-beating shareholder returns.\n\nNow you know what to do when the next year's results come out!\n\nGoogle Sheet containing the data and my analysis: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NF48A0p6L4V_79XkJVdOCT_jAdP1vKlC3ix5e44xXXM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] I have considered the benchmark as S&amp;P500 as the Best Companies to Work for list contains companies across industries and I think that S&amp;P500 is a fairer representation of the overall list.\n\n\\[2\\] 6 out of the last 10 years, the top company to work for was Google.\n\n*As always, please note that I am not a financial advisor.* Hope you enjoyed this week\u2019s analysis.\n\nIf you found this insightful, please share it with your friends :)\n\n[WhatsApp](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmarketsentiment.substack.com%2Fp%2Ftop-companies-to-work-for-stock-returns&amp;linkname=) | [Facebook](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmarketsentiment.substack.com%2Fp%2Ftop-companies-to-work-for-stock-returns&amp;linkname=) | [Twitter ](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmarketsentiment.substack.com%2Fp%2Ftop-companies-to-work-for-stock-returns&amp;linkname=)| [Reddit](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmarketsentiment.substack.com%2Fp%2Ftop-companies-to-work-for-stock-returns&amp;linkname=)",

        "selftext": "Let\u2019s break down the connections between the Apple Car Development Team and Lucid Group.\n\n\nWho is Kevin Lynch?\n\nFirst off let\u2019s talk about Kevin Lynch who was named Apple Car Lead on July, 16 2021. Lynch has had many roles at Apple as well as Adobe and played a key role in the creation of Creative Cloud. The first leader of the Apple Car Development program was Bob Mansfield (retired in 2020) followed by John Giannandrea (Apple AI and machine learning chief) finally followed by Lynch. \n\n\nState of Apple Car\n\nAs of July 16th 2021 it is rumored that Apple is now sourcing components, talking with suppliers, and making deals with manufacturing partners for the Apple Car. Still in the early stages the Apple Car is rumored to hit the market between 2025 and 2028. \n\n\nLucid Group + Kevin Lynch\n\nMichael Bell (Lucid Senior VP of Digital) - 16 years at Apple of which includes significant roles in development of iPhone, iMac, AirPort, and Apple TV. Bell and Lynch worked together closely on the development of iMac. \n\nMargaret Burgraff (Lucid VP of Software Validation) - 15 years at Apple of which includes working on the development and launch of the original iMac with you guessed it Kevin Lynch\n\nSir Johny Ive (Operating Partner for Spac now LCID) - Designer of iMac where he worked closely with Kevin Lynch. \n\n\nLack of Denial April 3rd 2021\n\nPeter Rawlinson (Lucid CEO) was asked point blank in an interview with The Guardian, if he had been approached by or was currently engaged in negotiations with Apple on a partnership for the Apple Car, in which he declined to comment. Per the NYSE rules false rumors must be promptly denied or clarified this would suggest they are true, but not at a point in which either company can release a statement. \n\n\nConclusion \n\nIn my opinion an Apple + Lucid partnership is still very likely giving the lack of denial and the connections between high ranking Lucid employees and Kevin Lynch, but with a go to market target of 2025-2028 it could still be months before we receive an update on a potential partnership. I am long $LCID and continue to hold.\n\nPositions: $LCID 725 shares @ $31.50",

All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&amp;P500?\n\nIn this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&amp;P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows).\n\n**Marketcap valuation gained during the last 52 weeks**\n\n||Top 5|Top 10|Top 20|Top 50|Top 100|Top 250|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$|$4.96T|$6.49T|$7.93T|$10.76T|$14.15T|$18.03T|\n|%|23.69%|31.02%|37.87%|51.42%|67.62%|86.14%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||Bottom 250|Bottom 100|Bottom 50|Bottom 20|Bottom 10|Bottom 5|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$|$2.9T|$780.77B|$340.88B|$92.3B|$38.79B|$13.11B|\n|%|13.86%|3.73%|1.63%|0.44%|0.19%|0.06%|\n\nThe total value gained in the S&amp;P500 index since one year ago is $20.93 trillion! The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (\\~86%).\n\nAs of right now, the S&amp;P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&amp;P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane. Let's look at the valuations of these companies.\n\n**Valuations of companies right now**\n\n||Top 5|Top 10|Top 20|Top 50|Top 100|Top 250|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$|$9.08T|$12.26T|$15.67T|$21.89T|$27.68T|$34.86T|\n|%|23.05%|31.13%|39.8%|55.59%|70.29%|88.51%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||Bottom 250|Bottom 100|Bottom 50|Bottom 20|Bottom 10|Bottom 5|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$|$4.52T|$1.18T|$478.81B|$159.71B|$73.03B|$23.64B|\n|%|11.49%|3%|1.22%|0.41%|0.19%|0.06%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Top and Bottom Companies off their highs and lows**\n\n||Top 5|Top 10|Top 20|Top 50|Top 100|Top 250|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|off the highs|\\-2.56%|\\-12.340%|\\-9.13%|\\-6.86%|\\-6.79%|\\-7.42%|\n|off the lows|54.50%|54.221%|48.67%|47.09%|53.02%|54.03%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||Bottom 250|Bottom 100|Bottom 50|Bottom 20|Bottom 10|Bottom 5|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|off the highs|\\-11.53%|\\-13.56%|\\-14.55%|\\-16.05%|\\-20.23%|\\-19.23%|\n|off the lows|65.00%|67.48%|75.81%|67.54%|61.85%|56.65%\u200b|\n\nTop 10 includes Tesla, which is about 25% off its highs that's why you see the top 10 is -12% off its highs. Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated.\n\nNow let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.\n\n**Companies in the S&amp;P500 for every 1-3% move**\n\n|||1%||2%||3%||\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||% of the S&amp;P500|$|%|$|%|$|%|\n|AAPL|6.16%|$24.26B|0.062%|$48.53B|0.12%|$72.79B|0.18%|\n|MSFT|5.38%|$21.19B|0.054%|$42.39B|0.11%|$63.58B|0.16%|\n|AMZN|4.59%|$18.08B|0.046%|$36.16B|0.09%|$54.24B|0.14%|\n|GOOG|4.42%|$17.42B|0.044%|$34.83B|0.09%|$52.25B|0.13%|\n|FB|2.49%|$9.82B|0.025%|$19.63B|0.05%|$29.45B|0.07%|\n|BRK.B|1.62%|$6.39B|0.016%|$12.77B|0.03%|$19.16B|0.05%|\n|TSLA|1.60%|$6.31B|0.016%|$12.63B|0.03%|$18.94B|0.05%|\n|V|1.32%|$5.20B|0.013%|$10.39B|0.03%|$15.59B|0.04%|\n|NVDA|1.23%|$4.84B|0.012%|$9.67B|0.02%|$14.51B|0.04%|\n|JPM|1.18%|$4.63B|0.012%|$9.25B|0.02%|$13.88B|0.04%|\n|JNJ|1.13%|$4.46B|0.011%|$8.93B|0.02%|$13.39B|0.03%|\n|WMT|1.00%|$3.96B|0.010%|$7.91B|0.02%|$11.87B|0.03%|\n|UNH|0.99%|$3.91B|0.010%|$7.83B|0.02%|$11.74B|0.03%|\n|MA|0.96%|$3.77B|0.010%|$7.53B|0.02%|$11.30B|0.03%|\n|PYPL|0.90%|$3.54B|0.009%|$7.09B|0.02%|$10.63B|0.03%|\n|HD|0.88%|$3.47B|0.009%|$6.94B|0.02%|$10.41B|0.03%|\n|PG|0.87%|$3.41B|0.009%|$6.82B|0.02%|$10.22B|0.03%|\n|BAC|0.84%|$3.30B|0.008%|$6.59B|0.02%|$9.89B|0.03%|\n|DIS|0.82%|$3.21B|0.008%|$6.43B|0.02%|$9.64B|0.02%|\n|ADBE|0.74%|$2.92B|0.007%|$5.83B|0.01%|$8.75B|0.02%\u200b|\n\nEvery 1% move Apple makes as of now, \\~$24 is moved and the S&amp;P500 index moved \\~0.06%. A 3% move would impact $72 billion dollars in valuation and has a 0.18% impact on the index. Doesn't seem much but the index is valued at almost $40 trillion dollars. Look at how much of an impact these stocks together make.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||1% move|2% move|3% move|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Top 5|0.23%|0.46%|0.69%|\n|Top 10|0.3%|0.6%|0.9%|\n|Top 20|0.391%|0.78%|1.17%|\n\nThe top 20 companies can make a 1%+ move if they averaged a 3% increase/decrease.\n\nSo what should I get out of this?\n\n* The S&amp;P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies.\n* S&amp;P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them.\n* Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD.\n* Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down.\n* Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season.\n\nHope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.",

The artificial intelligence controlling the fund believes these stocks will see price declines across the month.\n\nThe standout among the stocks added in July was AMC [**AMC,** **6.37%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AMC?mod=MW_story_quote), the cinema chain that along with GameStop [**GME,** **-4.30%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/GME?mod=MW_story_quote) has epitomized the \u201cmeme stock\u201d trading frenzy in 2021.\n\nA flock of investors, largely organized on social media platform Reddit, helped squeeze hedge funds\u2019 short positions on companies including GameStop and AMC earlier this year. The trading frenzy caused multibillion-dollar losses for hedge funds, unbelievable gains for individuals that timed it right, and ushered in a new era of internet-inspired trading.\n\nAMC\u2019s stock price rose 570% from January 20 to January 27\u2014from nearly $3 a share to almost $20. Shares in the group are now up close to 1,500% so far in 2021, trading around $33.\u00a0\n\nAnd now the AI calling the shots at AMOM thinks the stock will move even higher in July, buying enough shares to make up 1.8% of the fund. Bringing AMC into the fold came as the robot ditched fellow meme stock GameStop, which was added to AMOM in May but booted out after the stock fell more than 14% in June.\n\n\u201cQraft\u2019s AI model is not specifically designed to invest in meme stocks, but rather in stocks with high capital appreciation potential,\u201d Geeseok Oh, a managing director at Qraft and the head of its Asia-Pacific business, told MarketWatch.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAI is not swayed by prejudice or bias and may pick up meme stocks if the momentum seems highly positive,\u201d said Oh. \u201cThis month, our model found AMC more opportunistic than other meme stocks like GameStop.\u201d\n\nThe top five stocks by portfolio weight added to AMOM in July include retailer O\u2019Reilly Auto Parts [**ORLY,** **-0.08%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ORLY?mod=MW_story_quote), software group Cadence Design Systems [**CDNS,** **-0.79%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/CDNS?mod=MW_story_quote), electronics store chain Best Buy [**BBY,** **2.49%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/BBY?mod=MW_story_quote), biotech cancer specialist Seagen [**SGEN,** **-0.03%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/SGEN?mod=MW_story_quote), and enterprise software developer HubSpot [**HUBS,** **0.26%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/HUBS?mod=MW_story_quote).\n\nAfter the fund was rebalanced, AMOM\u2019s five largest holdings by portfolio weight were online dating group Match [**MTCH,** **-0.01%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/MTCH?mod=MW_story_quote), cybersecurity company Fortinet [**FTNT,** **0.88%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/FTNT?mod=MW_story_quote), O\u2019Reilly Auto Parts as well as rival AutoZone [**AZO,** **0.11%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AZO?mod=MW_story_quote), and retailer Kroger [**KR,** **1.11%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/KR?mod=MW_story_quote).\n\n\u201cWith Covid-19 reaching new peaks, the AI made trades related to the pandemic conditions,\u201d Oh said. \u201cMatch Group is one of the beneficiaries of the pandemic with more people trying out online dating. Fortinet stock gained prominence with more and more governments emphasizing the importance of cybersecurity.\u201d\n\nOh also added that it was noteworthy that AMOM has decided to adjust its portfolio away from very big bets\u2014in June, the fund\u2019s top three stocks accounted for 21% of the portfolio, but now the top three stocks account for just 11%.\n\n\u201cGiven the volatile market sentiment, the AI seems to have adjusted portfolio and concentration to hedge against potential risks,\u201d he said.\n\nAMOM has been listed in New York since May 2019, and has delivered total returns of 12% so far in 2021 and 42% in the past year\u2014outpacing its benchmark, the S&amp;P 500 Momentum index, which has climbed a comparable 34% since July 2020.\n\nThe fund is a product of Qraft, a Seoul, South Korea-based fintech group leveraging AI across its investment products, which include three other AI-picked versions of major indexes: a U.S. large cap index [**QRFT,** **-0.52%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/QRFT?mod=MW_story_quote) ; a U.S. large cap dividend index [**HDIV,** **+0.39%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/HDIV?mod=MW_story_quote) ; and a U.S. value index [**NVQ,** **-0.28%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/NVQ?mod=MW_story_quote) NVQ.\n\nAMOM is an actively managed portfolio driven by artificial intelligence, tracking 50 large-cap U.S. stocks and reweighting its holdings each month. It is based on a momentum strategy, with the AI behind its stock picks capitalizing on the movements of existing market trends to inform the decision to add, remove, or reweight holdings. The artificial intelligence scans the market and uses its predictive power to analyze a wide set of patterns that show stock-market momentum.\n\nThe entrance of AI-run funds onto Wall Street promised a new high-tech future for investing, though it hasn\u2019t quite lived up to the hype yet. Theoretically, researchers have shown that AI investing strategies [can beat the market by up to 40% on an annualized basis](https://www.wsj.com/articles/use-ai-for-picking-stocks-not-so-fast-11578279960?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D49189099147164614691798547045511944379%7CMCORGID%3DCB68E4BA55144CAA0A4C98A5%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1621008863&amp;adobe_mc=MCMID%3D25706935534593873851174687596825042056%7CMCORGID%3DCB68E4BA55144CAA0A4C98A5%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1623154286&amp;mod=article_inline), when tested against historical data.\n\nBut Vasant Dhar, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business and the founder of machine-learning-based hedge fund SCT Capital Management, [argued on MarketWatch in June 2020](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/machine-learning-wont-crack-the-stock-market-but-heres-when-investors-should-trust-ai-2020-06-08?mod=article_inline) that AI-run funds won\u2019t \u201ccrack\u201d the code of the stock market.\n\nAdvocating caution, Dhar said that it was difficult for funds underpinned by machine learning to maintain a sustainable edge over markets, which have \u201ca nonstationary and adversarial nature.\u201d He advised investors considering an AI system to ask tough questions, including how likely it is that the AI\u2019s \u201cedge\u201d will persist into the future, and what the inherent uncertainties and range of performance outcomes for the fund are.",

        "selftext": "**Preamble:** Every year Fortune publishes the top 100 companies to work for in the world. The results are based on an anonymous survey conducted on over half a million employees.\n\nI wanted to check whether companies where people are the happiest to work produced better returns for their shareholders when compared to the market. My hypothesis is based on two assumptions\n\na. An employee would create his/her best possible output when they truly love the place they work\n\nb. Companies with excellent culture would create a feedback loop to attract top talent by word of mouth and referrals.\n\nI feel that both of these factors would contribute to the company innovating over their competitors and creating outsized investor returns.\n\n**Data:** There are a lot of players that create the best companies to work for list. I chose Fortune as they are the most established company and have been doing this over the past 20 years. Their survey sample size is also very high (more than 5,00,000 anonymous responders), which would give us a fair representation and minimize the chances of false positives.\n\nFor this analysis, I took companies present in the best places to work for list in the last 10 years (2012-2021). But, not all the companies on the list are public and listed. So, the current analysis will only focus on the companies whose shares are listed.\n\nAll the data used in the analysis is shared in a Google sheet at the end.\n\n**Analysis Methodology:** Every year Fortune publishes its result on the 2nd week of February. I have considered two different ways to invest in the best companies to work\n\na. You invest in the company as soon as the list comes out and hold for 1 year and then sell and repeat this every year\n\nb. You invest in the company and hold (This is based on the assumption that company culture does not change year over year and once the company makes it into a list, it\u2019s a good long-term investment)\n\nReturns from the above strategies are then compared to the S&amp;P 500 returns \\[1\\] over the same period.\n\n**Results**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5krr494ep6b71.png?width=1032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e79b47975082c92c61f09cf169df626486b03ea9\n\nThe companies in the best places to work consistently beat S&amp;P500 in stock returns. There is a noticeable difference in return as you move up the list with the best place to work (Rank-1) beating the market comfortably by 9.5% every year! \\[2\\]. \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/zqbo7nkfp6b71.png?width=1035&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8f5d1c7ed8783fd74c24a04541281bf6cdd9238)\n\nThe difference in returns becomes more noticeable if you buy and hold the company for the long term. Here we can see a steady increase in returns as you move up the ranking ladder with the top company returning a whopping 131.5% more than the index over the last 10 years. This also validates our assumption that companies having great cultures create superior investor returns over the long term.\n\nNow that it\u2019s out of the way, we can dive deeper into the data and find out which stocks made the best returns and how your returns would have faired over the years.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/faluhbvgp6b71.png?width=1034&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91b5ca46ebefe2b5e0fa5e438acf1e31fea51f35)\n\nThe best long-term return among the top companies to work for was generated by Adobe! The stock has returned 1762% over the last 10 years. As expected, tech companies have generated the most amount of returns with Microsoft, Google, and Adobe all present multiple times.\n\nFor our final analysis, we can check if the returns were consistent throughout the years or was it just a few years that are contributing to the overall positive results.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/gpce6e1ip6b71.png?width=1045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b3e2139de6f53334bad5770447c5c70474801c3)\n\nI think this graph shows one of the most important takeaways from this analysis. As we can see best companies to work for have beaten SPY by a considerable margin in 8 out of the 10 years (80%) of our analysis timeframe. Even in the years that our strategy did not beat the market, the difference between the returns was negligible.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNo matter how you slice it, the above analysis shows that companies that are exceptional places to work create exceptional returns to their shareholders.\n\nI think this ties in nicely with our initial hypothesis that companies having great culture will have happy employees that create the best possible results and also would attract top talent. Both of these in turn would lead to market-beating shareholder returns.\n\nNow you know what to do when the next year's results come out!\n\nGoogle Sheet containing the data and my analysis: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NF48A0p6L4V_79XkJVdOCT_jAdP1vKlC3ix5e44xXXM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] I have considered the benchmark as S&amp;P500 as the Best Companies to Work for list contains companies across industries and I think that S&amp;P500 is a fairer representation of the overall list.\n\n\\[2\\] 6 out of the last 10 years, the top company to work for was Google.\n\n*As always, please note that I am not a financial advisor.* Hope you enjoyed this week\u2019s analysis.\n\nIf you found this insightful, please share it with your friends :)\n\n[WhatsApp](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmarketsentiment.substack.com%2Fp%2Ftop-companies-to-work-for-stock-returns&amp;linkname=) | [Facebook](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmarketsentiment.substack.com%2Fp%2Ftop-companies-to-work-for-stock-returns&amp;linkname=) | [Twitter ](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmarketsentiment.substack.com%2Fp%2Ftop-companies-to-work-for-stock-returns&amp;linkname=)| [Reddit](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmarketsentiment.substack.com%2Fp%2Ftop-companies-to-work-for-stock-returns&amp;linkname=)",

        "selftext": "Let\u2019s break down the connections between the Apple Car Development Team and Lucid Group.\n\n\nWho is Kevin Lynch?\n\nFirst off let\u2019s talk about Kevin Lynch who was named Apple Car Lead on July, 16 2021. Lynch has had many roles at Apple as well as Adobe and played a key role in the creation of Creative Cloud. The first leader of the Apple Car Development program was Bob Mansfield (retired in 2020) followed by John Giannandrea (Apple AI and machine learning chief) finally followed by Lynch. \n\n\nState of Apple Car\n\nAs of July 16th 2021 it is rumored that Apple is now sourcing components, talking with suppliers, and making deals with manufacturing partners for the Apple Car. Still in the early stages the Apple Car is rumored to hit the market between 2025 and 2028. \n\n\nLucid Group + Kevin Lynch\n\nMichael Bell (Lucid Senior VP of Digital) - 16 years at Apple of which includes significant roles in development of iPhone, iMac, AirPort, and Apple TV. Bell and Lynch worked together closely on the development of iMac. \n\nMargaret Burgraff (Lucid VP of Software Validation) - 15 years at Apple of which includes working on the development and launch of the original iMac with you guessed it Kevin Lynch\n\nSir Johny Ive (Operating Partner for Spac now LCID) - Designer of iMac where he worked closely with Kevin Lynch. \n\n\nLack of Denial April 3rd 2021\n\nPeter Rawlinson (Lucid CEO) was asked point blank in an interview with The Guardian, if he had been approached by or was currently engaged in negotiations with Apple on a partnership for the Apple Car, in which he declined to comment. Per the NYSE rules false rumors must be promptly denied or clarified this would suggest they are true, but not at a point in which either company can release a statement. \n\n\nConclusion \n\nIn my opinion an Apple + Lucid partnership is still very likely giving the lack of denial and the connections between high ranking Lucid employees and Kevin Lynch, but with a go to market target of 2025-2028 it could still be months before we receive an update on a potential partnership.

Here is this week's brief DD.\n\n**Introduction**\n\n\tDocuSign (DOCU) is an electronic signature agreement platform. DOCU makes money by charging those who create contracts.\n\nMarket Cap (MKT Cap)\n\n* 2018- $5.53B\n* 2019- $13.35B\n* 2020- $41.29B\n* Current- $54.81B\n\n\\*MKT Cap has increased by 891% in three years\n\nEPS (Dilution)\n\n* 2018- ($8.15)\n* 2019- $3.91\n* 2020- ($1.18)\n* Current- ($1.09)\n\n\\*EPS has increased by 87% in three years\n\n**Financial Statement Highlights (in thousands)**\n\nTotal Revenue (TR)\n\n* 2018- $0.65B\n* 2019- $0.90B\n* 2020- $1.30B\n* Current- $1.63B\n\n\\*TR has increased by 150% in three years\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (PE)\n\n* 2019- 16.93\n* 2020- 0.00\n* Current- 0.00\n\n\\*PE Ratio has decreased by 100% in two years\n\nPrice to Sales Ratio (PS)\n\n* 2019- 12.12\n* 2020- 28.57\n* Current- 32.68\n\n\\*PS Ratio has increased by 169% in two years\n\nPrice to Book Ratio (PB)\n\n* 2019- 20.84\n* 2020- 88.55\n* Current- 225.80\n\n\\*PB Ratio has increased by 984% in two years\n\nGross Margin\n\n* 2018- 73.7%\n* 2019- 74.6%\n* 2020- 74.6%\n* Current- 75.7%\n\n\\*Gross Margin has increased by 2% in three years\n\n**Balance Sheet Highlights (in thousands)**\n\nTotal Liabilities\n\n* 2018- 0.91B\n* 2019- 1.22B\n* 2020- 1.63B\n* Current- 2.05B\n\n\\*Total Liabilities have increased by 125% in three years\n\nLong Term Debt (LTD)\n\n* 2018- 0.43B\n* 2019- 0.46B\n* 2020- 0.47B\n* Current- 0.74B\n\n\\*LTD has increased by 72% in three years\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio (DE)\n\n* 2018- 0.53\n* 2019- 0.81\n* 2020- 1.14\n* Current- 3.05\n\n\\*DE Ratio has increased by 475% in three years\n\n**Customers**\n\n* Apple\n* Visa\n* Citgo\n* Samsung\n* Facebook\n* Deloitte\n* T-Mobile\n* BMW Group\n* Unilever\n* AstraZeneca\n* Santander\n* Salesforce\n\n**Competitors**\n\n* Adobe Sign\n* signNow\n* GetAccept\n* HelloSign\n* DocHub\n\n**Stock Price History**\n\n* 2018- $40\n* 2019- $75\n* 2020- $245\n* Current- $280\n\n\\*Stock price has increased by 600% in three years\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\tDocuSign is leading us into the future with its electronic capabilities. Say goodbye to formal paper agreements. DocuSign makes it easy to sign agreements. No more going into the office to sign a contract. No more losing your documents. All the documents are stored in the cloud making your agreements easy to find. Some of the top-performing fortune 500 companies use DocuSign. If they back them, why shouldn't you? COVID-19 has had a positive effect on DOCU. DOCU has been able to capitalize on all the people working from home during the pandemic. This can be proven by the massive increase in market cap. This can also be proven by the PE, PS, and PB ratios. I believe those who have transitioned to DOCU during the pandemic have no reason to switch back to paper. I believe we're going to see more companies make the switch from paper to the cloud whether or not they choose DocuSign. The digital era requires digital solutions. I believe DOCU is a good long-term investment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice\\*\\**\n\n*\\*\\*Do your own research\\*\\**",
