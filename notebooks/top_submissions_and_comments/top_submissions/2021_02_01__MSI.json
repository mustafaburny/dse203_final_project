        "selftext": "-SHITPOST-\n\nTLDR: liftoff is a waiting process. Hold on to your hair, and your bladder..\n\nLate 2000s. Knotts Berry Farm. It has all the typical rides that any theme park would have. The half-pipe, the weird and fun twisty ones, and the water ride that would wet your gonads like a $20 hooker about to pass out from sucking a bunch of pp all day. \u201cHmm, tongue swipes..\u201d you think to yourself. \u201cCool.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve just gotten off this ride and you\u2019re about to hop on the next one, the Accelerator. Now this fucking thing. This fucking ride is something. You\u2019ve been looking forward to this one all day. Simply put, it has the mechanics of a Tesla before Tesla\u2019s we\u2019re even cool. 0-60 in under 4 seconds? You think, \u201cShit, sign me up.\u201d Meanwhile, your crotch is drying off from those pitiful wank-licks you just received. You\u2019ll end up hopping on this one with dry pants and a new vigor. Among one of its characteristics is the massive vertical loop. You see people entering the ride and subsequently hold on for dear life to any part of the visibly worn metal guards as they rocket past the loading zone and scream with delight. Shouldn\u2019t have done your hair today. It gives off the appearance of wet, freshly cut grass plumps after a ride. \u201cOh well..\u201d you think to yourself.\n\nWhile you\u2019re waiting in the line for the ride, you come to notice the heat. It\u2019s a standing heat and it really bothers you all of a sudden. Because of that, you begin to notice the smell. Oh god, some kid just farted in front of you. What you would do to give that little shit a lecture, but you can\u2019t. His parents are right there with him. Okay, besides the heat and essence of booty particles, what els- \u201cwaiting!\u201d Why the fuck do you and a bunch of other people commit to waiting in this godforsaken line together? Being a retard, you know you should\u2019ve bought the express pass for an extra $20. \n\n\u201cWell fuck.\u201d You have another 10 minutes before it\u2019s your turn on the ride. \u201cMight as well check my phone.\u201d -a Motorola Razr. You pull it out and flex that shit in front of the crowds around you, but you realize everyone around you has one. Feelings of insecurity arise. \u201cDamn. This phone ain\u2019t that special..\u201d you think to yourself as you\u2019ve slowly inched up to the next in line on the Accelerator. \n\nYou feel a woosh of air as the rollercoaster blasts off out of the sight of everyone as they\u2019ve entered a vertical climb to the heavens. After about a minute, the carts come back to their stationary position right in front of you. \u201cProbably shouldn\u2019t have put that product in my hair. Shit\u2019s all messed up by now.\u201d By now, you\u2019ve totally forgotten about that sorry, fart-particle homunculus as you line up. Your crotch is nice and dry now as you adjust your pants to fit comfortably in your seat. \n\nYour palms have begun to sweat a little bit as you make your way inside the cart. Your heart starts beating a little bit faster. When the ride operator checks with you, he asks if you\u2019re doing all right. You choke up for a second as you make eye contact and just give him a passive thumbs up. He walks away. Eyes now back in front. They expand as you subconsciously know what\u2019s coming. Your hearing dials in and begins to muffle out what anyone else is saying. You\u2019re having second thoughts about this ride. Too late. You\u2019re strapped in. Time begins to slow. You attempt to take a deep breath. Nope. You instantly feel your back get jammed into your seat as you accelerate. \u201cTongue swipes now?\u201d you think as you feel a sense of warmth in that fleeting moment.\n\n\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "**(CSE: HP) (Frankfurt: 27H) (OTC: HLLPF)**\n\nSome interesting developments have happened since I last posted about Hello Pal that I wanted to post an update.\n\n**Hello Pal Launches User Bitcoin Mining Initiative**:\n\nOn February 17th, Hello Pal announced it is expanding its partnership with Shanghai Yitang Data Technology Co. Ltd to launch the Crypto-Mining initiative, which will give Hello Pal users the ability to participate in Bitcoin and Ethereum mining in a simple and convenient way\n\nYitang currently manages 35,000 mining machines spread across the North, North West and South East parts of China and has pre-existing contractual arrangements with mining machine vendors to acquire more in the future. Through Yitang, Hello Pal users can purchase Bitcoin and Ethereum mining machines (or fractional purchases), and have the machines hosted and operated by Yitang. Users can expect the mined cryptocurrency to be credited to their digital wallet each day.\n\nThe unique platform will allow Hello Pal users to become active in mining Bitcoin and Ethereum, something that is too expensive and complex for most everyday people. Cryptocurrency miners earn tokens for being the first to solve complex solutions to hashing puzzles, effectively building \u201cblocks\u201d for the blockchain in which data is securely stored.\n\nThe Bitcoin mining machines (Whatsminer M31S) each have a hash rate of 74T hash/s operating at an efficiency of 44w/T, while the Ethereum machines have MSI 5700 graphics cards at their core with an estimated hash rate of 400M. With each crypto machine purchase, all users can now mine BTC and ETH to learn and create value within their own crypto wallets on the platform.\n\nThe recent activity and interest in cryptocurrency presents us with a unique opportunity to introduce cryptocurrency to our users, as well as to bring cryptocurrency users to our platform.\n\n**Hello Pal Announces Fully Subscribed $2 Million Private Placement**\n\nToday, Hello Pal has announced that it has completed a its fully subscribed private placement financing of 5,000,000 units at at $0.40 per Unit for gross proceeds of $2,000,000\n\nEach unit is comprised of one common share of the Company and one-half of one share purchase warrant. Hello Pal will use the proceeds of the Offering for growth initiatives of its Hello Pal ecosystem as well as working capital purposes.\n\n**Hello Pal is Growing Quickly!!**\n\n* The launch of their Bitcoin mining initiative comes after Hello Pall achieved over $2,794,798 CAD in revenue for the month of January 2021, representing a 32% increase MoM. For 2020, Hello Pal has seen an average revenue of approximately $1,000,000 CAD.\n* Hello Pal\u2019s registered user base now consists of over 5.4 million users from over 200 countries and region. **The five million user mark is an industry standard benchmark of success**. Crossing the 5 million user benchmark enables Hello Pal to be examined more seriously among peers as comparables.\n* Its Asian subsidiary (its largest market) has been cashflow positive since October 2020. Hello Pal is continuing its expansion to reach more users across the world. Revenue from users outside of China now accounts for 10% of its total revenue, having increased from 6.5% on December and 3% in November 2020.\n\nThis is exciting news for this company and I am excited to see the direction they are heading.\n\nDisclaimer: This is not investment advice. Please do your own research!",
