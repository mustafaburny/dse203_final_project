        "selftext": "VSMAX is one of vanguard's small cap index index funds, yet when I looked up their holdings, I found that their largest holdings are ZBRA, ETSY, TER, and HUBS.\n\nThose 4 companies are approx $20B companies, which puts them into Large cap, not small.  Based on various google search sources, my definition of small is &lt;$2B.\n\nThe VSMAX prospectus references the MSCI Small Cap 1750 index, which has similar large cap companies for its top holdings.\n\nMaybe a case could be built for Etsy, seeing how most sales there are from tiny startups in people's garages, although I would generally classify those businesses as micro or nano caps.  Even if that's the reason, then couldn't the same logic apply to Amazon or eBay (which I don't think anyone would consider as small caps either)?\n\nAlso, even if that's the reason, that logic doesn't really work for Teradyne either though.\n\nSo, all this is to say \"what gives?\". Is there something I'm missing here?",
