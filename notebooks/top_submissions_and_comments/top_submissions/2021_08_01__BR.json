Shares down $10, or 14.2%, near $60 this afternoon after spiking 50% on the first day of options trading, with option volume on pace for 250k contracts and calls leading puts 4:3 as implied volatility drops nearly 40 points to about 160% in the September term. With five new weekly expiries listed and strikes now ranging from 5 to to $170, option flow is spreading out across ten listed terms, while the Aug 70 calls hold the most-active slot for the 2nd day, 15k trading in the $5-$9 range. Largest option trade in Robinhood today is a spread in December where data suggests a buyer paid a net $54.30 for 1500 Dec 90 puts and Dec 100 calls at midday as shares traded $61.15. This $8.14M premium trade opens on both legs with a moderately bearish delta of about 12k shares and a relatively hefty $41k in vega. Given the current ivol near 130% out there, the trader may be looking for volatility to snap back toward yesterday's 150 range.",

        "selftext": "There are three fairly basic ways that new traders lose money in 2021:\n\n**1)** They read some elaborate post about how some piece of garbage stock is the next MEME explosion.  To their newbie eyes the extensive DD looked convincing, and the stock is *only* $10 a share right now, so they they buy 1,000 shares.  And then they average down another 1,000. Two months later they are being told by the same people that were wrong about their DD to begin with,  to hold on to the now, $8 stock.  Even worse, they now believe that selling that stock is \"exactly what the evil hedge funds want you to do!\".  A few months after that they are questioning their life choices and stuck with a useless $4 stock.\n\n**2)** Most YouTube videos are geared towards trying to sell you a method of Day Trading that is based on *Gap n Go* strategies.  These methods, while real, are far more difficult than they are made to appear, but yet they are very marketable (i.e. \"how to turn $5,000 into $50,000!\").  Instead what happens is new traders become singularly focused on finding low float, highly shorted stocks that jump up after the open, convinced they are moments away from the next big score.  Once again, months later they are questioning their life choices and stuck with an account that has dropped far below the PDT requirements\n\nAnd finally that brings us to OTM options:\n\n**3)** Slightly more sophisticated than the first two methods of losing your money, this one requires actual thought and analysis.  \n\nThe appeal is obvious - they are cheap.  And if the stock explodes those options can double, triple, etc in value.  \n\nHere's why they don't work - The options themselves have no real value other than the pure premium you are paying.  When *buying* options, your goal should always be to pay as little premium as possible.  Ideally you would have options at total parity (i.e. Stock is at $100 and the $99 Call Option is worth - $1).  \n\nSimple formula here for ITM Options - (Strike Price + Option Price) - Stock Price = Premium you are paying.\n\nSimpler formula for OTM Options - Option Price = Premium you are paying.\n\nSo let's take an example -\n\nYou like **CSCO,** it is smart pick, the daily chart looks good, it is past earnings (and seriously, please stop holding options over earnings) and looks like clear skies ahead.  Two choices:\n\n56 Strike Call, Expires Aug 27th for $2.35\n\n59 Strike Call, Expires Aug 27th for .30 cents\n\nLet's say you are going to spend $500 - so you can get 2 of the 56 Calls or 16 of the 59 Calls.  \n\nIf next week CSCO hardly moves at all (current at $58.22), your 56 calls will be worth $2.22 - a loss of only 13 cents per call or $26.  \n\nHowever, in that same scenario, your 59 calls will expire worthless, a loss of $480.  \n\nOK, let's say CSCO goes up $1 next week, it is now at $59.22 - \n\nYour 56 Calls are now worth $3.22 (at expiration), a profit of .87 per call or $174.\n\nYour 59 calls are now worth .22 a loss of .08 per Call or -$128.\n\n**OTM Options place heavy lifting on the stock to get you to profitability.  You are betting on a huge move in the stock that pull your options ITM faster than Theta strips away their value.**    \n\n***You are almost always better off going with ITM options, that have a Delta of .6 or higher and are at least a week out, if not more.***  \n\nIn fact, if you just stuck to these three rules it would increase you likelihood of success a great deal:\n\n**1) Do not trade Options over earnings, trade them before, trade them after, but do not hold them** ***over*** **the earnings announcement.**\n\n**2) Do not go for the cheaper OTM options, instead choose Calls or Puts that have a higher Delta and are farther out in time.**\n\n**3) Do not trade Option Spreads unless you know how to leg out of them if they do not go your way.**\n\n(the 3rd one may seem like a small issue, but the number of people that get stuck in spreads they do not know how to exit is alarmingly high).\n\nThis advice may seem basic to some traders here, but if you look at the posts on this forum you will quickly see that the foundational rules you may have been following as a trader aren't as obvious as you think.  New traders clearly do not know these basic principles and we should stop assuming they do.",

        "selftext": "I posted [my July earnings trading report](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/ov71vv/my_july_earnings_report/) last month, and many of you were kind enough to share your thoughts with me.\n\nTLDR: My July results were almost a scratch, $93 into a positive column, and I was undecided if trading earnings is a worthwhile thing.\n\nFast forward to the end of August\u2026 I couldn\u2019t keep away from earnings, just love trading them.\n\nHere are my August stats:\n\n* 21 earnings trades (short condors and strangles, all small positions, average BPu $532.85 per position)\n* 19 wins and 2 losses. A win rate - 90%. Better than July\u2019s 77%. A little experience helps!\n* My wins brought in $567.68\n* Losses took away $104.00\n* Net profit $463.68.\n\nWins: ABNB, BBY, CRM, CSCO, DASH, GPS, HPQ, INTU, M, MRVL, NVDA, PTON, SNOW, SPLK, TGT, TJX, ULTA, URBN, WDC\n\nLosses: LOW, JWN\n\nThe wins are great - no doubt. But it is the losses that are really interesting and have a high learning value. My losses show my indecision between two lines of thought: to defend a losing trade or to exit ASAP to minimize the loss. I have seen convincing arguments for both approaches, and am not yet sure where I stand on this.\n\nI managed my losing LOW trade fairly well in the beginning, brought it from several hundred down to around $30 loss. I could have brought it to a win, but I made a mistake - misread where I was standing and exited for a small loss. I learned how to read the position correctly and did another losing trade right - turned it into a win.\n\nI decided to take a loss on JWN because my overall win rate for August was around 93% and I thought I could afford a small loss. But now I think it could\u2019ve been managed and perhaps turned. But we\u2019ll never know if it could and if I had the skill to do it.\n\nWhere do you stand on this question? Do you defend? Or take a loss and move on to the next trade?",

        "selftext": "**Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation and Analysis (Q2 Week 6) - $RBLX, $NVDA, $WMT, $HD, $CSCO, $TGT, $LOW and More**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat\u2019s poppin\u2019 bull gang, Flux here with your weekly Historical Post Earnings Moves spreadsheet! Last weeks theme was selling options, and boy did we sell! **$APPS short strangles returned close to 100%, with $BIDU following closely behind netting around 80%. Meme stocks also had muted volatility. I sold an $AMC 34 strangle for $630, and although I closed early, I was given the opportunity to close it out at the end of the week for mere pennies on the dollar. Last but not least, a long strangle on $UPST would\u2019ve netted you a whopping 460% return!** Unfortunately for us, earnings season is slowly coming to a close, meaning the quality of our plays will be diminishing greatly! Those looking to trade this week should proceed with caution, as there isn\u2019t much of an edge to be gained this time round. If you wish to track my trades and try them out for yourself, feel free to check out the community links on my profile! Let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don\u2019t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn\u2019t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It\u2019s literally all just gambling, and as a result I\u2019m probably gonna sit this week out entirely. Pay little attention to the sample plays below, as I\u2019ve only included them for inspiration, and in case anyone sees something I may have missed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Selling $DNUT puts may prove to be profitable.** Although justified, Krispy Kreme has been on a downtrend since its IPO. $DNUT is literally hemorrhaging money and fundamentally the company is a terrible investment. A couple of years ago they actually went private after defrauding investors, doing shady audit practices, and literally using company money to buy back stores owned by family members of the executive board for FIVE TIMES what they were worth. More info on that [here.](https://www.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2009/03/three-krispy-kreme-ex-execs-settle-sec-charges/) Nowadays, the stock is priced as what it is - a fraudulent, cash burning business. Earnings is priced to fail, and as a result, any semblance of positive news will likely send us going upwards. If you have the balls, selling puts may prove to be profitable. The 15P is going for $0.80 giving you a breakeven of around 5.5%. You can even pickup pennies in front of the steamroller and sell the 12.5P for $0.05, giving you a breakeven of 17%. Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we\u2019re going up.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing. Options are pricing a 2% move, while historically Cisco moves around 5%. Given that prices remain the same or get cheaper by earnings, a strangle should net you some nice profits. If you\u2019re poor or want a binary directional play, I\u2019d look to buy puts. $CSCO is at ATHs so we\u2019re probably gonna do the classic \u201cdump after earnings regardless of the outcome\u201c thing that everyone seems to get tricked by. Regardless, at the time of writing, $CSCO strangles give us nice edge.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll that being said, there aren\u2019t many trades to run this time round! If I notice anything extra during this week, I\u2019ll look to keep you guys posted on my socials. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nAll in all, pretty awful week for trading. Most tickers are complete garbage, and there\u2019s little edge to be gained among those that aren\u2019t. No shame in sitting this one out! That being said, if you see any appealing plays I\u2019ve missed, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you\u2019d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**",

Last weeks theme was selling options, and boy did we sell! **$APPS short strangles returned close to 100%, with $BIDU following closely behind netting around 80%. Meme stocks also had muted volatility. I sold an $AMC 34 strangle for $630, and although I closed early, I was given the opportunity to close it out at the end of the week for mere pennies on the dollar. Last but not least, a long strangle on $UPST would\u2019ve netted you a whopping 460% return!** Unfortunately for us, earnings season is slowly coming to a close, meaning the quality of our plays will be diminishing greatly! Those looking to trade this week should proceed with caution, as there isn\u2019t much of an edge to be gained this time round. If you wish to track my trades and try them out for yourself, feel free to check out the community links on my profile! Let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don\u2019t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn\u2019t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It\u2019s literally all just gambling, and as a result I\u2019m probably gonna sit this week out entirely. Pay little attention to the sample plays below, as I\u2019ve only included them for inspiration, and in case anyone sees something I may have missed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Selling $DNUT puts may prove to be profitable.** Although justified, Krispy Kreme has been on a downtrend since its IPO. $DNUT is literally hemorrhaging money and fundamentally the company is a terrible investment. A couple of years ago they actually went private after defrauding investors, doing shady audit practices, and literally using company money to buy back stores owned by family members of the executive board for FIVE TIMES what they were worth. More info on that [here.](https://www.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2009/03/three-krispy-kreme-ex-execs-settle-sec-charges/) Nowadays, the stock is priced as what it is - a fraudulent, cash burning business. Earnings is priced to fail, and as a result, any semblance of positive news will likely send us going upwards. If you have the balls, selling puts may prove to be profitable. The 15P is going for $0.80 giving you a breakeven of around 5.5%. You can even pickup pennies in front of the steamroller and sell the 12.5P for $0.05, giving you a breakeven of 17%. Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we\u2019re going up.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing. Options are pricing a 2% move, while historically Cisco moves around 5%. Given that prices remain the same or get cheaper by earnings, a strangle should net you some nice profits. If you\u2019re poor or want a binary directional play, I\u2019d look to buy puts. $CSCO is at ATHs so we\u2019re probably gonna do the classic \u201cdump after earnings regardless of the outcome\u201c thing that everyone seems to get tricked by. Regardless, at the time of writing, $CSCO strangles give us nice edge.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll that being said, there aren\u2019t many trades to run this time round! If I notice anything extra during this week, I\u2019ll look to keep you guys posted on my socials. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nAll in all, pretty awful week for trading. Most tickers are complete garbage, and there\u2019s little edge to be gained among those that aren\u2019t. No shame in sitting this one out! That being said, if you see any appealing plays I\u2019ve missed, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you\u2019d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**",

More info on that [here.](https://www.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2009/03/three-krispy-kreme-ex-execs-settle-sec-charges/) Nowadays, the stock is priced as what it is - a fraudulent, cash burning business. Earnings is priced to fail, and as a result, any semblance of positive news will likely send us going upwards. If you have the balls, selling puts may prove to be profitable. The 15P is going for $0.80 giving you a breakeven of around 5.5%. You can even pickup pennies in front of the steamroller and sell the 12.5P for $0.05, giving you a breakeven of 17%. Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we\u2019re going up.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing. Options are pricing a 2% move, while historically Cisco moves around 5%. Given that prices remain the same or get cheaper by earnings, a strangle should net you some nice profits. If you\u2019re poor or want a binary directional play, I\u2019d look to buy puts. $CSCO is at ATHs so we\u2019re probably gonna do the classic \u201cdump after earnings regardless of the outcome\u201c thing that everyone seems to get tricked by. Regardless, at the time of writing, $CSCO strangles give us nice edge.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll that being said, there aren\u2019t many trades to run this time round! If I notice anything extra during this week, I\u2019ll look to keep you guys posted on my socials.

Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nAll in all, pretty awful week for trading. Most tickers are complete garbage, and there\u2019s little edge to be gained among those that aren\u2019t. No shame in sitting this one out!

Last but not least, a long strangle on $UPST would\u2019ve netted you a whopping 460% return!** Unfortunately for us, earnings season is slowly coming to a close, meaning the quality of our plays will be diminishing greatly! Those looking to trade this week should proceed with caution, as there isn\u2019t much of an edge to be gained this time round. If you wish to track my trades and try them out for yourself, feel free to check out the community links on my profile! Let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table!

Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don\u2019t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn\u2019t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It\u2019s literally all just gambling, and as a result I\u2019m probably gonna sit this week out entirely.

        "selftext": "(TSX:WELL)\n\nI\u2019m sure everyone has heard a lot about WELL Health - it was a pretty hot stock a couple months ago but I haven\u2019t been seeing much on them recently. I guess the novelty of the company started to wear off and people began to ask if WELL could continue to rise over the long term or if it was just a one-time thing due to the increased demand for virtual healthcare services amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The company has clearly done a great job recently with the expansions and acquisitions that they have been pursuing, including CRH and MyHealth, in order to diversify their exposure and I think WELL\u2019s beyond impressive Q2 results make it safe to say they aren\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nWELL achieved a record quarterly revenue of $61.8 million during the quarter, compared to revenue of $10.6 million generated during Q2-2020, an increase of 484% driven primarily by the CRH acquisition, which accounted for revenue of $36.7 million during the quarter. The company also produced positive EBITDA for the third consecutive quarter which is a great sign. With their own portfolio of over 25 clinics plus over 40 that were added from their acquisition of MyHealth, they are now the largest outpatient clinic operator in Canada. From a patient perspective, WELL\u2019s omni-channel patient visits grew by 19 per cent from quarter-to-quarter, registering 559,008 total visits in the quarter with in-person visits accounting for 43 per cent of the quota.\n\nLast month, WELL formed WELL Ventures, a wholly owned subsidiary that\u2019s purpose is to invest in companies that share WELL\u2019s vision on healthcare. Historically, WELL has been successful at identifying strong businesses to invest in and they hope to use WELL Ventures to continue finding profitable business opportunities.\n\nThe CEO of WELL has also mentioned a NASDAQ listing in October. Recently announced was their partnership with renowned law firm Fenwick &amp; West, which helped Facebook, Amazon, Cisco, and Coinbase with their IPOs. This is important because WELL\u2019s equivalents in the US are currently trading at much higher multiples making this a unique opportunity to get on the gains.

        "selftext": "A UK court has approved an over \u00a310 billion ($14 billion) class action suit against financial services corporation Mastercard for overcharging fees to millions of British consumers using their credit cards for payments.\n\nBritain\u2019s first mass consumer class action suit with 46 million claimants was brought by former financial ombudsman Walter Merricks to the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), which formally approved it to proceed to trial on Wednesday.\n\nThe case will be probed under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which entitles claimants, both consumers and small businesses, to compensation for Mastercard\u2019s alleged anti-competitive behavio\n\n\u201c*Mastercard has thrown everything at trying to prevent this claim going forward, but today its efforts have failed*,\u201d Merricks said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nMerricks alleges that the global payments system charged unreasonably high interchange fees between May 1992 and June 2008, which resulted in higher prices for consumers and violated EU competition laws. The fees in question are paid by retailers to card-issuing companies when consumers use their cards to shop. The class action suit has been brought on behalf of all individuals over 16 years of age who bought goods and services from UK businesses via Mastercard in the specified period.\n\nThe CAT has not, however, included Merrick\u2019s claim for compound interest and claims from the estates of consumers who died between 1992 and 2008 in the case. According to Mastercard, this reduced the claim\u2019s size to around \u00a310 billion from the initial \u00a315 billion. The company is hopeful that further proceedings will cut the overall claim even more.\n\n\u201c*The decision reduces the value of this spurious claim by more than 35%. Mastercard is confident that over the coming months a review of key facts will further significantly reduce the size and viability of the claim,*\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nMerricks said the CAT ruling \u201c*heralds the start of an era of consumer-focused class actions which will help to hold big business to account in areas that really matter.*\u201d\n\nNo date has been set for the trial yet. Previously, the European Commission ruled that Mastercard interchange fees violated the EU\u2019s competition law in 2007.\n\n[https://www.rt.com/business/532471-mastercard-class-action-lawsuit-uk/](https://www.rt.com/business/532471-mastercard-class-action-lawsuit-uk/)",

        "selftext": "Q2 Earnings: August 16 - premarket\n\nIn light of China\u2019s recent crackdown on payment processors, FinTech company Paysafe\u2019s strategic move last year to exit those high-risk revenue channels is looking pretty smart. This de-risking will temporarily dampen Q2 YoY revenue growth, as it did with Q1, however, their CC transcripts indicate that tactical exit will likely no longer affect YoY revenue going into Q3 and Q4.\n\nBut this upcoming earnings report is less about revenue growth than it is about forward guidance and updates on their ongoing restructuring, acquisition pipeline and how their recent deleveraging will affect margins and free cash flow.\n\nThey reported strong FCF growth last quarter and a recent CNNE quarterly report revealed that, along with recently paying down $1.2 billion in debt, upon a Moody's upgrade, Paysafe successfully refinanced their remaining debt. This, overall restructuring could translate to $150+ million in cost savings annually which can dramatically improve their profit, free cash flow and M&amp;A outlook: critical elements of their growth strategy.\n\n\n\nEPS\n\nEven if this ER is about forward guidance, there\u2019s a good chance for an EPS beat which will make Q2 Paysafe\u2019s first profitable quarter as a newly public company. Analysts\u2019 average EPS estimate is reported to be 0.01 or 0.02 (depending on the source). We know that in Q1, without the $90+ million in one-time, non-recurring expenses associated with going public and paying down $1.2B debt, they would have beat analysts estimates with a positive EPS. For Q2, they won\u2019t have those expenses so, unless they introduce new costs from refinancing or impairment expenses on intangible assets, there appears to be solid basis for an EPS beat. My loose guess is for 0.05 EPS or better. Not a big deal to me if it doesn\u2019t work out that way, but it\u2019s entirely plausible.\n\n\n\nRevenue\n\nRegarding revenue, even though Paysafe is already integrated as a payment processor with 75% of US iGaming operators, let\u2019s ignore the facts that\n\n* many new states have legalized sports betting during Q1/Q2 (see below),\n* Paysafe\u2019s Q2 revenue could be bolstered by the strong growth recently reported by its several partners like Wynn, Caesar\u2019s, DraftKings and Penn,\n* Paysafe has new revenue streams from recent deals with Coinbase, Microsoft/XBox, Luckbox, Wix, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, PointsBet, Virginia Lottery, Rent Moola, Provena, FoxBet, Golden Nugget etc.,\n* Paysafe said early Q2 was already showing signs of record growth: \u201cWe continue to be pleased with where the top-line trends are going. We've had some actual record days in e-commerce processing, historical records, not just recovery records, but historical records.\u201d\n* or that the American Gaming Association reports sports betting has generated $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2021, 20% more than all of 2020 combined ($1.5B).\n\nRather than speculate about how much of that new revenue will affect Paysafe\u2019s Q2 balance sheet, I prefer to keep my sights on analysts estimates and Paysafe\u2019s own guidance, which has conservatively excluded US iGaming growth projections (55% CAGR).\n\nPaysafe offers Q2 revenue guidance of $365 - $385 million. With $341 million in revenue for Q1\u201920, this represents 7% to 13% YoY quarterly growth. We\u2019ve seen very little reason for them to miss this guidance. Quite the contrary.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 average Q2 revenue estimate is reported to be between $371.5 million and $378 million (depending on the source). That's right in the middle of guidance. Last quarter, Paysafe came in at the upper range of their guidance which, given all the good news, suggests that there\u2019s a very good chance that they\u2019ll beat the analyst estimate. That would result in around 9% to 11% YoY quarterly growth, which would be a solid improvement from Q1.\n\nAs a long-term investor, I\u2019ll be happy with anything above 7%. From there, any upside surprise will be welcome.\n\nLast quarter, Paysafe confirmed their 2021 full year projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume. Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.\n\nThis confirmed guidance implies that Q3 and Q4 will likely represent stronger revenue growth to compensate for the sluggish Q1 growth due to the channel exits. By Q3, Paysafe's balance sheet should reflect their many new partnerships and new US state markets opening up to legalized sports betting.\n\n\n\nRecent Price Action\n\nAs Chairman of the Board Bill Foley recently noted, Paysafe \"has been unduly punished as the inevitable shareholder rotation plays out.\"\n\nOver the last few months many sources confirm regular and heavy intraday short volume (not short interest) which has successfully tanked the stock price on nothing but good news from the company. Meanwhile 13F filings continue to reveal institutions loading shares.\n\n\\[Side note: Some have a hard time wrapping their heads around this but the SEC allows this type of intraday price manipulation under the shield of making a market. It's a legal loophole that allows market makers to walk down (or up) the price to shake out weak hands in order to fill institutional orders by the end of each day. It doesn't help that many financial news outlets continue to misrepresent Paysafe\u2019s data, claiming they have only 4 employees and falsely reporting a massive Q1 EPS miss of -0.37 and -0.38 (Yahoo/CNBC). It was only 0.02. Such things can definitely deter investors who undertake proper due diligence so, hopefully, these outlets will get around to reporting accurate data.\\] But I digress.\n\nWhile the shenanigans have gone on, bringing the price near all time lows and pushing many retail shareholders to capitulation, Fintel reports institutions are accumulating 21 times more than they are selling. Very recent 13F\u2019s show Susquehanna increased their stake by 48% to over 3 million shares, Citigroup increased their position by 5000% to around 1.3 million shares, Bank of New York Mellon bought half a million shares and BlackRock just opened a new position of 8.3 million shares.\n\nBottom?\n\nWhoever has been pinning the stock down has always stopped near these current levels because its more or less the price paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares). In fact, the current price is likely below where Wells Fargo bought 13M shares, where BlackRock bought their 8.3M shares and where Blackstone took on another 37 million shares, according to their 13F's.\n\nThe current low price poses an interesting opportunity for value investors because, since those major fund managers decided to invest near this level, Paysafe has had zero bad news while steadily executing on their promised strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and as Bill Foley put it, \u201ccross-sell, cross-sell and cross-sell.\u201d\n\nSaid in another way, because Paysafe has excluded US iGaming growth from its projections, literally none of the following developments in value creation have yet been priced in:\n\n\n\n\t\u2022\tDec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments\n\n\t\u2022\tDec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n\n\t\u2022\tDec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers\n\n\t\u2022\tJan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform\n\n\t\u2022\tJan 13 \u2014 Paysafecard launches in Moldova\n\n\t\u2022\tFeb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform\n\n\t\u2022\tFeb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n\n\t\u2022\tFeb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n\n\t\u2022\tFeb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service\n\n\t\u2022\tFeb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n\n\t\u2022\tFeb 25 \u2014 Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models\n\n\t\u2022\tFeb 26 \u2014 Paysafe wins \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 4 \u2014 Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 18 \u2014 Paysafe announces new Board of Directors\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 19 \u2014 Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta\n\n\t\u2022\tMar 25 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase\n\n\t\u2022\tApril 1 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program\n\n\t\u2022\tApril 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1;

This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe).\n\n\t\u2022\tJuly 26 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair &amp; Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe\u2019s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel.\n\n\t\u2022\tJuly 27 \u2014 Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe\u2019s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership\n\n\t\u2022\tAug 2 \u2014 Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe\u2019s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE\u2019s Q4 top line a solid boost.\n\n\t\u2022\tAug 4 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe\u2019s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. \"Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe\u2019s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks.\" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe\u2019s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.)\n\n\t\u2022\tAug 9 \u2014 Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor\n\n\t\u2022\tAug 10 \u2014 Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division\n\n\n\nM&amp;A / inorganic growth\n\nAlong the lines of value creation, Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, \u201can aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.\u201d\n\nInorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. Yeah, that's 3,600X. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).\n\nThrough his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d 6,9\n\nFoley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: \u201cFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\n\n\nRounding out the Picture:\n\n\\#1 global leader in iGaming, #2 digital wallet in the world, and #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It has a transactional volume approaching $100 billion in over 40 currencies.\n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n\\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). 11 -- By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). 12\n\n\n\niGaming Expansion\n\nIt's worth repeating that Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s expertise in multi-jurisdictional regulations is an important aspect of its competitive MOAT (as discussed below). Paysafe is also an integrated back-end payment processor so many users don\u2019t realize they are utlizing their gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.\n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n\nFund manager Dan Loeb agrees: \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n\nCompass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d\n\nDel Grosso, who gave Paysafe a $19 price target added, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d 5 Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n* \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n* \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n* \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n* \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n* \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n* \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n* \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n* \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n* \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n* \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n* \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n* \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n* \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n* \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n* \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n\n\nAnalysts universally rate Paysafe as a \"BUY\"\n\nSome quotes :\n\nRBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d 4\n\nRBC recently reiterated their Outperform rating saying: \u201cOur positive thesis is predicated on three key points including: (1) PSFE has a unique set of assets within the payments space, in that it\u2019s a digital wallet, an integrated payment platform (with \\\\\\~50% tethered to online transactions), and provides an on ramp for cash to be digitized via eCash, and it\u2019s the combination of the three that create a two-sided market (serving both merchants &amp; consumers), (2) new secular growth opportunity in US iGaming, which is in its early innings and could surprise investors to the upside, and (3) Bill Foley (Non-Executive Chairman) and his team have a long history of driving share holder value, which we expect to continue at PSFE.\n\nBMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" 3\n\nEvercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' 2\n\n\n\nMOAT: \u201crobust risk management operation\u201d\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and how is it able offer eCommerce services to the unbanked?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d 9\n\n\n\nValuation\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\nPaysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n\nBy comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\nPaysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth (recent new acquisition) nor their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated. This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth. In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. Incorporating US iGaming growth will of course reveal a whole new picture.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up. Veteran market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n\n\nThis is not investment advice. For those who do want to invest in Paysafe, my only advice is to stay away from options. I\u2019ve watched this stock for a long time and the market makers have a track record of ruthlessly blowing up those positions. Common shares is the way.\n\n\n\nSources:\n\n(1) see institutional ownership (WSB won\u2019t allow link)\n\n(2) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)\n\n(3) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(4) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(5) [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10) [https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi](https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi)\n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)",

        "selftext": "Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe\u2019s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.\n\nLast week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%.  But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20% to an astonishingly low 3.85X price to sales.\n\nWhy did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : \u201cPaysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion.  They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs \\~ $105 billion)\n\nSo why the miss?  Analysts\u2019 modeling assumed that 2021\u2019s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation.\n\nThe company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%.\n\nGaps like that typically get filled if there\u2019s no material negative news.  On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion\n* Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA\n* Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million\n* Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus.\n* 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter)\n* 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture)\n* 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV)\n* Revenue growth in all segments\n* eCash revenue +37% YoY  (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries)\n* North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY\n* Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits)\n* Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance\n* Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs\n* Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage.\n* Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring &amp; E-commerce\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurther, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, \u201cPaysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing online markets.\u201d  Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America\u2019s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.)\n\nWith their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America.\n\nImportantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe\u2019s current projections don\u2019t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost.  Management noted, \u201cThese transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units\u2026The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.\u201d\n\nThis quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV.  Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1.\n\nChairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, \u201cWe see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.\u201d\n\nThese new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley\u2019s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&amp;A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts\u2019 neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality.  In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance.  Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted.\n\nPaysafe vs PayPal\n\nSeemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a \"free cash flow machine.\"  The author apparently didn\u2019t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal.\n\nIn fact, if you applied PayPal\u2019s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe\u2019s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow,  Paysafe\u2019s share price would be $32.  A 4x gain from current levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider:\n\n1. PayPal\u2019s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.)  On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY.  With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe.  Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe\u2019s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news.\n2. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk \u201cbuy now/pay later\u201d business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces.\n3. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe\u2019s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth.\n4. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe\u2019s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR).\n5. PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 425%.\n6. Based on Paysafe\u2019s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60\n7. Based on Paysafe\u2019s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal\u2019s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe\u2019s share price at $28.40.\n8. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt).  During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR.\n\n* By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR.\n* Paysafe hasn\u2019t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe\u2019s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal\u2019s share value growth of 460%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are obviously many different factors to consider so I\u2019m not making any claims about fair value here. It\u2019s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe\u2019s share price between $28 and $32.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome Background:\n\nPaysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing.\n\nAs an integrated back-end payment processor, most don\u2019t realize they are using Paysafe\u2019s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.  Within the industry, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews).\n\nBy contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews).\n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMOAT:\n\nPaysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its \u201crobust risk management.\u201d Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter.\n\nCEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem.

That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\niGaming Expansion\n\nPaysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape.\n\nImportantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas.

It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n\nFund manager Dan Loeb agrees: \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n\nCompass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d\n\nSome headlines since Del Grasso wrote \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d:\n\n* \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n* \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n* \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n* \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n* \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n* \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n* \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n* \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n* \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n* \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n* \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n* \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n* \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n* \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d (Paysafe is market leader in Canada)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares).\n\nThe current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors.  In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.\n\nEssentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in:\n\n* Dec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments\n* Dec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n* Dec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers\n* Jan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform\n* Jan 13 \u2014 Paysafecard launches in Moldova\n* Feb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform\n* Feb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n* Feb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n* Feb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models\n* Feb 26 \u2014 Paysafe wins \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award\n* Mar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n* Mar 4 \u2014 Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n* Mar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\\\\\n* Mar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan\n* Mar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases\n* Mar 18 \u2014 Paysafe announces new Board of Directors\n* Mar 19 \u2014 Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta\n* Mar 25 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase\n* April 1 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program\n* April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook\n* April 15 \u2014 Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador\n* April 21 \u2014 Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022\n* April 27 \u2014 Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers\n* April 29 \u2014 Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring\n* May 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving\n* May 20 \u2014 Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US\n* May 26 \u2014 REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments\n* June 1 \u2014 Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth\n* June 2 \u2014 Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe\n* June 3 \u2014 Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market\n* June 7 \u2014 Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments\n* June 23\u2014Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash\n* June 29 \u2014 Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan\n* June 30 \u2014 Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best \u2018Affiliate Software Supplier\u2019\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.\n* July 13 \u2014 Paysafe adds 20 new digital currencies to its digital wallet and expands this service to 11 new US states, bringing US presence to 48 states.\n* July 14 \u2014 Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution\n* July 19 \u2014 Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants.\n* July 20 \u2014 Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe\u2019s Income Access\n* July 21 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable \u2018banking-as-a-service\u2019 solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services.

This deal is a direct result of Paysafe\u2019s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. \"Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe\u2019s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks.\" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe\u2019s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.)\n* Aug 9 \u2014 Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor\n* Aug 10 \u2014 Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division\n* Aug 16 \u2014 Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30%\n* Aug 16 \u2014 Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay\n* Aug 22 \u2014 Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM&amp;A / inorganic growth\n\nBill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, \u201can aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.\u201d\n\nInorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge.  Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).\n\nThrough his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\nFoley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: \u201cFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nValuation Metrics:\n\nAbove I compared Paysafe with PayPal.  A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n\\- Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow.\n\n\\- By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\n\\- Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels.  In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth  But even if you include 2020\u2019s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not investment advice.  Just a collections of observations.  If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\nPaysafe Q2: [https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\\_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf)\n\nReuters : Paysafe $4.7B - [https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP](https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP)\n\nPayPal Q2: [https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\\_financials/2021/q2/Q2-21-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2-21-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nPayPal 2012 : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal)\n\nPayPal 2020 : [https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\\_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nPaysafe 2012 : [https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908](https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908)\n\nPaysafe 2020 - [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/psfe](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/psfe)\n\n[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)",

Popular analyst Steve Grasso has been calling for it to triple.\n\nUsing the lower end of Paysafe\u2019s forecasted EBITDA ($500M), $1.5B revenue, an EV adjusted for $1.8B debt, and applying the post-merger pro forma 720M outstanding shares, here are Paysafe\u2019s potential share prices based solely on sector peer **EV/EBITDA ratios:**\n\n\u2043 PayPal : $269B EV/ $4.47B EBITDA\n\n    \t= 60.2x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $28.2B EV / SP: $39.28    \n\n\u2043 Repay : $2.2B EV/ $30M EBITDA\n\n    \t = 73.3x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $34.8B EV / SP: $48.43    \n\n\u2043 Shift 4 : $7.7B EV/ $90M EBITDA\n\n    \t= 85x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $41B EV / SP: $56.91    \n\n\u2043 Nuvei : $15B EV/ $171M EBITDA\n\n    \t= 87.7x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $42B EV / SP: $58.40    \n\n\u2043 Adyen : $56B EV/ $273M EBITDA\n\n    \t= 205x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $101B EV / SP: $139    \n\n\u2043 Square : $107B EV/ $357M EBITDA\n\n    \t= 299.7x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $148B EV / SP: $205.64    \n\n\u2043 [Bill.com](https://bill.com/) : $13.2B EV/ -$15.6M EBITDA\n\n    \t= 308x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $152B EV / SP: $211.39    \n\n\u2043 Affirm: $21.6B EV/ -$68M EBITDA\n\n    \t= 317x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $156.7B EV /SP: $217.64    \n\nEV/Revenue ratio , non-public company\u2019s with estimated revenue per recent funding rounds:\n\n\u2043 Stripe : $95B EV/ $1.8B est. rev\n\n    \t= 52.8x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $77.3B EV / SP: $107.44    \n\n\u2043 Chime : $30B EV/ $600M est. rev\n\n    \t= 50x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $73.2B EV /SP: $101.67    \n\n\u2043 Checkout : $15B EV/ $100M est. rev\n\n    \t= 150x &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Paysafe $223.2B EV / SP: $310    \n\nNote: Most of these companies have negative earnings and smaller margins than Paysafe.\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting it\u2019s worth this much, but for reference, averaging the above multiples would put BFT/Paysafe\u2019s share price at $135.98\n\nMore realistically, taking the average from the lowest four puts the share price at $50.75.\n\nPaysafe is the number 1 digital wallet in Igaming and is used by the top sports gambling company Draftkings. As all SPACs do now, it sold off big today with the ticker change so there has never been a better time to buy than now!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEssential DD on PSFE:\n\nPaysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPartnered with Coinbase, Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, and Pointsbet among many others.\n\nVoted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n\nPaysafe has the #2 digital wallet globally with a presence in 120 countries. They own Skrill, which is enabled for CTC trading.\n\nIn Europe, where Paysafe is more known, Trustpilot rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) with over 29,000 reviews, and Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews. They are currently laying the groundwork for their US expansion.\n\nUnlike any other payment processor, Paysafecard enables those without bank accounts or credit cards (the over 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d) to engage in online commerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.\n\nPaysafe\u2019s industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are slow to enter. CEO Philip McHugh: \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\nIn Q1 Paysafe had $90 million in one-time expenses associated with merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. This means without those expenses they would have beat analysts estimates and, going forward, they are well positioned to beat analysts EPS estimates for the rest of the year.\n\nRecent debt management, saving around $92 million annually, secures higher margins and higher profits which will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.\n\nPaysafe confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 growth projection which doesn\u2019t include planned inorganic M&amp;A growth pipeline and iGaming expansion (55% CAGR).\n\nFrom 2017 to 2019, under Blackstone/CVC stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion. (28% CAGR) 2020 saw revenue stagnate due to Covid-related business closures and high-risk channel exits but, even so, if you add 2020\u2019s performance, 2017-2020 still amounts to a respectable 18% CAGR, roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth.\n\nBuy rating from all seven analysts covering Paysafe, with 50-70% upside from current price but, with everything noted above, it\u2019s clear that Paysafe would still be significantly undervalued when compared to a basket of comps (PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign) with a collective growth rate of \\~12.5% (in Paysafe\u2019s 10-13% range):\n\nPaysafe's price based on sector peer multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\nValuation Notes:\n\n* Removed all high outliers in each category putting PSFE at $100+\n* Unlike Paysafe's reported $362 million in free cash flow (on track to increase 29%) and 30%+ EBITDA margin, half of peers report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.\n* Paysafe has better EPS than over half of the peer group\n* Paysafe has better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them\n\nChairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, Bill Foley, has a proven track record in generating value for his investors through rapid synergistic inorganic growth. This is a key strategic pillar for Paysafe. Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). He says, \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Buy the DIP",

This valuation was conservative as Paysafe did not have any growth in 2020 due to Covid.   \n\n\n2B of the money was used to pay the debt which means investors got a good deal at $10 with market cap at 7B. Which means either Bill Foley paid 2 billion more or blackstone received 2 billion less. Either way, investors got a 2B discount. Fast forward to now, the market cap is at 6 billion with revised upwards guidance for the year at 1.55b compared to 1.5b, with 23% growth excluding divested business. This is impressive as in just over a year, they grew from 0 growth to 23% growth and increasing their operating income margins from 10+% to over 30%, helping them to their first ever net positive income quarter. \n\nHowever, as we know shorts attacked it just as any SPACS. What separates it from other SPACS was the valuation initially at 9B was already undervalued unlike many clean energy SPACS which has lofty valuation and unrealistic projections. Paysafe was projected base on 0 growth in 2020, and a mere 10% annual growth. \n\nFurthermore, given many recent fintech acquisition such as square acquiring of afterpay is upwards of 20x revenue. FB and Paypal have both indicate they see the digital wallet segment as a game changer, whereby Paysafe is already a established player in the segment for 10 years and is still further growing due to igaming. Microvision being a rumored acquisition for microsoft sustain its p/s ratio at over 800. In comparision, Paysafe p/s ratio is now under 4.\n\nI am sure everyone have see different analysis all putting its target price from 15 upwards to 45.\n\nLooking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \\~12.5% (not far from Paysafe\u2019s minimum 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign among others:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\nAfter eliminating outliers with highest multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.\n2. Used low end of Paysafe's projections and factored in debt and high-end of potential dilution.\n3. As noted Paysafe\u2019s 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&amp;A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth, which constitutes a third of their revenue.\n4. The above comps were taken during a sector-wide pull-back and do not reflect recent fintech gains since Jamie Dimon\u2019s \"enormous competitive threats\" comment.\n\nThis is not any financial advice, but I am just a nerd that all in on Paysafe at 8.2",

        "selftext": "Q2 Earnings: August 16 - premarket\n\nTLDR: Institutions are currently buying 21x more than selling while it trades near all time low. None of the long list below has been priced in yet.\n\nIn light of China\u2019s recent crackdown on payment processors, FinTech company Paysafe\u2019s strategic move last year to exit those high-risk revenue channels is looking pretty smart. This de-risking will temporarily dampen Q2 YoY revenue growth, as it did with Q1, however, their CC transcripts indicate that tactical exit will likely no longer affect YoY revenue going into Q3 and Q4.\n\nBut this upcoming earnings report is less about revenue growth than it is about forward guidance and updates on their ongoing restructuring, acquisition pipeline and how their recent deleveraging will affect margins and free cash flow.\n\nThey reported strong FCF growth last quarter and a recent CNNE quarterly report revealed that, along with recently paying down $1.2 billion in debt, upon a Moody's upgrade, Paysafe successfully refinanced their remaining debt. This, overall restructuring could translate to $150+ million in cost savings annually which can dramatically improve their profit, free cash flow and M&amp;A outlook: critical elements of their growth strategy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEPS\n\nEven if this ER is about forward guidance, there\u2019s a good chance for an EPS beat which will make Q2 Paysafe\u2019s first profitable quarter as a newly public company. Analysts\u2019 average EPS estimate is reported to be 0.01 or 0.02 (depending on the source). We know that in Q1, without the $90+ million in one-time, non-recurring expenses associated with going public and paying down $1.2B debt, they would have beat analysts estimates with a positive EPS. For Q2, they won\u2019t have those expenses so, unless they introduce new costs from refinancing or impairment expenses on intangible assets, there appears to be solid basis for an EPS beat. My loose guess is for 0.05 EPS or better. Not a big deal to me if it doesn\u2019t work out that way, but it\u2019s entirely plausible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRevenue\n\nRegarding revenue, even though Paysafe is already integrated as a payment processor with 75% of US iGaming operators, let\u2019s ignore the facts that\n\n* many new states have legalized sports betting during Q1/Q2 (see below),\n* Paysafe\u2019s Q2 revenue could be bolstered by the strong growth recently reported by its several partners like Wynn, Caesar\u2019s, DraftKings and Penn,\n* Paysafe has new revenue streams from recent deals with Coinbase, Microsoft/XBox, Luckbox, Wix, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, PointsBet, Virginia Lottery, Rent Moola, Provena, FoxBet, Golden Nugget etc.,\n* Paysafe said early Q2 was already showing signs of record growth: \u201cWe continue to be pleased with where the top-line trends are going. We've had some actual record days in e-commerce processing, historical records, not just recovery records, but historical records.\u201d\n* or that the American Gaming Association reports sports betting has generated $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2021, 20% more than all of 2020 combined ($1.5B).\n\nRather than speculate about how much of that new revenue will affect Paysafe\u2019s Q2 balance sheet, I prefer to keep my sights on analysts estimates and Paysafe\u2019s own guidance, which has conservatively excluded US iGaming growth projections (55% CAGR).\n\nPaysafe offers Q2 revenue guidance of $365 - $385 million. With $341 million in revenue for Q1\u201920, this represents 7% to 13% YoY quarterly growth. We\u2019ve seen very little reason for them to miss this guidance. Quite the contrary.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 average Q2 revenue estimate is reported to be between $371.5 million and $378 million (depending on the source). That's right in the middle of guidance. Last quarter, Paysafe came in at the upper range of their guidance which, given all the good news, suggests that there\u2019s a very good chance that they\u2019ll beat the analyst estimate. That would result in around 9% to 11% YoY quarterly growth, which would be a solid improvement from Q1.\n\nAs a long-term investor, I\u2019ll be happy with anything above 7%. From there, any upside surprise will be welcome.\n\nLast quarter, Paysafe confirmed their 2021 full year projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume. Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.\n\nThis confirmed guidance implies that Q3 and Q4 will likely represent stronger revenue growth to compensate for the sluggish Q1 growth due to the channel exits. By Q3, Paysafe's balance sheet should reflect their many new partnerships and new US state markets opening up to legalized sports betting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecent Price Action\n\nAs Chairman of the Board Bill Foley recently noted, Paysafe \"has been unduly punished as the inevitable shareholder rotation plays out.\"\n\nOver the last few months many sources confirm regular and heavy intraday short volume (not short interest) which has successfully tanked the stock price on nothing but good news from the company. Meanwhile 13F filings continue to reveal institutions loading shares.\n\n\\[Side note: Some have a hard time wrapping their heads around this but the SEC allows this type of intraday price manipulation under the shield of making a market. It's a legal loophole that allows market makers to walk down (or up) the price to shake out weak hands in order to fill institutional orders by the end of each day. It doesn't help that many financial news outlets continue to misrepresent Paysafe\u2019s data, claiming they have only 4 employees and falsely reporting a massive Q1 EPS miss of -0.37 and -0.38 (Yahoo/CNBC). It was only 0.02. Such things can definitely deter investors who undertake proper due diligence so, hopefully, these outlets will get around to reporting accurate data.\\] But I digress.\n\nWhile the shenanigans have gone on, bringing the price near all time lows and pushing many retail shareholders to capitulation, Fintel reports institutions are accumulating 21 times more than they are selling. Very recent 13F\u2019s show Susquehanna increased their stake by 48% to over 3 million shares, Citigroup increased their position by 5000% to around 1.3 million shares, Bank of New York Mellon bought half a million shares and BlackRock just opened a new position of 8.3 million shares.\n\nBottom?\n\nWhoever has been pinning the stock down has always stopped near these current levels because its more or less the price paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares). In fact, the current price is likely below where Wells Fargo bought 13M shares, where BlackRock bought their 8.3M shares and where Blackstone took on another 37 million shares, according to their 13F's.\n\nThe current low price poses an interesting opportunity for value investors because, since those major fund managers decided to invest near this level, Paysafe has had zero bad news while steadily executing on their promised strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and as Bill Foley put it, \u201ccross-sell, cross-sell and cross-sell.\u201d\n\nSaid in another way, because Paysafe has excluded US iGaming growth from its projections, literally none of the following developments in value creation have yet been priced in:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Dec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments\n* Dec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n* Dec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers\n* Jan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform\n* Jan 13 \u2014 Paysafecard launches in Moldova\n* Feb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform\n* Feb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n* Feb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n* Feb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal serviceFeb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models\n* Feb 26 \u2014 Paysafe wins \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award\n* Mar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n* Mar 4 \u2014 Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n* Mar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n* Mar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan\n* Mar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases\n* Mar 18 \u2014 Paysafe announces new Board of Directors\n* Mar 19 \u2014 Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta\n* Mar 25 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands digital currency offering to US with Coinbase\n* April 1 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program\n* April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook\n* April 15 \u2014 Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador\n* April 21 \u2014 Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022\n* April 27 \u2014 Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers\n* April 29 \u2014 Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring\n* May 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving\n* May 20 \u2014 Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US\n* May 26 \u2014 REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments\n* June 1 \u2014 Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth\n* June 2 \u2014 Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe\n* June 3 \u2014 Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market\n* June 7 \u2014 Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments\n* June 23\u2014Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash\n* June 29 \u2014 Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan\n* June 30 \u2014 Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best \u2018Affiliate Software Supplier\u2019\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.\n* July 13 \u2014 Paysafe adds 20 new digital currencies to its digital wallet and expands this service to 11 new USstates, bringing US presence to 48 states.\n* July 14 \u2014 Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution\n* July 19 \u2014 Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants\n* .July 20 \u2014 Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe\u2019s Income Access\n* July 21 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable \u2018banking-as-a-service\u2019 solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services.

This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE\u2019s Q4 top line a solid boost.\n* Aug 4 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe\u2019s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. \"Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe\u2019s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks.\" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe\u2019s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, digital currencies and even PayPal.)\n* Aug 9 \u2014 Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor\n* Aug 10 \u2014 Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM&amp;A / inorganic growth\n\nAlong the lines of value creation, Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, \u201can aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.\u201d\n\nInorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. Yeah, that's 3,600X. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).\n\nThrough his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d 6,9\n\nFoley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: \u201cFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRounding out the Picture:\n\n\\#1 global leader in iGaming, #2 digital wallet in the world, and #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It has a transactional volume approaching $100 billion in over 40 currencies.\n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n\\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). 11 -- By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). 12\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\niGaming Expansion\n\nIt's worth repeating that Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s expertise in multi-jurisdictional regulations is an important aspect of its competitive MOAT (as discussed below). Paysafe is also an integrated back-end payment processor so many users don\u2019t realize they are utlizing their gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.\n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n\nFund manager Dan Loeb agrees: \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n\nCompass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d\n\nDel Grosso, who gave Paysafe a $19 price target added, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d 5 Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnalysts universally rate Paysafe as a \"BUY\"\n\nSome quotes :\n\nRBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d 4\n\nRBC recently reiterated their Outperform rating saying: \u201cOur positive thesis is predicated on three key points including: (1) PSFE has a unique set of assets within the payments space, in that it\u2019s a digital wallet, an integrated payment platform (with \\\\\\~50% tethered to online transactions), and provides an on ramp for cash to be digitized via eCash, and it\u2019s the combination of the three that create a two-sided market (serving both merchants &amp; consumers), (2) new secular growth opportunity in US iGaming, which is in its early innings and could surprise investors to the upside, and (3) Bill Foley (Non-Executive Chairman) and his team have a long history of driving share holder value, which we expect to continue at PSFE.\n\nBMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" 3\n\nEvercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' 2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMOAT: \u201crobust risk management operation\u201d\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and how is it able offer eCommerce services to the unbanked?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d 9\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nValuation\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\nPaysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n\nBy comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\nPaysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth (recent new acquisition) nor their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated. This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth. In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. Incorporating US iGaming growth will of course reveal a whole new picture.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up. Veteran market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not investment advice. For those who do want to invest in Paysafe, my only advice is to stay away from options. I\u2019ve watched this stock for a long time and the market makers have a track record of ruthlessly blowing up those positions. Common shares is the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n(1) [https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe](https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe).\n\n(2) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)\n\n(3) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(4) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(5) [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10) global capital\n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)",

        "selftext": "Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe\u2019s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.\n\nLast week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%.  But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20% to an astonishingly low 3.85X price to sales.\n\nWhy did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : \u201cPaysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.\u201d \n\nTo be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion.  They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs \\~ $105 billion)  \n\nSo why the miss?  Analysts\u2019 modeling assumed that 2021\u2019s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. \n\nThe company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. \n\nGaps like that typically get filled if there\u2019s no material negative news.  On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion\n* Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA \n* Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million\n* Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. \n* 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter)\n* 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture)\n* 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV)\n* Revenue growth in all segments\n* eCash revenue +37% YoY  (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries)\n* North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY\n* Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits)\n* Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance\n* Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs\n* Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage.\n* Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring &amp; E-commerce\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurther, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, \u201cPaysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing online markets.\u201d  Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America\u2019s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.)\n\nWith their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America.\n\nImportantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe\u2019s current projections don\u2019t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost.  Management noted, \u201cThese transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units\u2026The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.\u201d  \n\nThis quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV.  Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1.\n\nChairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, \u201cWe see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.\u201d \n\nThese new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley\u2019s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&amp;A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts\u2019 neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality.  In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance.  Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. \n\n \n\nPaysafe vs PayPal\n\nSeemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a \"free cash flow machine.\"  The author apparently didn\u2019t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. \n\nIn fact, if you applied PayPal\u2019s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe\u2019s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow,  Paysafe\u2019s share price would be $32.  A 4x gain from current levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider:\n\n1. 1) PayPal\u2019s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.)  On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY.  With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe.  Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe\u2019s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. \n2. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk \u201cbuy now/pay later\u201d business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces.  \n3. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe\u2019s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth.  \n4. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe\u2019s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR).\n5. PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 425%.\n6. Based on Paysafe\u2019s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60\n7. Based on Paysafe\u2019s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal\u2019s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe\u2019s share price at $28.40.\n8. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt).  During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. \n\n* By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR.\n* Paysafe hasn\u2019t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe\u2019s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal\u2019s share value growth of 460%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are obviously many different factors to consider so I\u2019m not making any claims about fair value here. It\u2019s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe\u2019s share price between $28 and $32.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome Background:\n\nPaysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. \n\nAs an integrated back-end payment processor, most don\u2019t realize they are using Paysafe\u2019s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.  Within the industry, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews).  \n\nBy contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). \n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMOAT:\n\nPaysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its \u201crobust risk management.\u201d Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. \n\nCEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\niGaming Expansion\n\nPaysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape.\n\nImportantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d \n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas.

In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe\u2019s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks.\" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe\u2019s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.)\n* Aug 9 \u2014 Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor\n* Aug 10 \u2014 Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division\n* Aug 16 \u2014 Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% \n* Aug 16 \u2014 Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay \n* Aug 22 \u2014 Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM&amp;A / inorganic growth\n\nBill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, \u201can aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.\u201d\n\nInorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge.  Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).\n\nThrough his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\nFoley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: \u201cFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nValuation Metrics:\n\nAbove I compared Paysafe with PayPal.  A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n\\- Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow.\n\n\\- By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\n\\- Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels.  In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth  But even if you include 2020\u2019s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not investment advice.  Just a collections of observations.  If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\nPaysafe Q2: [https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\\_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf)\n\nReuters : Paysafe $4.7B - [https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP](https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP)\n\nPayPal Q2: [https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\\_financials/2021/q2/Q2-21-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2-21-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nPayPal 2012 : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal)\n\nPayPal 2020 : [https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\\_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nPaysafe 2012 : [https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908](https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908)\n\nPaysafe 2020 - [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/psfe](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/psfe)\n\n[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)",

        "selftext": "Q2 Earnings: August 16 - premarket\n\nTLDR: Institutions are currently buying 21x more than selling while it trades near all time low. None of the long list below has been priced in yet.\n\nIn light of China\u2019s recent crackdown on payment processors, FinTech company Paysafe\u2019s strategic move last year to exit those high-risk revenue channels is looking pretty smart. This de-risking will temporarily dampen Q2 YoY revenue growth, as it did with Q1, however, their CC transcripts indicate that tactical exit will likely no longer affect YoY revenue going into Q3 and Q4.\n\nBut this upcoming earnings report is less about revenue growth than it is about forward guidance and updates on their ongoing restructuring, acquisition pipeline and how their recent deleveraging will affect margins and free cash flow.\n\nThey reported strong FCF growth last quarter and a recent CNNE quarterly report revealed that, along with recently paying down $1.2 billion in debt, upon a Moody's upgrade, Paysafe successfully refinanced their remaining debt. This, overall restructuring could translate to $150+ million in cost savings annually which can dramatically improve their profit, free cash flow and M&amp;A outlook: critical elements of their growth strategy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEPS\n\nEven if this ER is about forward guidance, there\u2019s a good chance for an EPS beat which will make Q2 Paysafe\u2019s first profitable quarter as a newly public company. Analysts\u2019 average EPS estimate is reported to be 0.01 or 0.02 (depending on the source). We know that in Q1, without the $90+ million in one-time, non-recurring expenses associated with going public and paying down $1.2B debt, they would have beat analysts estimates with a positive EPS. For Q2, they won\u2019t have those expenses so, unless they introduce new costs from refinancing or impairment expenses on intangible assets, there appears to be solid basis for an EPS beat. My loose guess is for 0.05 EPS or better. Not a big deal to me if it doesn\u2019t work out that way, but it\u2019s entirely plausible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRevenue\n\nRegarding revenue, even though Paysafe is already integrated as a payment processor with 75% of US iGaming operators, let\u2019s ignore the facts that\n\n* many new states have legalized sports betting during Q1/Q2 (see below),\n* Paysafe\u2019s Q2 revenue could be bolstered by the strong growth recently reported by its several partners like Wynn, Caesar\u2019s, DraftKings and Penn,\n* Paysafe has new revenue streams from recent deals with Coinbase, Microsoft/XBox, Luckbox, Wix, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, PointsBet, Virginia Lottery, Rent Moola, Provena, FoxBet, Golden Nugget etc.,\n* Paysafe said early Q2 was already showing signs of record growth: \u201cWe continue to be pleased with where the top-line trends are going. We've had some actual record days in e-commerce processing, historical records, not just recovery records, but historical records.\u201d\n* or that the American Gaming Association reports sports betting has generated $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2021, 20% more than all of 2020 combined ($1.5B).\n\nRather than speculate about how much of that new revenue will affect Paysafe\u2019s Q2 balance sheet, I prefer to keep my sights on analysts estimates and Paysafe\u2019s own guidance, which has conservatively excluded US iGaming growth projections (55% CAGR).\n\nPaysafe offers Q2 revenue guidance of $365 - $385 million. With $341 million in revenue for Q1\u201920, this represents 7% to 13% YoY quarterly growth. We\u2019ve seen very little reason for them to miss this guidance. Quite the contrary.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 average Q2 revenue estimate is reported to be between $371.5 million and $378 million (depending on the source). That's right in the middle of guidance. Last quarter, Paysafe came in at the upper range of their guidance which, given all the good news, suggests that there\u2019s a very good chance that they\u2019ll beat the analyst estimate. That would result in around 9% to 11% YoY quarterly growth, which would be a solid improvement from Q1.\n\nAs a long-term investor, I\u2019ll be happy with anything above 7%. From there, any upside surprise will be welcome.\n\nLast quarter, Paysafe confirmed their 2021 full year projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume. Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.\n\nThis confirmed guidance implies that Q3 and Q4 will likely represent stronger revenue growth to compensate for the sluggish Q1 growth due to the channel exits. By Q3, Paysafe's balance sheet should reflect their many new partnerships and new US state markets opening up to legalized sports betting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecent Price Action\n\nAs Chairman of the Board Bill Foley recently noted, Paysafe \"has been unduly punished as the inevitable shareholder rotation plays out.\"\n\nOver the last few months many sources confirm regular and heavy intraday short volume (not short interest) which has successfully tanked the stock price on nothing but good news from the company. Meanwhile 13F filings continue to reveal institutions loading shares.\n\n\\[Side note: Some have a hard time wrapping their heads around this but the SEC allows this type of intraday price manipulation under the shield of making a market. It's a legal loophole that allows market makers to walk down (or up) the price to shake out weak hands in order to fill institutional orders by the end of each day. It doesn't help that many financial news outlets continue to misrepresent Paysafe\u2019s data, claiming they have only 4 employees and falsely reporting a massive Q1 EPS miss of -0.37 and -0.38 (Yahoo/CNBC). It was only 0.02. Such things can definitely deter investors who undertake proper due diligence so, hopefully, these outlets will get around to reporting accurate data.\\] But I digress.\n\nWhile the shenanigans have gone on, bringing the price near all time lows and pushing many retail shareholders to capitulation, Fintel reports institutions are accumulating 21 times more than they are selling. Very recent 13F\u2019s show Susquehanna increased their stake by 48% to over 3 million shares, Citigroup increased their position by 5000% to around 1.3 million shares, Bank of New York Mellon bought half a million shares and BlackRock just opened a new position of 8.3 million shares.\n\nBottom?\n\nWhoever has been pinning the stock down has always stopped near these current levels because its more or less the price paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares). In fact, the current price is likely below where Wells Fargo bought 13M shares, where BlackRock bought their 8.3M shares and where Blackstone took on another 37 million shares, according to their 13F's.\n\nThe current low price poses an interesting opportunity for value investors because, since those major fund managers decided to invest near this level, Paysafe has had zero bad news while steadily executing on their promised strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and as Bill Foley put it, \u201ccross-sell, cross-sell and cross-sell.\u201d\n\nSaid in another way, because Paysafe has excluded US iGaming growth from its projections, literally none of the following developments in value creation have yet been priced in:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Dec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments\n* Dec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n* Dec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers\n* Jan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform\n* Jan 13 \u2014 Paysafecard launches in Moldova\n* Feb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform\n* Feb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n* Feb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n* Feb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal serviceFeb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models\n* Feb 26 \u2014 Paysafe wins \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award\n* Mar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n* Mar 4 \u2014 Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n* Mar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n* Mar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan\n* Mar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases\n* Mar 18 \u2014 Paysafe announces new Board of Directors\n* Mar 19 \u2014 Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta\n* Mar 25 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands digital currency offering to US with Coinbase\n* April 1 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program\n* April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook\n* April 15 \u2014 Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador\n* April 21 \u2014 Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022\n* April 27 \u2014 Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers\n* April 29 \u2014 Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring\n* May 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving\n* May 20 \u2014 Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US\n* May 26 \u2014 REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments\n* June 1 \u2014 Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth\n* June 2 \u2014 Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe\n* June 3 \u2014 Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market\n* June 7 \u2014 Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments\n* June 23\u2014Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash\n* June 29 \u2014 Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan\n* June 30 \u2014 Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best \u2018Affiliate Software Supplier\u2019\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.\n* July 13 \u2014 Paysafe adds 20 new digital currencies to its digital wallet and expands this service to 11 new USstates, bringing US presence to 48 states.\n* July 14 \u2014 Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution\n* July 19 \u2014 Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants\n* .July 20 \u2014 Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe\u2019s Income Access\n* July 21 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable \u2018banking-as-a-service\u2019 solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services.

This deal is a direct result of Paysafe\u2019s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. \"Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe\u2019s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks.\" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe\u2019s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, digital currencies and even PayPal.)\n* Aug 9 \u2014 Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor\n* Aug 10 \u2014 Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM&amp;A / inorganic growth\n\nAlong the lines of value creation, Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, \u201can aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.\u201d\n\nInorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. Yeah, that's 3,600X. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).\n\nThrough his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d 6,9\n\nFoley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: \u201cFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRounding out the Picture:\n\n\\#1 global leader in iGaming, #2 digital wallet in the world, and #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It has a transactional volume approaching $100 billion in over 40 currencies.\n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n\\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). 11 -- By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). 12\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\niGaming Expansion\n\nIt's worth repeating that Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s expertise in multi-jurisdictional regulations is an important aspect of its competitive MOAT (as discussed below). Paysafe is also an integrated back-end payment processor so many users don\u2019t realize they are utlizing their gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.\n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n\nFund manager Dan Loeb agrees: \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n\nCompass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d\n\nDel Grosso, who gave Paysafe a $19 price target added, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d 5 Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnalysts universally rate Paysafe as a \"BUY\"\n\nSome quotes :\n\nRBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d 4\n\nRBC recently reiterated their Outperform rating saying: \u201cOur positive thesis is predicated on three key points including: (1) PSFE has a unique set of assets within the payments space, in that it\u2019s a digital wallet, an integrated payment platform (with \\\\\\~50% tethered to online transactions), and provides an on ramp for cash to be digitized via eCash, and it\u2019s the combination of the three that create a two-sided market (serving both merchants &amp; consumers), (2) new secular growth opportunity in US iGaming, which is in its early innings and could surprise investors to the upside, and (3) Bill Foley (Non-Executive Chairman) and his team have a long history of driving share holder value, which we expect to continue at PSFE.\n\nBMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" 3\n\nEvercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' 2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMOAT: \u201crobust risk management operation\u201d\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and how is it able offer eCommerce services to the unbanked?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d 9\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nValuation\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\nPaysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n\nBy comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\nPaysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth (recent new acquisition) nor their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated. This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth. In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. Incorporating US iGaming growth will of course reveal a whole new picture.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up. Veteran market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not investment advice. For those who do want to invest in Paysafe, my only advice is to stay away from options. I\u2019ve watched this stock for a long time and the market makers have a track record of ruthlessly blowing up those positions. Common shares is the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n(1) [https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe](https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe).\n\n(2) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)\n\n(3) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(4) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(5) [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10) global capital\n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 3, 2021**\n\nStocks rose today, reversing from yesterday\u2019s losses and extending the current run of day-to-day volatility. Like I said yesterday, I expect a lot of choppiness moving forward as the market participants continue to balance record corporate earnings and expectations for economic expansion with concerns surrounding the coronavirus Delta variant and inflation. Looking ahead, market participants wait for the July Jobs Report, set to be released on Friday.\n\nConcerns surrounding the highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant continue to rise, with Florida now emerging as the US\u2019 new epicenter for the disease. Cases in Florida have jumped dramatically, going from 2432 on July 1 to 38,776 on July 30 and have so far had three consecutive days of record infections. Thankfully, however, despite the surge in cases, the death rate has so far remained stable and relatively low, a sign that the vaccines are very effective at preventing hospitalizations and serious death. \n\nIn the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with new cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 78,433 as of July 31, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, it is important to note, despite the surge the 7-day average of deaths is 360, once again according to John Hopkins University. However, it is very important to understand that cases remain highly concentrated in areas with high vaccine hesitancy, among other factors. For example, last week 1 in 3 new COVID infections came from just two states: Texas and Florida, according to the White House. While one always has to understand the risks present in the market, in my humble opinion, I don\u2019t think the Delta variant will weigh too heavily on the US economy as a whole. \n\nAccording to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, \u201cThere is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.\u201d Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.\n\nSo far, 59% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85%, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 2009. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* General Motors (GM) said it will be closing three of its North American assembly plants next week due to the global shortage in semiconductors.\n* Shares of Tencent (TCEHY) fell 10% after a state-media called video games \"spiritual opium\". This prompted Tencent to say it will limit gaming time for minors and may even ban those under 12 from its platform. Looks like the regulatory crackdown in China continues\u2026\n* After a disappointing IPO, shares of Robinhood (HOOD) gapped up more than 25% today. Stock is now roughly 27% above it\u2019s IPO price of $38 \n* French pharma giant Sanofi bought Translate Bio, a biotech company focused on using mRNA to develop other vaccines and therapeutics. Paul Hudson, Sanofi CEO, said of the acquisition, \u201cTranslate Bio adds an mRNA technology platform and strong capabilities to our research, further advancing our ability to explore the promise of this technology to develop both best-in-class vaccines and therapeutics.\u201d\n* Yesterday, semiconductor company Micron Technology announced it was starting a $0.10 dividend, a great sign that company operations are strong. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Arista Networks (ANET) with a host of target raises.

        "selftext": "Q2 Earnings:  August 16 - premarket\n\nIn light of China\u2019s recent crackdown on payment processors, FinTech company Paysafe\u2019s strategic move last year to exit those high-risk revenue channels is looking pretty smart.  This de-risking will temporarily dampen Q2 YoY revenue growth, as it did with Q1, however, their CC transcripts indicate that tactical exit will likely no longer affect YoY revenue going into Q3 and Q4.\n\nBut this upcoming earnings report is less about revenue growth than it is about forward guidance and updates on their ongoing restructuring, acquisition pipeline and how their recent deleveraging will affect margins and free cash flow.\n\nThey reported strong FCF growth last quarter and a recent CNNE quarterly report revealed that, along with recently paying down $1.2 billion in debt, upon a Moody's upgrade, Paysafe successfully refinanced their remaining debt. This, overall restructuring could translate to $150+ million in cost savings annually which can dramatically improve their profit, free cash flow and M&amp;A outlook: critical elements of their growth strategy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# EPS\n\nEven if this ER is about forward guidance, there\u2019s a good chance for an EPS beat which will make Q2 Paysafe\u2019s first profitable quarter as a newly public company.  Analysts\u2019 average EPS estimate is reported to be 0.01 or 0.02 (depending on the source).  We know that in Q1, without the $90+ million in one-time, non-recurring expenses associated with going public and paying down $1.2B debt, they would have beat analysts estimates with a positive EPS.  For Q2, they won\u2019t have those expenses so, unless they introduce new costs from refinancing or impairment expenses on intangible assets, there appears to be solid basis for an EPS beat.  My loose guess is for 0.05 EPS or better. Not a big deal to me if it doesn\u2019t work out that way, but it\u2019s entirely plausible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Revenue\n\nRegarding revenue, even though Paysafe is already integrated as a payment processor with 75% of US iGaming operators, let\u2019s ignore the facts that\n\n* many new states have legalized sports betting during Q1/Q2 (see below),\n* Paysafe\u2019s Q2 revenue could be bolstered by the strong growth recently reported by its several partners like Wynn, Caesar\u2019s, DraftKings and Penn,\n* Paysafe has new revenue streams from recent deals with Coinbase, Microsoft/XBox, Luckbox, Wix, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, PointsBet, Virginia Lottery, Rent Moola, Provena, FoxBet, Golden Nugget etc.,\n* Paysafe said early Q2 was already showing signs of record growth: \u201cWe continue to be pleased with where the top-line trends are going. We've had some actual record days in e-commerce processing, historical records, not just recovery records, but historical records.\u201d\n* or that the American Gaming Association reports sports betting has generated $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2021, 20% more than all of 2020 combined ($1.5B).\n\nRather than speculate about how much of that new revenue will affect Paysafe\u2019s Q2 balance sheet, I prefer to keep my sights on analysts estimates and Paysafe\u2019s own guidance, which has conservatively excluded US iGaming growth projections (55% CAGR).\n\nPaysafe offers Q2 revenue guidance of $365 - $385 million.  With $341 million in revenue for Q1\u201920, this represents 7% to 13% YoY quarterly growth.  We\u2019ve seen very little reason for them to miss this guidance. Quite the contrary.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 average Q2 revenue estimate is reported to be between $371.5 million and $378 million (depending on the source).  That's right in the middle of guidance.  Last quarter, Paysafe came in at the upper range of their guidance which, given all the good news, suggests that there\u2019s a very good chance that they\u2019ll beat the analyst estimate.  That would result in around 9% to 11% YoY quarterly growth, which would be a solid improvement from Q1.\n\nAs a long-term investor, I\u2019ll be happy with anything above 7%.  From there, any upside surprise will be welcome.\n\nLast quarter, Paysafe confirmed their 2021 full year projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume. Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.\n\nThis confirmed guidance implies that Q3 and Q4 will likely represent stronger revenue growth to compensate for the sluggish Q1 growth due to the channel exits.  By Q3, Paysafe's balance sheet should reflect their many new partnerships and new US state markets opening up to legalized sports betting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Recent Price Action\n\nAs Chairman of the Board Bill Foley recently noted, Paysafe \"has been unduly punished as the inevitable shareholder rotation plays out.\"\n\nOver the last few months many sources confirm regular and heavy intraday short volume (not short interest) which has successfully tanked the stock price on nothing but good news from the company. Meanwhile 13F filings continue to reveal institutions loading shares.\n\n\\[Side note: Some have a hard time wrapping their heads around this but the SEC allows this type of intraday price manipulation under the shield of making a market.  It's a legal loophole that allows market makers to walk down (or up) the price to shake out weak hands in order to fill institutional orders by the end of each day.  It doesn't help that many financial news outlets continue to misrepresent Paysafe\u2019s data, claiming they have only 4 employees and falsely reporting a massive Q1 EPS miss of -0.37 and -0.38 (Yahoo/CNBC). It was only 0.02. Such things can definitely deter investors who undertake proper due diligence so, hopefully, these outlets will get around to reporting accurate data.\\]  But I digress.\n\nWhile the shenanigans have gone on, bringing the price near all time lows and pushing many retail shareholders to capitulation, Fintel reports institutions are accumulating 21 times more than they are selling.  Very recent 13F\u2019s show Susquehanna increased their stake by 48% to over 3 million shares, Citigroup increased their position by 5000% to around 1.3 million shares, Bank of New York Mellon bought half a million shares and BlackRock just opened a new position of 8.3 million shares.\n\n# Bottom?\n\nWhoever has been pinning the stock down has always stopped near these current levels because its more or less the price paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  In fact, the current price is likely below where Wells Fargo bought 13M shares, where BlackRock bought their 8.3M shares and where Blackstone took on another 37 million shares, according to their 13F's.\n\nThe current low price poses an interesting opportunity for value investors because, since those major fund managers decided to invest near this level, Paysafe has had zero bad news while steadily executing on their promised strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and as Bill Foley put it, \u201ccross-sell, cross-sell and cross-sell.\u201d\n\nSaid in another way, because Paysafe has excluded US iGaming growth from its projections, literally none of the following developments in value creation have yet been priced in:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Dec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments\n* Dec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n* Dec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers\n* Jan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform\n* Jan 13 \u2014 Paysafecard launches in Moldova\n* Feb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform\n* Feb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n* Feb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n* Feb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models\n* Feb 26 \u2014 Paysafe wins \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award\n* Mar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n* Mar 4 \u2014 Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n* Mar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n* Mar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan\n* Mar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases\n* Mar 18 \u2014 Paysafe announces new Board of Directors\n* Mar 19 \u2014 Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta\n* Mar 25 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase\n* April 1 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program\n* April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook\n* April 15 \u2014 Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador\n* April 21 \u2014 Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022\n* April 27 \u2014 Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers\n* April 29 \u2014 Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring\n* May 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving\n* May 20 \u2014 Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US\n* May 26 \u2014 REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments\n* June 1 \u2014 Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth\n* June 2 \u2014 Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe\n* June 3 \u2014 Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market\n* June 7 \u2014 Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments\n* June 23\u2014Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash\n* June 29 \u2014 Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan\n* June 30 \u2014 Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best \u2018Affiliate Software Supplier\u2019\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.\n* July 13 \u2014 Paysafe adds 20 new digital currencies to its digital wallet and expands this service to 11 new US states, bringing US presence to 48 states.\n* July 14 \u2014 Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution\n* July 19 \u2014 Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants.\n* July 20 \u2014 Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe\u2019s Income Access\n* July 21 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable \u2018banking-as-a-service\u2019 solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe).\n* July 26 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair &amp; Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe\u2019s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel.\n* July 27 \u2014 Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe\u2019s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership\n* Aug 2 \u2014 Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe\u2019s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE\u2019s Q4 top line a solid boost.\n* Aug 4 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe\u2019s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. \"Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe\u2019s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks.\" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe\u2019s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.)\n* Aug 9 \u2014 Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor\n* Aug 10 \u2014 Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# M&amp;A / inorganic growth\n\nAlong the lines of value creation, Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, \u201can aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.\u201d\n\nInorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge.  Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. Yeah, that's 3,600X.  Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).\n\nThrough his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return.  He says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d ^(6,9)\n\nFoley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further:  \u201cFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Rounding out the Picture:\n\n\\#1 global leader in iGaming, #2 digital wallet in the world, and #4 globally in integrated merchant processing.  Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets.   It has a transactional volume approaching $100 billion in over 40 currencies.\n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.   Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n\\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11   --)   By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# iGaming Expansion\n\nIt's worth repeating that Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s expertise in multi-jurisdictional regulations is an important aspect of its competitive MOAT (as discussed below).  Paysafe is also an integrated back-end payment processor so many users don\u2019t realize they are utlizing their gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.\n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n\nFund manager Dan Loeb agrees: \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n\nCompass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d\n\nDel Grosso, who gave Paysafe a $19 price target added, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d ^(5)  Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n* \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n* \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n* \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n* \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n* \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n* \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n* \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n* \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n* \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n* \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n* \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n* \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n* \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n* \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n* \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Analysts universally rate Paysafe as a \"BUY\"\n\nSome quotes :\n\nRBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d ^(4)\n\nRBC recently reiterated their Outperform rating saying: \u201cOur positive thesis is predicated on three key points including: (1) PSFE has a unique set of assets within the payments space, in that it\u2019s a digital wallet, an integrated payment platform (with \\\\\\~50% tethered to online transactions), and provides an on ramp for cash to be digitized via eCash, and it\u2019s the combination of the three that create a two-sided market (serving both merchants &amp; consumers), (2) new secular growth opportunity in US iGaming, which is in its early innings and could surprise investors to the upside, and (3) Bill Foley (Non-Executive Chairman) and his team have a long history of driving share holder value, which we expect to continue at PSFE.\n\nBMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" ^(3)\n\nEvercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# MOAT: \u201crobust risk management operation\u201d\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and how is it able offer eCommerce services to the unbanked?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter.

That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d ^(9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Valuation\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\nPaysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n\nBy comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\nPaysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth (recent new acquisition) nor their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated. This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth. In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. Incorporating US iGaming growth will of course reveal a whole new picture.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n    \u2022\tEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n    \n    \u2022\tEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n    \n    \u2022\tEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\nMore conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n    \u2022\tEV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n    \n    \u2022\tEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n    \n    \u2022\tEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up. Veteran market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not investment advice. For those who do want to invest in Paysafe, my only advice is to stay away from options.  I\u2019ve watched this stock for a long time and the market makers have a track record of ruthlessly blowing up those positions.  Common shares is the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n(1) [https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe](https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe).\n\n(2) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)\n\n(3) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(4) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(5) [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10) [https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi](https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi)\n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)",

        "selftext": "All year for about 13 months now I've  been heavy on growth. I've come close to my position nearly doubling in value, and then lost all my profits in February. Shot back up in June and then crumbled back close to break even again recently.\n\nI have learned a lot over the year. A lot about growth vs value and the importance of fundamentals.  I've made some mistakes like fomoing but I think now it's made me a smarter investor.\n\n\nI recently basically liquidated all my shares and moved to a  cash position on everything bar some dividend stocks and some safe tech like AAPL and NVDA( up a good few percent on both so a massive correction to breakeven wouldn't even worry me. \n\nI'm in my 20s and my total investment worth is about 15k including My recent cash position. \n\nI sold tesla today and this hurt. I will be buying back. I must think it's way too risky in the short term. And I also need a house so the 15k would be close to a deposit down payment. But I'm not against going all in on an undervalued company such as HPQ(price to earnings is like 10 and they pay dividends.)\n\nI made some profits off Chinese EV. But personally I feel that is one of the most dangerous sectors in the market. Especially with what's going on with CCP recently.\n\n\nJust wanted to make this to  see if there is similar sentiment about thinking valuations have gone absolutely insane in growth stocks , tech and EV.\n\n\nI am now a bear on the market as a whole. And take my advise. I used to think dividend or value plays were a real boring way to invest. They seemed it in 2020. But in 21 they are a far better play.\n\n\nMy advice: inflation is going to wreck growth in the short term. And I'd keep some cash aside for dips if you are an investor. I can't shake the feeling the market is being propped up so artificially, and we are in for a serious correction.\n\n\nLove to hear from you guys and don't feel like you can't dm me or comment some questions..\n\nBTW I'm not into memes. Its cool if you are but my post isn't signalling the MO ASS because I think we are in for a correction or crash. In fact i think stocks like amc and gme will suffer like growth will as well.

It has been bleeding for months now and hasn't been lower than this since October 2020 before it jumped to .19 and then retraced back .05 and repeated a jump to .32. \n\nMarket cap is  19.608M. Unique Logistics have several customers that are some of the bigger players. \n\n[Carparts.com](https://Carparts.com), AutoZone Inc, HP Inc., and recently hired a new CFO about 4 months ago. \n\nAccording to Yahoo 62.34% is held by insiders, so I would think this is a major bullish sign. \n\nFloat is around 152 Mil, so nothing crazy.\n\nHere is their balance sheet/income statement.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5lnsn10ijsg71.png?width=459&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd2afbd4dd4764ab4b13befa15dbd1ae834a8f21\n\nIt doesn't look too hot, but year over year quarterly earnings didn't disappoint in February. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uafvx0erjsg71.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8551986983bf7f74a36b64ebcaded34b135c683\n\nLast time I checked UNQL had earnings released in August last year so I'd expect it soon probably within a month or so.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 23rd, 2021.\n\n# **Fed officials will seek to avoid a tantrum as they keep \u2018taper talk\u2019 going at Jackson Hole - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/20/fed-officials-will-seek-to-avoid-a-tantrum-as-they-keep-taper-talk-going-at-jackson-hole.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to reverse its easy policy will be a dominant theme for markets in the week ahead, as central bankers gather in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n*****\n&gt; The central bankers may even look relaxed against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons in the crisp late August air. But they will be under pressure to gently steer toward less policy support, without creating a market tantrum.\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve officials, in numerous recent speeches and interviews, have already managed to speed up expectations for when they could begin to slowly pare back their $120 billion a month in bond purchases. More of that talk is expected at their annual symposium, which begins Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed chairman\u2019s speech is typically the highlight of the annual event, and various Fed chairs have used Jackson Hole to send important messages. The question is whether Jerome Powell will channel his speech Friday morning to provide more details on how the Fed could begin to unwind its bond buying, and even whether he is personally ready to embrace it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re not expecting a big policy reveal at this meeting,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short strategy at Bank of America. \u201cI don\u2019t think Powell wants to front run the [September] meeting, given the myriad of voices that are out there. I don\u2019t think this is the time when Powell really wants to make a splash.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Besides the Fed, the week has a few economic reports. Existing home sales are released Monday; new home sales Tuesday and durable goods Wednesday. Friday has personal consumption expenditures data and the inflation index, closely watched by the Fed.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings are also expected from companies including Best Buy and Nordstrom on Tuesday, Salesforce.com on Wednesday and HP and Dell Technologies on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed and markets\nBut the Fed will matter most, as investors will also keep an eye on how the economy is responding to the spread of the Covid delta variant. Stocks were lower in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down 0.6%.\n*****\n&gt; There could be some volatility around the Fed\u2019s symposium, after the release this past Tuesday of minutes from the last official meeting rattled investors. The minutes described most members of the Federal Open Market Committee as being ready to taper this year if the economy is strong enough. Cabana said he changed his view after that release and now expects the Fed to begin paring back purchases in November, rather than January.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe just think this signal in communications is pretty clear,\u201d he said. \u201cFor now, it\u2019s safe to say they are wanting to start later this year, and we think the data will allow them to do that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; As for Powell, \u201che\u2019s not going to announce taper. What we anticipate is that he\u2019s going to give a live speech that talks about a lot of the progress that has been made since the start of Covid, and there\u2019s a lot of it,\u201d said Cabana. He said Powell could reiterate that the Fed will be data dependent in its decision to taper, and that many Fed officials believe it could make sufficient progress toward that goal later this year.\n*****\n&gt; The minutes caused hiccups in markets as investors reacted to the idea that the Fed will take its first steps toward peeling away the extraordinary amount of policy it used to fight the impact of the pandemic. Tapering the bond program could take months, but once it ends it could herald the onset of rate hikes.\n*****\n&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said Powell should provide a road map for how the Fed will taper, but with the caveat of being able to step back if Covid becomes more serious than expected.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe asset purchases were initially to stabilize financial conditions. ... There\u2019s clearly a consensus building stronger than it even was at the last meeting in July, given how [Fed officials] have been speaking out since then,\u201d said Swonk. \u201cThey want to wind down asset purchases. As they wind them down, they\u2019re not hitting the brakes. They\u2019re only lifting their foot off the accelerator. The difference is important for [Powell] to lay out at Jackson Hole.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Swonk said the Fed needs to provide a road map for tapering, but also with off ramps in the event that Covid is worse than expected.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTo avoid this becoming a tantrum and avoid financial markets seizing up again, he wants to get the messaging out and the context of it, as much as possible,\u201d Swonk said. \u201cIf this becomes a disorderly reaction and things are melting down, they would have to pivot. Where we\u2019re at is these types of purchases are no longer justified and may be detrimental in terms of how much liquidity they\u2019re putting into financial markets when its no longer needed.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/sxTwppT.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/XaZ3OqE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/oLHqqFQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/iuH4ig1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/lflLJO1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7JLtvgO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cnmvI5A.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Cqw6DkJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QeyCpqJ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hV3LYS4.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wLwUeqE.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4izjE1a.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/k1m7sYO.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Almanac: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Worst Month of Year\n\n&gt; Start of the business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school once made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979). After four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup, S&amp;P 500 was down five Septembers straight from 1999-2003. In the 17 years since, S&amp;P 500 has advanced 11 times in September and declined six times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/40afab5bf8a7d5d83f5c0df66416bd63/64275cde73d35d0e-b1/s400x600/f24c1395359fa121818eb1387e2f2cde70364a83.jpg))**\n\n&gt; In post-election years, September\u2019s overall rank improves modestly in post-election years going back to 1953 (third or fourth worst month depending on index). Average losses are little changed. Although September 2001 does influence the average declines, the fact remains DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined in 9 of the last 17 post-election year Septembers. Russell 2000 has the best post-election year record, up seven times in 10 years.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # US Dollar Breaks Out\n\n&gt; After roughly two months of declines, at the end of May the US dollar (proxied by Bloomberg's dollar index) found support around the lows from the first week of the year. Since then, the dollar has rallied 4.13%, moving back above its moving averages in the process which have also acted as support ever since. This week alone the dollar has gained 1.4%, and that upward move brings the dollar to the highest levels since early November and the early spring highs when the index stopped short of its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082021-Dollar.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking a step back to look at the past five years, those lows that were reached earlier this spring and at the start of the year can actually be traced all the way back to early 2018 lows. Similarly, the recent highs that were taken out this week are around the same levels as the early 2016 lows. With the dollar now having broken out, it is no longer at the low end of that five-year range.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082021-Dollar-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One of the Best Weeks of the Year for Claims\n\n&gt; Initial jobless claims hit another pandemic low this week dropping to 348K from last week's 2K upwardly revised reading of 377K. That was also 16K below expectations and the first better than expected print in six weeks. While recent releases have disappointed relative to forecasts, this week did mark the fourth week in a row that claims have dropped. That is the longest stretch of consecutive declines since a six-week streak ending on June 4th.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, initial claims fell to 308.57K which is again the lowest level since the start of the pandemic. Meanwhile, pandemic unemployment assistance claims ticked up to 109.38K from 103.85K the previous week. The main state driving that increase was Ohio which saw claims more than double. Maryland, Oregon, and California were the other states to have seen the biggest increase in PUA claims. Those increases also come even as the program is slated to end in just two weeks on September 4th.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the decline in claims for unadjusted regular state programs, we would caution against reading too deep into the number on account of strong seasonal tailwinds. As shown below, the current week of the year (33rd) is tied at second for the week of the year that most often sees claims decline. As shown in the second chart below, there has only been one year, last year, in which claims were higher week over week in the 33rd week of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-Seasonal-1a.png))**\n\n&gt; Seasonally adjusted continuing claims missed expectations by 20K this week, but at 2.82 million, this week's reading still marked a third consecutive decline. As such, claims are still at the lowest level of the pandemic and are closing in on coming within one million from the March 2020 levels.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n&gt; While the most recent reading on continuing claims was lower, purely looking at regular state claims does not show the full picture. Including all other programs creates some additional lag meaning the most recent data is through the last week of July. Through that week, total claims fell below 12 million for the first time of the pandemic, totaling 11.76 million. Driving that decline were 79.9K and 66.08K declines in regular state and PEUC programs. The biggest decline came from the extended benefits program, though. That program saw claims get more than cut in half after a significant uptick the previous week. Throughout the month of July, claim counts for the extended benefits program were particularly volatile. They started off the month with a sub-100K reading of 98.4K, then rose all the way up to 343.5K, dropped to 239.6K, then rose again to 398.8K before falling back down to 177.9K in the week of July 30th.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-NSA-Share.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Homebuilder Sentiment: The Next Big Miss\n\n&gt; Prior to the pandemic, the NAHB's record monthly reading on homebuilder sentiment was back in December 1998 when the index hit 78. Last November, the sentiment bar was set even higher when the index reached 90. Since then, though, two-thirds of the releases have declined month over month. The most recent release saw the index drop five more points to 75, marking the first time in a year that homebuilder sentiment came in below the pre-pandemic record high. Additionally, August's 5-point drop is the largest one-month decline since last April when the index collapsed by a record 42 points at the onset of the pandemic. It is also tied with a dozen other months for the seventh-largest month-over-month decline in the history of the index going back to 1985.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1a.png))**\n\n&gt; While the release indicates worsening, but still historically strong, sentiment among homebuilders, it can be added to the growing list of economic indicators that have been coming in well below expectations. As we noted in last week's Bespoke Report, Citi Surprise indices measuring how economic data comes in relative to estimates tipped into negative territory last week. That was as the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment survey saw the biggest miss relative to expectations on record. Today's reading on homebuilders was not far off those results. The five-point miss relative to expectations was the largest since last April and is tied with 4 other months (April and May 2006, November 2008, and October 2014) for the six largest miss going back to at least 2003.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1b.png))**\n\n&gt; Driving the decline in the headline reading were five-point drops in present sales and traffic. Even though there has been deterioration in those readings on current conditions, future sales have held up better going unchanged at 81.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-3.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking across regions, the ones that have seen COVID cases rising the most of late, namely in the South and Midwest, generally saw sharp drops in homebuilder sentiment in August although those are in the context of longer-term declines. The Northeast and the West, on the other hand, are off of their peaks but each region did show an uptick in sentiment for August.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 20th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 8.22.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$JD $CRM $BBY $PTON $SNOW $XPEV $DKS $PDD $MDT $ANF $AAP $DG $EXPR $MRVL $ULTA $PANW $ITRN $DLTR $INTU $MSGE $MARK $COTY $WDAY $JWN $SPLK $CTRN $BURL $GPS $ADSK $MOMO $FLWS $BMO $URBN $BOX $SAFM $HPQ $HTHT $WSM $TOL $TD $BNS $DELL**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hV3LYS4.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YupEtZ9.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/bge25NW.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.23.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eKNfaOS.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.23.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Nsf4OKr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  8.24.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xfr0NjU.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.24.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5Ly7VHw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.25.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/OFpxuOX.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.25.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8uM0FGq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.26.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/drMyySB.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.26.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7Hr5nKX.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.27.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RLkiAvx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.27.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # JD.com, Inc. $63.62\n**JD.com, Inc.

Converting Silica (Quartz, SiO2) into high purity silicon using PUREVAP\u2122 QRR,\n2. Converting Silicon (Si) into Nano Silicon powders using PUREVAP\u2122 NSIR. The goal is to increase performance and storage capacity (highly sought-after characteristics in many industries but specifically EV) in lithium-ion batteries by replacing graphite with these nano silicon powders, and\n3. Converting Silica (Quartz, SiO2) quartz into fumed silica.  \n\n\nThe successful milestone announced today by HPQ relates to the conversion of silicon into Nano Silicon powders (project #2 above). After experiencing certain delays relating to unexpected operating issues, PyroGenesis\u2019 engineering team has been able to successfully produce nano silicon materials, and this represents a significant confirmation of the original assumptions underlying this project.\n\nThe next major milestone is to optimize the process and have a third-party evaluation of powder characteristics, after which orders can be delivered to various entities who have been waiting to receive samples.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding certain unexpected operating challenges, the results today are indeed a significant milestone as it validates our original assumptions and provides further evidence that we are on the right path,\u201d said P. Peter Pascali, CEO and Chair of PyroGenesis. \u201cAlthough there may be challenges ahead, and no outcome can be guaranteed, words cannot adequality describe the excitement at PyroGenesis of potentially being able to address significant challenges facing the development of lithium-ion batteries for the EV market, and others. For example, by 2030, it is estimated that anodes may contain up to 30% silicon in automotive applications as compared to today where silicon is barely used in these applications.2\u201d\n\n[Research](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TDv-uxAOqfiOsWrObsZOP4ecEC0KhHAuWShfW8LoF6OGNC72EFL-U1jdYCwr9m_gSCn-npJRqaAUrIzCPCJXKppKX41LtLh9HkDYKAG2MIBVcb8djwV-HNRJ-DjS6oc_flyVgDDL_ABMkyEt13WYy89Var4UPx8wfdhwP0vCx0c=)3 indicates that replacing graphite with nano silicon powders could allow for the manufacturing of high-performance Li-ion batteries with the capability of delivering an almost tenfold (10x) increase in anode capacity, inducing a 20-40% gain in the energy density of the next generation of Li-Ion batteries. The Li-ion battery market size is estimated to grow from USD 44.2 billion in 2020 to USD 94.4 billion by 2025, equivalent to a CAGR of 16.4%.4 \n\nPyroGenesis also confirms that it is now moving forward with the next phase of the project which consists (i) designing and manufacturing a semi-continuous process system with a commercial production capacity of at least 500 kg/month (approx. 6 MT/year) of nano silicon powders, and (ii) validating commercial scalability.\n\n\u201cPyroGenesis\u2019 last major milestone, prior to the delivery of its first nano silicon sample, is the completion of an optimization process on the samples produced\u201d, said Mr. Pierre Carabin, CTO and Chief Strategist of PyroGenesis. \u201cThe optimization process will, amongst other things, (i) improve product quality and consistency, (ii) evaluate the chemical characteristics, and (iii) perform microscopic and particle size distribution analysis.\u201d\n\nAs previously disclosed, PyroGenesis has entered into an agreement with HPQ NANO in which, amongst other things, PyroGenesis benefits from (i) a 10% royalty (\u201cRoyalty\u201d) on HPQ NANO\u2019s future sales (with set minimums), and (ii) the option to convert this Royalty at any time into a 50% ownership in HPQ NANO.\n\n**About PyroGenesis Canada** **Inc.**\n\nPyroGenesis Canada Inc., a high-tech company, is a leader in the design, development, manufacture and commercialization of advanced plasma processes and sustainable solutions which reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) and are economically attractive alternatives to conventional \u201cdirty\u201d processes. PyroGenesis has created proprietary, patented and advanced plasma technologies that are being vetted and adopted by multiple multibillion dollar industry leaders in four massive markets: iron ore pelletization, aluminum, waste management, and additive manufacturing.
