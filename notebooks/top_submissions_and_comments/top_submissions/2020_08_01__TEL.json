        "selftext": "My family and I are all in business together. We are looking to invest a pretty decent amount of money. I\u2019ve been looking at Vanguard funds and I\u2019m comfortable moving into some large, mid, small cap funds, one that tracks the S&amp;P 500 and one aimed a dividends. \n\nMy dad prefers to invest through the bank and we have a guy that would help us place our money into various investments.\n\nHere is where we clash, I love vanguards low fees and I hate the idea of paying the fees our advisor charges (1 to 2%) a year (He is a fiduciary). Vanguard is way lower. Our advisor mentioned how he helps manage where our money is placed especially when times are bad. But his proposal looks like a general diversified portfolio. I just can\u2019t justify paying him for that. I\u2019m trying to tel my dad we can invest in the same type of funds with vanguard, with the advantage of way lower fees. He\u2019s worried that we won\u2019t have someone to tell us if we should move from one fund to a different fund. But my thinking is our financial advisor isn\u2019t going to tel us to move money either, as we are investing more aggressively for the long long term. I guess I believe the financial advisor promotes himself as being more active than he actually is and he\u2019s not worth it.  \n\nAm I crazy? I need some perspective on this. Much appreciated.",

        "selftext": "\u201cOn Tuesday, Tennessee Education Lottery (TEL) CEO Rebecca Hargrove said it is aiming to launch the state\u2019s sports betting market by 1 November at the latest.\n\nThis means that Tennessee residents will be able to legally bet on sports during the upcoming football season.\n\nSports betting became legal in Tennessee in May 2019 and since then, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Montana and New Hampshire all managed to legalise and launch their sports betting markets.\n\nLicensing updates\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s Sports Wagering Advisory Council meeting, Hargrove revealed that four operators and approximately 20 vendors and suppliers have applied for licenses.  The names of the operators were not disclosed; however, media sources say that BetMGM, DraftKings and FanDuel have applied for a license. The fourth company is Tennessee Action 24/7, a local Tennessee company that offers free-to-play games.\n\nOn Tennessee Action 24/7\u2019s website, a message says that the TEL is \u201ccurrently processing our Sports Gaming Operator license application.\u201d\n\nIn its latest quarterly report, MGM resorts revealed that it currently has market access and plans to launch sports betting operations in Tennessee later this year.\n\nOnline sports betting only\n\nUnlike other states with legal betting, Tennessee\u2019s sports betting laws only permit online and mobile sports betting. Tennessee is the only state to legalise online-only sports wagering, which makes it an outlier in the wider US gambling market.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.compare.bet/news/tennessee-sports-betting-to-go-live-on-1-november",
