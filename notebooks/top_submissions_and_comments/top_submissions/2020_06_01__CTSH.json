        "selftext": "Hello again, \u2018tardos. I\u2019m back with another deep-value play\u2014and might I suggest that, this time, you learn to take profit. Additionally, I\u2019ve realized that (due to poor levels of reading comprehension) it\u2019s necessary to include in an easy-to follow summary early-on in the post. Today, we\u2019re looking at DXC, your tech support specialist\u2019s least favorite company! The post will go as follows, and, as always, ***TL;DR at bottom***:\n\n1. What is DXC?\n2. What is the DXC turnaround process like?\n3. Undervalued\n4. Catalysts For Growth\n5. Bear Case \n6. Smart Money\n7. The Play / TL;DR\n\n# 1. What is DXC?\n\nDXC Technology is a provider of IT services. It\u2019s a massive company, sitting at \\~120 on the Fortune 500, and with 20B in LTM revenues. It operates through two segments, Global Business Services (GBS) and Global Infrastructure Services (GIS). GBS includes \u201ctechnology solutions comprising enterprise, cloud application, and consulting services; application services; analytics services; business process services; and industry software and solutions.\u201d The GIS segment \u201cprovides cloud and platform services; workplace, mobility, and Internet of Things services; and security solutions.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re like me, the above basically reads as a bunch of buzzwords that you don\u2019t care about. The important thing to realize is that many of DXC\u2019s specializations are absolute money-losers, some are stagnant, and some are highly promising. Essentially, any segment that has been doing well in the market overall (cloud security, analytics, etc.) is doing well, and the other segments are forgettable. Here\u2019s an example from their 2019 [annual investor presentation ](https://assets1.dxc.technology/investor_relations/downloads/DXC_Annual_Report_2019_10K_Final_v4.pdf)summarizing this effect (\u201cdigital\u201d essentially encapsulates SAAS solutions): \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p3mbstdooh251.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67ab20f7d02175a5cbb953676c6f183a31c6bd12\n\nAnd this trend has continued throughout Covid-19 up until this quarter. Though, as with most companies we\u2019ve seen some Covid-related QoQ contraction, we are absolutely seeing growth in the \u201cAnalytics and Engineering\u201d and \u201cCloud and Security\u201d segments:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j5fr5y9poh251.png?width=1244&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed624cbc16017302b3b49c2f96d112e5d1d28b32\n\nIf you\u2019re too lazy to parse all that, basically just understand that DXC does the same things as the B2B IT segments of Accenture, Cognizant Group, Infosys, and CGI Inc. Now that you understand *what* DXC does, it\u2019s important to understand if they do it *well*. Unfortunately for clients and shareholders, DXC\u2019s non-SAAS services (and some of it\u2019s SAAS ones) are ***utterly shit***. I\u2019m going to expand on this for a while, but don\u2019t have a fweak out just yet. \n\nThe shittiness of DXC over the past few years is well-demonstrated through a simple Reddit search. Within 5 minutes, I was able to find these comments: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cbtqfdyroh251.png?width=728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1adb3938ff4c15fcd6eb497ff31e3712728beea\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mhuq505uoh251.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18103395bbdbd2ab5cc129f259e2590c9ad328b9\n\nAll of this is reflected in DXC\u2019s share price, which has been on a downtrend for a long time:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wyk558qvoh251.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c6c40ae966f59e0939d1ddd5723d2af0cb2c0be\n\nEven though DXC beat earnings (Q4 results came in on May 28th), its stock price further plummeted due to other continuing issues, like diminishing revenue. The company\u2019s share price now sits at \\~$14.5 and it\u2019s market cap has declined to \\~$3.6 billion. Even though a decline in worth should feel nice and familiar for you autists, obviously this is not a company that\u2019s performing well. \n\nThe good news is that the management of the company is well aware that they are shit, and they are additionally well aware of the path towards growth: pivoting away from their underperforming verticals and into SAAS, selling unprofitable segments, and providing customers with an actually good experience. Let\u2019s examine what the company is doing to turn itself around, and whether or not this presents an opportunity for tendies.\n\n# 2. An Ugly DXCling?\n\nDXC\u2019s turnaround story is, in large part, about management. In 2019, continuing underperformance resulted in a management shake-up that saw [Mike Salvino](https://www.dxc.technology/investor_relations/ds/32534/147322-mike_salvino_biography) take the reins. In addition to looking like a [Chad](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk02_lng_BrG2LumGjtCOqGH94JrRLw%3A1590772575830&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1183&amp;bih=737&amp;ei=X0PRXv25L7OIytMP4YeG0Aw&amp;q=mike+salvino&amp;oq=mike+salvino&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADIECAAQGDIECAAQGDIECAAQGDIECAAQGDoFCAAQgwE6BggAEAgQHlDVBFjSDmDPEGgAcAB4AIABVogBvQaSAQIxMpgBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1n&amp;sclient=img&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi95bDSydnpAhUzhHIEHeGDAcoQ4dUDCAc&amp;uact=5#imgrc=X6Oqc96utpic5M) version of Jim Carrey, Salvino is very well-regarded in the field, and has quite a bit of experience \u201cextracting value\u201d from his time at PE firm Carrick Capital Partners. Also, he was the chief executive at Accenture Operations, which is essentially Accenture\u2019s non-shitty IT services branch. Salvino has instituted several changes designed to turn DXC around. \n\nFirst, they\u2019ve begun to focus on, well, not being shitty to customers. This is not mere talk. Prior to this quarter, 40 customers had opened challenges against DXC for services not rendered; these occasionally amounted to legal action. However, on the last conference call, Salvino noted that:\n\n\u201cOn customer delivery, we have now **fixed 35 of the 40 challenged accounts** \\[meaning the customers are retained\\]. Of the remaining five, two have decided to leave us, and we are still working the other three. Investing to fix these accounts was something I highlighted during my first earnings call, and I'm happy to report this is pretty much behind us.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s extremely good news. Another problem that has plagued DXC is its Workplace and Mobility subunit. But this long struggling area has actually been *helped* by Covid-19, and may become a big earner going forward:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpkdaxmyoh251.png?width=1562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=129539453ec6a126f0e5149ca5a52b0f8b7bdc40\n\nAdditionally, DXC has been implementing financial flexibility measures both as a response to Covid-19 and so as to strengthen the business generally. It\u2019s recently completed a debt-raise for [$500 million dollars](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312520107182?cik=1688568), at a modest\u2014particularly for a company that has a bad narrative surrounding it\u20144% interest rate. That\u2019s good because the stock price won\u2019t get hammered by an offering anytime soon. \n\nFurther, DXC has no upcoming debt obligations that are particularly threatening\u2014in fact, the nearest debt due date is in 2022. It also recently suspended its massive 5% dividend. This news is largely what caused DXC to crash 13% on Friday, May 29th, but it\u2019s actually a smart move. The suspension of a dividend will free up further cash that can be reinvested and used to pay down interest, as well as to [raise employee salaries](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/DXC-Technology-Salaries-E1603125.htm). This is a huge point, because DXC has lost human capital by not paying its employees enough; finally, they are learning their lesson. Considering all this, the recent stock price downturn is frankly a big market overreaction (and if you were investing in DXC for a dividend, you\u2019re an idiot).\n\nBut here\u2019s the real reason to invest in DXC, as described by some fat guy named Seth Klarman:\n\n**\u201c**Spinoffs permit parent companies to divest themselves of businesses that no longer fit their strategic plans, are faring poorly, or adversely influence investor perceptions of the parent, thereby depressing share prices. When a company owns one or more businesses involved in costly litigation, having a poor reputation, experiencing volatile results, or requiring an extremely complex financial structure, **its share price may also become depressed.** The goal in spinning off such businesses is to create **parts with a combined market value greater than the present whole.**\u201d \u2014 Seth Klarman in *Margin of Safety*\n\nThis quote is amazingly apt, considering DXC recently [completed a sale](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/dxc-technology-to-sell-us-state-and-local-health-and-human-services-business-to-veritas-capital-for-50-billion-2020-03-10) of its shitty Local Health and Human Services segment to PE firm Veritas Capital for\u2026 $5 billion (**\\~$3.6 billion cash after taxes**). The market responded with huge support to this plan: DXC share price jumped around 30% in one day and remained there for months, up until it got bat-soup fucked:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q23pv531ph251.png?width=1208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c9194ef092dd355475092b978141074705829cb\n\nNow that we know DXC\u2019s areas of operation, ugly past, turnaround strategy, and recent stock price action, we can turn towards an examination of its financials. \n\n# 3. The Great DXCtator\n\n**\u201c**But WAIT,\u201d you\u2019re surely thinking! Doesn\u2019t it seem shocking that DXC, a company with a mere $3.6 billion market cap, will literally have that amount in cash come deal close? Surely, something must be wrong. You\u2019re probably thinking that the deal won\u2019t close due to Covid. That may be true, except for the following clause in the MAC. What\u2019s the MAC? Only the [very thing](https://www.divestopedia.com/definition/4954/material-adverse-change-mac) designed to avoid this deal getting shuttered by force majeure (e.g. a pandemic):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/233awtm3ph251.png?width=1718&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3938a75584f35f80c8ad48ff615e777c6fce607\n\nOf course, there has been much skepticism still\u2014but Salvino\u2019s earnings call comments demonstrate complete conviction that this deal will go through as planned (actually, ahead of schedule). It seems extremely unlikely that such comments would be made were this not to be the case:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2f61tb5ph251.png?width=1628&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb86e6154fddeb424e1099947035f0ad9116c4ed\n\nBut perhaps you\u2019re thinking\u2014if you\u2019re one of the more \u201csavant\u201d idiots here\u2014that this company is abysmal at generating FCF, and so it effectively is still a terrible investment, even with cash on hand equal to its market cap. However, you\u2019d also be wrong:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ufvzogk6ph251.png?width=1828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d823a78b877b8cf594db3c8bb347f7e1a187d77b\n\nAdditionally, the CEO has expressed that cash from the sale will be used to pay down debt, resulting in even more future FCF (check those large negative interest numbers on the above statement). Here\u2019s an image of a DCF that makes some terribly conservative assumptions from an [excellent analysis](https://autumncapitalmanagement.wordpress.com/2020/05/19/dxc-technology-nysedxc/) of DXC\u2019s finances (apologies for pic quality):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gk1owm19ph251.png?width=716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08c1bd569f3beec3293292b294af3855ff1ab8c4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pz02iqscph251.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=067ea46fa7faa3c023896a648a425b4f40962fd2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oxvplwfdph251.png?width=675&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2426564fc2cc3b958e5769f9456a18def77267a8\n\nWhat does this mean? Essentially, if DXC behaves as it has in the past, its current stock price implies an mouth-watering 20% IRR over the next decade. Given *astoundingly* conservative assumptions, including \u201c-50% revenue, margin contraction across the board, $1.5B in AR write-downs (40% of outstanding), and $400m in working capital additions for *five* years on a *smaller* business with currently break even working capital,\u201d there\u2019s still a positive IRR of around 5.77%. Basically, once the market properly values DXC, it\u2019s gonna fly. \n\n# 4. Catalysts\n\nWhat\u2019s gonna make the market catch on? The most obvious catalyst, and one which proves this thesis, will be the completion of the segment sale. As is mentioned above, it\u2019s expected this will occur by next September. However, I expect the narrative will change far sooner, after the initial de-risked (post-ER) stock is bought up. To truly make money, you often have to get in before the market catches on.\n\nAdditionally, the market could begin valuing DXC not on its past performance, but on its likely future performance. In a way, it\u2019s already doing that. If you recall from above, the interest rate on DXCs new bond offering was just 4%. Because the [current risk free rate ](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmubmusd03m?countrycode=bx)is \\~1.4%, if this company was as distressed as its stock price would imply, we\u2019d expect to see this interest be something more like 7.4% - 9.4%. You can do some math to see what this implies for the stock price, but I\u2019m too lazy. Basically, it means it's super undervalued.\n\nFurther, DXC\u2019s shift to cloud could prove profitable enough to change the narrative around the company. There\u2019s been a 23% uptick in qualified pipeline leads over the past few months, many of which come from cloud customers dealing with WFH, and 7% cloud growth QoQ. But they\u2019re also working to better margins, instead of merely boosting top-line growth. The company\u2019s $550-700 million cost savings plan, according to the earnings call, is expected to accelerate this coming quarter. \n\nI\u2019m getting a bit bored of writing this, so let me just end with this summary. EPS this past quarter was $1.2 per share, and the quarter before that was $1.4 per share. Boo-hoo. In that time, the stock price has more than **halved**, even though the company generates FCF, and has entered into a sale that will see them **receive their MARKET CAP IN COLD HARD CASH**. And that is what we call on opportunity.\n\n# 5. Bear Case\n\nThere are four main potential components to the bear case. The first, and most obvious, is that the sale doesn\u2019t go through. That seems unlikely based on this last ER, based on the language of the MAC, and based on the fact that the involved PE firm hasn\u2019t said anything to the contrary. But anything is possible.\n\nSecond, DXC\u2019s shift to cloud could be absolutely botched. Keep in mind that, this whole time, I\u2019ve not been claiming this is a *good company*. So I suppose that it\u2019s possible that DXC could fuck this turnaround up so badly that their future earnings come in far worse than the -8% to -10% growth they\u2019ve already conservatively forecasted for the upcoming quarter. That being said, even though they\u2019ve been shitty, they aren\u2019t exactly ignorant about IT trends. They are the largest fully IT focused company in the Fortune 500, after all.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s a tiny chance that they struggle with their debt. It\u2019s not like their cap table is particularly attractive: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p0jpdo4fph251.png?width=1326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=030a0043b46585ce2eb97982989fe540579e474e\n\nHowever, it must be kept in mind that they should have $3.6 billion cash on hand very soon, and that they are able to raise new debt at highly reasonable rates. Even if they weren\u2019t they only have $600 million of debt maturing in the next two years (and they have $20 billion in revenue). So it\u2019s not exactly like they\u2019re on the brink of bankruptcy. \n\nFinally, as some old guy said once, the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. So even if *everyone knows DXC* is undervalued, that doesn\u2019t mean that it won\u2019t stay that way. In my opinion, this is the true risk. It\u2019s much easier for investors to buy into the narrative that a company is undervalued because it\u2019s going to do better than expected, than it is to get them to believe that a company is deservedly getting shat on, but that said stream of shit is coming at far too high a flow-rate. But I also am confident in the market\u2019s efficiency. \n\n# 6. \u2018Tutes for the Slutes\n\nAs always, it\u2019s best to assume that some loser from Bridgewater has figured this shit out already. So let\u2019s see what the smart money thinks about DXC. First, note that it has an extremely high level of institutional ownership\u2014around 80%. You can see the many funds holding it [here](https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=dxc). To me, this shows good faith in their future prospects.\n\nAdditionally, ER reports are catching on to the fact that DXC is undervalued. Morgan Stanley [just set a $33 price target](https://markets.businessinsider.com/analysts-opinions/dxc-technology-overweight-715630). Citigroup and Cowen have also recently upgraded to a buy rating. Even JPM, who is neutral on the stock, has a price target of 17. That\u2019s \\~16% higher than price at time of writing.\n\nEssentially, smart money is betting on this play. With a recent ER having de-risked the stock, I believe that now is a great time to get in. I predict we won\u2019t see this below $\\~14 for the foreseeable future.\n\n# 7. TL;DR / Play\n\nDXC is retardedly undervalued. Even with worst case assumptions, it should go up from here. I contend that a run up these next few months, and then the closure of the $5 billion sale will assuage almost any fears of these worst case assumptions. Keep in mind that this company is generating almost the same EPS as the quarter previously in one of the worst crises we\u2019ve ever seen, will have $3.5 billion in pure cash after tax, and has taken **real** steps to implement a turnaround. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll take the market long at all to catch on\u2014I expect there to be a runup prior to their next earnings call on August 9th. If the company can merely beat its conservative EPS forecast and confirm the deal is still good, which it almost certainly will, all is gucci. Because of that I\u2019ve loaded up on:\n\n# July 17 $16 &amp; $17 calls\n\nI\u2019m also going with stock since it\u2019s been nicely de-risked, but you guys don\u2019t give a shit about that. Positions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hxcjccogph251.png?width=1426&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0aa80ccafed5f14971384e7e77135ebefadf230\n\n***All I can say about DXC is this\u2014remember all the girls you didn\u2019t think were hot until they turned around?***",
