        "selftext": "I'm not trying to pass as a genius or savvy investor at all but most of my positions have been up. I started investing in mid June 2016 and there was a time I dipped into 3x leveraged ETFs like JNUG hoping to make quick bucks. I failed a lost a bit of money (about $3000). Back then I read charts like crazy, trying to predict the trend, looking to the Fed minutes, etc. Guess what? One day I was sure that my positions would go up and when the Fed released their statement, it went down.\n\nI was sick of it. In the very beginning, I invested in AMD, NVIDIA, APPLE, and TWITTER. During all that time I toiled over fundamentals, charts, etc, those stocks steadily climbed. I realized had I not trying to get rich quick, I would be in far better position with those simple blue chip stocks. \n\nSo I changed the way I invest.\n\nI stopped paying too much attention to the news. I stopped reading annual reports, I don't care what the fundamentals are, I wouldn't give a damn if a apocalypse hit tomorrow. Candlesticks, earning, financial statements are all meaningless.\n\nI buy and DCA everything. Every paycheck I set aside a certain amount and put into stocks and ETF\n\nThis is my current portfolio\n\nAMD, NVDA, APPL, MSFT, VOO, VTI, SPY, SCHG, VGT, XLK, FINX, QQQ, QTEC, FTEC, ESPO, SMH, MGK.\n\nIf you think \"ha, this idiot actually bought SPY and VOO, they are the same shit\"\n\nYes, that's why I admitted I'm an idiot. Perhaps a lucky idiot. The only stock that I lost money is SQ. I bought it at all time high in 2018 and the stock went nearly sideway in 2019 so I sold it at a loss of $200 and invested that money into something else. All of my positions have been going up.\n\nSometimes I tried to dabble into options trading after seeing mad gains from wallstreetbet. \n\nThe main problem: again, I'm an idiot. A happy idiot in fact. No matter how much I read/watch YT videos, I don't understand theta, delta, exercise, short leg, long leg, time value, intrinsic value, strike price. Ok, I do understand the definitions but I don't know how they can connect to each other to make me money. \n\nSo I dropped option trading completely, not even attempt to do anything about it\n\nMy portfolio hit all time low on March 20 at -17.33%, today it hit all time high at 18%. It climbed about 40% for the past 3 months\n\nAll due to DCA. I steadily put money into stock every 2 weeks. I don't care if the market hit all time high or all time low, I buy. When RH crashed and everyone freaked out, it didn't affect me one bit. \n\nWhen I read the story about that guy who took his life over 700k loss, I realize it could be me had I not learn anything from the early $3000 loss. I don't do well with stress. I want to go home after work at night, check my stocks for 5 minutes, eat something, fap, and go to bed. I don't ever want to stress out every minutes of my life over things I can't control: the market.\n\nI don't try to give anyone advice because I'm still a learner. All I ever do is to expand my portfolio and put some more money every paycheck.\n\nBut before you buy any book or subscribe to any stock-picking or teaching service, do you realize that stocks picked by a monkey can beat the market?\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/rickferri/2012/12/20/any-monkey-can-beat-the-market/#324cef35630a\n\nhttps://www.stockinvestor.com/35446/beating-market-surprise-surprise-monkeys-win/\n\nI wouldn't waste money in any of that. Every penny I'm not putting into stock is a penny I loss from profit.\n\n**tl;dr**: an idiot made money by DCA into ETFs and blue chip stocks after failing basic math.",

        "selftext": "**Abstract**\n\nHello all, today we are going to be discussing everyone\u2019s favorite meme stock, ~~Tesla~~ AMD! Before we get into the meat of the arguments for AMD and Intel, this is intended to be a follow up of another pretty crappy post I made a few months back, as such we will go into much further depth than before. Also I will not be providing price targets due to macro environmental circumstances.\n\nIn this post I will first have to cover some terms needed to talk about both companies\u2019 products, and some history. Then I will talk about how both are positioned in the present and the near term (next 6 months to a year), followed by long term speculation which I\u2019ll release later (next week maybe). Please note that I will briefly touch on NVIDIA and their products in the future speculation, but I will not go into depth due to there being a lot of misinformation circulating. I will most likely make another post doing a deep dive into the relation between NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD in late October/December.\n\n*Also note that I do not hold any shares or derivatives in AMD, Intel or NVIDIA.*\n\n**An introduction into the semiconductor industry**\n\nThe semiconductor industry is a massive industry currently valued at a massive 433b1, it is what powers all electronics ranging from the weakest smartwatch all the way up to the largest supercomputers. Semiconductors are made out of silicon oxide with transistors on them which perform logic functions and the likes. The semiconductor market has two large segments, that being the CPU market and the GPU market, with CPUs being used to compute a wide ranging set of data, whereas a GPU is used to perform lots of very repetitive tasks such as rendering. There are four primary companies in this space, that being Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, and ARM (note that Qualcomm and Samsung license their core architectures from ARM).\n\n*Some important terms that are needed to understand basic things that will affect performance/competitiveness.*\n\n1. Architecture: Refers to the design of a product think about it like how a house is built from a frame.\n2. Clock speed: How many cycles a CPU/GPU can perform, each cycle is the effectuation of a certain number of calculations.\n3. IPC: Instructions per clock refers to how many calculations a CPU/GPU can perform per clock cycle.\n4. Core: The \u201cprocessor\u201d in a CPU/GPU that performs the calculation\n5. Thread: present only in CPUs, allow multiple code paths to access a singular core at once thereby ensuring that the core is always fed with information.\n6. Monolithic design: A CPU/GPU using only 1 piece of silicon.\n7. MCM: Multi-chip module, a CPU/GPU that is composed of a multitude of pieces of silicon.\n8. Wafer: A disc of varying size in which the transistors are inlaid on, this will later be cut up into chips\n9. Chips: Smaller pieces of silicon which are typically a final product\n10. Node: Refers to how small a transistor is, measured in nano-meters (NM). Note however, it is more of a marketing term and the real size of the transistors are typically much larger, furthermore different nodes are intended to compete with each other, such as Intel\u2019s 10nm node being intended to be on parity with TSMC\u2019s 7nm node.\n11. Reticle limit: The maximum size a chip can be made on a certain node.\n12. EUV: Extreme ultraviolet, is the cutting edge of semiconductor manufacturing, uses high energy ultraviolet light to imprint the transistors on the wafer, allows for increased efficiency and better yields.\n13. Yields: Defect density of a wafer, if there is a defect on wafer the corresponding chip may be compromised and have to be thrown out or binned lower.\n14. Binning: The practice of sorting chips by how many defects they have, a chip with a lot of defects will have lower performance then one that has none.\n15. Cache: Small, low latency storage that allows for cores to quickly access data. Further divided into L1, L2, and L3 cache, with L1 cache having the lowest latency and lowest storage and L3 having the highest latency and the highest capacity.\n16. Memory/RAM: Fast storage that a CPU can directly access, note that it can not store as much data as traditional solutions, but latency and transfer speed are much higher. There are currently four generations of it, that being DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4, with DDR4 being the newest. Memory also has clock speeds which indicates indirectly how fast the data transfer is.\n17. Fab/Foundry: Where wafers are made, the three largest ones are TSMC, Intel and Samsung.\n\n**A brief history of the relation between Intel and AMD**\n\nIntel was founded in 1968 by a few people you may know about, Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce, and Arthur Rock. Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce had left Fairchild Semiconductors with Arthur Rock providing the initial capital. Together the three made the first commercial CPU, the 4004.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nIntel 4004\n\nAMD was founded a year later in 1969 and initially produced memory, but in 1981 they entered in a 10 year partnership with Intel as a secondary supplier as requested by IBM. At the time, most OEMs required a secondary supplier to ensure that they would not become too reliant on one company and to ensure that they would have enough supply should one company have issues. This meant that Intel licensed their technology to AMD so they could produce them at their own fabs.\n\nThis partnership did not last long when in 1984 Intel broke the partnership, and violated the terms which in and after numerous appeals and cases of discovery abuse on the side of Intel resulted in the court's ruling in AMD\u2019s favor in 19902. Because of this AMD was forced to set out and create their own chips, initially copying Intel\u2019s 80C287, which would have been shared under the 10 year partnership. This resulted in Intel suing AMD for patent infringement, however the courts ruled in AMD\u2019s favour citing the previously mentioned case.\n\nAs the decade progressed, and the 2000s rolled around AMD came out with their own products, which handily beat Intel\u2019s own offerings, but the damage was already done. Intel was able to make so much money that they essentially had a monopoly on the CPU market.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nOld benchmark demonstrating AMD's advantage over Intel\n\nBut despite having the performance crown for about 7 years, their market share never came close to that of Intel, and the reason behind this would be revealed in 2009.\n\nIn 2009, the European commission fined Intel $USD 1.4b3. The reason behind this was Intel had bribed OEMs with cash incentives to not use AMD processors. This was to the point that Intel paid Dell 1b per year to not use AMD4. These bribes were so significant that when in 2006, in order not to be laughed out of business, they started to use AMD products, resulting in a massive 50% decrease in profit in 20065. That being said the damage was already done once again, and AMD was relegated to being a secondary competitor to Intel as they had simply run out of money. AMD released the Phenom in 2008, which was thoroughly crushed by the Intel competitors and after three years of refreshing the product with minor improvements, they released the horrible Bulldozer in 2011 which was legendary for its horrible performance, and insane power consumption. In 2016, they were near insolvency, with a share price bottoming out at 2$ per share.\n\nAll the while, Intel made small iterative performance upgrades while making all the money they could ever want. This is why your computer from 2010 is still very serviceable in 2020, 10 years later.\n\nIn 2017, AMD released their new Zen architecture with a massive 40%+ leap in IPC bringing it back into competition with Intel. Furthermore, Zen was an MCM design meaning that you could pair a few small chips to act as one large chip via Infinity Fabric, an interconnect that acted as the highways permitting multiple chips, or chiplets to communicate with each other.\n\n**Intel VS. AMD in the modern age**\n\nA lot has happened in the last 5 years. Currently, Intel\u2019s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation. For example, Intel\u2019s primary product, Intel\u2019s current offerings are a mere 7% better in applications that only use 1-2 cores, than those of AMD\u2019s while using 50% more energy and having vastly inferior in the increasingly important applications which leverage more than four cores. Intel\u2019s highest end desktop product, the w3175x, coming in at 3k only has 28 cores, whilst the highest end AMD cpu the 3990x, has over double at 64 cores. The performance disparity is clear, AMD is the only viable option for productivity. The story continues in servers where Intel is outclassed in a similar manner to that of the desktop with performance on the AMD side being well over 200% higher. The slaughter continues into laptops where AMD\u2019s 4900HS, completely embarrasses the highest end Intel competition while consuming \u2153 the power. The only performance crown that Intel can claim is gaming, and even then it is a mere 7% higher, due to extreme clock speeds with their newest architecture, when compared to AMD\u2019s design, which is over a year old.\n\nThere are multiple reasons why Intel is so behind in performance, the primary being nodes. Intel\u2019s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. Earlier on I mentioned that AMD had fabs and was a secondary supplier, however as they were approaching insolvency, they sold off their fabs and partnered with Global Foundries, and later TSMC. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm, which was designed to compete with 10nm, extremely fast, handedly taking Intel\u2019s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel\u2019s road map, volume 10 nm will most likely hit the market by 2021, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm, which was designed to compete with Intel\u2019s 7nm hitting markets in 2020. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end of Intel\u2019s fabs. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel.\n\nThis is also compounded, though to a lesser extent by there being little to no IPC improvements in 5 years, meaning that AMD was free to catch up and in many cases surpass them.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin when it comes to Intel in the near term is their security vulnerabilities. Before 2018, all security vulnerabilities were mainly from software attacks, but that changed with the discovery of Meltdown and Specter. To show how important these issues were, let me illustrate an example. *Say you are a CEO of a major investment firm (lol), and you are using Intel servers to do whatever you need to do, you go about your day, the server is 100% secure from a software standpoint. Night comes, and you decide to look at how profitable your company was this quarter (again lol), but on the front page you see \u201cMajor leak at X company all confidential data was leaked,\u201d you panic and call up your IT guy and he is in a panic, the head lines are correct all company data stored on any server that you own has been leaked and there is nothing you can do about it.* That is the danger of these vulnerabilities. There is absolutely nothing you or your staff could have done, and worse yet, there are over a dozen similarly dangerous vulnerabilities, and over 600 more minor ones. The only way to try and prevent these leaks are to apply patches from Intel, but this results from anywhere between a 10% to a 60% loss in performance, which needs to be made up by buying new servers as you are already at 90-100% capacity. Then you hear that a certain company, AMD, was immune to this attack and their products are vastly superior. This is the major issue plaguing Intel at the moment. For the time being you will see a major rise in server sales as people scramble to buy up servers to remain operational, but in time they will switch to AMD, with AMD forecast to take 10% in Q2 20206, up from near 0% in 2016.\n\n**Intel VS. AMD in the near future**\n\nAt the moment AMD is uniquely positioned, their competition has yet to compete truely with their 1 year old tech, and they are on track to release brand new CPUs this year in late Q3/Q4. As a warning, we are entering grounds of speculation, but do note that this speculation is based on reliable leakers like AdoredTV7 (correctly leaked entire AMD CPU product stack from last year with only minor errors), Moore\u2019s Law is Dead8 (correctly leaked entire CPU product stack form Intel that was released this year with near 0 errors thus far).\n\nAMD: Intel  \n(New product titled Zen 3, releasing this year) (New product released this year)\n\n16 cores with 32 threads N/A\n\n12 cores with 24 threads 10 cores with 20 threads\n\n8 cores with 16 threads 8 cores with 16 threads\n\n6 cores with 12 threads 6 cores with 12 threads\n\nThings to remember\n\n\\- Zen 3 \\~13-15% IPC bump7, with maybe 100ish MHz clock speed bump7, which will allow AMD to claim the final performance crown of gaming from Intel, this coupled with Intel being nowhere in sight will allow AMD to reign supreme in all faculties for a while.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nAMD is in an excellent position to capitalize on Intel\u2019s stagnation. The security flaws could have not come at a better time, accelerating the world\u2019s adoption of AMD CPUs and their new products will beat Intel in gaming thanks to the IPC and clock speed increase improving their gaming performance by at least 15%. Overall, Intel is a precarious spot, that being said they have vast sums of cash and they had a few key developments in the past few years which could allow them to catch up in 2022 or 2023. I will discuss that possibility in a later post along with an analysis of how AMD will perform in the GPU market with consoles on their side.\n\n1.

Mexico and the US have a tightly coupled trading relationship. The USMCA stands to invigorate that relationship and emphasize successes in energy production, manufacturing price parity, and tech-invoked trade access. The exercising of law will result in institutional confidence, resulting in reasonable profits from July-September.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Mexico is Buy American as a nation. It has a tightly coupled relationship with American output.](https://preview.redd.it/jcz0alawji751.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a85687aafa11d3bf4e600e380f08fdea89eea52)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- NAFTA ends June 30th and the USMCA goes into effect July 1st. The US is the last nation ready to prepare the changes.\n\n\\- Trump will soon be under pressure for some form of economic stimulus. This may be in the form of an infrastructure bill by the time September or the election rolls around.\n\n\\- The USMCA modernizes up cross border digital trade and seeks to modernize some structural changes that have transformed in the energy industries invoking industrial surplus. This will increase the rate of exchange\n\n\\- These changes from Facebook (WhatsApp), Walmart, Amazon, Costco, Shopify, Cloudflare, Paypal, and other important supply chain players like **SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS** to supercharge trade between the two nations.\n\n\\- These changes also encourage energy production between US &amp; Mexico, where Mexico has fallen behind and Texas has exceeded.\n\n\\- **NO** this DD is not about the obvious auto-manufacturing benefit. It is an important factor but there is plenty of evidence that only focuses on that element of the USMCA.\n\n\\- Kansas City Southern is one of the ten Class-I Railroads of the US. It is the **ONLY** Class-I Railroad that connects the US &amp; Mexico and runs along the Gulf of Mexico.  This results in streamlined cross-border energy and product trades. This also means that **KSU** **stands to agnostically benefit from economic improvements in energy output and nation building from both the US &amp; Mexico.**\n\n\\- Mexico is an important bulwark nation for the US to bolster as a partner against Chinese economic threat. Its relationship with US is far different than international partners like Germany, India, and Japan. There is a far greater efficiency potential between the two nations across many industries related to logistics, mining, energy, manufacturing, telecom, and agriculture.\n\n\\- Mexico's higher education and English learners have rapidly increased as Mexico radically approaches middle incomes and its narcotics problem. By most accounts, the US is least behind in terms of social policy regarding The Drug War. The US stands to adapt and benefit most rapidly from the economic bottleneck the Drug War has produced.\n\n\\- Migration is complex between the two nations. It is arguably a symbiotic relationship regarding wages, education, crime, and currency parity with respects to US &amp; Mexico.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[1994, the signing of NAFTA was a consequential inflection point in economic history.](https://preview.redd.it/73u5e39bki751.png?width=3045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a8296fa4d5fb1797d141f936c4809c683b022e4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Mexico serves as important trading vector and access point to increase global price efficiencies in auto markets, energy, materials, agriculture, and labor.](https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # The Product\n\nKansas City Southern is a relatively small railroad compared to other systems like Union Pacific. You can argue that this is beneficial as is allows the railroad to execute and iterate more rapidly to changes and optimize for efficiencies that larger railroads cannot.\n\nKSU does this with **Precision Railroad Scheduling** along with other Class-I railroads but to great effect. In simple terms, this means that railroads prioritize the scheduling of arrival and departures over the weight and output of each train run. This has resulted in\n\n* Greater speed\n* Greater flexibility to economic changes (Amazon, energy, etc)\n* Greater competition to trucking\n* Increased fuel efficiency\n* Greater economic output\n* Reduced costs for rail trade\n\n*This is an excellent primary for economic growth.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[List of traded goods managed by KSU](https://preview.redd.it/jwed8v3hoi751.png?width=1169&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a1cb82b7dcfa7ab59a727bc50991c9d303e3ef7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Diversified to benefit &amp; reflect Mexican-American progress](https://preview.redd.it/6qvks6g0oi751.png?width=2386&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=422e6aa0728e13e9fab0a76893522317a015a9cb)\n\n# \n\n[Institutional restructuring](https://preview.redd.it/bd6h7tpzoi751.png?width=543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3958e442f2cce7001739fbc333689ba5c7a56379)\n\n# \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Market ineffeciencies will rebalance with USMCA changes.](https://preview.redd.it/kjlml0x5pi751.png?width=540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a4a562b56d075fd1b6c6229f823aa8e5718c3f3)\n\n# \n\n# # The Macroeconomic view of Texas &amp; Nuevo Leon's economic zones\n\nThe reality is that there are logistical positions in Texas and Monterrey trade vectors that is strategically advantageous. Monterrey is a trading city located near the southern border that operates as an important global industrial zone for products and services delivered from Samsung, MSCI Financial, Toyota, Siemens, and the like because the region's geography permits it.\n\nThe story is quite simple. Mexico needs more energy output. Texas has it. Mexican can grow it. The USMCA is designed to directly benefit the economies of Mexico &amp; Texas.\n\nMonterrey, of course, is not the only important vector in Mexico that KSU falls under.

        "selftext": "Somehow we managed a green Monday. Let's hear it for the bulls. Bear gang walks home gay and empty-handed. If you held $SQ or $NVDA over the weekend, congratulations! Occasionally, diamond hands pay off. I'm sure you made some tendies. I know I did.\n\nEnough boasting, I'm not a total dick (only in person). I have a few disclaimers I want to put out real quick: 1) You should never trade anything you see on here without doing research of your own, 2) Never put more into one position than you're willing to lose, 3) Trading is all about patience - which is going to be important this week.\n\nOkay - I know, \"Shut the fuck up and get to the details, moron. I have money to throw away.\" What are some big things to look out for this week?\n\n1) Bank stress test on Thursday - this is going to give us some good insight on whether the financial sector can handle an unexpected event/adversity. Do not underestimate how important this is. Watch for possible lower volume until Thursday. I'm going to play the banks, but it's going to be last minute when I have a better idea of which side to play.\n\n2) COVID-19 daily reported cases. Things are starting to feel uneasy again. I live in Texas, and I know my county made it mandatory again to wear masks while indoors in public. Mamma didn't raise no bitch, but this is definitely something to monitor.\n\n3)  US/China tensions. Is the trade deal over? I mean we all knew it was over 6 months ago, and 6 months before that, and 6 months before that... but is it over?\n\n4) Oil uncertainty. Chevron JV in Saudi Arabia restarting shipments despite OPEC deal. Others likely to follow.\n\nIf I missed anything big, and I'm autistic so I probably did, please put it in the comments. It's show-and-tell and everybody and their brother wants to hear about it.\n\nIf you don't like Kaepernick, you won't wear this brand mid calf and you won't trade this stock: **$NKE**\n\n[1 year chart](https://preview.redd.it/zbk39424qk651.png?width=1012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a915056770afdec8f82a9621e2e190f281c9ba4)\n\n[1 month chart](https://preview.redd.it/evyxu736qk651.png?width=1013&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a304d2bc9a93cd9ad55d1bba7bb96eab2702bfa9)\n\nSo tbh no one requested this one. I was thinking about America, the 4th of July, and tendies... then I had this memory come back to me. Last year - on June 30th - while getting ready for America's most patriotic day, I wrote up some DD on $NKE. I predicted the continuation of a trend (inverse head and shoulders), recommended a play, and it eventually came to fruition. There was money to be made. To the bars! People laughed, beers were drunk, mistakes were made, people cried. Not gonna talk about it.\n\nWhy do I like $NKE? The company makes some dope shoes, joggers, I rep their socks 50% of the time (the other 50% of the time is a mix of random brands), their marketing team is g(ay)reat, they make a mean profit. \n\nMy one complaint about $NKE last year was that they had too much of a cash pile and I suggested more marketing/R&amp;D. Turns out, having too much cash was a good thing (COVID). Not only do they have cash reserves, but the long term debt on the company's books is very modest. As J \"Daddy\" Pow once said \"stonks only go up\", so does $NKE's revenue, EBITDA, and FCFs YoY, QoQ, possibly even DoD. I have multiple degrees in accounting and finance and $NKE's financials make me pretty hard (humble brag...).\n\nEarnings estimates are very reachable at just $0.09 EPS. Even if it beats estimates, can this stock keep pumping? Is the risk of China trade too great to play the upside? How much is already priced in? ER is on 6/25.\n\nQuick peak at the options chain shows a priced in movement of about $3 on both sides after ER. Volume and open interest on the options chain are pretty high. Put/call ratio for volume is pretty bullish, ratio for open interest is barely bearish. RSI and MACD are both pretty bullish.\n\nTomorrow I'm going to watch the price, wait, and make a decision. What looks attractive to me right now? 7/2 105c and 110c. 6/26 105c are pretty cheap, too, but theta and IV decay are something you have to watch out for. There is a lot of uncertainty in the market right now. Don't blindly buy these.\n\nThe next one on the list is one that I have heard a lot about, but was rather unfamiliar with up until now: **$FSLY**\n\n[1 year chart](https://preview.redd.it/ji6axw5ixk651.png?width=809&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=978330dfcffc5fd2278c87f9ac5590bc4efe3da2)\n\n[1 month chart](https://preview.redd.it/3krds49pxk651.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82db0b39170f2ce693a932da00de951e3c99ee41)\n\nSome local retard recommended I do some DD on $FSLY so here it is. $FSLY is not profitable. It is near-profitable. It wants to be profitable. But it is not profitable. When I read a summary of the business operations and took a peak at the financials I saw big data and fast delivery. I'm young and I know what that means: a future of profitability (if properly managed of course). \n\n$FSLY joined our ranks last year with a May 2019 IPO. It's currently trading at ATHs with very high volume to back that up. RSI is signaling overbought, MACD is signaling the bull run must go on. Volume and price action signal investors could never be more optimistic. \n\nThe upside is uncharted territory (seriously go look at options chain. Calls only go up to the 90 strike). It could go *anywhere*. There are no specific resistance levels. The downside is pretty clear. This was a $20 stock not too long ago. It could go *anywhere*. \n\nThe options chain is pricing a movement of about $10 post-ER. Volume and open interest are both bullish. ER is 8/6 and recent EPS have fallen between -$0.05 and -$0.20.\n\nWhat does this stock really have going for it? Coronavirus. Work-from-home. Data and the transfer and storage of that data is more important now than ever. $FSLY will most likely win in the future, regardless, but can rona speed up its success? \n\nMy play for this fast-mover? Wait for a big red day and get in on some leaps. I'm thinking a post-earnings play. 8/21 90c don't look that bad, but I think the premiums will drop. If you don't want to play earnings the 7/10 80c are not that bad. A major part of this play is if daily rona cases continues to rise. Again, I suggest waiting for the price to drop a bit or at least flatten.\n\nTL;DR\n\nBe patient. Look at the events I pointed out in 1-4 and play accordingly.\n\n$NKE barely OTM calls to play ER - 7/2 105c and 110c\n\n$FSLY deep OTM calls to play ER and capitalize on rising COVID cases - 8/21 90c and 7/10 80c",

        "selftext": "Alright I get it. A lot of you degenerates have been burned by this POS from it\u2019s volatile swings but listen up. Micron is turning around a dead old horse to position itself to be a profitable competitor in the future.\n\nDRAM prices are down, NAND prices are down, all memory prices are down due to the lack of consumer demand from the bat flu and Memory chips are the business of Micron. However Micron has pivoted their business to focus their revenue on the X100 3D Xpoint chip. A memory chip that bridges the gap between NAND and DRAM. It\u2019s cheaper than DRAM and faster than NAND. Currently they are only selling it to data centers. Think cloud here. Cloud big. Cloud is the future. Data center demand has kept up the revenue for Nvidia and other chip companies which have said they are relying on for revenue in the time being since sales in other sectors are down.\n\nBased on Micron\u2019s last quarter sales it seems they have pivoted to rely more on the X100 as a point of revenue for their future.\n\nhttps://blocksandfiles.com/2020/03/27/micron-q2-results-fall-less-than-feared-as-xpoint-sales-revealed/\n\nThe X100 was released in 2020 and if Micron was able to capture 7% of revenue from sales of the X100 in the first quarter then it is expected that the sales of xpoint will grow have grown this past quarter and will continue to grow as the technology is adopted in data centers.\n\nData center business demand has been the saving grace of revenue for Nvidia, AMD, and other chip stocks when they reported recently.\n\nMicron pivoted their business before the corona wave to target data center demand. Data demand went up when everyone was at home and will continue to go up in the future as data grows exponentially.\n\nMU: 55 C 7/17",

        "selftext": "About twenty years ago, I had just graduated college. My grandfather had died years ago,  and he had left me a small amount to invest which was an account that, now graduated, I had access to. \n\n He had utilized a stock broker  and I was to  meet  with him. \n\nI was on a bit of a  tear.  I had just gotten my liberal arts degree, and  thought  I was  super smart.  And in all the arrogance of a sure-fire smart \u201ckid\u201d coming out of a liberal arts school and still buzzing a bit from the dotcom boom,  I  learned that I could make my own trades for 29.95 using s new site called \u201cE*Trade\u201d.  I spoke to my Dad about it, he said, talk to  broker,  but if that\u2019s what you want to, do, it\u2019s  your money (sort of with the whole, I wouldn\u2019t do it, but go for it, I guess, attitude)\n\n I spoke to the broker for  the first time, and  after his pitch of  what the portfolio had done in the last five years and some  stocks I was going buy, it all sounded reasonable and good.  He seemed to know what he was talking about, but I still, in my  pushy arrogance of late adolescence , inquired how much I paid him per trade.  it  was considerably more than 30 dollars. I then asked if  I could make some suggestions  as to what we could buy.\n\n\u201cWhat were you thinking of?\u201d\n\n\u201cApple, for one,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cOh no, I don\u2019t know about that.  They\u2019ve had a lot of issues the last few years, and I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\u201d\n\nMore due to cost differential per trade than this vague analysis, I told him I think I\u2019m going to go my own way.   I put about 1200 bucks into Apple, some less into the online book store  \u201camazon\u201d, and a couple of index funds,  and a few other companies, that I  thought had a lot interesting hype around them.\n\nSure enough, my apple investment looked horrible to start, losing about 40%  of  the value  within three months.  Same with Amazon.  I decided, though, to do nothing, and I was onto do different things.  I never  sold those shares, and today they\u2019ve are  pretty close to appreciating to  10,000%.  I bought Apple a few more times throughout my life, and that  one stock has accrued in value (I mean, all of it theoretical, I suppose, unless I do sell)  about the same for me  than my paychecks throughout my career.\n\nI have generally  picked winners. I own shares in Sam Adams, in Tesla, in google, in facebook, in nvidia, etc.  and still have those index funds, that did quite well as everything has over  the last twenty years.\n What\u2019s the lesson in all of this? I don\u2019t think there is one. Get lucky. Don\u2019t sell. And listen to  yourself, I  guess.",

Not sure why the date is more publicized, Robinhood and Yahoo doesn't have it correct for instance, but yeah now is your chance to get in before the earnings run-up.\n\nThey are a massive semi-conductor company, meaning they make all sorts of tiny, unique parts for all sorts of devices. Apple is totally reliant on them, as are many, many other tech companies. They made most of the internal wireless antennas for the last generation of cell phones, and they are making most of the next gen ones too.\n\nNvidia is also basically a semi-conductor firm and look at their recent results.

        "selftext": "First, I want to say I know most of us, even the professionals have no idea what is going on, ever.\n\nSecond, nearly every news article and blog to me is consistently wrong. But what really pisses me off is the follow up news articles, postings, etc have a bogus explanation why something happened. The information that should of been presented prior if it were a true future analysis. There is no benefit figuring out a short term explanation for increase or decrease in a stock after the fact when the stock market is a future fight.\n\nFinally, I am no better than anyone else, but I get gut feeling on some stocks that just stand out based of their trend and my intuition. I haven't got cocky and gone all out on any of these, but I have strong feelings. For example:\n\no 2016 I invested $200 dollars into AMD (60 Shares) which is worth \\~$3200 today. I was looking through various businesses and saw AMD significantly lower than Intel at the time. It was like 2 dollars a share! I was certain it would have substantial growth, maybe dumb luck, maybe intuition. I won't lie, I have no idea when to sell and rarely do. They still appear to be doing so well and will have a significant hand in AI, future of gaming and other technologies. \n\no 2020 At the bottom of Tesla's stock in March trading about \\~350 a share, I knew that would quickly rebound as the future is now, the clear path to transportation is self driving just as significant as all revolutionary technologies. For me, when I retire in 30-40 years I see myself in a self driving RV, with virtual reality capabilities. So, I held off on Tesla at this time because I listed to people full of shit thinking the economy was going to crash and Tesla would be worth less than 250 a share. \n\no Currently, I've invested in a couple commercial airliners, because look at those margins. Analyzing how long it takes airlines to recover, I say full recovery in 2-3 years. I eyeballed Boeing hard, many articles cautioning 'too big to fail' what a load of garbage. They are critical to national transportation. I was going to put down $1,000 on them at about $120 per share. They are up to $173 per share today, and I believe this is only the beginning. \n\no Also, Ford is a lot like the airlines, I have watch this stock sadly die away for four years, and I don't think it will be gone for good. It was \\~9 a share prior to COVID, and went sub $5. I bought a little then and I think they could get to $7 maybe even 8$ before continued their downward trend. \n\nI deviated with my own holdings, but I want this to be about inaccurate articles saying we are going into a recession, specific companies are the next Apple/Amazon that usually go down. Seriously, look up old news articles on companies are overwhelmingly wrong. \n\nIf you are curious of my holdings: ALK, F, SBUX, WEN, MSFT, TSLA, CSCO, SFM, NVIDIA, KR, AMD, CANN\n\nIn the past 4 years, I have 50% gain. Whatever you do, don't buy CANN, I knew this was a dumb move, but i had a little greed in me when I did it.",

        "selftext": "Good morning ladies, gentlemen and fellow autists, have you ever wondered if the genius day traders in robinhood are netting positive or negative?\n\n# Well your questions are just about to be answered with the [Robintrack daily top 10 Positions ETF](https://github.com/kendricksin/robintrack_ETF/blob/master/robintrack_ETF.py) written by yours truly.\n\nThe code is long and inefficient, done within a period of 3 hours, poorly annotated, so please have a go if you like it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# How does this ETF work?\n\nBasically, this ETF measures the quality of the decision, when bought or sold relative to today (6/12).\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n**Example 1** \\- (buy low, now high): When bought = 5, today's price = 10, traded = 1 - 5/10 = 0.5\n\n**Example 2** \\- (buy, high, now low): When bought = 15 today's price = 10, traded = 1 - 15/10 = -0.5\n\n**Example 3** \\- (sold low, now high): When sold = 5, today's price = 10, traded = 5/10 - 1 = -0.5\n\n**Example 4** \\- (sold high, now low): When sold = 15, today's price = 10, traded = 15/10 - 1 = 0.5 \n\nThis is a problem because you could have closed the position at better price point than today, but remember, this is just a hindsight algorithm.\n\n# Conditions:\n\n(1) Algorithm starts trading on 1/1 which is approximately the time where TSLA doubled and robinhood bois wet their pants.\n\n(2) Algorithm assume that you bought/sold the asset and diamond handed it till 6/12 (and closed the position), like a genius robinhood trader.\n\n(3) Only the top 10 increase/decrease in positions posted on [robintrack](https://twitter.com/robintrack) twitter page is considered.\n\n(4) Algorithm uses the Adjusted close from yahoo finance API (!pip install yfinance).\n\n(5) Only tickers mentioned more than twice (since 2019) are considered.\n\n# Findings:\n\n(1) Assuming you entered a $1000 position (long or short) each time a top 10 increase/decrease flashes in robintrack twitter, and closed all those positions today:   \n\n\nYou would have only lost **$112k** after trading 3450 trades ($1k each).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(2) The top gains are as follows:\n\n![img](ysceetshd1551)\n\nObviously AAL, NCLH, and CCL yolos have paid off. \n\nApparently alot of JDST (gold bear 2x) and UGAZ (natural gas bull 3x) was sold at its peak.\n\n(3) Top GUHs are as follows:\n\n![img](xxxr4cv2e1551)\n\nXSPA is an anomaly in yahoo finance.\n\nEnergy were pretty bad plays.\n\n(4) Hot tickers, that might be on your mind.\n\n![img](8h7bur69i1551)\n\nThe combined decision making of RH trades made a 4x loss on NVDA, but also made decent gains on MSFT and NKLA.\n\nAlso, i did a check on MRNA (2.2) &amp; GILD (0.7) it pays to join in the Biotech pump and dump simply following the RH masses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Final Word:\n\nI am a novice coder, trained in mechanical engineering.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, I've been trading options for almost a year now. I paid my learning tuition with some ill-advised plays in the beginning, but have settled into a net profit by now running more novice strategies - cash-secured puts, buy/writes, and the wheel strategy.\n\nIn the past few weeks, stocks that I sold covered calls on have skyrocketed above my strikes and I'm wondering what to do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **5/14 - Bought 100 NVDA at 318.40 and sold a 6/12 345 call for 10.44;** after hearing about their new A100 system (I'm in ML and &lt;&lt;&lt;3 Nvidia's products). I was too correct in their success and now they're trading at \\~350 so I'm losing out on **$500**. Not too shabby, especially with the &gt;$1000 from the call premium.\n* **5/28 - Bought 100 BA at 153.56 and sold a 6/12 165 call for 3.55.** I've since rolled to a 6/19 call at the same strike for a net credit of 1.80/share.  Now BA is trading at $228 so I'm losing out on **$6300**. I'm sh\\*\\*ing the bed with this one.\n\nShould I just be happy with these plays and the premium/profits I'll collect? Or should I roll into further expiration dates? Seems like the latter is hard to do without paying out the a\\*\\* to buy back the calls I've sold that are now deep ITM. \n\nAdditionally, is there anything I can do to adjust my strategy to avoid this in the future? Should I roll early and often or not at all? Usually I'll do a buy/write on a stock I like owning and wouldn't mind holding for weeks or months while I collect covered call premiums. The strikes I choose are typically 10% OTM with 30-45 DTE, or have &lt;= 0.3 delta, whichever is more conservative.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 8th, 2020.\n\n# **Look for the S&amp;P 500 to turn positive for the year with a boost from the Fed in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/look-for-the-sp-500-to-turn-positive-for-the-year-with-a-boost-from-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction. We\u2019ve also seen new monthly lows in people on ventilators, in the ICU, and in hospitals.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Hard to believe, but there are still 7 months left in 2020. It hasn\u2019t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full. The dual benefit of record monetary and fiscal policy should help create a bridge to help those most impacted, while the economy can slowly come back online later this year.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending June 5th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1HAZbHiMUI))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 6.7.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n*(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)*\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$CHWY** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$NEPT** \n&gt; * **$GHM** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$CVGW** \n&gt; * **$AMC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$QTNT** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$CHS** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$GCO** \n&gt; * **$BF.B** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$WSG** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$RRGB** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$JW.A** \n&gt; * **$SB** \n&gt; * **$GSM** \n&gt; * **$SRT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bgPdMCr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/d2EW1kr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uxSiJJr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3SIjcG7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cRBrPlt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DaheXAm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9mcHxTl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i8SNjWM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9xcBZPK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $392.90\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

It auto-hedges. \n\nAnd the best part is, when the stock reaches its bottom, you can simply buy back the call you\u2019re selling \n\nSo now during the uptrend, you will capture all the profits the (now unhedged) call. \n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nIn my opinion, call debit spreads aren\u2019t enough if you\u2019re balls deep in calls. So in addition to that, you simply buy **put debit spreads** on QQQ and SPY to additionally manage downside. \n\nThe best part about put debit spreads are that when the market inevitably gaps up after you buy the spread, you can simply buy back the put you\u2019re selling.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 8th, 2020.\n\n# **Look for the S&amp;P 500 to turn positive for the year with a boost from the Fed in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/look-for-the-sp-500-to-turn-positive-for-the-year-with-a-boost-from-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction. We\u2019ve also seen new monthly lows in people on ventilators, in the ICU, and in hospitals.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Hard to believe, but there are still 7 months left in 2020. It hasn\u2019t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full. The dual benefit of record monetary and fiscal policy should help create a bridge to help those most impacted, while the economy can slowly come back online later this year.\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$CHWY** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$NEPT** \n&gt; * **$GHM** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$CVGW** \n&gt; * **$AMC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$QTNT** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$CHS** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$GCO** \n&gt; * **$BF.B** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$WSG** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$RRGB** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$JW.A** \n&gt; * **$SB** \n&gt; * **$GSM** \n&gt; * **$SRT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bgPdMCr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/d2EW1kr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uxSiJJr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3SIjcG7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cRBrPlt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DaheXAm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9mcHxTl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i8SNjWM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9xcBZPK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $392.90\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 8th, 2020.\n\n# **Look for the S&amp;P 500 to turn positive for the year with a boost from the Fed in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/look-for-the-sp-500-to-turn-positive-for-the-year-with-a-boost-from-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction.

We  are right under the 200 day moving average at 300 and we will want to see these levels hold for more follow through or else we could see some more decline. Many stocks are gapping down but they are gapping into support/moving averages etc. If the market holds up and moves higher today, most gap downs should reverse and I will try to long them. My main focus will be on the TVIX and the market itself. The list today sucks do to the current situation in the market but in the next few days, things should change. If you don't feel comfortable, sit out, watch  and wait for the best trades. Good luck out there\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not holding any positions in any of the stocks listed above.

(Other website builders for small business/dropshipping/noob-e-comm. Valuation doesn't make sense though. Their revenue dropped in that second quarter of 2020. EPS dropped too. Short track record. Never paid dividends. Debt to Equity is incredible on this one! Furthermore, CR is 9.45, which is extremely good. Lockdown and future e-comm won't boost their customer demographics at all. Huge corporations will take the e-comm market share, and they won't be using Shopify.

Revenue growth is consistent as well.  \n  \nCBA to write more since reddit markdown is retarded. lmk if you want p2 of an autistic take on stonk market",

        "selftext": "# Hey guy! I don't post much so please excuse the poor formatting and multi-topic post. I plan to post this across a few subreddits. \n\n# I am writing to you guys today because I don't have anyone to give me sound advice. I would like you to review my current position and future trajectory in life. Help me set myself up for financial independence, freedom and hopefully an upper echelon in society. This isn't your traditional financial post. I could probably use  advice in more than one aspect of my life. \n\nTLDR; Weak family beginnings. Abusive absent father, decaying mother. Ambitious son (me) overcame a childhood of loneliness and hardship. I am more mature, responsible and ambitious than everyone else I know at my age group. I feel like I deserve more than I currently have and I need to continue pushing myself to get there to the point I am becoming greedy and frugal.  Skip **Backstory** and go straight to **current living conditions/spending** if you don't care for the long read.\n\n***Backstory:*** \n\nOur Family is weak and unorganized. My dead grandmother died of cancer at 65. She had my mother, aunt and uncle from age 14-16 with my Greek grandfather who was 21 or 22 at the time and left back to Greece. leaving her in Ontario with 3 children. With no education and being a teen mom did not set the next generation up well for the future.\n\nWhen my mother was young she was very smart and did well in elementary and high school,I'm lucky to have a kind mother. My grandmother kicked out  her 3 kids at 18 so she could enjoy the rest of her youth. \n\nThey lived together and all worked 2 jobs to survive. My aunt was a stripper and my mom was a waitress at the same club. I'm not too sure about my uncle. My mom was groped by a drunk patron and the manager did nothing so she quit.\n\nEventually ending up at a good job involving computers in the floppy disc ages at a large company. IT or data entry maybe?  I don't know anything between that time gap, but it's several years. \n\nMy mom met my dad at some company baseball game.  \n\nLittle did she know what a piece of shit he was. He knocked her up and came and went as he pleased, mooching off her for her car, food, condo all which she achieved on her own. I'm assuming my mom was desperate for affection and stability not being close to our grandma and having no dad.\n\nFew years later my sister was born. My dad convinced my mother he wanted to settle down and get married (they didn't). Told her to sell her condo and he would sell his parents house that 6 of his family were living in\u2026 idk how she believed that. As soon as her condo sold he said he wasn't able to sell his house.\n\nWhile my mom was pregnant with my sister she was getting severe stomach pain and colon pain. The doctors brushed it off as pregnancy related pain and said it was normal.\n\nTruth was she had terrible terrible colon cancer and it was bad. My mom doesn't like to talk about her health but she is scarred everywhere from c-sections and surgeries. They caught the cancer late after she gave birth to my sister. My mom had several intense surgeries, not going very smoothly. She has plastic tubing for a colon and osteomy bag, poor circulation.\n\nMy father emptied her bank accounts and stole her car while watching us. Let my RESP payments laps and I ended up losing mine.  (maybe the money is still out there somewhere, my mom says it's gone). When she got out of the hospital she was like 90 pounds and in a wheelchair. Still battling cancer in her late 20\u2019s. My Dad got fed up of looking after us solely and said \u201cthings like its been 2 months since you gave birth when the fuck are you getting out of that chair and going to watch the children?\u201d All this time my mom is on her own. Poor relationships with her mother, sister and brother and she is the smart and responsible one out of the bunch.\n\nShe has benefits at work and is on disability, bought a new house and is raising us alone.Its a good thing she was able to get a mortgage and LOC and credit cards before going on disability, playing off her sickness.\n\nIn and out of court with my dad fighting for child support and sole custody, there is a court order he can pick us up and drop us off every second weekend. They probably hired lawyers and went to court on several occasions. My father has a job with Canada Post, a decent job.\n\nYears go by, my mom is slowly recovering from eating healthy and doing light exercise. My dad convinces her he wants to be in his young kids lives and he made so many mistakes with us and her and that he loves her. She sells her house and buys a bigger house ( the current house we have lived in for 18 years) It doesn't work out, he hasn't changed, she finally learns and realizes and he is gone for good. Several court battles later claiming she is alienating and abusing us from the father. Throwing money at my mom with crooked family lawyers stirring the pot on both sides (several of her own lawyers fucked her). Our whole childhood was robbed with a stressed out overworked sick mother, abusive father towards me and my sister, emotional physical and slight sexual towards my sister.\n\nYears of scraping along and bad lawyers dragging things out ruined my mom. So much stress and no support. She doesn't sleep well and doesn't eat well, it's broken her. I've tried to ask about her health and her finances but she is a private introvert and says it's none of my business. She has been suffering from depression for many years, she tells me she has MS. She is tired all the time, she can't control her emotions. She has a hearing and sight issue. She has poor communication skills and emotional intelligence. I think me and her might be somewhere on the spectrum. At a first glance you wouldn't be able to tell these things about her. Besides her talking very loud all the time not realizing how much louder she is talking than those speaking to her. I could be wrong about myself as well and it may just be that I was poorly socialized as a kid.\n\nI started working at a grocery store at 12 or 13 years old and I have had 1 or 2 jobs at a time since. My mom couldn't afford to give me an allowance, if i needed money i had to work for it.. My mom needed to give the manager of a grocery store a signed letter saying it was legal for him to be hiring me. Growing up I knew not to ask for things from the store, or say what things I liked or wished I had. I remember teaching my little sister the same, constantly telling her we didn't have money for that or it was a waste of money.\n\nI feel emotionless from all the weed I smoked growing up. I was high on marijuana more than I was sober from 14-21 minus the year and a half break I took while aggressively losing weight and doing lots of cardio and weights. 13-17 I got really fat sitting and playing video games eating unhealthy and smoking. I don't get angry, I don't get scared. I am confident in the fact that I don't care what many people think and I don't have time for their laziness or bullshit. My former introverted shy self is gone, but any happiness I feel is short lived and quickly fleeting. I've been depressed for so long  it just feels normal. What keeps me going is my will to finally live financially free and explore what life has to offer, I hope I still have passion when that is all said and done. I want to make a woman happy and to feel wanted and lusted over. I want to pass on a hard work ethic, reason, wisdom, problem solving skills and a financial fortune to a child.\n\nI am not that close with my sister or my mom. Our crucial years of growing together were all ruined. And now I feel like my mom has been poisoned into being toxic by being mistreated and her decaying health.\n\nShe started taking out her misery on me when I was an older teenager. The court battles were not over. Skipping school and becoming careless I just wanted to get away from it all, my slipping grades and poor attendance were ammunition for my dad against her. Him paying child support was conditional that i was a student and a dependent, he owed her thousands towards my sisters schooling costs and retroactive child support. My sister and myself are extremely intelligent. I am more of a hands-on learner. My sister is quite the academic. She is multilingual and  was enrolled in a french immersion private school from grades 6-8. Doing accelerated classes. Paid for by a family friend of my moms from her old company. He is somewhat like a grandfather towards us. She has also completed 2 or 3 university and college programs. Her latest program was supposed to be linked with an employment or intern position in communications and human resources but COVID-19 fucked that all up.\n\nI hung out with anyone who would put up with me\u2026 I didn't know how to socialize, I ate food that made me feel good, I smoked weed constantly and I played video games. Video Games saved me from the bad influences I was hanging out with (kids doing hard drugs, selling drugs, getting into fights). Video games was the one thing I was good at, that I could show the world I had skill in something. I played competitive games, that's all I cared about.   I was gaining a lot of weight in my teenage years, which still affects my physique today. I can gain fat back extremely quickly even though I managed to get into good shape and quit smoking weed for a  year and a half. No father and living with 2 women while being an introvert and a loner, did not help me with women. I was happy to lose my virginity at 18 after getting hard into the gym and getting into shape to some yolo party chick. RIP so many missed sexual advances growing up. Thankfully I had blonde hair and green eyes and nice features before I started gaining weight and eventually losing my hair. Probably a mix between starving myself to  lose weight fast and poor nutrition, high stress and wearing a lot of hats growing up. Falling in and out of the gym after 20 and being in relationships with some poorly selected ladies I started smoking a lot of weed again, putting back on the weight and getting weak. \n\nFound someone willing to pay me for Working construction. And I got a side job as a server. I was able to save up 40k cash. I ended up giving it to my mom for rent for the next few years. Construction was 6AM-6PM 7 days a week cash. And i would work a few hours after that at a restaurant.  This was not sustainable. I ended up getting really stressed out and went back into living in my room playing video games with my rent taken care of. (i really wish i had invested that money and found a new job) \n\nThis is getting too long, and I apologize for the scattered wall of text. This is the first time I've opened up to anyone at such a length and detail.\n\nWith hard work and bullshitting I was able to secure a good city job, getting my CPR and AED first aid and DZ commercial license. I plan to pursue a horticultural degree and become a gardener at the city, that will pay around 33$ with the ability to run a crew and get lead hand 36$/hr. Possibly a real estate license and a course in finance/economics down the road. Currently looking for SAT/SUN work as an arborist, that fell through since covid.\n\nI am ambitious. My ambition is why I choose to live. I want a physique people drool over, I want Fuck you money i can treat myself and family to stuff. I want my dad to know how successful I've become on my own. That we made the right choice without him. I want to say a big fuck you to everyone who ever doubted me or bullied me growing up. I want to FIRE. I want social status and power. I fear I want more than I can achieve and I want to do anything to get it. I feel like I'm running out of time and I'm going to blink and be 30 years old and aging without a woman that loves me and without friends or a plan. I want a good night's sleep without my brain keeping me awake with a will to learn and make more money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Current Living situation and Spending:***\n\n**I am a** **26/M Living in Ontario Canada, just north of Toronto (Richmond Hill)**. \n\n**I Live at home with my single mother(54) and younger sister(23).HCOL area.**\n\n**I have no debt.**\n\n**I have a credit rating of 840/900.**\n\nI have a job working for my municipality full time as a parks operator 3rd class. **$29.11/hr 1.5% annual raise**, winter months provide the ability to plow streets and sidewalks for overtime/double time plus oncall pay. I make the majority of my money in these months. Pension, healthcare benefits, union  job security, paid vacation (caps at 5 weeks after 20 years). Paid sick leave. I would say I earn between **$60,500-$75,000 Canadian**. I have been working here for 3 years. First 2 years were on contract for $23.00/hr. **Sadly i do not have an RRSP contribution match**.  **Looking for weekend work $23.00/hr 64 hours a month.**\n\n**Automobile:**My mom \u201cgave\u201d me her honda accord 2003 with 200k km on it several years ago (i am not on the title). Had to replace the engine and transmission. It's at 330k km and I want to get rid of it sooner than later.\n\nMy mattress, MTB bike, Snowboards, video games and electronics probably hold 10k-20k canadian.\n\nMy mother's house is worth around 1.5M CAD.  purchased 20 years ago for around 400k+\n\nI have a single credit card with RBC, as well as a checking and direct investing account.\n\n**35K candian invested in TFSA holding US stocks: TSLA, SQ, AMD**. \n\n**2k in RRSP :VGRO (CAD)**\n\n**3k in Omers pension so far**\n\n**Rent** :750$ cash to mom\n\n**Groceries** :300-500$/month\n\n**Internet / TV/Cell Phone** :$120 \n\n**Car Insurance**: $165/month \n\n**Gas**$50/month\n\nWhatever is left over I have been dumping into the stock market in blue chip/value growth stocks. I tried to get into the stock market before the crash but rbc took 1 month to approve my margin/tfsa/rrsp direct investing accounts. On april 12th i entered the market on TSLA at $625 US with the majority of my capital.\n\nMy goal portfolio will consist of: ENPH, TSLA, SEDG, TSM, NVDA, QCOM, AMD, SHOP, AMZN, GOOG, FB, MSFT, AAPL, GILD, SQ, NFLX, ROKU, KTOV, CSIQ, CRSP, CGEN, RUN, JKS, PRLB, NVTA, TWOU, ON, AZRE, REGI, MELI, FSLR, ILMN, VWDRY, NOVA, VOO, VGRO, ARKK, ARKG, ARKW, ARKF.  \n\nI am planning on buying and holding as long as possible. 10-20 years. I would appreciate some insight on what order to buy, as i'm currently knocking these off the list per pay cheque on whatever is in the red. I'm sure some of you will disagree with some of my picks. Half of the picks in my list I am still doing my due diligence on and this may not be the final portfolio product.\n\nI was told i can ask my employment to withhold my income tax deductions and pay me in full? At the end of the year I will be responsible for making the income tax payments myself. I see it as an opportunity to be making more money off interest and potential market gains sooner.\n\nMy goal is to buy a condo at yonge and hwy 7 as the extend the TTC subway up to the Richmond Hill center of transportation. I feel like southern Richmond Hill will look like Toronto in no time. Eventually buy property in the neighboring boroughs of the GTA farther North East and West, while their population and infrastructure is lower.\n\nI would like to have 2 jobs and be a landlord at the same time if i can eventually buy property. I would like to find a partner or friend to increase our buying power.\n\nThis was a mixed post of finance, life story reflection and seeking opinion.",

It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares.

        "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nSo I've been mostly selling put spreads for the past couple of weeks and am wondering how to calculate expected value based on changes in price, IV, and theta. For example, I currently have a short NVDA put spread (opened on Monday) that was worth $3.00 at close yesterday, when the stock was at $362.92 and its IV was at 47.23%.  The net delta on the spread is .0235, net vega is -.0245, and net theta is .0159.\n\nEarlier today, NVDA was $367.67 (an increase of 4.75) with an IV of 47.06 (a decrease of .17%), so I would have expected my spread to be worth $16.17 because of the following calculations:\n\nDelta: 4.75 \\* 2.35 = + $11.16\n\nVega: -.17 \\* -2.45 = + $0.42\n\nTheta: + $1.59\n\nHowever, the spread was worth $28. Where did this \\~$12 discrepancy come from? Am I missing another price factor? Should I be using beta weighted net delta (4.07 in this case) instead of delta? I didn't calculate gamma or rho because I feel those are negligible and likely wouldn't explain a $12 difference. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy it's worth more than I expected, but I want to understand so I can make predictions properly.\n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "\nFor Trading JUNE 10th\n \nBack to SOME Sanity\n \nNASDAQ at Another New High!\n \nU.S. DOLLAR CONTINUES TO WEAKEN\n \n \nToday\u2019s market was just another day dominated by a switchover to focus on the FAANG and mega-cap stocks.  After a couple of quiet day the big guns took off again.  The star was AAPL moving to a new all-time high at $345.61 and closed not much below that new mark.  AMZN, with its new price target of $3,300 was also strong with a move to $2,626.43 before a late market close at $2614.50 +90.44.  Unfortunately for those invested in the big 5 or 6, the rest of the market didn\u2019t fare quite so well.  DJIA -300.14 (1%), NASDAQ +29.01 (.30), S&amp;P 500 -26.21 (.,78%), the Russell -29.84 (1.94%) and the DJ Transports -227 (2.2%).  Volume was slightly above the recent average with the A/D on the downside with NYSE 3.5:1 and NASDAQ 2:1 lower.  Unfortunately, the DJIA stocks were heavily stack in the loss column with only 2 higher and 28 down.  The big gainer was AAPL +72 DP\u2019s and the loser, BA -95.\n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 1900 members.  I also did this video titled \u201cHow to survive being an options trader and not blow up your account,\u201d over the long weekend.  I think it\u2019s very informative as a guide to stock selection and option choices.  The link is\nhttps://youtu.be/Y7H9RpWfLlo  Enjoy!!\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video https://youtu.be/CsENlkRH81g\n \nSECTORS: The big news was no news initially with BA falling back off it\u2019s after-market run as high as $240 before a lower open at $227 before falling back to $213.08 and a final trade @ $215.99 -14.51 and $25 off the overnight high.  The two groups that were the biggest numbers were Airlines and Cruise lines.  All the biggest winners for the last week or so were today\u2019s losers.  CCL $23.04 -1.87 (7.51%), RCL $69.91 -5.21 (6.94%), and NCLH $24.13 -2.73 (10.16%).  Airlines were UAL $44.64 -4.05 (8.32%), DAL $34.17 -2.80 (7.57%), JBLU 14.21 -1.38 (8.85%), ALK $46.10 -4.14 (8.24%).\n \nAnd, last, were 2 big late movers.  Immuron: (IMRN) an Australian biotech with what they characterized as a cure for HIV, closing $2.10 yesterday had the news about a major move forward with the FDA committee for discussion of a trial permit was trading as high as $10.00 premarket opened $9.97 before a runup to $28.99 before settling back to close $20.00 +17.9 (852%) and in afterhours back to $16.30, still a nice gain of $14.20 or still 700%.  The other name was LAKE: Lakeland Ind., a maker of protective garments for use in treating COVID-19 patients that finished $16.20 +.45 before announcing that their production would continue for at least another 6 \u2013 9 months, sending the stock back up to $24.97 before finishing $23.75 +7.55 (46.6%).\n \n \n \nFOOD SUPPLY: was LOWER with TSN BGS -.95, FLO -.12, CAG -1.41, MDLZ -1.05, KHC -.83, CALM -.31, JJSF -6.30, SAFM -6.07, LANC -3.85, HRL -.13, SJM -2.73, PPC -.55 and PBJ $31.99 -.15 (.47%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA was MIXED with BIIB -7.52, ABBV +1.58, REGN +4.55, ISRG -8.18, GILD +.54, MYL -.33, TEVA -.23, VRTX +6.99, BHC -.41, INCY -1.27, ICPT +.18, LABU -.28 and IBB $132.75 -.35 (.26%).\n \nCANNABIS: was LOWER with TLRY -.29, CGC -.06, CRON -.64, GWPH +.76, ACB -.74, PYX, -.75, NBEV -.08, CURLF -.18, KERN -.56, and MJ $14.99 -.28 (1.83%).\n\n \n\nDEFENSE was LOWER with LMT -5.74, GD -3.75, TXT -2.15, NOC -3.89, BWXT -.08, TDY -14.28, RTX -3.37, and ITA $187.17 -6.67 (3.445%).\n \n \nRETAIL was LOWER with M -.83 in late trading after raising $4.5billion in the bond market and rallying as high as $11.00 pre-open and then in real time could only make it to $10.46 before a $8.72 finish in after hours trading.  JWN -2.33, KSS -2.17, DDS -2.62, WMT +.06, TGT -1.49, TJX -.82, RL -4.78, UAA -.51, LULU +1.38, TPR -1.25, CPRI -2.29, and XRT $44.23 -1.12 (2.47%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +6.96, AMZN +90.44, AAPL +11.94, FB +8.40, NFLX +15.51, NVDA +11.54, TSLA -12.93, BABA +1.80, BIDU -1.03, CMG -9.23, CAT -2.71, BA -14.51, DIS -2.88, and XLK $102.40 +.48 (.47%)&gt;\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -2.70, JPM -2.69, BAC -.28, MS +.45, C -1.64, PNC -4.13, AIG -1.69, TRV -1.25, AXP -2.56, V +.12, and XLF $26.17 -.57 (2.13%).\n \n \nOIL, $38.94 +.75. Oil has managed to trade $40.44 yesterday and fell back to the 5-day MA and closed there. We then traded as low as 37.07 today before reversing late in the day and closing higher.  In fact, people came after every little depressed stock and many have moved several 100% in the past few days and they sold them just as hard today. The stocks were lower and XLE was $45.10 -1.76 (3.76%).\n \n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,721.90 +16.80. After trading down to $1671 last week we had a bounce higher again today after testing the 1697 level. The action in the US$ is projecting higher prices for the metals, but it does not necessarily trade with the dollar on a day by day basis.  Support is around Friday\u2019s lows. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM yesterday @ $58.86.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,805 +25. After breaking down from just over 10,000 and trading as low as 8630 last Tuesday we have been clawing our way back toward 10,000.  Last week we traded over $10500 but fell all the way back to the lows, but we\u2019ve moved back toward $10,000.  We added 350 shares of GBTC last Wednesday @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $11.48 - .10 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

I pulled it out of equities at the 2018 high and put it in CDs, so I timed the dip, but lost out on the 2019 surge. I\u2019ve gradually been adding cash, which has mostly been sitting (amounts to about 1/4 of my current but), but with the March dip, I\u2019ve bought into some stocks to hopefully get the benefit of any reopening (LUV, SBUX, MAR, high-risk ACRGF and MMNRFF in smaller amounts just in case I can scoop up some positive volatility and don\u2019t mind losing on, and balanced with VOO). My money in CDs frees up in November. Given the short horizon, what would you do come November (obviously we have no clue what the equities market will look like). Part of me thinks to stick with my current strategy, which is largely conservative with a few  medium and high-risk bets. But another part of me hates to miss the opportunity to generate extra thousands that can make a real difference in what my mortgage will look like (I feel a little burned by selling off my Apple and Nvidia...).

Which would give the stock prices time to hopefully climb back up some. I\u2019m hoping to just recoup my losses at this point.",

The market then spent until about 1:15 grinding its way back to unchanged and was testing both sides of unchanged until the Fed announced that it was going into the market for individual bonds, not just the ETF\u2019s.  That took us to new highs +280 before another selloff to test unchanged again and a rally to close us +157.62 +.62%), NASDAQ +137.21 (1.43%), S&amp;P 500 +25.28 (.83%), the Russell (listen to the closing video below) the biggest winner +31.92 (2.3%) and the DJ Transports +78 (.86%).

But the DJIA was all over the place, spending the first hour headed down to the low of the day -334 before working higher and then taking off to the upside after the FED announcement making the high +83 by 2:30 and then heading back and forth and settling -282.31 (1.04, NASDAQ +66.59 (.67%), S&amp;P 500 -17.04 (.53%), the Russell -39.66 (2.63 and the DJ Transports -246 (2.51%).  Internals were not as weak as the market looked with NYSE A/D 2.5:1 and NASDAQ 1.8:1.  Volume was about average and the DJIA was 23 down and 7 up with AAPL adding 61 and MSFT 48 DPs while BA was the big loser -91 with AXP, JPM, GS, and TRV each lower by 31DP\u2019s.  The strength came from Information tech (FAANG) but the weakness came from energy, financials, industrials and real estate.  Not a good looking day.\n \n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.

The link is\nhttps://youtu.be/Y7H9RpWfLlo  Enjoy!!\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video https://youtu.be/XX4bgWZNtH8\n \nSECTORS: The big news was no news from the FED, as expected.  Rates fell slightly but the Financials fell hard.  The forecasts for 2020 GDP (-6.5%) and 2021 (+5%) weren\u2019t much of a surprise.  The real news was Taubman (TCO) getting kicked to the curb by Simon Properties (SPG) and cancelling their marriage.  The reaction was swift, sending TCO down to $26.70, but it finished $36.17 (9.08%) while SPG got less of a hit moving to $&amp;* before it managed a close of $83.01 -3.46 (4%).  This will not be a civil divorce.  JP Morgan downgraded JBLU and UAL, sending JBLU down to $12.03 before coming back to $12.63 -1.58 (11.12%) and UAL to $38.30 before it too recovered a bit to $39.72 -4.92 (11.02%).  The cruise lines were weaker with RCL to $63.59 -6.32 (9%), CCL $20.59 (-2.45 (11%), and the biggest loser NCLH $20.65 -3.48 (14%).\n \n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was MIXED with BGS -.10, FLO -.12, CAG -.39, MDLZ +.16, KHC -.80, CALM -2.65, JJSF -2.20, SAFM +.06, LANC +.16, GO +1.20, HRL +.01, SJM +.07, PPC -.49 and PBJ 31.48 -.51 (1.59%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA was MIXED with BIIB +.62, ABBV +.98, REGN -2.59, ISRG +11.22, GILD -.58, MYL -1.25, TEVA -.68, VRTX +4.15, BHC -1.16, INCY +.05, ICPT -.68, LABU +.22 and IBB $133.38 +.47 (.35%).\n \nCANNABIS: was LOWER with TLRY -.62, CGC -.32, CRON +.01, GWPH -3.74, ACB -.70, PYX -.65, NBEV -.08, CURLF +.06, KERN +.52 and MJ $14.85 -.14 (.93%).\n\n \n\nDEFENSE was LOWER with LMT -6.96, GD -6.68, TXT -4.17, NOC -7.53, BWXT -.62, TDY -4.26, RTX -3.19, and ITA $181.08 -6.09 (3.25%).\n \n \nRETAIL was LOWER with M -1.07, JWN -2.19, KSS -3.47, DDS -3.74, WMT -.44, TGT -1.47, TJX +1.78, RL -6.48, UAA -.73, LULU +4.45, TPR -1.10, CPRI -2.02, and XRT $43.20 -1.03 (2.33%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +8.27, AMZN +30.13, AAPL +7.01, FB -2.72, NFLX -1.95, NVDA +11.14, TSLA +68.83, BABA +1.78, BIDU +.21, CMG -15.47, CAT -4.01, BA -20.44, DIS -2.66 and XLK $103.63 +1.23 (1.20%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -7.24, JPM -6.64, BAC -2.13, MS -2.77, C -4.70, PNC -8.69, AIG -2.90, TRV -6.27, AXP -5.96, V -.08 and XLF $24.93 -1.24 (4.74%).\n \n \nOIL, $39.60 +.66. Oil has managed to trade $40.44 yesterday and fell back to the 5-day MA and closed there. We then traded as low as 37.07 today before reversing late in the day and closing higher.  Today\u2019s close near the high didn\u2019t help the stocks.  They were lower and XLE was $42.29 -2.81 (6.23%).\n \n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,720.70. After trading down to $1671 last week we had a bounce higher again today after testing the 1697 level. The action in the US$ is projecting higher prices for the metals, but it does not necessarily trade with the dollar on a day by day basis.  Support is around Friday\u2019s lows. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,935 +130. After breaking down from just over 10,000 and trading as low as 8630 last Tuesday we have been clawing our way back toward 10,000.  Last week we traded over $10500 but fell all the way back to the lows, but we\u2019ve moved back toward $10,000.  We added 350 shares of GBTC last Wednesday @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $12.30 + .77 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

They closed today $2.12.  \n\n\n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a good start based on the futures, and within the first few minutes started a selloff to the low of the day (+70) and then turned on a dime and started higher again and by 10:00 were had hit +450.  We moved sideways to higher until the last 15 minutes we had rallied to a new high and closed +580.25 (2.32%), NASDAQ +116.93 (1.2%), S&amp;P 500 +44.19 (1.47%), the Russell +42.43 (3.08%) and the Transports +246.90 (2.8%).  Market internals were good with the NYSE A/D 3:1 and NAZ 2:1, while NYSE A/D volume was better than 5:1.  Overall volume was about unchanged from Friday.  The DJIA was 29:1 with the biggest mover BA +168 DP\u2019s and the others a far distant AAPL +56, HD +35 and GS 20 DP\u2019s).

Homebuilders were up anywhere from 3%, (LEN &amp; DHI) to 8.8% (BZH &amp; TOL), and the ETF, XHB finished $43.45 +1.67 (4%).\n \n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video https://youtu.be/AeKKwW1lmKw  \n\nOur Discord Forum link is in the description..\n\n\nSECTORS: The news of COVID-19 surges in cases to new highs has caused the states of both Texas and Florida to halt the progression of their re-openings.  In fact, both states have closed bars since it is a place for younger people to gather and the 25 -39 group shows the biggest increases in cases.  There are states that have seen increases of up to 300% from where they were when the re-openings began.  For a look at how ALL the states are doing use this link:  https://rt.live/\nThere were 2 stars in the market today; the obvious brightest star was Boeing (BA) on the strength of it starting FAA piloted flights of the 737 MAX for re-certification.  The flights seem to be okay, but the flights are just the tip of the iceberg since all of the data now has to be analyzed.  I\u2019m sure it will be a little while before we hear anything substantive, but it was a start after over 440 days of grounding (March 2019).  But buyers wouldn\u2019t be stopped after the recent decline from the recovery high of $234 to close $170.01 Friday.  The stock opened $181.65 and traded up to $194.50 before closing on the highs at $194.49 +24.48 (14.4%).  The second star was FB, embroiled in the cancellation of ads but some of the world\u2019s biggest and best companies due to racist and hate oriented content.  Last Tuesday before the advertisers started pulling ads the stock had made a new all-time high at $245 but started lower the next day.  On Friday Unilever and KO had pulled (adding to the list of medium sized firms) and the stock fell to $215.  This morning Starbucks adding to the list and the stock fell to $207.11 before the market took off (see above) and by 10:45 it had crossed unchanged and kept moving to close $220.64 +4.56 (2.1%) but $13 from the low.  We\u2019ll have to see what it can do when it gets to supply between $224-226.\nEarning from two chip makers both beat, and both gave solid guidance.  MU finished $52.11 +2.96 (6%), while XLNX was $98.47 +6.50 (7%).  Simon Property Group (SPG) reaffirmed its earnings quoting the fact that 199 of their 204 properties across 37 states are open and operating.  They also declared their dividend and added that they expect to pay $6.00 in cash for 2020.  The stock had closed $68.13 +6.23 (10%) but rose further in late trading and was $72.52 + $439 or another 6.4%.  \nIn the financials, after the close several, (BAC, MS, C, and MS) all affirmed current rates while WFC said it will have to cut their payout.  The stock fell about $ .25.\n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was HIGHER with TSN +.97, BGS +.63, FLO +.75, CPB +.85, CAG +1.77, MDLZ +.78, KHC +.81, CALM +.68, JJSF +6.39, SAFM -.64, HRL +.13, SJM +2.07, PPC -.38, KR +1.39, and PBJ $30.87 +.54 (1.81%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA was MIXED with BIIB +1.34, ABBV +.16, REGN -.49, ISRG +3.92, GILD +.24, MYL +.12, TEVA -.01, VRTX -.64, BHC -.01, INCY +1.05, ICPT $47.10 -30.39 (39.2%) ON THE FDA HAVING QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR NASH (LIVER) TREATMENT.

Oil was lower last night trading as low as $37.50 before we rallied well off those levels. I mentioned in last night\u2019s charts with comments section in the Weekly Strategies letter, prices are trying to work higher towards $45.00. The stocks were higher with XLE $37.24 +.74 (2.03%).\n \n \nGOLD $1781.20 + .90. It was a small pull-back after the strong rally of the end of last week, and after touching $1796 last week we turned back lower and tested $1754 before bursting higher Friday.  We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 yesterday and we closed $2.12 today.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,200 -20. After trading back to 8985 we rallied back to close \u2013 only $5.  Since last week we have closed between 9200 \u2013 92.85 every day with narrow ranges.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC last Wednesday @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $9.48 - .22 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

The DJIA finished -710.16 (2.72%), NASDAQ -222.20 (2.19%), S&amp;P 500 -80.96 (2.69%), the Russell, the biggest loser was -49.60 (3.45%) followed closely by the Transports -282 (3%).  Market internals on the NYSE was 7:1, while NASDAQ was a tamer 4.5:1.  On the DJIA all 30 were down with BA -76, UNH -59, GS -47, V -45, AAPL -44 and MMM-40 DP\u2019s.  Volume was slightly lower than yesterday.  All S&amp;P sectors were lower with energy, financials, &amp; industrials were the weakest while utilities were the least bad\u2026I really hate to put it that way.\n \nWe added some CVS 7/67.50 calls on the decline with an average price of $1.16 and they finished $ .69, and the NEM 7/17 $60\u2019s @ 1.55 and added to on Friday @ $1.30 for an average of $1.47 triggered a 100% Up Rule sale at $2.94 this morning.

There are now 9 \u201chot-spots\u201d that include CA, AZ, TX, FL, MI, AR, WI, SC, NC., and NY, NJ, and CT have put travelers from those places on 14 quarantine.  Later in the day NV started mandatory masks for everyone in casino/hotels.  For a look at how ALL the states are doing use this link:  https://rt.live/\nAirline, cruise lines, hotels and resorts all took it on the chin on the news.  As I mentioned in my video (link just above), there was an article in Barron\u2019s online this evening talking about Southwest Air (LUV) having started a fare war.  Not exactly the truth since they have 2 annual \u201cFare Sales\u201d early in the year for summer travel and summer for holiday travel.  But the article also mentioned Allegiant Air (ALGT) $107.89, a budget carrier with an all AIRBUS fleet and well positioned to compete in the coming cutthroat recovery.  Their margins were 21% and the expected burn rate of only $2 million a month for Q2 turned cash-flow positive as of May.  Definitely one to watch since it\u2019s also very close to support around $100.\nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was MIXED with TSN -2.26, BGS +.43, FLO +.09, CPB +.28, CAG +.08, MDLZ -1.28, KHC -.34, CALM +.13, JJSF -5.41, SAFM -3.75, HRL +.10, SJM -.69, PPC -.49, KR +.65 and PBJ $30.70 -.25 (.83%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA was LOWER with BIIB -5.09, ABBV -2.12, REGN -23.72, ISRG -33.56, GILD +.74, MYL -.22, TEVA -.36, VRTX -4.62, BHC -.87, INCY -2.19, ICPT -3.26, LABU -3.77, and IBB $136.25 -2.40 (1.73%).\n \nCANNABIS: was LOWER with TLRY -.34, CGC -.51, CRON -.18, GWPH -3.40, ACB +.31, CURLF -.27, KERN -.10 and MJ $13.17 - .39 (2.88%).\n\n \nDEFENSE:  was LOWER with LMT -11.70, GD -7.75, TXT -1.55, NOC -4.10, BWXT -2.07, TDY -8.14, RTX -2.84 and ITA $160.71 -7.38 (4.39%).\n \n \nRETAIL was LOWER with M -.46, JWN -1.22, KSS -1.50, DDS -.90, WMT -1.08, TGT -1.85, TJX -1.75, RL -2.81, UAA -.50, LULU -6.46, TPR -.90, CPRI -.83, and XRT $41.58 -1.52 (3.53%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were LOWER with GOOGL -31.98, AMZN -39.41, AAPL -7.58, FB -8.74, NFLX -10.21, NVDA -9.60, TSLA -50.78, BABA -2.75, BIDU -2.33, CMG +4.14, CAT -4.24, BA -12.58, DIS -4.74, and XLK $102.26 -2.37 (2.26%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -7.65, JPM -3.13, BAC -1.09, MS -1.09, C -2.43, PNC -4.48, AIG -1.75, TRV -3.33, AXP -4.17, V -6.22, and XLF $22.98 -.84 (3.53%).\n \n \nOIL, $38.01 -2.36. Oil was lower all day and couldn\u2019t manage to hold any rally and fell right thru immediate support. I mentioned in last night\u2019s video that it appears that prices are trying to work higher towards $45.00 but it will have to reverse quickly.  The stocks were lower with XLE $37.11 -2.18 (5.55%).\n \n \nGOLD $1775.10 -6.90 It was a clean breakout and a continuation of the rally today, closing practically on the highs.

        "selftext": "Month ago I saw a chart from Deutsche Bank which explains a lot about what is going on, and after extra additional research would like to share it with you: [link](https://imgur.com/a/NzcSNXk). \n\nBasically, what the chart says is that all big mutual funds now are dong exactly the same, and their beta to 11 mega-cap growth stocks (AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, GOOGL, FB, V, MA, NVDA, ADBE, NFLX) is at record level since 2012 reaching 0.9 number.\n\nIt means, that right now no big fund is trying to deploy some innovative strategy and instead just following the market, and one of the reasons why it might be like this: performance fee.\n\nIn a recent decade more and more large funds deploy performance fee to substitute management fee and motivate clients to choose their funds. For those who are unfamiliar with these terms: management fee dominated market for a while and charged by fund based on Asset Under Management value. If fund manages $2 trln, it could charge 1% of it as a management fee regardless of its result. For years it was considered as unfair state, because clients might still pay a lot of money even if their fund loose money with the time. \n\nWith a rise of passive investments and ETFs with an ultra low expense ratios, active mutual funds start accomodate performance fee: if they beat sme benchmark pre-agreed with clients, they charge high fee. As example, if fund choose S&amp;P 500 as a benchmark and beat it by 5%, they will make a big charge from this extra gain provided to a client. In addition, some of the funds provide a negative fee if they loose to benchmark. (see the [example](https://citywireamericas.com/news/fidelity-reveals-details-of-new-performance-fee-charges/a1073586))\n\nSounds fair, right?\n\nWell, now it pays back. With an extreme volatility at the market, and with high risk to be eliminated from the market (bank run problem with clients pulling off cash from un-performed fund), the problem is re-phrased from \"how to beat benchmark\" to \"how to not loose to benchmark\". And most of funds easily come to the conclusion: if you don't want to loose to benchmark - be the benchmark. \n\nThis explains me what and why is going on around. MFs buy indexes and ETFs, and sell indexes and ETFs. S&amp;P starts sell-off? Everyone will sell-off everything, no matter is this comapny good (like MSFT) or bad (like UAL). S&amp;P futures go green at pre-market? Everyone just start buying everything. Amazon release earnings and they beat the expectation? Funds will increase AMZN allocation all together. \n\nDon't try to pick up stocks, don't make risk, don't make bets, follow the market or you will die. Welcome, to 2020.",

Futures were down well over 280 for the DJIA but a combination of economic news and the \u201cfair value\u201d overnight blunted the declines.  We worked up thru most of the day but the real move came from 3:00PM when we went from unchanged to close near the highs +299.66 (1.18%), NASDAQ +107.83 (1.09%), S&amp;P 500 +33.43 (1.10%), the Russell +23.57 (1.7%) and the Transports managed to gain 100.52 (1.13%).  The DJIA had 22 up and only 8 were lower with no major losers and the gainers lead by GS +63, UNH +48 and AAPL +38DP\u2019s.  Market internals were 9:5 up on the NYSE and 2:1 on NAZ, and volume on the NASDAQ was actually down about 20%.  Financials, Energy, Info Tech and materials lead the way while Utilities and Consumer discretionary were the laggards.\n \nWe added some CVS 7/67.50 calls on the decline with an average price of $1.16 and they finished $ .76, and the NEM 7/17 $60\u2019s @ 1.55 and added to on Friday @ $1.30 for an average of $1.47 triggered a 100% Up Rule sale at $2.94 this morning.  They closed the day $1.98.  \n \n\nhttps://youtu.be/ByEWVOLxlWU\nTonight\u2019s closing comment. Our discord link is in the description.\n \nSECTORS: The news of COVID-19 surges in cases to new highs has caused the states of both Texas and Florida to halt the progression of their re-openings.  While it doesn\u2019t stop the phases that they are in, it does stop things from moving forward.  There are states that have seen increases of up to 300% from where they were when the re-openings began.  For a look at how ALL the states are doing use this link:  https://rt.live/\nDisney \u201ccharacters\u201d signed a petition in Florida to keep the park closed until there are actually declining numbers for the virus, something that has not started.  Remember that DIS reopened the Disney Mall, just off the property.  DIS is pushing back the openings both in Florida and California.  \nIn other news, Verizon (VZ) has put FB on notice that they are discontinuing their advertising on the site \u201cindefinitely,\u201d until FB gets a handle on hate-speech and other issues that the company finds objectionable.  While there have been several smaller firms to pull ads, VZ is clearly the biggest.  \nAlbertsons, the grocery chain that was taken private priced their new IPO today.  Reception by the street was so muted that they had to cut both price and size of the offering down to $800 million and priced the shares @ $16.00.  The main reason for the distain is the fact that there is no money actually going to the company, but rather it all goes to the insiders who took the company private.  Besides that, the insiders (current management) will still maintain control.  Not the way new investors want to see the deal done.\nLast, I\u2019ve written about Inovio (INO) for months now, starting when the stock moved from $3 to $6, and further when it went from $6 to $19 in just 2 weeks.  The company makes a delivery system for the coming Coronavirus and the government has seen fit to finance the manufacturing, as announced earlier this week.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 8th, 2020.\n\n# **Look for the S&amp;P 500 to turn positive for the year with a boost from the Fed in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/look-for-the-sp-500-to-turn-positive-for-the-year-with-a-boost-from-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to reassure markets next week the central bank will do whatever it takes to help the economy heal. That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction.

The day couldn\u2019t have been more boring if it had been closed.  Volume was light and the A/D on NYSE was 3:1 while NASDAQ was only 3:2, and 18 of the 30 DJIA stocks were positive with the biggest mover, BA adding 37 DPs to the average.  Financials, Energy, real estate and utilities were the strongest while information tech and healthcare were the weaker groups.  Commodities were relatively unchanged while the US$ was weak again having broken below 99 just 3 days ago broke below 98 and closed 97.82 -.52 while all the world\u2019s currencies moved higher.\n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.

It seems to have limited use for a limited number of patients.  While the stock was heartily rewarded when it was first discussed, hitting $86, it closed the day $75.16 -2.67 (3.43%).  Also a disappointment were the results from PFE on their breast cancer drug, Ibrance, announced after the close on Friday, and after several price targets were lowered, it finished the day $35.46 -2.73 (7.15%).\n \nOn Thursday, the HOMERUN OF THE DAY was ARCA Biopharma: ABIO with a novel approach for COVID-19 treatment.

        "selftext": "\n \nFor Trading JUNE 18th\n \nHousing Permits +14.4%\n \nMarket Takes a Rest\n \nSmall-caps Lead the Way, Lower\n \n \nToday\u2019s market was a real snore with action contained in a short range until the last hour when the boredom turned to some selling.  We finished a narrow, short-range day -170.37 (.65%), NASDAQ +14.66 (.15%), S&amp;P 500 -11.25 (.36%), the Russell -25.73 (1.77%) leading the way after several days of outperformance on the upside.  Market internals were unremarkable with NYSE A/D 2:1 lower, NASDAQ 3:2 and NYSE volume 3:1 down.  Stronger sectors were consumer discretionary, information technology and communication services with energy, financials and real estate weakest.  Concerns about rising Covid-19 spikes in several states and especially the resurgence in Beijing weighed on investors minds.  In China 400,000 were tested with only 437 positives but the concern centered around the fact that there were several \u201cclusters\u201d showing up in outlying areas and seem to be centered around a wholesale fish and meat market and imported salmon.  The city alert status was raised, and all schools were closed, with officials saying that they may not be reopened until February.  DJIA stocks were 22 down, 7 up and WBA unchanged.  The biggest losers were BA-37, GS-24, JPM-18, and CAT &amp; AXP-12.  Only HD +6 added even a whole number with the rest up just fractions.\n \nWe had 1 carryover trade, long CVS 6/26 $64 and we sold those late in the day for a profit and the NEM 7/17 $60\u2019s @ 1.55 that finished the day@ $1.43.  I am looking for a decline to add to that position.\n \n\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video https://youtu.be/yd6oIc97r_A\n\nOur Discord Forum link is in the video description...\n\n\nSECTORS: We had a continuation of the selloff in CHK again today.  The stock, a 1:200 reverse split that traded over $77 just 8 short days ago continued to fall today trading $12.75 and closing $13.24 -2.12 (13.8%) for an 8-day decline of 83.4% in that period.  We also saw a selloff in Urban-One (UONE) which rose from $1.54 to $40 this week falling back to close $12.71 -14.48 (53.25%)\u2026easy come, easy go!\nHertz (HTZ) was back in the news today with a mid-morning trading halt \u201cfor news pending.\u201d  Later in the day the SEC said that they had informed the company that they had questions and concerns about the company issuing $500,000,000 worth of stock.  The bankrupt auto rental company then cancelled the offering.  More to follow, I\u2019m sure.\nAnd, the HOMERUN OF THE DAY, was a new name, but the same story, no news but a dramatic rise.  Carver Bancorp (CARV) which I reported on in this morning\u2019s pre-open comment was trading $14.00 +12.00 managed to trade as high as $22.97 but coming back to earth and closing $8.39 +5.98 or 248.13%).

It was another short-range day closing in the middle of the range.  The yellow metal is unchanged tonight.  We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, which closed $1.43.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,325 -205.
