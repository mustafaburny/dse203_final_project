        "selftext": "I\u2019m just an autist that wants to help my fellow dudes make money. Have I been guilty of this in the past? Absolutely. In my post history you\u2019ll definitely find me shilling for CLOV. Stupid piece of shit CLOV. \n\nTurns out, you\u2019ll find most of these stocks are shorted FOR A REASON. THEY SUCK ASS. THINK YOU DAMN APES, THINK. \n\nAMC and GME actually did squeeze. But those are RARE exceptions. And they totally poisoned this sub with a bunch of Neanderthals looking for the next short squeeze. Stop. Get help. It feels like we\u2019ve had 5 years worth of short squeezes in the last few months. It\u2019s over. \n\nWhy should you listen to a random nobody yelling at you on the internet? Because. People are making money out there while you baghold these crap stocks. SPY at an all time high. You coulda made more $$ playing Microsoft or Apple. \n\nOr actually, don\u2019t stop. Lose your money please. And then fuck off to your lonely 9-5 daily cocksucking for that $500 weekly paycheck. And never come to this sub again. So I don\u2019t have to read your bullshit. I just want to wake up, pull out my phone, and not see your dumb ass. Your wife/girlfriend however is invited. \n\nSo, want to know why your \u201cshort squeeze\u201d DD isn\u2019t working?! Here\u2019s the difference- AMC and GME are household names. If you want retail to pile on? It\u2019s gotta be a household name. Retail loves nostalgia. They love familiarity. \n\nSo is it a retail squeeze, or can you get the big bois on board? Here\u2019s some facts for ya- they don\u2019t need your shit DD. They have Bloomberg Terminals. They have 100x more data than we do, and they see it before we do, in real time, and they play market rotations and earnings. They\u2019re not googling 1 week old short interest data. They got the real time shit. They play this game on another level. And if you can\u2019t get them on board, and the stock isn\u2019t a household name, then you fucked up. \n\nSo this is what I\u2019m saying- I blame all you fucks for missing plays like NKE last week. \n\nCome on. NKE was a fucking given. It was written on the wall in neon letters and most of us missed it. \n\nTL;DR- want to make money? You can be a millionaire without ever touching a short squeeze. \n\nFucking rookie ass bitches.",

        "selftext": "The LCID merger has been completed and the ticker change will be happening Monday 7/26. So lets start up with the background on the company.\n\nLeadership: Peter Rawlinson: Current CEO/CTO - Peter has over 30 years of automotive experience. Prior to Lucid, Peter was Vice President of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla and Chief Engineer of the Model S, where he led the engineering of the Model S.\n\nDerek Jenkins: Senior Vice President of Design and Brand - Before joining Lucid, Derek was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments locally and globally. He also spent nine years as the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America, and eight years with Audi, serving first as Lead Exterior Designer, followed by Assistant Chief Designer for Audi Design.\n\nMichael Bell: Most recently, Michael was Chief Technology Officer for Rivian. He has 30 years in the tech field includes 16 at Apple and five at Intel. At Apple, he played significant roles in the development of iPhone, iMac, AirPort, and Apple TV products.\n\nIn short Lucid team is comprised of leaders with decades of experience in lead roles in automotive and technology industries.\n\nNow, lets talk about the cars. Prior to the Lucid air, Lucid was known for Formula E racing. Lucid\u2019s technology arm Atieva develops and builds the battery packs powering every car on the grid in the world's leading electric racing championship field. Currently Lucid's lineup with consist of 4 models: The Air, available in 2022, from $77,400. Air Touring model, from $95,000 Air Grand Touring, from $139,000 Air Dream Edition, at $169,000 Lucid Air EV has a battery capacity of 113.0 kWh and a range reported as high as 517 miles. That is more efficient than the Model S Long Range Plus, which has a 98.0-kWh capacity and 402 miles of range. Lucid's Dream edition will also boast a modest 1080HP. Lucid currently has reached 10,000 preorders, representing over 650M in anticipated sales. Lucid expects 577 of these to be delivered this year.\n\nIn November, Lucid finished building the first phase of its factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, with the capacity to deliver up to 30,000 units per year initially, with up to 400,000 units annually in the future. The site sits on 590 acres allowing for additional expansion. The next phase expected to begin later this year \u2013 enabling production of Project Gravity, a premium SUV, and is expected to be fully produced and delivered by 2023.\n\nLucid is also backed by the wealthy Saudi PIF (Public Investment Fund). They will be the largest shareholder, however there are also other companies in the pipe. Including Fidelity Management &amp; Research, BlackRock, Neuberger Berman, Franklin Templeton, Wellington Management, and Winslow Capital Management.\n\nHowever I've been focusing on the Saudi Fund, they currently hold over 430B in assets, and for such an oil rich company to be backing an EV, if that doesn't scream bullish....The pipe shares will also be locked until at least September 1, so I would not expect a selloff this week.\n\nLucid Currently has 8 showrooms but has plans to open 20 by the end of this year throughout the U.S. and Canada. Long before the SPAC Lucid also promised the Saudi's to build in factory in Saudi Arabia. Talks are the factory would be located somewhere around Jeddah, which would be mark a very significant move as the Middle East shifts its economy from oil to EV's.\n\nAnyways this is my first attempt at a DD so....I'll be trying to read and respond to as many comments as I can.\n\nEdit: current positions 400 shares@27.27\nNot sure why its getting deleted? Help?",

You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again.",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 152.82 points to close at 34,786.35. The S&amp;P 500 has now risen for seven consecutive sessions, its longest winning streak since August.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Solid moves by major tech stocks helped support the overall market on Friday, with shares of Apple and Salesforce rising by nearly 2% and 1.3%, respectively. Microsoft jumped 2.2%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For the week, the Nasdaq Composite rose nearly 2%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Dow climbed 1.7% and 1%, respectively. Several sectors closed at record levels on Friday, including tech and health care.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The strong week on Wall Street was spurred by a string of solid economic reports, capped by a better-than-expected jobs report on Friday morning.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The economy [added 850,000 jobs last month](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/jobs-report-june-2021.html), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting an addition of 706,000. The print topped the revised 583,000 jobs created in May.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThis is a strong report and should be taken as a sign of things to come for an accelerating labor market,\u201d Aberdeen Standard Investments deputy chief economist James McCann said in a note.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Angelo Kourkafas, an investment strategist at Edward Jones, said that the report showed solid growth but wouldn\u2019t change the Fed\u2019s policy path, hitting a sweet spot for markets.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cI think it was one of these goldilocks-type of reports, because hiring accelerated -- which is a positive sign for the second half and the recovery -- but not so much that it would trigger a reaction of an accelerated timeline for the Federal Reserve to start tapering,\u201d Kourkafas said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In addition to the job gains, average hourly wages rose 0.3% for the month and are up 3.6% year over year, matching expectations.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said that the report eased concerns about a labor shortage.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cI think we also learned that the explanations for the weaker numbers from April and May -- namely that seasonal probably weighing on job growth and probably some impact from the unemployment benefits on labor supply -- that those were pretty good explanations. So I think it was reassuring, in that sense,\u201d Hatzius said on CNBC\u2019s \u201c[Squawk on the Street](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-on-the-street/),\u201d adding that the unemployment rate coming in higher than expected showed that the recovery still had a long way to go.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The S&amp;P 500 has now risen in five of the past six weeks, while the Nasdaq has gained in six of the past seven weeks.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Even with the recent strength for stocks, market strategists say that uncertainty about the future of the Fed\u2019s asset purchases and the upcoming earnings season could keep stocks from making major gains in the near term.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThe market is still very much concerned about the Fed\u2019s reaction function,\u201d said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors, adding that he thought there was still a lot of slack in the labor market.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One weak spot for the markets this week was small caps, as the Russell 2000 slipped 1% on Friday to finish negative for the week.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On Friday, shares of Boeing fell 1.3%, weighing on the Dow, after a 737 cargo plane made an [emergency landing off the coast of Honolulu](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/boeing-cargo-plane-makes-emergency-landing-in-ocean-off-honolulu-coast-faa-says.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_content=Main&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1625234441).

RIP for any of the EDU and  TAL bagholders...\n\nWell,  the scary thing is the public opinion in China always align with what  the Chinese government wants to do. If you have friends in China, look  up their comments on WeChat or WeiBo, they are cheering for turning  education sector into non-profit.\n\nThe  honeymoon with Chinese tech stocks are way over and the price Chinese  stocks, even now for some, had priced in a friendly, laissez faire  regulation and CONTROL from the Chinese government.\n\nIt  might be the time to be greedy while the market is fearful. Chinese  market is huge and with tons of growth potential for anything and  everything. But maybe in the short-term until this muddy policy /  attitude shift is over, it's better to stay away from the Chinese stock  to not have that gut wrenching feeling when one of your holding is  dropped 50% overnight without fundamental change in its business.",

        "selftext": " For context: I've been a ROBLOX developer for 8 years, on the platform for 11 years. I have 200M+ total visits (visits work like youtube views) and made $250k usd from roblox in the past year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n If you're a boomer, roblox is not a game, it's more of a marketplace/app store. Developers make games, players buy robux and spend them in games, developers convert the robux to usd. Roblox charges the standard fee of 30% on all robux transactions between players. The part  where they rip devs off, is how much USD they get from robux. If you buy robux, then convert that robux back to USD, you will not get the same amount you paid, even before the 30% tax.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Let's calculate how much roblox actually takes. If you spend $100 on robux, you will get 10,000 robux. After you spend all the robux in a game, the developer will get 7,000 robux after 30% tax. The current robux to usd rate is 100,000 robux for $350, with a minimum of 100,000 to cash out. That means the developer ends up with $24.50 from a player spending $100 in their game. Roblox is taking a 75.5% cut on robux earnings, compared to 30% on Steam or Apple app store. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n It gets worse, some devs aren't able to convert their robux to usd at all. Developers must be approved before they can convert robux. Even if all the robux came from legitimate means, some devs aren't accepted. This is an issue with roblox contractors (smaller developers who do commission work) and they can only get around that by accepting PayPal.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n What does this mean? Roblox is making bank off their developers, and the developers are fine with it. Lots of the developers are kids (under 18) and many from third world countries, so money has more value to them. Developers also fear the competition on other app stores where there are already established game dev companies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy position: [2000 shares at $86.45](https://prnt.sc/1e15x8u)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Roblox takes 75.5% of earnings on robux from devs, devs don't care.

        "selftext": "# Introduction\n\nLet me just preface this by saying this post is for those who take trading seriously, who harbor real hopes of earning a steady income in the market. This post is going to be long, and it is going to demand work from you to both understand and attempt to emulate. But that work will be worth the effort. I recommend you read it several times through, and keep as a reference. If you are just here looking for entertainment and gambling, that is fine, but this is probably a thread to skip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFour weeks ago I began a challenge to turn $4k into $1M. I began this to help educate others on the professional trading process, and to prove several points that are often in contention:\n\n**1) That it can be done,** \n\n**2) That good trading is actually simple,** \n\n**3) That technical analysis is real and effective,**\n\n**4) That small accounts have a huge edge.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here are my results from the FIRST WEEK of that challenge.**\n\n*Processing img 92wrzgrcasb71...*\n\n**Return first week: $658 (+16.5%)**\n\nThe question you should be asking yourself is: **How did I find so many sudden, big winners in a single week?** I will teach you exactly how below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, let's just get a bit of a rant off my chest. Hard words to follow, and a lot of you will disagree with these points, but some of you will benefit a lot from hearing it. These are some of the reasons you aren't making money, in my not so humble opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1) Stop chasing stupid memes and \"hot\" stocks. Create your own opportunities.**\n\nWhen I read the daily chat in subs, including this one, it gets really depressing quick. All I see are the same tickers posted over and over and over again, and usually total dogshit stocks. Everyone just copying what others tell them to trade, so few actually thinking for themselves or finding their own trades and opportunities. Like, why is half this sub bagholding SOFI and mentioning it nonstop? Was some recent DD posted on it and you all just hopped in blindly? Why the obsession with the other same tickers, like CLNE, that get posted again and again? Because others were posting about it? Look, I won't deny you can sometimes, potentially make money in meme stocks or reading DDs. But chasing memes or pump and dumps is not going to make you money long term.\n\nMaybe you looked at the fundamentals and you thought it was a great company with long term prospects. Ok, sure. But if you are trading on fundamentals, why the hell are you buying short term options? If you are a fundamental trader then you are a buy and hold investor with a year plus timeline. If you are buying weeklies or looking for a quick pop, fundamentals don't mean shit, technicals are what matter. Stop mixing long term strategy with short term trading, it just doesn't make any sense.\n\nSet up your own scanners. Do your own research. Find your own opportunities.\n\n**2) Stop trading slow as fuck megacap stocks with a small account.**\n\nWhen I see people with sub-million dollar accounts trading stocks like Ford or even Apple, I can't help but cringe. The one HUGE advantage that small accounts have is that they can trade the fast, explosive, hard moving small cap stocks without having to worry about issues like liquidity and wicking the price upward. *The reason you can beat the market hard with a small account is because you can trade the highest beta stocks that guys like Buffett can't.* But only if you focus on them.\n\nTrade the fast stocks. The stocks that really move hard. Those are the stocks that will get you rich quickly, not fucking BABA on a 2% move.\n\nThere is an acronym you need to learn, and become obsessive about. That acronym is ADR. Average Daily Range. If your account is less than a million, you should not even be looking at stocks with an ADR less than 5%. They are too slow. When someone asks me to judge a stock or setup for them, the very first thing I look at is the ADR. If it is less than 4 or 5 ADR, I tell them it is dog shit, whether I'm bullish on it or not.\n\nAAPL has an ADR of 1.6 at the moment. Garbage stock for small accounts. Is it rallying? Sure. It is rallying in 1.6% increments. Can you make money in that? Sure, even more with options. But you won't double your account in a month with Apple unless you YOLO everything into short dated options. It works until you go broke, which let's be honest, most people here have or will.\n\nTSLA has an ADR of 3.5. Not terrible, but you can do much better.\n\nSPCE has an ADR of 12.5. THAT is what you want to see. I made a 42% return on SPCE in 3 days last week, with SHARES. And I will show you exactly why I bought SPCE and many others before they exploded last week. It wasn't simple luck.\n\n**3) If you want to gamble with options, then go for it. But if you want to be an actual professional trader, you probably shouldn't touch options until you've shown consistency with shares first.**\n\nLook, if you just want to gamble and hope to get lucky, knowing you will probably go broke, that's fine with me. That's the WSB way. At least you are being honest with yourself. But if you want to get serious about trading, to make so much money so consistently you never have to work again, you should not be touching options until you've proven you can be consistently profitable trading shares.\n\nLeverage and margin is something that ought to be earned, not used just because it is there.\n\nOptions are extremely unforgiving. Let's say you buy a stock at 10, it rallies up to 12, then tanks back to 10 again, and you sell. With shares, you've just broken even. Not good, but obviously not bad either. Breakeven is fine for a trade. But do the same exact trade with options instead of shares, and you could be down 20% on it. Good luck overcoming that downward pressure as a noobie trader long term. Trading is hard enough without adding theta and vega rape to the mix.\n\n**4) If you want to be a professional, then think and act like a professional.**\n\nProfessional traders are process oriented. They are focused on improving their trading process more than they are on chasing the hot next trade.\n\nThat means having a method or system to your trading. Something you can repeat again, and again, and gradually improve. It means using scanners and finding YOUR OWN stocks and trades, finding tickers neither you nor most anyone else has even heard of before, and making tons of money on them. Browsing WSB for DD or the next hot stock is not a system, and likely won't lead to any lasting success as a trader.\n\nIt also means you have to work fucking hard. Success is rarely easy, much less in something as competitive as the stock market. If you are lazy, or don't want it enough, be honest with yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now, on to making money.**\n\nWhat follows is one simple setup that will make you money if traded correctly. I will teach you a process you can follow and repeat and improve upon. This obviously isn't the only way to trade, but I can promise you it beats the market significantly if done correctly. So learn it, and practice it, and start making money. From there, the rest is improvement, and branching out, and finding new strategies to test and perfect on your way to becoming an independent, professional trader. In other words, the rest is gravy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Breakout Swing Trading Strategy: The Setup.\n\n*Processing img 0nnm1qztasb71...*\n\nThis is a purely technical trading system. A lot of people will tell you technical analysis is nonsense and doesn't work. Those people do not know what they are talking about. I've made my living as a purely technical trader, and I assure you I am not the only one. Over my career I've picked far too many huge short term winners using nothing but charts for it to be simple luck.\n\nTo put it in one sentence: **We are going to look for strong, volatile momentum stocks that are breaking out of a consolidation pattern.**\n\nSounds easy, and it is, but the details are what really matter. So let's go in depth.\n\nWe will start by analyzing five of the trades I've made as part of my $1M challenge, so you can see exactly what I saw on the charts when I entered my positions. I drew two red lines on each chart to show the \"flagging\" pattern I was watching. The chart on the left is daily candles, chart on the right is hourly candles. Proof of these entries and exits can be found in both text and screenshot format in my history.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Example #1: IDT**\n\nBought @ 37.70 on 7/1\n\nSold partial @ 47.00 on 7/2\n\nReturn: 25% gain in 1 day\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dxwixuarbsb71.png?width=1619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=403e77830fe05e1e0d8c38f76cb2098656af8abf\n\n**Example #2: SPCE**\n\nBought @ 37.25 on 6/22\n\nSold partial @ 52.8 on 6/25\n\nReturn: 42% gain in 3 days\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zvlqevnsbsb71.png?width=1619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4f7d04aafb25e4a43700eb223b3b011f6fd652d\n\n**Example #3: \\[redacted small cap\\]**\n\nBought @ 3.81 on 6/24\n\nSold partial @ 4.44 on 6/25\n\nReturn: 17% gain in 1 day\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/23rk1b4ubsb71.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cb4eb4f83154b4d992cc6b6b3bc882e60d0ea43\n\n**Example #4: LPI**\n\nBought @ 68.86 on 6/21\n\nSold partial @ 91.39 on 6/25\n\nReturn: 33% gain in 4 days\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jiiuwlevbsb71.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa4d81b417b665324f1fca54f18995f361bfe5d5\n\n**Example #5: CRCT**\n\nBought @ 35.74 on 6/25\n\nSold partial @ 41.85 on 6/28\n\nReturn: 17% gain in 3 days\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpuatviwbsb71.png?width=1617&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b2dded0bca2a31dda00d5c4f94b3550a5a5f5cc\n\n**What do these charts all have in common?**\n\n**1) Strong momentum stocks.** Every one of these (except CRCT which was a recent IPO) had doubled or more in the past six months. None of this buy low, sell high stuff here. We want to buy high and sell higher.\n\n**2) High ADR (Average Daily Range).** You want to trade the fast stocks, the truly explosive stocks, and a high ADR is one of the best ways to find them. The average ADR on these five stocks was above 8%. Our minimum ADR will be 5%.\n\n**3) Consolidation.** The stock made a big move upward, and then began trading sideways with a tightening range. Forming higher lows and lower highs. The ideal flagging pattern we are looking for is technically referred to as a \"pennant.\"\n\n**4) Moving Averages.** Every one of these stocks was either riding or bouncing off of their 20 day simple moving average. There is something truly magical about that yellow line on my charts, and I don't know what or why it is, but it simply works. This is absolutely key to remember, to avoid stocks that are either too slow or over-extended, focus on those at or near the 20 SMA. Occasionally you can find good breakouts above the 20 SMA that are riding the 10 SMA, but these have a higher failure rate in my experience.\n\n**5) Strong breakout from their range on high volume.** A \"breakout\" refers to a stock punching through the top of the consolidation flag you drew. Ideally you want to see fast rising price action on large volume. This is your entry point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to see more charts and examples of this strategy, [**this four hour video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx8GvtAxilk) should give you plenty. If you are going to employ this strategy, I highly recommend investing those four hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Trading Process\n\n**STEP 1:** Set up a scanner and run it the night before your trading day. I will give you all of my scanner settings below to get you started. Your welcome.\n\n**STEP 2:** Go through every single stock in your scanner. Look for the most promising stocks. In other words, the stocks that have the five criteria I listed above. If you spot a good stock, do three things: 1) Draw a flag around the consolidating price action. 2) Set an alert to the top of the range, to notify you when a breakout from that range occurs. 3) Add the stock to a breakout watchlist. I don't know if you can do any of this with Robinhood, but you ought to have a real broker and charting software by now. I use ThinkorSwim, but there's plenty of good software options out there, like TC2000. Don't be afraid to pay a bit for good software, if you have to.\n\n**STEP 3:** Before market open, you should now have a solid watchlist of breakout candidates. Go through the list and see which setups look the closest to breaking out, or which have already broken out in the premarket action. Also look carefully for anything that may bounce hard off the 20 SMA. These will be your primary focus, but you should also have alerts to all other stocks in your watchlist to notify you of a breakout.\n\n**STEP 4:** If a strong breakout from the range occurs, meaning good rising action on good volume, you want to buy quickly. I would recommend a minimum of 10% of your account, to a maximum of 25%, but follow your own personal risk tolerance. Set a stop loss order just below the low price of the day. You should always be using a stop loss, especially as a beginner and especially with these volatile stocks.\n\n**STEP 5:** If the stock has stayed above your entry price by the next day, you can raise your stop to the entry price if you wish, to limit your loss to breakeven. After 3-5 days, or after very strong price gain, you should take some profits. Anywhere from a quarter to a half of your position. The rest we will let ride.\n\n**STEP 6:** Use the 10 day simple moving average as a trailing \"soft\" stop for the remaining shares. If it looks like the price action is going to close below the 10 SMA, then close out the entire position. The reason I emphasize close is because intraday price action can be volatile, and you don't want to get stopped out from a small dip just below the 10 SMA, if possible. If you don't have the time to watch the market during the day, feel free to use a hard stop.\n\n# Scanner Settings\n\n**ADR (Average Daily Range) above 5%**\n\n**Price X% greater than Y days ago (1 month, 3 month, 6 month scanners)**\n\n**Price within 15% of 6 day high**\n\n**Price within 15% of 6 day low**\n\n**$Volume (close \\* volume) greater than 3,000,000**\n\n**Listed Stocks Only (No OTC, etc.)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1 Month: 25% Greater than 22 Days ago\n\n3 Month: 50% Greater than 67 Days ago\n\n6 Month: 150% Greater than 126 Days ago\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to adjust these settings to get more or fewer results.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ADR code for ThinkorSwim:**\n\n`#Hint: ADR`\n\n`def len = 1;`\n\n`def dayHigh = DailyHighLow(`[`AggregationPeriod.DAY`](https://AggregationPeriod.DAY)`, len, 0, no).DailyHigh;`\n\n`def dayLow = DailyHighLow(`[`AggregationPeriod.DAY`](https://AggregationPeriod.DAY)`, len, 0, no).DailyLow;`\n\n`def ADR_highlow = (dayHigh/dayLow + dayHigh[1]/dayLow[1] + dayHigh[2]/dayLow[2] + dayHigh[3]/dayLow[3] + dayHigh[4]/dayLow[4] + dayHigh[5]/dayLow[5] + dayHigh[6]/dayLow[6] + dayHigh[7]/dayLow[7] + dayHigh[8]/dayLow[8] + dayHigh[9]/dayLow[9] + dayHigh[10]/dayLow[10] +dayHigh[11]/dayLow[11] + dayHigh[12]/dayLow[12] + dayHigh[13]/dayLow[13]) / 14;`\n\n`plot ADR_perc = 100*(ADR_highlow-1);`\n\n**Screenshot (all scanners combined)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/334oc34jbsb71.png?width=1646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac5aa76d696358d6f2ad15ababe6045bf139a158\n\n# The Other Side of Breakouts: Break Downs\n\nI'm going to recommend that you don't anticipate breakouts. In other words, don't buy a stock simply because it is trading in a good consolidation pattern. Wait for the price to break upward from the range before you buy. The reason for this is that consolidation flags don't only break up, they can also break down. I'll just mention that this can actually be used as a profitable shorting strategy, but I won't go into depth on that in this guide. And I don't recommend shorting for a beginner trader either. Let's take a look at a few examples of recent break downs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SOFI**\n\nSOFI formed a decent flag in June, but then broke down from that range on 6/24. This day on 6/24 would have been a clear signal to either exit a position, or to short the stock. The price simply collapsed hard after this point.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9fk1wrn0csb71.png?width=1623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cf5299e56581d562e7ed71f80bf42b78886cdde\n\n**AMC**\n\nAMC formed a very strong looking flag in June. I actually broke my own rules and bought this in anticipation on 6/29. But I exited the position quickly on 7/1 when it became clear the price was breaking down from its range. After that, the price collapsed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y91p2tj1csb71.png?width=1625&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86bf88d5c3acfd4253ae31424396d0c187c444ca\n\n# Putting it all together. More complex charts.\n\nLet's take a look at a couple little more complicated, tricky charts. We need to stretch your brain a bit with less simple examples.\n\n**\\[redacted small cap\\]**\n\nHere you can see three consolidation flags back to back, with differing follow through. Flag, breakout, flag, breakout, flag, break down on the 20 SMA. You will frequently see hard rising stocks following this \"stair-stepping\" sort of pattern. Still pretty simple, so let's try something a little harder to see.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rve956djisb71.png?width=1623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94584a68a32c9ada4cd5494af413ae41833feead\n\n**PLBY**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qbkvm3m4csb71.png?width=1609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c145defa11d2a47b4097e23b8374acc32d543c2e\n\nStudy this chart carefully, and you can see everything discussed so far. PLBY formed a nice flag in May. It broke down from this flag on 5/11. But then it seemed to trade sideways for a bit and form another, larger flag again.\n\nNote that the breakout/breakdown point for the first flag was the 20 SMA, and the breakout/breakdown point for the second flag was the 50 SMA. This is no coincidence, and will be seen often. Some stocks will move based on the 50 SMA rather than the 20 SMA, and these can be traded as well, but they are slower moving stocks, and I recommend for smaller accounts to just focus on those stocks near the 20 day.\n\nThe failure point for the second flag was on 6/14. After that the price has collapsed.\n\nOne more thing to note on this chart. There are two points where the price on PLBY broke hard upward from it's range, but then quickly fell back down into the range. These are referred to as \"false breakouts,\" and will happen to you often. Note that the first false breakout occurred well above the 20 SMA, which is one reason to avoid breakouts well above the 20 SMA. They just haven't consolidated enough and have a higher failure rate. Patience is king.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**When is the best time to employ this strategy?**\n\nThis strategy should only be employed during a rising bull market, or possibly during a sideways market. Breakouts will not work well in a declining market, and some other strategy must be employed.\n\nThe absolute best time for breakouts is shortly after a pullback in the market, when stocks begin to recover quickly. You can see some explosive moves during these periods.\n\n**How do you deal with breakouts that have gapped up in premarket?**\n\nThose are more difficult. It all depends on the price action. If something has gapped up huge in premarket, I will generally just pass on it. But if something is just starting to break out in premarket, I will look to enter. The exact percentage is difficult to say unfortunately, but anything up more than 10% is usually a pass for me.\n\nIf I do enter premarket gappers, I won't enter immediately on open. I'll give it one to five minutes to watch the price action. If the price is stalling or dropping at open I won't buy it. But if it is showing strong volume and rising, that is what I want to see for a buy.\n\n**Can this strategy be done with options instead of shares?**\n\nIt is possible, but I wouldn't recommend it, especially to start. Breakouts have a high failure rate, and options are very unforgiving to failed trades. If you do decide to use options, I would suggest being much more aggressive with your profit taking, perhaps even selling same day on a breakout. Since this is a swing trading strategy, you can go quite short dated on the expiration, around one month dated should be fine unless you want to try for a bigger move or gamble with even shorter expiry.\n\n**What do you set your stop losses at?**\n\nAlready explained above. First day, the lows of the day. Second day, cost basis. After that, use 10 day SMA as a trailing soft stop.\n\n**When do you take profits?**\n\nAlready explained above. Take quarter to half profits after first big run up, usually around 3 to 5 days. Then use the 10 SMA as a soft trailing stop.\n\n**What if the stock gaps down hard overnight? My stop won't protect me from that!**\n\nThis is true. The only way to avoid overnight risk is to be a pure day trader and to never hold overnight. Personally I find swing trading to be far more profitable, since the big moves take days to play out. Swing trading also gives you much more time and freedom to live your life, since you can simply hold a winning position for days or even weeks, and don't have to sit and stare at a screen all day long to make money.\n\nStocks gapping down big overnight is actually quite rare, but eventually you will experience it. But, let's do the math. Let's say you put 10% of your account into a stock, and some news comes out and it tanks a whopping 30% overnight. As a percentage of your account, that is 10% \\* 30%, or 3% of your account. Definitely not good, of course. But you aren't going to go broke losing 3% of your account. It can be overcome with time and good trading. This is just part of the risk of being a trader.\n\n**I am curious if you handle \"memestocks\" or other very popular stocks differently. I hear a lot of people say these stocks don't act rationally. Do you take more/less risk with stocks like this?**\n\nYes, meme stocks often have much more support and move stronger than most other stocks. For this reason I usually have more conviction to trade them, so I will put on a bit more size or even slightly anticipate the breakouts. But I don't trade meme stocks just because they are meme stocks, they must fit the criteria and patterns described above.\n\nMeme stocks represent opportunities for massive gains and so you should take a bit more risk with them. If you got in GME early, which I did, you can make life changing money.\n\nUnfortunately today you've got too many people trying to pump too many names and everybody ends up diluting each other. It's not like a few months back when the names were much more consolidated.\n\n**Do you use any fundamentals in your trading?**\n\nNone. My trading horizon is too short for fundamentals to make any difference in the price action. Fundamentals only make a difference for long term investors. If you are a short term trader, you don't need to worry about fundamentals at all imo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Additional Resources\n\nI was going to offer several links here, but don't want to break any rules...

        "selftext": "*\"The Elder Days are gone. The Middle Days are passing. The Younger Days are beginning.\"*\n\n\u2015 Saruman the White\n\nSince most of you degenerates have joined during the middle days of WSB (post 1M), I thought it might be helpful to remind you the stories of some of the OG legends. \n\nu/1R0NYMAN**, the master of homeless box spreads**\n\n['no money at risk'](https://preview.redd.it/21yvujixo9971.png?width=635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a990f594a9a435a6d80e230bb87550ca2a6fe917)\n\n* Discovered an ancient spell of 'it literally can't go tits up' trading strategy called \"The Box Spread\", a multi-legged options strategy involving both buying/selling calls and puts at the same time.\n* Through his wiseness, he came to the conclusion that Box Spreads, if sold at the right time, can get him credit with 'zero risk' because his blood magic told him so\n* Out of all tickers, he chose $UVXY (because why the fuck not? It's not like Volmageddon ever happened). He was confident that he set up a play that would net him a guaranteed total of $38k of riskless profit in 2 years\n* Sold hundreds of Box Spreads on Robinhood using margin and gets paid a credit for each box spread. His account goes [from $5k of his own money to about $200k worth of risk](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/aeqcvt/i_dont_know_when_to_stop/)\n* Proceeded to withdraw $10k in cash, because who woudn't? \n* If a Box Spread gets held till expiry it's risk free, but that's not how option selling works because there is always assignment risk...and 1r0nyman completely forgot about that\n* To make it worse, Robinhood didn\u2019t pick up on the risk level of his box spread trade and actually echoed back to him that there wasn\u2019t a big amount of risk on the trade. Much like other elders here, 1R0NYMAN found a glitch/cheatcode in Robinhood which ultimately added even more fuel to the fire\n* Got assigned short shares, -$58k loss, account closed out. Robinhood banned box spreads after the fiasco and emailed its entire client base about its policy change as a direct result of what happened with 1R0NYMAN\n\nu/analfarmer2**, the paragon of financial degeneration**\n\n* analfarmer2, the 19-year-old somehow got access to a $100,000 trading account, he described as \u2018online biz and margin\u2019\n* His first FD was a $110k bet on $ALGN with 2DTE calls. The company announced a share buyback, and shares rocketed the next day gaining him $180k. His account went to $343k\n* A couple of days later our guy dropped $170k on1DTE  SPY puts, and again got insanely lucky as the market tanked after a Trump tweet about the Chinese trade embargo. [**His trading account was up another $277k up to $646k**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cksrsf/spy_puts_277k_profit_in_1_minute/)\n* He took another massive bet the following day, buying $600k worth of SPY calls 1DTE. analfarmer2 sold out of his position at a $500k loss. He made a few more unknown trades and found himself down to $41k\n* [**3 days later**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/co31pq/my_final_yolo_40k_into_cgc_calls_expiring_next/) he bought $40k worth of CGC calls in anticipation of earnings the following week. This was a more responsible trade -- he had an entire week until expiration, just imagine the possibilities. Earnings were shit, the stock tanked and his FDs were now worthless\n\nu/ControlTheNarrative, **the wizard of GUH!**\n\n* ControlTheNarrative was so wise that he managed to discover the 'infinite money cheat code' deeply embedeed into Robinhood's matrix and as a result redifined what some consider to be beyond their Personal Risk Tolerance\n* He so genius and so retarded at the same time that through his Robinhood Gold he took his leverage level to 25x \n* From an inital deposit of $2k (minimum balance to access RH Gold) he bought 100 shares of AMD for 3,800 or so, with margin. He then sold an AMD Call Contracts with a $2 strike to get almost all his money back. He then used that money to buy TWO hundred shares of AMD because remember, margin doubles the buying power, then he sold 2 Call Contracts witht he same $2 strike price to get almost all his money back, which is then doubled again thanks to Robinhood's Margin\n* Robinhood let him buy AMD stock on margin that is collateralized by AMD stock he's already sold. The AMD loop he went through made his buying power go up only because RH was absolutely retardedly (even more so than he was) still counting the AMD stock for his covered calls as part of his margin collateral to buy the options. He rinsed and repeated this process until sufficiently leveraged to his Personal Risk Tolerance (25x leverage)\n* Finally, he used his increased buying power to 'maximiz' gains by loading up on $AAPL put FDs to bet against Tim Apple. Unfortunately, $AAPL destroyed earnings and blew his account\n* To make matters worse, [he recorded the market-open and the instant nuking of his account](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/)\n\nu/MoonYachts**, the leverageborn**\n\n* Credit. Debt. Equity. Leverage. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when u/MoonYachts attacked. MoonYachts was a disciple of u/ControlTheNarrative. Through his master's teachings, MoonYachts also understood that when selling covered calls on Robinhood and if he bought the shares, the stock wasn't subtracted from the buying power. The cash balance from the covered call got added to his cash balance \u2013 increasing the buying power by the premium he took in.\n* Only the Fed Chair, master of all four elements, could beat him, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. And although his QE skills were great at the time, he had a lot to learn before he was ready to save anyone.\n* So it happened, that MoonYachts' Personal Risk Tolerance was from the netherrealm and not even the Fed Chair could match him at the time. By using the 'infinite money spell', he managed to take his [Personal Risk Tolerance to 250x leverage (a $1M leveraged position on $4k of initial equity)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drqaro/robinhood_free_money_cheat_works_pretty_well_1/) on $F stock\n* To this day nobody knows the ending of his adventures, but legend has it that banks still hate him for showing us the spell of infinite leverage",

        "selftext": "We have all read that \"it is not COVID's effect on people\", it is \"how businesses and governments react with restrictions\" .. that effects stocks.  Bored of this, heard it too many times?  Not scared any more?\n\nWell the virus and variants didn't get bored.\n\nReviewing the top five economies and their case trends -------------------------\n\nSource : Worldometers.info\n\nUSA:  new cases curving upward, especially in FL\n\nChina:  they lie about their numbers\n\nJapan:  new cases increasing at a roughly linear rate\n\nGermany: new cases growing again, though off of a low base\n\nFrance:  new cases surging and strong in the numbers, curving up\n\nUK:  new cases surged though showing signs of starting to drop\n\nKeeping your elder family members safe from your infecting them is still a cultural truth.\n\nOne political party in a given country wants to make another fail.  One party will weaponize the virus and threaten the other to take action.  This is what leads to restrictions.  Before it was the Democrats shutting down businesses to make the economy worse for Republicans.  Now it is the same, but Repub states will shut down and Dem states will want to keep businesses open.  In another country similar games will play out.\n\nSo all the potential economic shut downs are still there.\n\nWhat is different is that all the technology that was bought to have the kids educate from home, such as tablets and web cams and online meeting subscriptions don't need to be bought a second time so soon.  So the 2nd set of restrictions on the population comes without a sector that gets an economic boost.  The exception is grocery stores and online shopping.\n\nThe extra unemployment benefits end on Sept 6th in numerous states, but investors know that and would sell effected stocks sooner.  The moratorium on evictions ends this fall, and so tenants will stop the games and scramble to pay their landlords, taking away their spending money.  If they don't they will get an eviction on their credit record.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow to valuations\n\n[https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe)\n\nshows that the Schiller PE ratio of stocks is 38.3.  The .com bubble was the highest it ever got, higher than this level for 2.5 years, and getting to the mid 40's.  Other then that, at no time in history was this valuation ratio this high.\n\nNote also that in 1982 at the peak of interest rates 13 to 14%, the average stock had a PE of 7 to 9.\n\nA book by O'Shoughnessy \"What Works on Wall Street\" studied 40 years of stock market data.  Its results shows that a price to sales ratio is 'the king of value factors', since sales can't be manipulated like earnings can.\n\n[https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales)\n\nshows that this valuation is higher now than at any time charted.  The book suggests that a price to sales of 1.5 is considered a good deal.  We are over twice that level on average.\n\nThe market breadth has eroded under the mega techs.  Not the Russel 2000 declined recently.\n\nHere are the price to sales of the mega techs, using data at Reuters.  This can be hard to find in navigation, but a direct link will help, for example\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.N](https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.N)\n\nuse .N and .O at the end of the symbol for NYSE and NASDAQ.\n\nprice to sales:\n\nMSFT = 13.3 ; FB = 10.4 ; AAPL = 7.5 ; AMZN = 4.3 ; GOOG = 8.76 ; NVDA = 25.2 ; AMD = 9.5\n\nThese clearly can fall and still be overvalued.\n\nSome have sighted the growth in the money supply, such as M2, as part of what has pushed the market higher.  However, it is important to note that M2 was recategorized in 2020.  So even though you can go to the Mises Institute's site and see articles of big increases in the M2 money supply, much of that is due to the recategorization and strangely the articles omit this but for a footnote.\n\nInflation ----------------------------------------------\n\nA large part of what we pretend to understand about inflation is the CPI and PCE.\n\nWe think that we know that the last CPI reading was 5.4%.  That is above the target of 2% of course when action by the recipe is needed.  This coupled with Powell not wanting to raise rates and desiring to de-prioritize inflation is \"bad enough\" from a stock perspective.  Jim Cramer described Powell as \"having a heart\" in wanting to prioritize helping people back to work.  Recall that interest rates have to be jacked up in response to inflation eventually.  Acting to late makes it worse.  From business school texts, higher interest rates put downward pressure on the value of future earnings.  Thus the forward looking value of stocks drops.\n\n  But I challenge all of you to take the CPI by its percentage components and REBUILD it yourself with online research.  I did.  While the published number was +1.6% year over year at the time, I found no component less than 2%, and most were a good deal higher.  It is easy to find information showing education expenses rising at a +5% annual rate for many years.  Medical costs I found web sites saying +4% annually consistantly over many years.  At the time, only oil was lower than 2% price growth.  Today, with oil back up above $70 a barrel, that is not to be taken lightly.\n\n  Recently the Fed has emphasized the PCE, the Personal Consumption Expendatures index.  Do you find as I do it strange that they publish the 'this month vs last month' number, making it look like small 0.1 to 0.3% rise, and not the more useful year over year number, which would show a larger % increase?\n\n  The National Debt takes no small part in the desire to have inflation be low and keep interest rates low.  But that combination is impossible over time.\n\n  I have been at individual stock investing since 1996 and I have sold most of my stock holdings.  I lived through the .com crash which I took on the chin (with small dollars since I was young and I learned from it such that I was 66% in cash for the crash of 2008.  If you have not been in the habit of thinking about economic impacts, valuations, and questioning what real inflation is, it is certainly time to start.\n\n  The great bull market of the 1980's in the USA was spurred by the acceleration of women entering the work force and the personal computer.  The great bull market of the 1990's was spurred by implementation of the internet, immigration, and foreign economies developing.\n\n  What is the story now?  5G networking is just a faster version of the same thing, but only over shorter distances.  Artificial intelligence is intended to replace humans.  Electric vehicles only reduce pollution after 100k miles according to an article in the WSJ.  I think to move on to much higher valuations we need a big economic story that just isn't there right now.",

        "selftext": "In this DD, I will attempt to prove through overwhelming evidence, historical trends,  market valuation, exponential growth, and more. That Virgin Galactic is criminally undervalued and is truly valued with other big name \u201cpotential stocks\u201d while being historically comparable to the commercialization of the plane.\n\n\n1. What is Virgin Galactic?\n\n\nVirgin Galactic is an aerospace company that provides human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers. The company is focused on developing a spaceflight system to offer customers a multi-day experience culminating in a spaceflight that includes several minutes of weightlessness and views of earth from space. \n\nEasily summarized by themselves on their website saying their mission is\n\n\u201cto be the Spaceline for Earth, means we focus on using space for good while delivering an unparalleled customer experience\u201d\n\nThey are a company attempting to commercialize space travel for the average person to be able to enjoy a trip to space.\n\nThis, by itself doesn\u2019t give the company any value. Due to the unknown factors and ambitcious nature of this mission statement, it is understandable why investors would roll their eyes at the idea of this company and therefore making it not very valuable. \n\nHowever, due to the way Virgin Galactic is conducting itself and the way it presents itself as the first real attempt at making a commercial space traveling company, I believe this company has the potential to become one of the biggest travel line stocks in the world.\n\n\n2. The market\u2019s value system\n\n\nLets say hypothetically, within a certain sector, there was a subsection that only accounted for roughly 2% of the overall sector, and company A contributed 79% to said subsection. \n\nNow, it would be logical to assume that even though company A controls 79% of its subsection, it wouldn\u2019t be a big player, as it\u2019s entire subsection consists of only 2% of the overall sector. \n\nBut what if I told you, that company A was in fact the largest company in its entire sector at a current market cap of 632 Billion dollars, and the runner up Company B, accounting for roughly 10% of all sells in the entire sector only had a current market cap of 248 Billion dollars.\n\nAs I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve guessed by now, this isn\u2019t hypothetical. Company B is Toyota and Company A is Tesla.\n\nTesla. A company that controls a small subsection in the overall car market, has extremely low sale compared to other car manufacturers, and has never turned a profit off selling cars is over 2 times more valuable then the next runner up. Why?\n\nWhile you could ague it\u2019s valuation a hundred different ways from retail interest to the overall Bull market. Simply put, Tesla is valued so highly for 1 major reason. Their potential.\n\nYou can debate whether or not it\u2019s rational, but it\u2019s safe to say the market right now values a company primarily on its sector\u2019s projected growth and the company\u2019s own potential.\n\nWhile Tesla is the most drastic example, almost all the big technology companies are valued similarly. \n\nApple is the largest company in the world because of the belief in their potential to continuously innovate in news ways that drastically change their entire sector. \n\nAmazon is almost universal rated a buy by most top analysts due to the potential they have in becoming a modern monopoly.\n\nModern Criteria Value, is based not necessarily on current fundamentals and value, but the perceived potential a company has to grow within its sector.\n\n\n3. Virgin Galactic\u2019s exponential potential\n\nOn January 1st, 1914 the first ever commercial plane flew from St. Petersburg, Florida to Tampa, Florida. While not realized much at the time, this one flight would led to the creation \nof the multi trillion dollar industry that is modern day airlines.\n\nAnd now, with interest in space travel at an all time high, and test flights like the one this upcoming Sunday making it more of a reality, one has to ask. \n\nWhat\u2019s stopping history from repeating itself, and what will happen when investors realize this exponential market Space itself could potentially become. As Virgin Galactic push\u2019s to make itself the number one most valuable space company, past private companies like SpaceX (with a market cap estimated to be 75 billion), the potential in this extremely lucrative future market will soon be realized by investors as they continue to look for huge potential stocks.\n\n\n\n\nAs far as Monday\u2019s flight is concerned, how successful it is and the announcement afterwards are secondary for Monday\u2019s price.\n\nThe main determinant in Monday\u2019s price action will be how Virgin Galactic\u2019s flight is portrayed by the media.\n\nIf it is portrayed poorly, or average. We will most likely see a rough sell off.\n\nHowever, I personally believe will see an image of hope and excitement painted, As the media proclaims this to be a great leap for humanity as a whole (over exaggerating for attention).\n\nIn this case, we will see a massive run on Monday, with consolidation later in the week followed by more soaring.\n\n\n\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading my personal take on the overall situation regarding $SPCE. And I wish all of you a good evening.",

        "selftext": "I am not a market expert but I have been observing red flags piling up recently and it\u2019s wise to pay close attention to them as they point to a near market correction including: \n\n**Low market breadth and divergence:** there are fewer stocks rising versus ones declining, and a larger number of stocks are hitting the 52 week low than the ones hitting the 52 week high. \n\n**Overbought stocks:** such as AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, and ARKK all have recently breached the 70 RSI overbought marker and are now dropping fast. This ties in well with the poor market breadth as allot of the money existing other stocks as they sell off is just pilling in few top stocks in an unstained way, hence the overbought flag. \n\n**Reduced volumes:** signal weakness in the market and provoke profit taking. For example the Russell 2000 average volume has dropped to just under 3 billion per day from a three months average of 3.7 billion. Incidentally this index tracks 2,000 small cap US companies which have been dropping for most of the last 3 weeks for a total decline of 7.3% thus far. \n\n**Major trend line broken:** for the second time in less than one month the S&amp;P 500 has dipped under its major trend line. The first time on May 18th, it reversed and went back up on the back of decent labor and production reports plus earnings expectations. Now that earnings are underway and most economic indicators are pointing to growth peaking it might not be able to reverse the drop. \n\nObviously all of the above are technical indicators that try to explain market behavior based on historical metrics, but they don\u2019t explain the reasons behind such changes. We have to look at economic news to identify causes including: \n\n**Peaking economic recovery:** several reports this month point to an economy that has reached peak recovery. For example, both the services PMI 64.6 vs 65.2 vs 64.8 (actual, forecast, previous) and ISM 60.1% vs 63.3% vs 64.0% reports for June show a declining rate of expansion. Also, industrial production is showing similar pattern 0.4% vs 0.6% vs 0.7%.\n\n**Mixed Q2 banking results:** also point to the same issue above. While the overall figures are up, the details point to absence of loan growth and net interest margin weakness. \n\n**Declining consumer sentiment:** while consumer spending came in higher than expected for the month of June consumer sentiment declined from 85.5 to 80.8. The main driver behind this is inflation.  \n\n**Inflation rising:** the FED has been harping on inflation being transitory because of the \u201cbase effect\u201d and some temporary supply constraints. Their timeline for all of that to sort out was few months. Now it\u2019s more than few months and inflation continues to rage registering the highest figures in over a decade with Core CPI (the Fed\u2019s favorite metric) registering 0.9%, the highest increase since 2008.\n\nFurthermore, the PPI (producer price index) also continues to rise at a rate of 1% in June indicating that consumers are still going to see higher prices in the coming months and that overall inflation will overshoot the FED\u2019s 2% threshold by a wide margin. \n\n**Reemergence of a new variant:**  the delta variant is causing allot of lock downs and interruption throughout the world. While its effect in the US might be limited, a slowing world economy does not bode well for stocks in general, hence perhaps the reason why bonds have gone up. \n\n**Bond yields going down:** usually indicates that an economy is slowing and investors are looking for safer assists. Many have pointed out that bond yields usually peak 3 months in advance of the stock which they did in March. Since we are in July and bond yield continue to decline many think the bond market is sniffing out something and reacting to it. Remember, the inverse relation between bonds and yields. \n\n**China\u2019s Crack on tech:** has rattled some investors especially that it came at a time when that market was showing sign of bottoming out. \n\nAll of those events point to a possible correction sometime in the near future. Most experts expect that sometime after Q2 earnings, but it could be starting as we speak, especially that corrections don\u2019t play out in one straight line. They tend to move in a series of several lower lows and lower highs until bottoming out. \n\nIt\u2019s important to also point out that a correction is not a market crash. Corrections are a much smaller event, ranging around a -10% drop on the low end for the leading S&amp;P 500 index and much more for individual speculative stocks. They are a healthy event that helps reinvigorate the market with new buyers. \n\nA crash on the other hand is a much larger event that\u2019s usually provoked by a combination of events or a single major event. Crashes usually last much longer than people expect, well past the initial large drop. \n\nThere are several catalysts for such an event such as the emergence of a virus variant that outsmarts vaccines or a collapse in the reverse repo facility. The most prominent of them however, is QE tapering (quantitative easing) and increase in interest rates. \n\nMassive QE and low interest rates have been the driving force behind this bull market. They are the justification given for the current astronomical valuation where the S&amp;P500 Shiller P/E ratio is reaching a whopping 38%! That is a historic high only second to the Dotcom bubble in 2000 (44%) and is in general an unsustainable level in the long term. \n\nSome argue that the FED will manage to taper QE and increase interest rates gradually in a very controlled manner and avoid any meltdown, but given rising inflation beyond expectations, the FED might very well be forced to act much sooner than it would like. Equities and bonds expert Ray Dalio explains this process in his most recent video on YouTube.",

        "selftext": "  [Nancy and Paul Pelosi Making Millions in Stock Trades in Companies She Actively Regulates - by Glenn Greenwald - Glenn Greenwald (substack.com)](https://greenwald.substack.com/p/nancy-and-paul-pelosi-making-millions) \n\n[Glenn Greenwald](https://greenwald.substack.com/people/18792891-glenn-greenwald)  Jul 15, 2021 \n\n**House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is** the [sixth-richest member of Congress](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/04/majority-of-lawmakers-millionaires/), according to the most recent financial disclosure statements filed in 2019. As the California Democrat has risen through party ranks and obtained more and more political power, her personal wealth has risen right along with it. Pelosi \u201chas seen her wealth increase to nearly $115 million from $41 million in 2004,\u201d [reports](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/04/majority-of-lawmakers-millionaires/) the transparency non-profit group Open Secrets. Even by the standards of wealth that define that legislative body \u2014 \"more than half of those in Congress are millionaires\u201d \u2014 the wealth and lifestyle of the long-time liberal politician and most powerful lawmaker in Washington are lavish.\n\nAnd ever since ascending to the top spot in the House, Pelosi and her husband, Paul, keep getting richer and richer. Much of their added wealth is due to extremely lucrative and \"lucky\u201d decisions about when to buy and sell stocks and options in the very industries and companies over which Pelosi, as House Speaker, exercises enormous and direct influence.\n\nThe sector in which the Pelosis [most frequently buy and sell stocks](https://housestockwatcher.com/summary_by_rep/Hon.%20Nancy%20Pelosi) is, by far, the Silicon Valley tech industry. Close to 75% of the Pelosis\u2019 stock trading over the last two years has been in Big Tech: more than $33 million worth of trading. That has happened as major legislation is pending before the House, controlled by the Committees Pelosi oversees, which could radically reshape the industry and laws that govern the very companies in which she and her husband most aggressively trade.\n\n[ Data compiled by HouseStockWatcher.com, 2020-2021 ](https://preview.redd.it/91fhr1typ0c71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69071e3b05983e6ce32ba00434fc563a568c9f8c)\n\nTo underscore the towering conflict of interest at the heart of Speaker Pelosi's self-enrichment, consider the company in which the Pelosis traded most often: Apple. Buying and selling in that one company accounted for 17.7% of the Pelosis\u2019 overall trading volume. And yet, during this same period, Pelosi held at least one private conversation with Apple CEO Tim Cook about the state of Apple and possible effects on the company from various pending bills to reform Silicon Valley.\n\nOn June 22, *The New York Times* [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/22/technology/amazon-apple-google-facebook-antitrust-bills.html?referringSource=articleShare) on \u201ca forceful and wide-ranging pushback by the tech industry since the \\[antitrust reform\\] proposals were announced this month.\u201d In particular, \u201cexecutives, lobbyists, and more than a dozen think tanks and advocacy groups paid by tech companies have swarmed Capitol offices, called and emailed lawmakers and their staff members, and written letters arguing there will be dire consequences for the industry and the country if the ideas become law.\u201d But one of the most important steps taken against these bills was a personal call placed by Apple's CEO directly to Pelosi:\n\n&gt;In the days after lawmakers\u00a0[introduced legislation](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/11/technology/big-tech-antitrust-bills.html)\u00a0that could break the dominance of tech companies, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, called Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other members of Congress to deliver a warning. . . . When Mr. Cook asked for a delay in the Judiciary Committee\u2019s process of considering the bills, Ms. Pelosi pushed him to identify specific policy objections to the measures, said one of the people.\n\nSources who refused to be identified tried to convince the *Times*\u2019 reporters that \"Ms. Pelosi pushed back on Mr. Cook\u2019s concerns about the bills.\u201d But in doing so, they confirmed the rather crucial fact that Pelosi was having personal, private conversations with the CEO of a company in which she and her husband were heavily invested and off of which they were making millions of dollars in personal wealth. And Pelosi, according to the report, asked Cook what changes were needed to avoid harming Apple and other Silicon Valley giants. Can even the hardest-core Democratic partisan loyalist justify this blatant conflict of interest and self-dealing?\n\nIndeed, all five of the Pelosis\u2019 most-traded stocks over the last two years just so happen to be the five Silicon Valley giants that would be most affected by pending legislation. Four of them \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google \u2014 were all of the companies identified by the House Antitrust Subcommittee [as being classic monopolies](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/10/house-amazon-facebook-apple-google-have-monopoly-power-should-be-split/), while the fifth \u2014 Microsoft \u2014 has sent executives to repeatedly testify before Democratic-led House committees to [defend Democrats\u2019 pending bills](https://www.axios.com/brad-smith-house-judiciary-antitrust-hearing-6148dc26-f4b3-4190-bd4d-5033a272db36.html). In other words, the Pelosis are trading stock most heavily in the exact companies whose future can be most shaped by the bills Pelosi and her lieutenants are negotiating and shepherding through Congress:\n\n[ Data compiled by HouseStockWatcher.com, 2020-2021 ](https://preview.redd.it/gbmrp8mbq0c71.png?width=1340&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c39e73f50533896a3a16defda7003f383a4abef9)\n\nBeyond that, Google \u2014 one of the companies in which the Pelosis\u2019 stock trades have made millions \u2014 is [one of the top five donors to the House Speaker](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/nancy-pelosi/summary?cid=N00007360). The wealthy couple buys and sells in Google stock, making millions. She works on bills that directly affect the future trajectory of Google. And they lavish her campaign coffers with cash, a key source of her entrenched power.\n\nMultiple times over the last several years, serious questions have been raised about stock positions taken by the Pelosis that turned out to be immensely profitable under suspicious circumstances. Perhaps the most disturbing was a [report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-07/pelosi-s-husband-locked-in-5-3-million-from-alphabet-options?srnd=premium) from *Bloomberg News* last Wednesday and [another](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/paul-pelosi-big-tech-stocks-antitrust-bills-house-judiciary) from days earlier by *Fox Business* that documented how Pelosi's husband purchased highly risky options in Google, Apple and other tech companies back in February, 2020, right before the market began plunging due to the COVID epidemic and *right before the House, led by his wife, was set to introduce new legislation to regulate those same tech companies*.\n\nYet even as the prices in several of those companies plummeted, Paul Pelosi held onto them, only to sell them last June at a massive profit. His option sales on Google alone netted more than $5 million for the couple.",

        "selftext": "Hey idiots,\n\nI\u2019ve been seeing a lot of misinformation and rumors spread about $LCID since it\u2019s introduction to the NASDAQ today. Im here to try and answer some question, clear up some of the information regarding $LCID.\n\nQ: Why am I seeing hundreds of Lucid posts and why are they posting now?\n\nA: Lucid just completed their merger and is no longer a SPAC, therefore it can finally be talked about on WSB. Not only that, but Lucid might have been the most hyped SPAC ever (correct me if I\u2019m wrong).\n\nQ: What is this scam? \n\nA: Well, no\u2026 Lucid was formerly known as Atieva, a battery and drivetrain manufacturer for formula E. They started in 2007, they later decided in 2016 that they wanted to throw their tech into a car of their own. They have been around a long time, and the Lucid team has tons of experience in the industry (Lots of ex Tesla, Porsche, Apple, Google, Lotus, etc employees)\n\nQ: Are they just another Tesla ripoff?\n\nWe\u2019ll start with a note that Tesla started in 2003 and released their first car in 2008, a similar 5 year development to that we are seeing with Lucid - 2016 - 2021 (With any luck). Lucid and Tesla are two very different companies reaching two different markets (at least for the moment). Lucid is luxury EVs whereas Tesla has a great EV for pretty much everyone. Peter Rawlinson of Lucid has stated that he intends to eventually manufacturer affordable EVs as well as their SUV (Gravity) and other cars. \n\nQ: They\u2019re way too overvalued and they have no cars on the road.\n\nA: You\u2019re right, but aren\u2019t all EVs. Rivian has an estimated valuation of 70b, despite no cars on the road. According to Lucid\u2019s timeline we should see some of the 10,000 preorders on the roads sometime around Q3.\n\nI know I missed a lot, but I can\u2019t be bothered to write more. Please add in where I missed and feel free to correct me. Not telling anyone to go out and invest everything in $LCID, just do some DD before you write a retarded comment.\n\nHappy investing.",

        "selftext": "Im an engineer, but Im also an idiot.  I literally almost flunked out cuz i was too dumb. I ended up in construction because i couldnt do anything else engineering related.  Take this opinion at your own risk because I might be talking out of my ass.  \n\nI'm in construction, specifically on the municipality side (yea im *that* city worker) so I'm the one administering the federal infrastructure funds at the ground level. To date I've administered millions in federal funds on \"infrastructure\". Infrastructure is by definition the least sexiest thing.  Everyone shits, but we'd all prefer to not deal with it, that's infrastructure.  Here are a bunch of very common sense reasons why this isnt going to cash in. \n\n* I see a lot of posts about steel, concrete and other raw materials.  Clearly these are from people who know fuck all about infrastructure.  I'd argue that if you're looking to invest into Biden's infrastructure plan you should be looking at the other end of this supply chain.  Who do you think is more profitable, the no name company that supplies the raw material for 1 component of an iphone or Apple? If youre looking to jump onto the infrastructure bandwagon, I'd be looking at construction companies or engineering firms.\n* But companies are also not a great bet. contractors and trades are specialized.  The company that paves the street is not the same one that does traffic signal upgrades.  An electrician is not going to do laborers work.  Large companies will need(either by choice or requirement) to subcontract out certain specialized portions thus diluting overall tendies. not to mention that profits are capped.  markup % is often literally defined.  \"Oh no Mr. Contractor you have a problem?  fuck you, sucks to be you\" (this is one of my favorite parts of the job). Not to mention that projects are parsed to all the states and from there into certain sizes in order to further dilute the tendies.  State and local governments may have additional requirements that even further dilute the tendies.  The government is trying boost an industry and the economy at large, not a few companies.  The literal idea of the plan is to trickle money across the country.  If you look at this fountain that slowly trickles down, if you place your cup in any one spot you're just gonna get a few drops. \n* Infrastructure means nothing because it means everything.  It could be streetlight poles in which case steel is very very relevant, or it could be a fucking sidewalk in which case steel is not important at all. If you just open your eyes when you go outside (huge ask i know) you will see that infrastructure is extremely varied. \n* Many of us with ties to the industry are feeling delays and back orders, but this is logistics related.  These issues were around before the infra plan and will remain after. I think the idea behind these \"DDs\" on raw materials is because they think this infrastructure plan will increase demand on an already limited supply thus driving prices and profits up.  Nevermind the contracting aspect of this money(a lot of it is fixed for a certain amount of time), Supply and demand still rules, but solving the global supply chain logistics will also increase supply. The supply chain logistical issues are a larger and more importantly, independent, factor.  \n* Also surprise surprise Biden's infrastructure plan, while maybe bigger, isnt special. Trump had infrastructure plans and so did Obama.  Infrastructure is ALWAYS happening.  As i said, everyone shits and it doesnt stop.  Infrastructure never stops, you can try to clench your sphincter closed and it'll work for a lil while, but eventually you shit.  Its the same thing with infrastructure spending.  Biden's plan is not the big demand surge people think it is. \n* I think a lot of people underestimate the timescale of infrastructure.  it takes time to build shit and it takes even more time to renovate shit cuz you cant just blow it up and start over. Most people cannot shit on command and those that can dont do it instantly. This aint China.  We're not gonna build a covid hospital in 48 hours( mostly cuz our work isnt made out of garbage tofu-strength concrete but that is another topic). This shit is going to take YEARS. I will see Biden infrastructure money at my level 1-2 years from now and will start spending it 3-5 years from now. Think about this, after the money is secured someone gotta design the damn thing, someone gotta the draw the picture so my dumbass who cant read can knows what is supposed to be built.  Those assholes always fuck up too and they are the smart ones!!!  This isnt even mentioning how raw material suppliers, product suppliers, construction companies, design firms, are only a part of this timescale. \n* One dude can only use 1 shovel at at time, can operate one piece of equipment at a time. The pipe maker can only make pipes so fast and those pipes can only be installed so fast.  There is no exponential factor in infrastructure like there is in tech.  An app can be downloaded millions of times in a single night. You only shit one poop at a time. \n\nTl;dr.  Infrastructure is like pooping. Everyone does it, it is always happening. Trying to cash in on infrastructure is trying to cash in on pooping. You can only poop so fast and so much, the supply demand is capped. You only shit one poop at a time.  Sure you get diarrhea sometimes but even then it has its limits. You cant cash in on analogous dry heaves. Infrastructure is regular, so in the long term investing in this industry is probably a smart move.  As long as humans are alive they are going to shit and if there are more humans tomorrow than there are today then there will be more shit, but if that is your tendie making strategy why are you even here?",

It's the only viable options play I can come up with that ends up either being indifferent to IV crush or benefitting slightly from it. From what I understand you can also go deep ITM and survive the crush just fine as the closer your Delta gets to 1 the less effect it has on you. I would be interested in learning any other viable strategies, especially a strategy that can prosper from the move itself, without having to choose up or down. Correct me if I am wrong but straddles and strangles get crushed along with straight calls and puts, correct?\n\n2) Plays\nBased on past  moves and general market sentiment, especially predicted move base on option pricing, here are my thoughts on plays I'm hoping will print for next week.

I\u2019ll grit my teeth through the risks of inflation and rising interest rates. Short term it may be rough, but long term I think it will pay off. I will not sell any of these companies.

From database to enterprise applications, Netlist serves diverse industries that require superior memory performance to empower critical business decisions in today\u2019s data-driven environment.\n\nNetlist is working to make a big deals with google, Samsung, micron and Inphi (we are talking about patent litigations) after the recent deal with Sk hynix for $640M!\n\nAbout Google\u2019s case (the most important case):\n\nHow did Google rise to the top of the search engine wars? Simple. Google cheated. A small company called Netlist in California developed some leading edge computer memory technology. That technology would let computers and servers of the day access 4 times more RAM (Random Access Memory) than the computer could normally access. Netlist met with Google regarding this technology. They showed the technology to Google in order that Google might license the technology from Netlist. Google didn't license it. Google stole it. Google copied it, had it manufactured, and used it in their servers. Google was caught with Netlist IP in their servers when the court ordered a random check of Google servers that were in operation at that time. Google, with Netlist IP, now had the fastest search engine on the Internet, and went on to leverage that speed and savings to become the giant, powerful company they are today.\n\nNetlist has battled Google for over 10 years to reclaim their intellectual property, and regain the value that their IP should have provided their bottom line and shareholders for many years. Google continued to try and run out the clock, hoping that Netlist would go out of business, or abandon the costly litigation. Netlist has abandoned nothing. Now the tables have turned and the clock is running out on Google. Google lost their latest appeal of the '912 patent at the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals (Federal Circuit), which upheld the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) affirmation of the patent's validity. Google did not appeal this ruling to the United States Supreme Court, and now the patent has been recertified by the US Patent Office. The trial in the Northern Disctrict of Califonia to determine the level of infingement, and the damages owed to Netlist by Google, has been reopened.\n\n\"For ten years Netlist has steadfastly opposed Google's misguided campaign to invalidate the \u2018912 patent,\" said Netlist's CEO, C.K. Hong. \"We are very pleased that in the end the appellate court made it clear that the claims of this seminal patent are indeed valid and in so doing, further vindicate our decade-long defense of the company's strategic intellectual property. We will now move to lift the stay in the patent infringement lawsuit against Google in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of CA., in order to recover current and past damages related to the \u2018912 patent.\"\n\nAbout Sk hynix:\n\nUS SSD and memory module supplier Netlist has prevailed in a patent infringement lawsuit against SK hynix, winning a $40m settlement, a cross-licensing deal and a supply arrangement.\n\nThe dispute concerned Netlist LRDIMM and RDIMM patents, with Netlist alleging that SK hynix used elements of those patents its own memory module products.\n\nNetlist CEO C.K. Hong said in a statement: \u201cWe are delighted with the recognition of the value of Netlist\u2019s intellectual property and very much look forward to partnering with SK hynix, a global leader in memory and storage technology.\u201d\n\nNetlist will receive a payment of $40m in connection with the entry into the License Agreement. The Supply Agreement entitles Netlist to purchase up to $600m of SK hynix memory products during its term. The companies also plan to collaborate on commercialising Netlist\u2019s HD CXL technology. This HD CXL technology refers to HybridDIMM modules, which mix NAND and DRAM, and are accessed over Computer Express Link as DRAM. Netlist supplies DIMM products to OEMs such as Dell, IBM, HP, and Apple, and has been in business for over 20 years.\n\nWaiting a lot of news by Samsung and google\u2019s cases in the next days/weeks! \n\n\n \n[Abouthegooglescase](http://googlecheatednetlist.com)",

        "selftext": "As many of you already know, a highly anticipated electric vehicle startup by the name of Lucid Motors is debuting on the public market this week. If you are not already losing your mind excited over hearing that, let me tell you why you SHOULD BE. Later this year, Lucid will begin producing and delivering their flagship car, the Lucid Air, which will become the first production electric vehicle with over 500 miles of range. Even more important than the raw range is battery efficiency, which shows Lucid as the industry leader for EV core efficiency. Yes, that\u2019s right, a small startup is the first to create an EV more efficient than Tesla. Much of this can be attributed to the leadership of CEO Peter Rawlinson (former head engineer for the Tesla Model S). His experience and expertise no doubt helped create one of the most exciting EV\u2019s to date. Lucid\u2019s battery expertise also extends to Formula E racing, as they designed, developed, manufactured and supplied batteries for all race teams in the 2019\u201320 Formula E season. By far the most exciting part of your (future) investment into Lucid Motors is the potential for an Apple Partnership. While many have debated whether or not there\u2019s any truth to the rumors, I\u2019ve compiled all the information/evidence as to why no other car manufacturer makes sense for Apple. \nFirst let\u2019s clear something up, Apple WILL release an Apple Car at some point or another. This is clear and confirmed by Apple themselves. What is also clear is that Apple does not have a car factory or plans to build one in the near future, which means they\u2019ll have to find a partner to produce it for them. The head of $CClV (now known as $LCID) Michael Klein is the mastermind behind all of this. The man who connected Saudi Arabia to Lucid (he\u2019s a top adviser to the Saudi kingdom's Public Investment Fund), Lucid to $CClV (purposely leaked the rumor back in January and forced Lucid\u2019s hand, while also having Lucid Motors board member Andrew Liveris put on the $CClV board) and finally Lucid to Apple (put Steve Jobs former right hand man and head designer at Apple Jony Ive on his board also). His connections to Apple hardly stop there, as he is a longtime friend and advisor to  Laurene Powell Jobs. Laurene has known Klein since college, even before she met her husband Steve Jobs, the late Apple co-founder and CEO. In addition to handling business affairs for Emerson Collective (her company), those familiar with Klein describe him as an informal adviser to Powell Jobs.\n\"He\u2019s kind of the final voice in Laurene\u2019s ear,\" said one source with knowledge of their relationship. In conclusion, all of the connections between Lucid Motors, $CClV, Saudi Arabia, Michael Klein, and APPLE are just simply too much to be coincidences. I firmly believe Lucid Motors third production vehicle (after the Air and the Gravity) will be a partnership with Apple to create a mass produced, luxury Apple Car. Position accordingly, it doesn\u2019t take a genius to guess where the stock is going once they publicly announce this agreement.\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR: XPO is spinning off a company - $GXO that will begin trading on NYSE on August 2, 2021.  Once spun off, GXO will become the largest pure play contract logistics provider in the world on day one. Every large company spinoff in the history of trading has unlocked huge value for shareholders. This combined with upcoming earnings on 28 July, makes this a potential multibagger, considering the stock is consolidating for last 3 months**\n\n**Company Summary**\nXPO is a global provider of transportation and supply chain solutions. It operates through two divisions - Transportation and Logistics.\n\nTransportation provides freight brokerage operations that matches shippers freight with trucking companies and last mile operations including a network of ground, air, and ocean carriers. Transportation makes 60% of company revenue.\n\nLogistics provides warehousing and inventory management services and generates 40% of the revenue for XPO.\n\nXPO is positioned to capitalize on rapid growth of e-commerce and logistics outsourcing. For last 6 quarters XPO has grown sales yoy by at least 10%\n\n**Catalysts**\n**Company Spinoff** - XPO Logistics Inc. (XPO) has announced a distribution of (New) GXO Logistics, Inc. (GXO) Common Shares. The distribution ratio is 1.0 GXO share for each XPO share held. The record date is July 23, 2021; the payable date is August 2, 2021. The NYSE has set August 2, 2021, as the ex-distribution date for this distribution\nOnce it becomes a standalone company, GXO will be the largest pure-play contract logistics provider on day one and its customers include companies like Apple, Nike etc.\n\n**Company Earnings** - 28 July after market\n\n**Why it is 10x Bagger**\nThere are 2 upcoming catalysts - First is earnings on 28 July and second is $GXO spinoff on Aug 2. Now you know, company would not have announced a spinoff just 2 days after earnings if they were not confident of hitting it out of the park. \nAnd you all know what happens when there is a stock split or spinoff, there is never a successful company out there that did a spinoff, and it did not rocket.\nAs per the CEO, post spin off, the parent company will trade in $100 - $120 starting range and spin off company $GXO will trade around $65 - $70 range.\nAs per Deutsche Bank - GXO will be around $70 out of the gate.\nThat gives an upside of at least 20 - 30% post spin off. \nCramer loves it too, what is there not to like about a logistics company especially during this ecommerce boom.\n\n**What will happen to current Options?**\nThe current options will become XPO1 and will trade by adding the price of both the companies. The strikes will remain the same.\nXPO1 = XPO + GXO\n\n**Play**\n-The stock has been trading range bound in between $140 - $150 for last 3 months and right now it's at the lowest of that range that is $140.  You can buy shares for a potential of 20 - 40% upside in next 2-3 weeks.\nor\n- You can buy $150 - $160 calls for 20 Aug for a potential multi bagger. By Aug 20 both earnings will come out and the spinoff would have happened and both companies will have decent time to do a runup. \n\n**My Position**\n $160 Calls for 20 Aug. ($79k) (700Calls)\n\n\n**Warning**\n I am degenerate like you all and I don't know shit. Do you own DD and don't trust anything from a stranger on internet. The above is no financial advice.\n\n**All the best apes, lets lose money together!**",

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: I am not trying to pump. This is not financial advice. Nonetheless, I still found this super interesting from user SCHNiiiiiKEN (not my original DD) on Microvast x Apple car\n\nThere are rumors circulating that Microvast and Apple could potentially be working together on the new apple car, and Microvast would be the lithium-ion battery producer. \n\nTo start, and this is the most convincing piece of evidence, [Microvast battery patents were cited FIVE TIMES by Apple.](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_360113942.png) \n\nHere is the specific patent site: https://patents.google.com/patent/US20130011738A1/en\n\nApple has also noted that they are looking for the exact battery technology that Microvast owns. \n\nEven more, Microvast will be established as the largest American Lithium-Ion battery maker once they finish the first production phase of their TN factory, likely to produce batteries for Oshkosh/USPS, but even potentially Apple as well. \n\nSource: https://www.theleafchronicle.com/story/news/local/clarksville/2021/02/10/clarksville-lands-220-million-microvast-plant-287-direct-jobs/4450435001/\n\n&gt;The first phase of production will fulfill the company's largest order to date, establishing Microvast as the largest American Li-ion manufacturer.\n\nAnd, to top it all off, [Apple has made it clear they want just an American LI battery maker](https://fossbytes.com/apple-wants-to-use-us-made-batteries-for-electric-car/#:%7E:text=Apple%20is%20seeking%20affordable%20yet%20good%20quality%20EV%20batteries.&amp;text=Apparently%2C%20Apple%20is%20looking%20for,manufactured%20in%20the%20U.S.%20only.). They were in talks with LG, CATL, BYD, etc, but they all fell-apart/didn't come to fruition. That would leave Microvast with the ability to meet their production requirements. \n\n&gt;Apple is looking for lithium-ion battery suppliers for its electric car to launch sometime in 2024. However, Apple wants these batteries to be manufactured in the U.S. only.\n\nIt is not like this is impossible, considering that Microvast has beaten out CATL on these contracts before. \n\nAgain, not trying to be labeled as a pumper, so please any-and-all bear discussions are welcome.",

        "selftext": "I am not a market expert but I have been observing red flags piling up recently and it\u2019s wise to pay close attention to them as they point to a near market correction including: \n\n**Low market breadth and divergence:** there are fewer stocks rising versus ones declining, and a larger number of stocks are hitting the 52 week low than the ones hitting the 52 week high. \n\n**Overbought stocks:** such as AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, and ARKK all have recently breached the 70 RSI overbought marker and are now dropping fast. This ties in well with the poor market breadth as allot of the money existing other stocks as they sell off is just pilling in few top stocks in an unstained way, hence the overbought flag. \n\n**Reduced volumes:** signal weakness in the market and provoke profit taking. For example the Russell 2000 average volume has dropped to just under 3 billion per day from a three months average of 3.7 billion. Incidentally this index tracks 2,000 small cap US companies which have been dropping for most of the last 3 weeks for a total decline of 7.3% thus far. \n\n**Major trend line broken:** for the second time in less than one month the S&amp;P 500 has dipped under its major trend line. The first time on May 18th, it reversed and went back up on the back of decent labor and production reports plus earnings expectations. Now that earnings are underway and most economic indicators are pointing to growth peaking it might not be able to reverse the drop. \n\nObviously all of the above are technical indicators that try to explain market behavior based on historical metrics, but they don\u2019t explain the reasons behind such changes. We have to look at economic news to identify causes including: \n\n**Peaking economic recovery:** several reports this month point to an economy that has reached peak recovery. For example, both the services PMI 64.6 vs 65.2 vs 64.8 (actual, forecast, previous) and ISM 60.1% vs 63.3% vs 64.0% reports for June show a declining rate of expansion. Also, industrial production is showing similar pattern 0.4% vs 0.6% vs 0.7%.\n\n**Mixed Q2 banking results:** also point to the same issue above. While the overall figures are up, the details point to absence of loan growth and net interest margin weakness. \n\n**Declining consumer sentiment:** while consumer spending came in higher than expected for the month of June consumer sentiment declined from 85.5 to 80.8. The main driver behind this is inflation.  \n\n**Inflation rising:** the FED has been harping on inflation being transitory because of the \u201cbase effect\u201d and some temporary supply constraints. Their timeline for all of that to sort out was few months. Now it\u2019s more than few months and inflation continues to rage registering the highest figures in over a decade with Core CPI (the Fed\u2019s favorite metric) registering 0.9%, the highest increase since 2008.\n\nFurthermore, the PPI (producer price index) also continues to rise at a rate of 1% in June indicating that consumers are still going to see higher prices in the coming months and that overall inflation will overshoot the FED\u2019s 2% threshold by a wide margin. \n\n**Reemergence of a new variant:**  the delta variant is causing allot of lock downs and interruption throughout the world. While its effect in the US might be limited, a slowing world economy does not bode well for stocks in general, hence perhaps the reason why bonds have gone up. \n\n**Bond yields going down:** usually indicates that an economy is slowing and investors are looking for safer assists. Many have pointed out that bond yields usually peak 3 months in advance of the stock which they did in March. Since we are in July and bond yield continue to decline many think the bond market is sniffing out something and reacting to it. Remember, the inverse relation between bonds and yields. \n\n**China\u2019s Crack on tech:** has rattled some investors especially that it came at a time when that market was showing sign of bottoming out. \n\nAll of those events point to a possible correction sometime in the near future. Most experts expect that sometime after Q2 earnings, but it could be starting as we speak, especially that corrections don\u2019t play out in one straight line. They tend to move in a series of several lower lows and lower highs until bottoming out. \n\nIt\u2019s important to also point out that a correction is not a market crash. Corrections are a much smaller event, ranging around a -10% drop on the low end for the leading S&amp;P 500 index and much more for individual speculative stocks. They are a healthy event that helps reinvigorate the market with new buyers. \n\nA crash on the other hand is a much larger event that\u2019s usually provoked by a combination of events or a single major event. Crashes usually last much longer than people expect, well past the initial large drop. \n\nThere are several catalysts for such an event such as the emergence of a virus variant that outsmarts vaccines or a collapse in the reverse repurchase facility. The most prominent of them however, is QE tapering (quantitative easing) and increase in interest rates. \n\nMassive QE and low interest rates have been the driving force behind this bull market. They are the justification given for the current astronomical valuation where the S&amp;P500 Shiller P/E ratio is reaching a whopping 38%! That is a historic high only second to the Dotcom bubble in 2000 (44%) and is in general an unsustainable level in the long term. \n\nSome argue that the FED will manage to taper QE and increase interest rates gradually in a very controlled manner and avoid any meltdown, but given rising inflation beyond expectations, the FED might very well be forced to act much sooner than it would like. Equities and bonds expert Ray Dalio explains this process in his most recent video on YouTube.",

        "selftext": "# INTRO - I have a feeling this week is going to be another good week for the major indices and tech. I do believe most inflation fears are priced in, have been for some time, and for the most part this is an ordinary summer. The 10 year bond has dropped right around 1.35% which will indicate what sectors we should be investing in. It seems like the lower it goes, the better tech and growth do. Traditionally cheaper money benefits these companies that carry a lot of paper. I'm not expecting any major changes on this front. Yet, I am getting ready to take profits on longer term positions and move somethings around in preparation for a bigger dip in September or August that I've been writing about for some time now.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TODAY** \\- Good start to the week as the markets across the board set fresh all time highs! My portfolio is up over $10k. \n\nYear-to-date gains in the S&amp;P and NASDAQ are at 18% and 15% respectively and even though I am expecting a pull back after the summer, there is still more room to run towards the end of the year.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qyshhp5qhva71.png?width=1121&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3083deb40b7fda498d29d0a0210c0fae1727e8f2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI do think that $**AAPL** will pull back, unfortunately for my LEAPS, however if it does getting into another position closer to the 180 MA is beneficial. There is no real guarantee that **AAPL** will recede all the way back down, giving up all the gains from the last couple weeks, however September is usually a horrible month for **AAPL**. In case, I will be prepared.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hueebk7gva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=041dbab8f67ee16ac8a4f70f33077a0da02f66fe\n\nNext on the list of new alerts is $**ROKU**. I am not that bullish on **ROKU** and agree with Morgan Stanley giving it a sell rating. If it does rise up to the resistance trend line, it will be almost all time high. I like puts at this point.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zluyryg9gva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=438bd1a0b0657f12fa519bbfcca854a7037cf609\n\n **MSFT,** like AAPL, has ran up a great bit the last few weeks. Currently most indicators are showing levels of over bought. I don't want to buy puts or short **MSFT**, but if it does pull back toward the support, which it has bounce many times before, I'm a buyer.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eizxl02bgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dafe6828303bbb45e245d62ce41b5e3b96fddebc\n\n \n\n$**X** is an interesting play that I would consider pretty safe. Of course everyone has heard of lumber and the inflation that is kicking up prices. Housing prices are skyrocketing around the country and possible rents will be too. If **X** can pull back to the 180 MA I believe that is a very good level of support to buy at. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8gfx26ocgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1182f1a0fe2cb4c0b178b0c7d12dced37615662\n\n**ArcelorMittal,** together with its subsidiaries, owns and operates steel manufacturing and mining facilities in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Africa. This is another steel and mining play for me. Over the past 10 years August has been the worst month of the year for $**MT**. I'll wait for a dip and hopefully buy mid to long term calls around the strong support, and if that breaks maybe the 180ma.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zj34ylcegva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a5bfcef576a2b806338bcb9c02450be11de0a50\n\n**Vertiv Holdings Co**, together with its subsidiaries, designs, manufactures, and services critical digital infrastructure technologies and life cycle services for data centers, communication networks, and commercial and industrial environments in the Americas, the Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. $**VRT** is essentially a data center and tech infrastructure play that I believe is overbought currently. **VRT** seems to be riding up towards the key resistance that it cant seem to cross, dating back to last year, 2020. I prefer puts here and take profit around the 50ma.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zsypjnrfgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f33a77fe41d1a3e7dbd7dd023eb713799d92c732\n\n $**AI** is a company that, you guessed it, develops AI products. I think the ticker is really, really cool, but that's about it. I believe most of the hype probably comes from that and we can see that it sold off enormously earlier this year. Once it is up to the resistance, let's play puts back down to the big volume shelf that is providing support.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8mcbb9zggva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77e515bbde6d723ae5393c1744951a6cf5198818\n\n $**TNA** is a leveraged 3X ETF that follows the Russell 2000 small cap index. Small caps are more risky that large caps, of course, but usually out perform them as well. I would like to add this to my portfolio, most likely, in September to set up for a run into the holiday months. Shares are fine with me since it is leveraged.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m2yx6z0igva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e335354f9e074313436e30d2ad0e0a28f955aaf\n\n $**BIDU** alert that triggered late Friday. If $**BIDU** continues an upward push, through the support, I'll pick up some calls a couple months out. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lwtjr5njgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bbe7a38958435b63b0b7ceb1e43d8bd514936bd\n\n $**COIN** is my favorite BTC/Crypto stock play. It is the most reliable and regulated crypto exchange in the US. I think all the institutional investors will be using **COIN** for crypto exposure. I also don't think that the stock price should follow that of BTC. Even if BTC is down for the month, there is still selling volume taking place on **Coinbase**, there fore incoming revenue. Overall, I like this stock. If it pulls back to the MA, I think its a good entry and addition to your portfolio if you want crypto exposure.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ymaldxhlgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=289f1e4d9130c1134ea952d51fa06158bd9c0d54\n\n If you are like me and waiting of a bigger pull back/correction before situating your portfolio for a bigger run toward the end of 2021, I'll be taking profits in some of my positions and needing a place to park the money in the interim. I've identified a few that could be good for this. First is **VTV,** Vanguard Value ETF. It is a ETF that is focused on Value stock play and has a Dividend yield of more than 2%. It is usually considered a 'safe' place to park money. Some top holdings include, BERK, JPM, XOM, JNJ, UNH, and PG.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2dcxclpmgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03de8f2f07a832d6042fbbff5c6b5298ad3438b0\n\n Another one is **SCHD**, also has a Dividend yield of over 2%. Some of Schwab Div Yields top holdings are MRK, TXN, HD, PEP, and VZ.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f5o5q8nngva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f597984b4adabd4f6417c313c57576644024f6ee\n\n Another interesting addition to your portfolio could be **XHB**. It is a homebuilders ETF. There has been huge demand for new SF homes in the US, and **XHB** and NAIL have done very well this year with the inflation trade. I don't expect demand to considerably change anytime soon. I always buy on support, so patience is key until **XHB** pulls back a little bit more.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8vck4xogva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9dd3c23232ccdc439a93b7dd9f2d20c7a808955\n\n **DIS** just released Black Widow and did very very well this weekend. Overall I like what the company is doing with **Disney**\\+ and in Shanghai they are raising the ticket prices for the newest Disney theme park. Be careful when buying this for two reasons. One, a lot of good news could already be priced in - and probably is. Two, August through October have been horrible months for **DIS** over the past 10 years. If you are a **DIS** bull, buying on the 180MA is your best bet for now.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6lorao9qgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dc8230c7f288c8d06b14df0d824a8b18bb69346\n\n \n\n**$TASK** provides outsourcing services to Internet companies worldwide. It offers digital customer experience that consists of omni-channel customer care services primarily delivered through digital channels; and other solutions, including customer care services for new product or market launches, trust and safety solutions, and customer acquisition solutions.\n\nAll of the major analysts, except Morgan Stanley have a 'buy' rating for the stock. I personally like their vision and what they are doing. Their IPO wasn't long ago and there isn't much data out so far, however I think there is upside toward $40+. Currently I want to buy commons sub $30 if the opportunity comes, or sell puts if options are enabled on Webull. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8nyyk4gxgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34c0a89f71fe2bc1ecd0fb7aad3ddd8bd81e7574\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Current Weekly Positions\n\n$NAIL \\-6.8% (Ongoing Swing Trade)\n\n$DIDI \\+$550 Sell $10.5p (+45%) (Ongoing)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nDisclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.",

        "selftext": "This company is revolutionary, not just on products but it\u2019s service.\n\nHave any of you even seen NIO day and the enormous mass following on this company? Its walking in the footsteps of Apple. There are some people VOLUNTEERING to be a part of this. \n\nFrom its beginnings NIO has established epic foundations. Winning formula E and developing a super car (EP9) holding a lap record around the Nurburgring, more than once, might I add. Take a look at NIO House in Beijing - it is the epitome of what NIO represents. It\u2019s a lifestyle beyond the car. \n\nNIO cars will soon have a 1000km solid state battery and incase that isn\u2019t enough then feel free to visit one of the 300+ battery swap stations (increasing every day), 300000 fast charging stations over multiple cities in China or simply use power home 2.0. A swap station will have a fully charged battery in your car in 3minutes. They have now competed well over TWO MILLION SWAPS! This tech, while slower to scale than super chargers, is exactly what the EV market is lacking. This is one the greatest stigmas for EV, having to WAIT on your battery charging and worry about degradation. Imagine the continued scope for new service plans and flowing revenues with this model. EYE WATERING. You can walk into a NIO Space and save yourself 11k straight off the bat. We live in a subscription generation folks. Oh, and don\u2019t forget a healthy tapped 2nd hand car market. Encore - Sinopec. \n\nAs for the new ET7 sedan - Nio Partnered with NVIDIA to put their DRIVE Orin-powered supercomputer dubbed ADAM into their car. This supercomputer, will feature four high performance Orin SoCs in each of its EVs to achieve an industry leading performance of 1,000+ TOPS!!  Let  me translate: that\u2019s equivalent to 7, yes you read that correctly - SEVEN -Tesla FSD computers. \n\nA total of 11 8MP cameras, a 1,550nm LiDAR sensor, five mmWaveRad, 12 USS and two GPS / IMU as well as one V2X and one A.D.M.S sensor are installed in the NIO ET7.\n\nAquila, is the name for the first high resolution camera (8 MP) that is installed in a vehicle. In comparison, Tesla uses a 1.2 MP camera. The higher resolution and display enables the NIO ET7 to recognize objects and obstacles at a greater distance and to let the system react accordingly. NIO underpins this with numbers, so the system is able to recognize vehicles at a distance of 687 meters; Tesla at 229 meters. Traffic cones would be seen at a distance of 262 meters (Tesla 87 meters) and people at a distance of 223 meters (Tesla 74 meters).\n\nAs I said before, you also buy into a service as much as a car with NIO. LIFETIME FREE ROAD SIDE ASSISTANCE. LIFE TIME FREE CAR CONNECTIVITY. UNLIMITED ON THE SPOT TYRE REPAIR &amp; BACKUP CHARGING CALL OUTS. LIFETIME WARRANTY WITH NO MILEAGE LIMITS. Oh, did I mention NIO house? What\u2019s Tesla doing? **tumbleweed**\n\nAs for the market - do any of you truly understand how underpinning the success of a company is with the power of the Asian market? It\u2019s ENORMOUS. It\u2019s economy is now bigger than America, 30-40% of Tesla cars are sold here and with good reason. The demand is unprecedented. The supply simply can\u2019t meet it. There\u2019s room for both but Nio will dominate China and make waves in Europe and America. Heck, it would be immensely great with the Asian market alone. They now have over 1.5million active users on the NIO app, which was recently ranked No. 1 with the highest score of 4.5 stars on a list among 20 other mainstream automakers. This is a beautiful community. NIOs relations executive - Chavin Shens thoughts: \u201cBuying a car is a less frequent activity than taking a flight or shopping at a supermarket. So we need to create more everyday activities to keep customers in touch.\u201d\n\nLoyalty and rewards, my friends. \n\nTesla is severely lacking in build quality. Off-set panelling, windows not fitted properly, seats that wear down faster than toilet paper and some dodgy paint jobs along the way. JAC motors builds NIO cars and they are well renowned for quality being associated with VW. NIO has research and development, design, manufacturing and offices in San Jose, Munich, London, Shanghai as well as eight other locations. They are employing and working with some of the greatest talent on this planet. Kris Tomasson - NIO VP of design - This guy was literally a global director at Coca Cola. GLOBAL. AND the Head of exterior design at BMW. What a complete powerhouse (no pun intended). \n\nBTW - Yes, NIO isn\u2019t Tesla. NIO is taking is on completely different stance. It\u2019s NIO within its own right. \n\nBelieve or not I do love Tesla, I\u2019m a massive fan! Elon is a visionary and I\u2019d love to be riding shotgun to Mars one day! But don\u2019t let that blind sight you from the uprising of perhaps one the biggest companies in the world. Infact...it already is. \n\nTo summarise folks, what we are witnessing here is the best EV and lifestyle company in the making, bar none, that offers cutting edge technologies and innovations along with customer experience and satisfaction at its core business objectives. The impact of double shifts at JAC will start coming into fruition and before you know it NEO park will have eye watering production. Imagine 500k to 1million NIO cars/year. The Chinese government has backed NIO in more ways than one - subsidising AND bailing them out in times of birthing need. The writing is literally on the wall for ICE cars. NIO will keep delivering, keep breaking records and keep bringing world class innovation. \n\nFurther translation for smooth aped brains out there: THE STONK GOES UP. \n\nFurther translation for super smoother aped brains: Rocket ship to the moon.\n\nFurther translation for super smoothed aped brains that lack several cognitive abilities such as literacy and the ability to plan, solve problems, think abstractly and comprehend complex ideas:\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\u2026.\ud83c\udf13",

        "selftext": "Part of me has never been more confident in the future of the semiconductors. At the same time I am worried Wall Street will be unimpressed with future earnings. A company can make a bazillion dollars in profit but if they say one bad thing then Wall Street throws a fit. \n\nRegardless of what Wall Street thinks, the future of technology is dependent on semiconductor chips. \n\nFor example Micron (MU). I thought their earnings call was very positive. They had a huge beat on earnings and it sounds like their future is very bright. The CEO made is clear that as cloud storage and EV vehicle usage increase in the coming years it will be very beneficial to Micron. The future of technology relies on cloud storage and the future of transportation is electric and computerized. Its concerning that MU went down over 5% on heavy volume today. Sure looks like a heavy resistance. \n\nThen you have Nvidia (NVDA). Arguably the industry leader and growing like crazy. They are still waiting on approval on the Arm deal which I would expect to go through. It recently brokeout HUGE. I mean what? Up 21% in one month for a company that size? Thats unreal. \n\nAMD just recently broke its trading range and on its way to 100. I am concerned that volume was not as big as it was when it broke through but the catalyst of the Xlyinx deal going through should be enough? Its apparent AMD is beating Intel in their sub-sector and Intel is over 100 billion large in market cap. Will AMD be able to continue the breakout? I dont know why they wont be able to. \n\nTSM has been consolidating for awhile. I cant see any reason it would break to the down side except for a hostile take over of Taiwan by China. Then either its game on between China or the US or the US backs down like they probably will cause, I mean it would be bad business for Apple, Starbucks, Tesla, Costco, and other American companies trying to grow in China. \n\nHow are all of you approaching this situation? If youre not thinking about this industry as a 6 month to 1 year play then idk what I am doing. I got call options on AMD and Mu expiring in October and December and a few in March of next year.",

        "selftext": "Alright retards, put down your peanutbutter and tuna sandwiches and listen up.\n\nFor too long there\u2019s been a load of DD about $CRSR on here, a lot of it is just parroting the same old points over and over again, giving only bullish sentiment and rocket emojis without any insight into the actual gaming industry.\n\nHopefully my DD will give you a better understanding of where $CRSR fits into the gaming market. This DD is meant to be balanced, all DD should have bearish points and bullish points imo, so this is not the DD to fuel your conformation bias, sorry, but maybe you'll get slightly aroused at certain points \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAs for my experience - I\u2019ve been gaming for the last 20+ years playing many different types of games. I actually have a degree in Computer &amp; Video Games but don\u2019t work in the sector these days. But I\u2019m still a keen gamer and build gaming rigs, and game on PS5 as well.\n\nI\u2019d also like to point out from the start that I really like Corsair. I own shares and do build PCs using their components. They are not my go-to choice for every component, and i'll explain why later in this DD.\n\nAs always, this isn\u2019t financial advice, it\u2019s the ramblings of someone who\u2019s spent too long scouring the internet for a 3200mhz stick of memory. I\u2019ve also done a TL;DR at the end with nice bullet points for those knuckle-dragging retards who can\u2019t read more than a few paragraphs at a time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Corsair has been smashing earnings\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this so many times before in other DDs so I won\u2019t focus on it too much but it\u2019s good for perspective. The rate at which Corsair has been increasing its revenue is pretty impressive.\n\nIn their Q1 2021 earnings, they reported **net revenue of $529.4 million**, which is a year-over-year **increase of 71.6%**\n\nTheir gamer and creator peripherals segment **net revenue was $175.9 million**. A huge **increase here of 131.9%**\n\nCorsair\u2019s gaming and components segment also grew, with a **51.9% increase to $353.5 million**.\n\nClearly the demand for Corsair products is there, with increasing demand, increasing revenues and profit. Most expect Corsair to beat earnings again in their Q2 report next week.\n\nTheir market share is also impressive, with (by Corsair's own claims and from research from NPD Group) a total component market share of 41.9% and about 20% for peripherals. I can\u2019t seem to find very recent market share figures since IPO, since you need to pay for market analysis and I\u2019m a peasant who can\u2019t afford it, but from what I can find Corsair is:\n\n**1st** in Keyboards\n\n**3rd** in Mice\n\n**4th** in Gaming headsets\n\n**2nd** in Streaming gear\n\n**1st** in High performance memory\n\n**1st** in Cases\n\n**1st** in PSUs (power supplies)\n\n**1st** in Cooling solutions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# How does Corsair fit into the gaming market?\n\nAs you probably know, the gaming market is a fucking behemoth. It\u2019s bigger than the music and movie markets combined, and is only getting bigger.\n\nThe pandemic has further fuelled this market, with new gamers joining as they were sat around at home and needed something to do that wasn\u2019t jacking off. So they built epic RGB gaming rigs. I think these new customers will stick around in the industry for years to come. Building a PC is a bit like smoking crack, your current rig doesn\u2019t quite achieve the maximum FPS possible, so you\u2019re always on the look out for the next component that will give you a slight boost, you\u2019re always chasing that high.\n\nThe PC building market and console market vary widely in terms of generational changes. With consoles, you get a change of console generation, most people buy the new one all at the same time or within the same year or two. With PC building, gamers will be constantly upgrading bits and pieces of their rig to keep it up to date, there's no seismic generational shift like there is with consoles. It\u2019s rare for gamers to throw an entire gaming rig away and build from fresh.\n\nCorsair is a mid-tier component maker. Their products fit into the \u2018not the cheapest, but not the most expensive\u2019 category. This is the same in terms of quality, performance and reliability - they offer good quality products that have decent reliability and the performance is usually pretty good. In some cases, as I\u2019ll mention later, their products are basically identical to other manufacturers. This mid-level position in the market is probably one of the reasons they make it to the number 1 spot in terms of sales for several component categories. Gamers want good bang-for-buck and decent reliability when it comes to components. They spend hours and hours researching this, and usually know exactly what they are buying, if it's a good deal, and if it's going to perform the way they want it to.\n\nAlso it's important to point out that the term *best components* is a relative and sometime subjective term. Taking price out of the equasion, the *best* component is the one that works in your rig to deliver maximum performance and not cause a bottleneck. Sometimes it's a cheaper one, sometimes it's a more expensive one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Who is the Corsair customer?\n\nThe Corsair customer is a mid-tier (and sometimes high-tier) PC rig builder. Younger teenagers/kids often use Corsair as their marketing and branding appeals to them. They love RGB fans, and Corsair basically puts RGB in absolutely everything, these days even on RAM sticks and built into the GPU cables. Console gamers are also included in this customer base, mostly for headsets and streaming gear.\n\nThe extreme ultra-nerd PC builder who spends hours and hours pouring over spec sheets and benchmarks might not use Corsair unless there was a reason related specifically to their build like compatibility with other components, or perhaps a part was on offer at their chosen retailer. Have a look at some build guides online and a lot of the time their no-holds-barred builds often won\u2019t include Corsair components, or only one or two. There are so many variables that go into building a PC, it\u2019s not just a case of buy whatever components you like the look of. It all has to work together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The misconceptions of Corsair\n\n**The first misconception of Corsair is that their components and products are the absolute best in the industry** \\- the ultimate in luxury component, the \u2018Apple\u2019 of gaming if you will.\n\nCorsair is mostly a mid-tier component maker. Their components are good value for money, work well and are reliable but there are companies out there that make higher quality components, some that make lower quality ones and some that make pretty much identical ones.\n\nThe components market is extremely crowded, there are a lot of companies competing for the same margins on the same products: NZXT, CoolerMaster, Noctua, G.Skill, Fractal are just a few of the dozens of companies in this space. I'll go over the competitors later in this DD.\n\nOnce you start to peel back the surface of the gaming market, you\u2019ll realise that actually a lot of these companies are pretty much the same in terms of the products they sell. In some cases the spec is almost identical and in reality some of the time it doesn\u2019t really matter what brand of component you put in your rig (as long as its not a cheap knock-off), the performance will be roughly the same, or in many cases identical. For example, the Corsair Hydro Hxxxi series are basically the exact same products as the NZXT Kraken X series, just with a different fan arrangement, branding, exterior LED arrangement and exterior shroud.\n\n**This leads me neatly onto my second misconception that Corsair has a massive moat.** Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t have a huge moat against the other companies in the component space in terms of actual products that compete or compare with each other. The acquisition of Elgato was a nice move, though, and in the streaming market does give them an edge over some other competitors with an expanded product lineup. But in terms of their moat over other component manufacturers, in some cases, they don't have one at all.\n\n**The third misconception of Corsair is that gamers have extreme brand loyalty towards specific component manufacturers.** Gamers usually want one thing when building a rig: the absolute maximum performance for their budget. Looks and RGB often come secondary to this.\n\nWhile some gamers do have some brand loyalty (particularly some of the younger kids who are less experienced at building rigs) and Corsair strengths in branding and advertising help this, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s *extreme* brand loyalty amongst gamers who build their own rigs and have spent years doing so. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen someone who exclusively built their rig with Corsair components because they specifically wanted to out of brand loyalty, except [Linus from Linus Tech Tips on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEIKFxHzzac&amp;t=194s), which was a paid-for sponsor by Corsair.\n\nThe price is an important factor here, and in many cases gamers will just buy a stick of RAM, for example, from one manufacturer over another simply because the price is different, or the specific stick is on offer at the time they build their rig. They also might be limited to what kind of AIO cooler they can get due to the other components they are using such as the size restrictions in their case. There's a lot of variables that go into making a sale right then and there, and a lot of the time Corsair doesn't stand-out as the absolute leader in some components that warrant gamers spending the extra money if their parts are more expensive at that given moment in time.\n\nI would say there is more brand loyalty around core components of a rig - like CPU or GPU.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Some Corsair components aren\u2019t actually made by Corsair\n\nCorsair doesn\u2019t actually manufacturer all its components. Many of their products are actually OEM products, rebranded and built by another manufacturer.\n\nCorsair AIO CPU coolers are all made by either Asetek or CoolIT.\n\nCorsair PSUs are made by Seasonic, GreatWall, Flextronics, CWT or Chicony.\n\nCorsair RAM have chips made by Samsung, Micron or SK Hynix.\n\nSo what does this mean? Generally it means that there is often minimal or no difference between some products that are sold under many brands within the PC component market. Gamers will often say \u201cLook at the underlying product, rather than the brand\u201d when comparing two almost identical products. You could compare a Seasonic PSU to a Corsair PSU, and end up finding that they are actually almost identical, and underneath it\u2019s actually just a Seasonic PSU with a Corsair logo slapped on it.\n\nNow this isn\u2019t always the case, OEM rebrands are not always an identical item, the end brand may  modify the products they take from OEM before selling it to the customer. They can also request specific changes to an OEM part from the manufacturer. In some cases this can change the performance of the component, for example using different fans on an AIO cooler can cause performance increases/decreases depending on how said fans displace air through the radiator fins.\n\nThis is seen a lot with GPUs - for example Nvidia release a \u2018Founders Edition\u2019 of all their cards which is basically the standard card. Then all the GPU manufacturers such as MSI, Gigabyte, ASUS, Zotac etc will built their on shrouds and fan arrays onto the cards, with their own branding and brand-specific features. The base card and chip are always the same, but there can be slight performance differences between the cards in terms of active cooling and power consumption.\n\nBut rebranding OEM parts doesn\u2019t mean the quality of the part is reduced, and this doesn\u2019t seem to be the case with Corsair.\n\nWhat OEM parts can do though, in the case of Corsair, is reduce its moat. For some products Corsair has little to no edge over the competition, and often if you go onto some of the PC building subreddits and compare an OEM Corsair PSU (made by Seasonic) and an actual Seasonic PSUs, most of the replies will suggest buying the Seasonic one since Seasonic are the original manufacturer. There are arguably slightly better offerings from Seasonic vs Corsair in terms of PSUs in some instances, even though the underlying product is similar, with better warrenties if something goes wrong in the future. Being the original manufacturer seems to also hold some value amongst gamers.\n\nTo further this, in some cases, you can cut out Corsair alltogether and go direct to the manufacturer to get almost the exact same product - this is the case with AIO Coolers, you can build-your-own direct from Asetek. Gamers don't usually do this, many of them probably never heard of Asetek, they are an OEM so don't really target end-consumers, their customer is companies like Corsair.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Corsair\u2019s branding and marketing\n\nBy this point in the DD you're probably asking why Corsair has some products that have absolutely no moat, but are still best-sellers. And here is one way that Corsair shines over its competition: branding, marketing, collaboration and visability.\n\nThey sponsor eSports tournaments, give away free kit to increase exposure and work with streamers to increase brand awareness. Also just look at their website, it's head-and-shoulders above many of their competitors in terms of functionality, look and feel.\n\nTheir targeted marketing seems to be paying off. With collaborations and sponsorship with YouTubers, targeting younger audiences with their stylish, colourful branding and RGB unicorn puke, I think Corsair can continue to lead the market in terms of sales by continuing their marketing.\n\nCorsair is not new to the gaming space, it was founded way back in 1994, so this long term pedigree in the market place definitly helps with their visability.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Corsair\u2019s competitors\n\nCorsair has a lot of competitors. Dozens of companies compete in the PC gaming space. Corsair is somewhat unique in the way that you can basically build an entire PC almost exclusively from Corsair components, so it doesn\u2019t have a direct like-for-like competitor in that sense, but there are many, many competitors who compete with them for specific components.\n\n**Logitech - Peripherals and streaming gear**  \nCorsair and Logitech compete over peripherals and streaming kit. Logitech is often compared to Corsair on this sub, probably because it\u2019s one of the only other companies relating to gaming that trades on the stock market, but they are actually pretty different companies, with different target markets and different products. While Logitech does target gamers for some products, it also has a substantial \u2018productivity\u2019 target - peripherals for people working from home or in the office, in creative fields and so on. Personally I don't find the two companies *that* comparable, but they do compete in some product lines so have added them here.\n\n**Razer - Peripherals, cases, pre-built desktops**  \nIn terms of peripherals, Razer, Corsair and Logitech often compete for the top three spots on any \u2018Best gaming keyboards/mice this year\u2019 blog post. They make similarly good quality peripherals, but often where Razer falls down is their QA and longevity. They are often slightly more expensive than Corsair, many say Razer is \u2018style over substance\u2019. They also compete for the headsets portion of the console market.\n\nPeripherals in general are very subjective, everyone has differing opinions on which one they prefer in terms of quality, usability and comfort so other than looking at sales figures, it's pretty hard to figure out which supplier produces the *best* peripherals.\n\nIn terms of their hardware, though, Razer are allegedly somewhat unreliable in that aspect, with users complaining of poor QA issues. Razer compete with Corsair for PC cases, which they offer two choices - a full sized ATX and a Mini-ATX. Recently Razer also entered the pre-built market, with the Tomahawk Gaming Desktop, a small-form-factor pre-built rig.\n\nRazer in general are pretty expensive, targeting the high-end gamer who has money to burn. You could argue that Razer is the Apple of the gaming world, with stylish ultra-expensive laptops. Judging by user reports online though, their QA and performance doesn't quite live up to the price tag.\n\n**Turtle Beach - Headsets**  \nCorsair and Turtle Beach compete directly with gaming headsets. This is not PC specific, console gamers will also buy headsets from either of these suppliers.\n\nMany say Turtle Beach is massively undervalued, it does trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker HEAR. Personally I find their headsets disappointing, I own one and it was expensive, not comfortable to wear, the audio quality isn\u2019t great and has a cheap plasticy feel. That\u2019s just my opinion though, they are a popular choice amongst many gamers.\n\n**NZXT - Components and pre-built gaming rigs**  \nI feel like NZXT is one of the closer \u2018all-round\u2019 competitors of Corsair. While they don\u2019t sell all the products that Corsair offers, they do sell cases, AIO coolers &amp; fans, PSUs, RGB lighting and recently motherboards (which Corsair don\u2019t offer at all).\n\nTheir products are good quality, their cases are nicely designed, popular and easy to build in. NZXT also have started selling pre-built rigs, like Corsair, to add further revenue streams.\n\nIn my opinion NZXT could be one of the main rivals to look out for in terms of a major competitor in coming years, because they could increase their product lines to compete more directly with everything Corsair does.\n\nIn some cases, as I\u2019ve described previously, NZXT and Corsair products are almost exactly the same. The AIOs sold by both companies are actually manufactured OEM by Asetek, with changes to the fans, exterior shroud and so on, but the underlying product is pretty similar/the same in some cases.\n\n**Seasonic - PSUs**  \nAs i've mentioned elsewhere in this DD, Seasonic actually produce some of Corsair's PSUs, they are an OEM supplier. Seasonic make some of the best PSUs in the industry, in terms of quality, reliability and customer support (i.e. warrenties etc). This quality does filter down to Corsair's OEM PSU units, but many gamers will reccomend going to the original manufacturer when buying a PSU.\n\nIt's worth noting that when gamers buy a Corsair PSU, some of the money they pay for it goes directly to Seasonic (depending on model, Corsair gets its OEM PSUs from multiple suppliers depending on the model). I don't know the exact margin figures for these PSUs, so can't make a judgement on if this positive or negative (i.e. does Corsair make a tiny margin on their PSUs becuase they give the OEM manufacturer most of the money of the sale, or do they actually make better margins than manufacturing them in-house becuase it's costly to do so).  \n\n\n**A few other competitors in the component space**  \n**Fractal Design** \\- They make cases and a few AIO CPU coolers which are OEM made by Alphacool.\n\n**CoolerMaster** \\- Makes keyboard, mice, cases, AIO coolers (they are a main manufacturer), air fans, monitors.\n\n**Noctua** \\- They compete directly with Corsair in terms of air cooling. Corsair recently started offering the A500, a fan CPU cooler for those who didn\u2019t want to use AIO cooling, but it doesn\u2019t perform as well as many cheaper or equally priced Noctua or Deepcool competing products. In some instances a decent Noctua air cooler will outperform a Corsair AIO cooler for less money.\n\n**G.Skill** \\- Compete with Corsair on RAM. G.Skill are often used in high-end rigs, with built-in RGB, decent clock speeds and some of their sticks are ultra-low-latency for maximum performance. This RAM is quite popular at the moment, I regularly see it in build videos on YouTube.\n\n**Crucial** \\- Compete with Corsair on RAM. Crucial can be a slightly more budget choice, some of their sticks are bare, without RGB or fancy heatsinks, but their performance and reliability is good.\n\n**Kingston, Patriot, HyperX** \\- Compete with Corsair on RAM at mixed prices and performance levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Revenue increases during the pandemic - a one-off?\n\nOne of the main reasons for Corsairs current sideways trading, in my opinion, is the uncertainty that has come from the pandemic.\n\nSome analysts and investors have taken this huge revenue rise in the last year or so as a \u2018one-off\u2019 caused by the pandemic. To a certain extent, I\u2019d argue that this is correct. The pandemic did cause a huge influx of customers into the sector in general.\n\nThe real test for Corsair here will be if they can continue to grow their revenue after the pandemic is completely over. It does look positive, with their revenue continuing to climb in their recent January 2021 earnings report. I feel that in the short-term we may see a slight slow in revenue growth, but over the long term it will continue to increase. The customers that built their first PC during the pandemic won\u2019t go anywhere.\n\nFor that reason, Corsair is a long term hold. It\u2019s possible we will see some sharp rises as the result of earnings announcements, for example if they absolutely obliterate the estimates to the point where no-one expected it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# How can Corsair grow?\n\nGrowth (of products, not revenue growth), is something that can hold back the share price. Many of the products Corsair sells might not see any further innovation. For example, a CPU air or AIO cooler is pretty much as good as it gets these days, it's unlikely we will see that many technological improvements in this area, so gamers have less of an incentive to upgrade. Cases is another one - you can literally keep PC cases for a decade without ever needing to change it.\n\nFor other components, however, there are more tech improvements. RAM is one of them - DDR5 memory will be coming out this year. This could offer further incentives to gamers to upgrade other components while they upgrade to DDR5 RAM. However, the changeover for RAM usually takes years, as we saw in the past with DDR4 RAM when it came out, so gamers might not all rush out to buy new sticks as soon as it comes out. Often the clock speeds on launch are often slower than later on in the generational cycle, and the prices are expensive so it's likely those top-tier gamers with high-end rigs who will upgrade their RAM at release but many mid-level gamers will wait a bit before upgrading.\n\nContinuing doing what they are doing in terms of increasing revenue through existing product sales might not cut it in this instance. As i\u2019ve mentioned elsewhere in this post, their moat for many products isn\u2019t big, and in some cases non-existent, and I feel like many institutions and analysts have looked at this during their research, and it's made them uneasy. Future mergers and acquisitions could be the key. They\u2019ve already acquired Elgato, which gave them a foothold in the streaming market, and acquired Origin to be able to sell pre-built rigs.\n\nThey also released the Corsair One a few years ago, a pre-build compact workstation/gaming PC. It has had a pretty decent reception from some of the online reviews. Although most PC custom builders turn up their noses at pre-builts, and yes you can build a superior performing rig yourself, they have a place in the market in my opinion. \n\nThere are plenty of gamers out there who want a decent gaming PC that's simple, compact, good looking and high performing, but don't want the hassle of learning about all the components and figuring out how to put it together. They also want the warranty that comes with a pre-built, and the ease and peace-of-mind that comes with sending it back to Corsair if it breaks. Corsair seem to have a pretty decent returns policy regarding this too - they will pay for the courier service both ways, you can drop it into a physical repair center and will even send you fresh packaging if you threw yours away when you bought the rig initially.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The elephant in the room\n\nYep, the elephant in the room is EagleTree. EagleTree Capital is the major shareholder of Corsair, and has helped them grow for the last 4 years or so. At one point they held over 60% of the shares of the company, and in recent months have been selling off sizable chunks of their position.\n\nObviously this probably isn't good for short term rises in share price, we could see them sell off larger chunks of their position in the coming months. The flip-side of this is that it could just be scheduled profit taking, and may not effect the share price whatsoever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# You can do your research on $CRSR here on Reddit\n\nWe are somewhat blessed to literally have a shit ton of customer insight right here on reddit, something we don't often get. There are several PC building and gaming subs that have millions of members who regularly discuss, at length, the pros and cons of every component and brand imaginable. Here are some of the biggest subreddits: r/gaming r/pcmasterrace r/buildapc r/battlestations r/Corsair r/Games r/pcgaming\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n**Bullish points**\n\n* Excellent revenue and profit growth. The fundamentals are super strong.\n* Earnings are expected to grow a further 21% in the coming year.\n* Proactive expansion into new sectors such as streaming (which will likely grow in the future) and pre-built PCs\n* Wide range of good quality, reasonably priced products, many of which are best sellers within the market.\n* Strong marketing and branding that increases exposure and visability of their products globally.\n* Did extremely well during the pandemic, increasing its customer base.\n* In terms of financial fundamentals, very undervalued at the moment.\n* The video games industry in general is only going to increase in size and revenue, and streaming will likely increase with it.\n* In terms of share price, there\u2019s decent support at this level.\n* New generations of products entering the market could be beneficial to Corsair - for example DDR5 memory is just around the corner. This can have knock-on positivity for Corsair in that if gamers want to upgrade to DDR5 RAM, they might need/want to upgrade other components too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bearish points**\n\n* Some suggest their recent revenue spurts are a \u2018one-off\u2019 due to the pandemic. We could see a reduction or slow in revenues in the coming months/years. The uncertainty surrounding the return to \u2018normality\u2019 after the pandemic could make investors hesitent to invest.\n* Many of their products are almost identical to others from competitors in the same market, the moat in some cases isn\u2019t significant or even existent.\n* EagleTree dumping shares could have an effect on share price.\n* The margins on many products in the sector are quite small.\n* For some products, there\u2019s a level of innovation that might not be improved upon. A fan is a fan, and that\u2019s it. There\u2019s no growth in some specific lines of products to obtain sales from users \u2018upgrading\u2019 when there\u2019s nothing to upgrade to.\n* The PC components market is exceptionally crowded.\n* Corsair has a fair amount of debt, although it is well covered by operating cashflow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAs I said at the start of this DD, I really like Corsair. They are a well run company, with incredible revenue growth, solid fundamentals, decent products and a good foothold in the market.\n\nPersonally I don't buy the whole 'the pandemic is a one-off' take. We've already seen a continuation in revenue growth into 2021, even after lockdown restrictions are reduced or lifted, so I feel they will continue to make bank. While we might see a slight slow, overall Corsair will just keep growing in terms of revenue and profit. It will grow with the continuously growing gaming industry.\n\nI feel like this is a long term play with somewhat short term uncertainty. But I feel it\u2019s a buy. I only have a small position as am about to go through a divorce, but will be adding to my position as soon as is possible.\n\nI don't suggest calls with short expiries, i've already been burned on this becuase i'm a dumbfuck. If you're gonna do options then leaps are probably ideal, or buy shares and sell covered calls against them. Shares is probably the play in general.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to be as accurate as possible with this DD, if anything is incorrect, feel free to comment below and I\u2019ll amend it.\n\nGodspeed apes \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

This Ape got you, I will try to make this DD a longer version of a TLDR! I'll try to make it concise and to the point as much as possible.(5 hours later, I failed at this objective lol)\n\n**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**\n\nFor the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.\n\nOn May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video). It has all the features crucial for it's **target buyers** (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's **a Truck which actually looks like a Truck.** \u201cFord knows what pickup owners want,\u201d IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.\n\nThe reservation now have exceeded 120,000 since it's debut. An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that **about 75%, or 90,000, are new to Ford, according to the company!** If anything, this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition. almost every car manufacturer can make an EV, but only a few (I can count on one hand) can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality.\n\nNow Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **\"Potential(because they don't exist yet)\"** competitors with superior car features. \n\nIt's relevant to mention that Ford's EV sales (counting electric vehicles and hybrids) increased 177% during June, capping off 56,570 units sold so far in 2021.\n\n**As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...**\n\n^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)\n\n**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**\n\nFord-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now \ud83d\ude02(Ford is 55.64B at 14.18$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with **the most recent news being 902$million in Q1 of 2021.**\n\n**On Jul 23, it was announced that Rivian closed a $2.5 billion funding round,** led by existing investors **Ford**, Amazon and T. Prior to it, they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U.S States started submitting bids on it.\n\nFarley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** \"but that's not why we invested,\" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.\n\nFarley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too **with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car**. He understands that **the first move is the most important one in the EV Game,** and with the Mach-E and F-150, Ford executed it's moves perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices, high quality, while maintaining the demand(something which Tesla still isn't able to). Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3- Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands:**\n\n Prior to the release of the Bronco, it had 190,000 reservations. **66% of the reservations were converted to sales!** Additionally, Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70% of the 125,000 orders it has are customers of other brands. \n\nAccording to Ford, dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of **15 days!,** with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep. People are killing to get their hands on one. just go on Ebay and see for yourself. Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K$. \n\nI would understand PS5 scalpers, but that happening with Cars, I never would've imagined. This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it's 2021 Revenue expectation from $3.5 billion, to between $9-$10 billion and they'll probably raise it again in the next quarter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4- Ford's Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy:**\n\n\u201cFord clearly has business and government fleets in mind,\u201d Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.\n\nFord revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it\u2019s equipped with a standard battery that\u2019s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, which is the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.\n\nFord's vision to lead the EV market has a \u201cno-brainer\u201d component Elon Musk lacks: Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery-powered trucks and vans. Ford\u2019s focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company\u2019s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts. They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F-150. They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach.\n\n# 5- Valuation and Price target\n\nYes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.\n\n$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple\n\n(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- outdated)\n\nTSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X\n\nNIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)\n\nGM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X\n\nF - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X\n\n**(Important part starts here)**\n\nAs you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.\n\nIf you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.\n\n At that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83e\udd85**.\n\n**Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it's just starting!**\n\n[Ford Price Target Forest illustrated with crayons](https://preview.redd.it/9lbgo0lg7de71.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eea5e203cda0de8a7a7856c4f3475d0abc536519)",

        "selftext": "So what does that mean, the market has turned upside down? What does that mean when the Nasdaq is hitting new highs everyday but many of the stocks I watch are down? What is this divergence? Is the Nasdaq index accurate? What stocks are actually up?\n\nSo yesterday 7/6/2021, I was surfing on Reddit and I did come across some Warren Buffet videos. The oracle of Omaha and well deserved. I have read a couple of his books maybe 10-12 years ago, read much about him but actually didn't see these videos until yesterday. In a nut shell he stated that you can not time the markets, no one can time the market, the best time to buy, is when you first see value and if anything but it in increments. The 2nd thing he stated was that he does not buy anything where he does not see value..... if it does not make money now..... because you can not predict the future, \"a bird in the hand right now, is worth 2 more in the bush.\" That means if you have a solid company making money now, do not jump ship and buy/speculate on something that is losing money/growing or for the short term perceives to be doing alot better. This paragraph will become important as I answer these questions. I hope to help calm everyones' nerves with the answers to these questions.\n\nI have wrote in many posts, as far back as a few weeks that the market is upside down, ever since the Nasdaq was at 13,800-14,000 and fed Powell was about to speak. The market upside down is when stocks that make money, have cash, give dividends, have the ability to buyback shares, raise dividends are falling like knives. Something like AFIN dipped under 8! NYCB under 11! (Again today, thanx for the trade), NYMT under 4.50 (Here we go again).. These are stocks that I constantly trade, and tell the elite team to trade when we are forced to pivot and seek safety. Why? Because they can do all of those things....... A company that does not make money, can not buy shares, can not raise dividends, and even as the stock drops they want to print more shares..\n\nMany followers and the elite team are asking me what do I think is going on, why is the Nasdaq making new highs but I see a sea of red? So, I did alot of digging this week. The Nasdaq is indeed a cap weighted Index.. So is the SP and Nasdaq 100 are all cap weighted. That means as the market cap of a company grows (That is the overall value of a company) the meaning and weight it carries on the index grows as well....Why does this matter? The big 5, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, FB... account for 40% of the nasdaq!!!! Look it up! I just did, because I am supposed to be all knowing! You guys do keep me sharp! AAPL alone accounts for 12% of the nasdaq index and nearly 20% of QQQ (Nasdaq 100). The Nasdaq has almost 5,000 tickers. So the fact that 5 company's can shift 40% or more! of the market means that 4,000 can call and 150 can be up and the NASDAQ can be up! Is that possible? Yesterday there were 4 decliners for every advancer.. (4,000 down, 1,000 up) that is 7/6/2021. Today 7/7/2021 there were about 1.5 decliners for every advancer. (3,000 down and 2,000 up)..... In fact the US equity market is about 50 trillion and covers about 12-13,000 tickers amongst the NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX and OTC... These 5 make up about 10 trillion!! So, just these 5 are 20% of the entire US market!! Yes! Now, I knew they were important and cap weighted I just didnt know how so..... because these stocks are making record all time highs, the Nasdaq is at 14,600-14,700 and its a sea of red. I started to see what was up and saw these mighty titans and some speculative stocks.. So that is your answer....... it is happening, why the Nasdaq is making new highs and I see a sea of red. So the Nasdaq is accurate, their is no mistake. Some stocks like SE, BILL are going sky high, LMND bouncing back but these are strictly speculative, snow.......\n\nWhat is the danger in this? Why does it matter? Because I was even telling my elite team to me, we are already near a correction. If you take out 25 of the largest cap company's their is no doubt the Nasdaq is already down 5-10% but we cant see it! They have asked me other ways to track what is going on...... The only other way is to track other nasdaq important stocks to know, because if you track these 5 that mean the most, they are making highs. The danger in this is if they fall, it may cause a panic and speculative stocks will really crash! Because if the Nasdaq is at record highs and most people do not know its a few company's bringing up the market if the Nasdaq as a whole falls to 14,000 it may cause panic!\n\nWhat do we do? I am going back defensive after I sell of some of my offensive stocks....Or I will buy an offensive stock after its down at least 5% on the day.....\n\nRecall earlier the paragraph about Warren Buffet and buy value, cash cows, and buy more when fear is instilled elsewhere........ When the market started to turn upside down, an amazing value stock I had was TX, it dipped to 31, I did buy more, albeit in fear and traded it. It has bounced back to near 52 week highs as of today near 42. So that is a 30+ percent move in 2 weeks on a safe stock that makes cash! AFIN, BRMK, NYCB, they all recovered and made for great trades.... Today I am given another trading opportunity in NYCB and NYMT.......Now an offensive play, give it, these are Chinese are getting crushed and they are offensive. TIGR and VIPS. TIGR rose to 30!! It is now under 21...... VIPS dipped to 15 and change went back to 20.66 and has dropped this week because of DIDI (Chinese).. Same with TIGR.. I do own VIPS at 21.... I have been trading TIGR.... I just wanted you all to see what the difference is of a defensive play making tons of cash \\[1 in the hand, 2 in the bush\\]..... Now I do believe VIPS and TIGR are 2 offensive plays that should rise but we do have to be careful....\n\nSo in short, the market is upside down, being held by a few stocks. I refer to the Nasdaq as most of us trade tech/growth. I hope this explains much, and calms nerves for people with stocks that make cash!!!",

        "selftext": "Earlier, I wasn\u2019t able to navigate creating a  DD post correctly to show the similarities between how FB and WISH were manipulated downward to shake weak hands off the stocks with massive long term gains ahead.\n\n1. Compare FB July 2012 through Mar 2013 to WISH Dec 2020 to Present?\n\nMarket insiders who drove enthusiasm through the hyped FB IPO and the run up of WISH after its IPO make it their business to punish early investors with eyes on short term gains. They make huge profits on IPO run ups followed by shorting the very same hyped stocks mercilessly.\n\n2. Why is this important?\n\nIn the case of FB then and WISH now you see two stocks - one that got punished then and another that has gotten punished recently such their valuation levels made no sense. Both companies had post IPO had very little debt while experiencing rapid growth but their market cap dropped precipitously and in the case of WISH, to around 1.4 x sales.\n\nWhen valuations get out of whack like that and losses on individual investors force them to sell out of their positions, big investors always jump in to take massive long term stakes in which they reap massive gains.\n\nThis then says to me that you should be patient in your investing. You could carefully invest using a number of strategies to make money without losing your position in a long term winner. Here are a few approaches:\n\na. Average in your largest buys around large institutional investor buys as seen on level II trades\nb. Join the shorts with with PUT orders when algorithmic selling or manipulative downward price action is evident\nc. Sell LEAP covered CALLs if they are profitable\nd. Balance trading on margin to avoid margin calls\n\nOver time all that matters is that your trading account and positions in it are funded and not vulnerable to margin calls. A good early investment will usually prove to be one within two years.\n\n3. What does this mean: Contrast manipulation vs value?\n\nFirst, understand that in the long run valuations matter. To get the best value an investor should pay the lowest price for a promising stock. When a stock price drops while the fundamentals of the company is improving like WISH who reported 76% YoY revenue growth but fell to $7.52 after hitting a $32.85 high you have to wonder why. Well a buyer at $32.85 now has the worst value given the stock is now worth $11.78. A buyer on the other hand who bought at $7.52 or near about like I did has the highest value especially knowing that the company\u2019s revenue is significantly increasing.\n\nSecond, we as investors must learn to follow the money. Big buy orders that we have seen since the 52-week low of $7.52 has produced massive trading volume. Massive trading volume with increasing price per share and algorithm-based pullbacks are signs of extraordinary long term gains as seen in FB. And, if you go back to AAPL in roughly 2004 and 2005 you see similar price action and volume followed by the enormous gains that APPL has since produced.\n\nManipulation is to me disingenuous price increase or drops against valuation. At either end whether through hype or unfounded bashing the unsuspecting and inexperienced investor is bound to lose.\n\n4. Why did I deem FB and WISH price drops as manipulation?\n\nWhen a disruptive technology enters the market and is run up early only to reverse and drop over  50% and sometimes down 90% there to me is no other explanation that big investor pump and dump market manipulation. I do not claim this to be scientific analysis but rather common sense. To make one feel as though their initial investment was a bad one only to later reveal sometimes 200-fold gains is similarity someone telling you your winning lottery ticket was a loser. To me it should be criminal when big investors colluded with unscrupulous Law Firms who file fake lawsuits and post them all over every brokerage site or financial website and paid bashers are employed to drive down a stock price to encourage individual investors to sell their stakes at a loss as I believe is being done in the case of WISH.",

        "selftext": "Now that I got your attention, I\u2019m thinking there is going to be a (possibly major) correction mid-way next week.\n\n**FA:**\n\nFOMC meeting is on July 28 and they will be, yet again, discussing fiscal and monetary policies. Fed funds rate could remain at &lt;=0.25% or bump up. The rise in fed fund rate is pretty unlikely as JPow communicated that QE slowdown will precede interest rate hikes, but there's a good chance that tapering will be further discussed. US exports have climbed back to precovid numbers, US imports are higher than ever before despite DXY getting slapped meanwhile the GDP target has risen for 2021 signaling a sooner than anticipated economic recovery. Not to mention the continuous MoM CPI climbs in absurd amounts and the US operating at a massive trade deficit, all signal that tapering may start in the very near term despite JPow repeating how far we are from the economic target. However, officials have echoed on numerous fronts, the interest rate is not expected to see a hike until 2023; although, they predict that tapering plans will be announced in Fall of this year, but with everything seeming to go back to status quo sooner than expected, tapering or other bearish monetary policies could be announced and implemented shortly.\n\nTech earnings week is fast approaching. It\u2019s unlikely the prices will hold when tech stocks sit at all time highs and the ER forecast for blue chips remain stagnant compared to its previous quarters.\n\n**TA:**\n\nTA says we\u2019re reaching upper level resistance. Volatility is extremely high on the upside and can trigger HFT or quant funds to reduce inventory. We can expect higher levels of volatility (VIX futures that is only 1 week dte trading at roughly 20% from current levels).\n\n[Reaching critical trend line resistance. Consider QQQ to have a upside of +1&amp;#37; from here at $370\\~$371](https://preview.redd.it/2pp016pjbzc71.png?width=1546&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3248a4a2286ac3add6b4a7351682104e2ff5a773)\n\nEWT says we\u2019re reaching the massive correction cycle. It's the same shit when it comes to tech earnings run-up followed by the dump in spite of a decent performance.\n\nUncertainty creates risk and risk drives fear so the fact that ER release (granted a beat) by the blue chips might not be large enough to justify current prices, or the possible sector rotation that may ensue post ER release, or the possible tapering discussion which may change the macro, or reaching the upper level resistance of a major trend line could scare smart money away from the equity market in the near term. Call it quad witching if you will.\n\n**QQQ ETF weighting/ER Date:** \n\n* AAPL - 13.39%/July 28 \n* MSFT - 10.76%/July 27 \n* AMZN - 10.66%/July 28 \n* FB - 4.26%/July 28 \n* TSLA - 3.45%/July 26 \n* GOOGL - 3.42%/July 27 \n* PYPL - 1.99%/July 28\n\nThe stars have aligned for a (bigly) drop.\n\nPosition: QQQ 361p 08/06",

        "selftext": "I'd like to think, I am a careful investor, willing to take a calculated risk for a significant reward but I am sad to say when it came to SPACs I failed miserably. But I continue to learn from my failures.\n\n\"Failure is only the opportunity more intelligently to begin again.\" \u2015 Henry Ford\n\nSo lets take a closer look into SPACs. SPACs are essentially angel investors, they pump private companies full of money hoping that the company can use that money to accelerate growth. Almost all* have the same theme...\"cool idea\", \"trendy topic\", \"all star management\", \"amazing revenue potential in 3-5 years\".(*RIP PSTH). The companies that invest in SPACs usually bail after they have merged and funded the company. Most of you already know this but lets get to who makes money in SPACs. Most SPACs start out at $1B market cap @ $10 a share. When the merger occurs, obly a portion of the target company gets merged(sometimes its 100% but many times its much less). Many target companies have already issued shared to their management or owners. These shares all have to taken into account. \n\nValuation\nFirst, I am not considering any company that does not have revenues or a product for sale. These are the most dangerous companies to invest in and unless you have some special knowledge about how they are going to succeed, I would steer clear of them.\n\nWe as investors want to find out how much XYZ company is worth. These are the things I take into account:\n1. What percentage of the company is going public through SPAC?\n2. How many total shares and warrants are issued?\n3. What will be the market cap of the company after merger?\n4. How many shares/warrants are issued to private investments(PIPE), owners, officers, etc?\n5. Is the company generating revenue?\n6. Can it meet the projected yearly growth?\n\nALL of these can be answered in the Investment Prospectus(S-1 Filing). If you are investing thousands of dollars in something take 30 minutes to go through the S-1. After getting their numbers see how they stack up to other high growth companies(P/S is a decent metric to evaluate the company). All companies are not the same making buses is not the same as selling a subscription to an app. Not every company is destined to be Tesla or Apple...physical products are difficult to scale. Many EV companies think they can scale as quickly and efficiently as Tesla, Most will fail. Revenue growth is key to our valuation and I feel most of SPACs will fail to grow their revenues on a consistent basis. YOU MUST CONFIRM REVENUE GROWTH BEFORE MAKING LARGE INVESTMENTS INTO THE COMPANY! After we determine what company we like, we have to now determine how much we are willing to pay for it. All SPACs start off trading at a premium, you are paying a premium on the expectation that the valuation will eventually be at or higher than the premium you paid. The $10 you paid for the SPAC before merger, is already a premium no matter which company they merge with. (Premium compared to similar established companies) Just because its $10 does not meat the company is cheap. So how much should you pay for it? Lets look at the SPAC lifecycle first and then pricing...\n\nSPAC Lifecycle\n1. Sponsor company starts SPAC with $10 price and $1B market cap\n2. They merge into existing company, give them a check usually between $200M to $500M to help company grow faster.\n3. A portion of the total shares become public.\n4. Ticker changes to new ticker\n5. Earnings reports\n6. Lock-up expiration, shares that were privately held can be traded, usually 3-6 months, sometimes 1 year after the closing date) THIS IS IN THE S1 FIND IT, VERY IMPORTANT!\n7. Earnings reports\n8. Research Analyst Coverage begins usually after 2 earnings reports\n\nHow much should you pay?\nAnything you want really, I'm not judging, if you're an APE/wallstbetter, have high conviction, want to buy options in a single stock...go for it as long as you dont need that money to support yourself or other around you BUT if you want to take a calculated risk keep reading.\n\nEx. ABCD(Spac) merges with XYZ\n1. ABCD...DON'T BUY unless you're a technical investor and want to trade momentum\n2. ABCD DA(Deal announcement), DON'T BUY, usually pump and dump\n3. AFTER Ticker change to XYZ, DON'T BUY, statistically proven that price will drop after ticker change.\n4. Before lockup period expiration, DON'T BUY, after the lock-up period expires, private investors and company officer WILL dump their shares...MILLION usually 25% of the total shares will enter the market.\n5. After lockup period(I would wait atleast 30 days after lock-up expiration) to BUY and start a position\n6. After second earnings, add shares, usually analysts will start giving their ratings after this and you can CONFIRM REVENUE GROWTH! \n\nGood luck!\n\nCOMPANIES I LIKE(in no particular order):\nPTRA and SOFI\n\nMOST COMPANIES BELOW DID NOT HAVE LOCK-UP EXPIRATION(DONT BUY YET)!\n\nSTEM , SKIN , DMTK, AHAC, LTCH, PUBM, MILE, PSFE, MAPS, DM\n\nIf you want my 2 cents on a company, leave a ticker in the comments.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.

        "selftext": "# The Ultimate Guide to Due Diligence\n\nI have come across a lot of amazing information over the years and this post is a compilation of the things and ideas I found most useful. I have tried to summarize and condense them in order to keep this post as short as possible.\n\nI\u2019ll be covering my research process, talking about the different steps involved without going into too much detail, this post won\u2019t tell you how to perform each step but rather which steps to include in your process.\n\nI'll be updating this post with more details and information!\n\n# What is the goal of Due Diligence?\n\nBefore we begin, we need to understand what we\u2019re trying to do by performing Due Diligence.\n\n**In my opinion, the main goals are:**\n\n1. To study and understand how a business works inside and out.\n2. To form our own ideas, thesis and opinions based of our findings.\n\nI know this sounds basic and obvious, but it\u2019s the framework behind any good due diligence. While we all have our own methods and preferences, we should all keep these goals in mind. It\u2019s very easy to follow the crowds these days, but investments shouldn\u2019t be done solely based on other people\u2019s recommendations.\n\nIf you don\u2019t take the time to study a business and understand how it works then you\u2019re not investing, you\u2019re gambling.\n\n**So, lets dig in.**\n\n# Is this company real?\n\nI know I know, it sounds like a waste of time, and it is in most cases thankfully, but you're better off looking into the basics before digging in any further. Scams are real and they do happen.\n\n* Check out the headquarters address on Google Maps\n* Visit the company website\n* Look for news articles mentioning the company\n* Look for social media mentions\n* Check Glassdoor / LinkedIn for employee stats and reviews\n\n# What is the Management team like?\n\nIt\u2019s very important to get to know the decision makers behind a company. As investors we need to get creative and read everything we can to get an idea and feel for the management team.\n\n**First of all, I look at who the key executives are:**\n\n* What is their background?\n* What successes or failures have they experiences professionally?\n* What is their compensation package?\n* What do they bring to the table?\n* What decisions have they made?\n* What direction are they taking the company in?\n\nI read it all: Earning Call Transcripts, SEC Filings, Press Releases, Interviews, Articles, Social Media, Industry Reports, Shareholder Letters and anything else I can get my hands on. There are some hidden gems across these materials that really help me get a feel for the management team and understand what they value most, what would benefit them personally and how honest they have been in the past.\n\n# How does the company make money?\n\n\u00ad\u00adIt\u2019s crucial to understand how the company you\u2019re analyzing generates revenue. If you don\u2019t know or understand how a company makes money you either haven\u2019t conducted proper research or simply don\u2019t understand the business, and as Warren Buffet says, only invest in businesses you actually understand. There\u2019s no shame in being selective and sticking to sectors and industries that you understand.\n\n**Let\u2019s look at Apple, they generate revenues in different ways:**\n\n* iPhone\n* Mac\n* iPad\n* Wearables, home and accessories\n* Services\n\nAs an investor, I need to understand each of these product categories. I need to find out their margins, returns, competitors, moats, strengths, weaknesses and any other competitive advantages.\n\n**I ask myself:**\n\n* Which category generates the most revenue and has the best margins?\n* What will the company fund with the free cash flow generated by this category?\n* What competitive advantages are there with this product?\n* What are competitors working on?\n\nIt\u2019s key to understand the primary source of revenue inside and out, as its performance will drive the development of other product categories thanks to the free cash flow readily available to be invested. You need to find out if this primary source of revenue is healthy, competitive and if it faces any potential issues or pitfalls as its performance can heavily impact the future of this company.\n\nSomething I give a lot of importance to is the market sentiment and competitive advantages of a company\u2019s primary revenue streams.\n\n**In the case of Apple, the iPhone is its primary source of revenue.**\n\n**I ask myself:**\n\n* What does the market think of the iPhone?\n* How do customers feel about the iPhone?\n* How do competitors feel about the iPhone?\n* Are there any incoming innovations that threaten the iPhone?\n* Is the image and public perception of the iPhone positive?\n\n# Financial Analysis\n\nI have made some posts on how to read and analyze financial statements, you can find them in my profile.\n\nAs an investor I need to understand how the company has performed and how it\u2019s currently performing. I do this by going through each financial statement going as far back as possible. I look for items that stand out and ask myself questions as I go along.\n\nI try to spot patterns between line items and company performance, for example if I see debt increased along with R&amp;D of X years, I\u2019ll look for a justification, did they release a new product or service? Expanded their team? Invested in PP&amp;E. These are just examples. Try to think past the numbers themselves. Try to find out why they are there and what they are for.\n\n# Insider and Institutional Ownership:\n\nInsider ownership can be very telling. Find out which key executives own equity and look for any recent purchases or sales. No one knows a company better than it's executive team, so any equity purchases or sales made by them could signal incoming news.\n\nThe same is valid for Hedge Funds and Mutual Funds. They have teams of analysts that hunt for potential investments. Keep an eye out for their purchases and sales.\n\n# Historical Price\n\nThis is a pretty straightforward part of my process. I look at a historical price chart of the company I\u2019m analyzing and I write down the dates of major price dips or increases.\n\nI then do some digging, looking for the catalyst of those price movements. I scan through those dates looking for news, company announcements, micro and macro developments, industry/sector breakthroughs, commodity prices, material supply/demand etc. I do this to try and identify what causes the biggest price movements in order to hopefully be able to see them coming in the future.\n\n# Custom Financial Modeling\n\nMaybe custom financial modeling isn't the right title for this part, but I couldn't come up with a better one. I create a \"Frankenstein\" table by combining historical data from the three financial statements as well as different financial ratios and metrics. I do this for as far back as I can go depending on the age of the business.\n\nI really value this part of my process as seeing everything together really helps me get a better understanding of the individual line items as well as make connections and spot patterns.\n\nThe less I have to jump around between websites, statements, spreadsheets etc the better for me.\n\n# Watchlists\n\nI add the stocks I have performed proper due diligence on to watchlists in order to keep an eye on them through my personal go-to ratios and metrics.\n\nThis helps me spot any changes or movements which may lead to another round of due diligence depending on what I see. It also simply helps me remember each stock. It's easy to get lost or forget about a potential investment with all the new stocks that we discover.\n\n# Repetition\n\nThis is the most important part. Repetition. It\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll get better.\n\nThe more you do something, the easier it becomes. Your understanding of finance, economics, psychology and all things investing related will be refined through repetition. The more you study companies, analyze their financials, track their developments the more you\u2019ll begin to spot patterns and make connections.\n\nDue diligence and financial analysis are much like story telling but in reverse. You\u2019re putting together a story based on various bits and pieces, studying documents, financials and more to understand the beginning and middle in hopes of being able to see how the end will play out.",

        "selftext": "Let me start by saying that I love Spotify and have been using it for over seven years. Everything about the platform is great and like many others, I have no plans of switching. The algorithm is unlike anything I've experienced on a music streaming app and has helped me discover countless new artists and genres. I\u2019m sure you have felt a similar experience. Unfortunately, none of these amazing features should allow an investor to turn a blind eye to an obscene valuation. As history has shown, Wall Street will eventually make you pay the price. People quickly forget that Pandora Media was one of the world\u2019s leading internet radio providers before collapsing due to more competition, and eventually was bought by Sirius XM.\n\n      Growing Sales Doesn't Justify its High Valuation. Spotify is currently valued as a high-margin, wide-moat business. Investors are willing to pay a premium now for profits that aren't expected for at least four to five years. Bulls love to only focus on the impressive revenue and MAU growth, huge podcast signings, and overall great product. The question I always follow up and ask is, \u201cHow much more room is there to grow?\u201d. Spotify has already absorbed close to 35% of the music streaming market as of 2019 and with a number of new platforms emerging each year, it\u2019s only going to get more competitive. Some reports are claiming that Spotify\u2019s share has declined closer to 30% as of 2020 but these are difficult to verify.\n\n      If Spotify can\u2019t generate a profit now, when will they? Their explosive growth and exclusive content signings are costly and while it looks good in the near term, it doesn\u2019t imply a sustainable business model. On top of that, Spotify\u2019s high EV/EBITDA (can\u2019t use profit margins since negative) imply it\u2019s trading well above fair value vs. similar names such as Netflix, Sirius XM, or Apple.\n\n      Some may argue that it is unfair comparing a low/negative EBITDA with companies that have stronger multiples, but to me, that is the point I'm trying to make. Spotify doesn't deserve this valuation given its low-margin business. If management can prove to investors that it can scale AND improve operating margins, then it will deserve the valuations of Netflix and Apple who already have 18-25% net income margins. \n\n      Royalty Fees Remain a Major Concern. One of the biggest things I feel Wall Street fails to effectively understand with Spotify is its painful royalty fee structure. 73-80% of the company's revenue is subject to this in a given year, and it isn't going anywhere. There are no economies of scale or optimization strategies that will fix this; it's a constant payment to recording owners such as Universal Music or Sony that eat up the vast majority of Spotify's revenue. Figure 3 shows Spotify\u2019s unchanged gross margins for the last three years despite impressive top-line growth.\n\n      It's even more surprising when you find out that Spotify is one of the worst paying streaming services out there. There isn\u2019t much more room for management to decrease payouts or else they risk losing more market share.\n\n      Why is that important you might ask? Well, one of the hottest topics in music streaming right now (has been for years) revolves around artists, who are demanding to be paid more and rightfully so. This does not bode well for Spotify\u2019s low payout coupled with more streamers entering the market who will try to gain exclusive access from artists by paying them more. If Spotify decides to increase payouts to retain artists, it's only going to hurt their bottom line. \n\n      Competition From Apple Music Will continue to be an issue for Spotify. Earlier this year, Apple unveiled its lossless streaming and spatial audio which is essentially a new enhanced way to listen to your favorite artists. It's a relatively new feature that launched in June and I believe as more people become aware of its better high-resolution stream offering, there is potential for them to take more market share from Spotify. I\u2019m not claiming to be a music expert, but many blogs/articles are out there touting Apple\u2019s achievement and we have yet to hear from Spotify on their next move. They may match what Apple has released, but until then, it has become a new near-term risk for Spotify. \n\n      Don't Sleep on Spotify's Debt. Although Spotify currently generates a healthy operating cash flow, it's important to recognize the $1.8 billion in debt on its balance sheet. In early 2021, Spotify raised $1.3 billion in unsecured notes. For what exactly? Many are speculating on the uses. An acquisition? General corporate purposes? Paying out more to artists? That remains to be said, but regardless this adds a new risk factor to Spotify if it cannot execute on a plan to pay off these notes due in 2026. The company does have a history of getting out of a high debt situation. Prior to going public in 2018, Spotify had raised approximately $1 billion of convertible debt at a roughly $10 billion valuation with private investors before selling it off to Tencent for the direct listing. Kind of weird when you\u2019re competitor owns a piece of your company after going public.\n\n      Spotify is a tricky business to evaluate. There aren't any fair comparables (I've seen research analysts use Netflix and Amazon for multiples) to accurately value it. So, what is a fair value for a company that can generate massive revenues, has a superior product, but can't make a profit? I'm a firm believer that investors eventually lose patience with a company that doesn't improve bottom-line margins. Does it take five years? Ten? After going public in mid-2018, Spotify traded range-bound between $105-200 per share and appeared to be fairly valued until April 2020 when it began to take off. In my opinion, this more than 100% increase to $350 per share was not justified given the company's inability to improve profit margins while management gave no indication that things were drastically changing. Some will argue that higher sales and improving MAU's played a role but that was already factored into the share price prior to the run-up. Even though Spotify's share price is down 28% from its February high, there is still room to fall. Don't catch a falling knife as this name heads back to the low-$100's where it belongs.",

        "selftext": "1. It is not a hedge against inflation: \n\nAs a hedge against inflation, there are better alternatives. Equities, Real estate, commodities etc. All of which are regulated and more secure. The recent fall in Bitcoin\u2019s price - at the same time inflation fears are at the highest in decades - proves it is not a useful tool to hedge against inflation.\n\n2. It has no value as \u201cmoney\u201d, because it is not accepted for taxes:\n\nAlthough people generally refer to the USD as \u201cfiat\u201d, it\u2019s true value comes from taxes. 300M+ of some of the wealthiest people on earth, are mandated by their govt to pay their taxes in USD. That gives it its value. Even a non-American understands that other Americans would accept it, so it has value to non-Americans. People use USD a unit of account, because it is easier to transact in the same unit of account for which taxes would be paid.\n\nContrary to popular belief, taxes made Gold valuable as money. Not just it\u2019s metallic properties. If the Roman Empire had requested taxes be paid in copper, lead, etc all Roman citizens would have had to sell a portion of their Gold for the acceptable tax payment commodity. Eventually, it would have been too inconvenient to transact in Gold, just to have to exchange it to something else each year. And people would inevitably have changed their unit of account to the form accepted for taxes. Gold had other useful properties, like scarcity. But ultimately, it was used as the unit of account, because it was the method of payment for taxes.\n\n3. As a currency, it is deflationary: \n\nWhile deflation can be a good property for an asset, this is a terrible feature for a currency. When a currency is deflationary, it removes the need for investments. Why would a business owner spend the currency to build a new factory or hire more workers, if they can simply hold on to their currency? No need for new factories, new innovation, new investment in that scenario. A currency needs to have some predictable \u2018moderate\u2019 inflation, because it forces people to invest it into the real economy. Or risk it losing its value. These investments - like a new factory - create job as well as useful products.\n\n4. There are cheaper more secure ways to transfer money:\n\nVenmo, Apple Pay, Cash app etc are much safer and secure way to process transactions. Between exchange fees, miners fee, volatility. The cost to transact in Bitcoin is not nearly as low as people think.\n\n5. Developing countries have better options:\n\nBicoiners would argue that developing countries have many citizens that are \u201cunbanked\u201d. And would benefit from access to cryptocurrencies. However, developing countries are able to use more stable currencies like the USD or the Euro. This is especially useful for countries with hyperinflation - different from earlier mentioned \u2018moderate\u2019 inflation. There are already phone apps - outside the normal banking system- that allow people to complete transactions in developing countries.",

        "selftext": "Sorry, telecommuters. Obituaries for the office were premature. As vaccination levels soar and the limitations of remote work become more evident, a growing number of companies are planning at least partial returns to cubicle land. Investors should pay attention.\n\nSome of the most direct beneficiaries of a return to the office would be real estate investment trusts, such as Allied Properties REIT, which lease prime office space in downtown cores.\n\nMore retail-oriented landlords, such as RioCan REIT, would also stand to gain if the return of office workers helps to re-energize downtown shops and restaurants and spur more demand for storefront spaces.\n\nBoth these REITs trade at reasonable valuations and currently pay unitholders around 4 per cent a year in distributions. Their shares have risen sharply in recent months but are still well below their prepandemic levels. They could climb further if the return to the office proves more vigorous than expected.\n\nSome signs suggest it will be. The Globe and Mail recently reported on a flurry of companies, including TMX Group Ltd. and Intelex Technologies Inc., that are cancelling plans to sublet some of their downtown Toronto office space because more workers than expected are returning to their cubicles.\n\nIn the United States, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have told employees to be back to their New York offices by fall. And Apple Inc. has told its staff it expects workers back in the office three days a week beginning in September.\n\n\u201cThere is no consensus on how far the return to the office will go,\u201d says Howard Leung, an investment analyst with Veritas Investment Research who follows the REIT market. \u201cBut there is a growing belief that some sort of hybrid model will become common, where people work from home part of the week and go into the office for the remainder.\u201d\n\nFor REIT investors, this is all good news. A hybrid model suggests offices \u2013 and office landlords \u2013 will still have a major role to play in corporate life. The possibility that major employers will suddenly decide to abandon their workspaces en masse and go largely remote \u2013 a real worry for REIT investors a year ago \u2013 no longer seems realistic.\n\nA hybrid model would reflect the mixed feelings many people have about remote work. Surveys show most workers enjoy not having to commute every day, Mr. Leung says. But many \u2013 including Mr. Leung himself \u2013 also miss the buzz and energy that comes from seeing colleagues and clients over lunch or meeting them for drinks after work.\n\nCompanies, too, have become more aware of remote work\u2019s limitations, he says. Managers now realize how challenging it is to bring new employees into a company\u2019s culture when there is no physical place for the newbies to rub shoulders with co-workers, strike up friendships and find mentors.\n\nWorking via Zoom becomes particularly tedious amid projects that involve constant close collaboration. Matters that could have been settled quickly prepandemic by walking a few feet and talking to a colleague for a few seconds now involve scheduling a call.\n\nMr. Leung notes that even the tech giants that paid the most enthusiastic lip service to the possibilities of remote work last summer have not abandoned the office. He recently compared lease commitments by the likes of Twitter Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Shopify Inc. and found they actually ticked up in 2020 compared with a year earlier. While not all of these lease commitments were necessarily for office space, the lack of any dramatic reduction in commitments suggests that even companies well positioned to work remotely are not shedding vast acres of empty cubicles.\n\nThat bodes well for Allied Properties, which caters to a heavily tech-focused clientele that wants space in downtown cores. Mr. Leung says he\u2019s \u201cbullish\u201d on the company. He puts its intrinsic value at $50 a share, significantly higher than the $44.65 level around which it now trades.\n\nMr. Leung is also optimistic about RioCan REIT, as a result of the stabilizing outlook for commercial real estate in general \u2013 and, more specifically, RioCan\u2019s plans to add residential units on top of many of its urban retail properties. He has an intrinsic value estimate of $23.50 a share on the stock, now trading around $22.\n\nAnalysts at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce see things similarly. They rate both RioCan and Allied as outperformers with a target price of $23 on RioCan and $49 on Allied.\n\n\u201cA strengthening Canadian economy, the desire of workers to reinstate the line between home and work and signals from tenants all support stable prospects for the office asset class,\u201d wrote Scott Fromson of CIBC in a June 22 report. He says Allied is particularly well positioned to capitalize on the \u201cgreat office reverse migration\u201d and names it as his top pick among Canadian office REITs.\n\nWhat are the risks? A COVID-19 resurgence would play havoc with the outlook. A sudden increase in interest rates could also dampen enthusiasm for REITs. But if current trends continue, the sector looks likely to benefit from a reversal of the telecommuting trend of the past year.\n\n[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-with-limitations-of-remote-work-becoming-more-evident-reits-will-be/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-with-limitations-of-remote-work-becoming-more-evident-reits-will-be/)",

        "selftext": "  \n\nThank you to: u/caseywh, u/sectorpotential2083, u/FatAspirations, u/JayAreW, u/JeffAmazon, u/drop-o-matic, u/uberkikz11 for guidance and assistance in writing this report. \n\nPUBM has been a name that has been floating around for a few weeks now, usually in the context of its high short interest. As we dug into the name further, we were pleasantly surprised to find out that this company is not dog-shit, is not failing, nor is it in a dying industry (as most of the other short interest plays that will remain unnamed), but a thriving company in an accelerating industry. This post will guide you through how we stumbled on the name, the company and its financials, the industry, the short-interest, and the plan. There are several angles of attack here, enough for everyone to get their grubby little hands dirty: traders, investors and gamblers. A summary:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Clean financials, with earnings beat and raised guidance\n* Undervalued compared to peers\n* Secular tailwinds as digital advertising expands\n* Dual class share structure which disincentivize insider selling\n* High short interest (anywhere from 20%-50% as of 6/24)\n* High institutional ownership (74%)\n* Small float with tight liquidity\n* Bottoming chart pattern with reversal\n* Options chain initiation on 6/25 - with more strikes to be added imminently\n\nPlan: Shares for the conservative players. Options - the chain is limited because options were just introduced - pound any and all strikes - with focus on the longer-dated. \n\nDisclaimer: Multiple people have contributed to this report, and most have shares in the $30 range when the idea of this play was first conceived. \n\n**The Origins and Chart Analysis**\n\nWhat caught our interest originally, was a volume scan. After market close on 6/7, $PUBM showed up on a scanner looking for relative volume increases. This is a scan I use a lot, as it\u2019s a good way to follow the whales as they tip their hand when scaling into a position. When you see big volume moves (over the relative average), but little price movement, it\u2019s usually a sign of institutional accumulation. The big players piece into positions slowly as not to price themselves out with a massive market order. In the case of $PUBM, despite a 3x volume spike, price only increased a modest 5%. These moves are often signs of trend reversals when an institution slams its wizard staff into the ground and says, \u201cYou shall not pass!\u201d. The last three weeks have seen the most shares traded in $PUBM\u2019s history - even more than when $PUBM IPO\u2019d in December of 2020. \n\nIn addition to accumulation volume, the PUBM chart is a perfect example of both types of head and shoulder patterns (topping H &amp; S, and bottoming inverse H &amp; S) - see Chart 1. The original H &amp; S called out the top, and now we see an inverse head and shoulders formed, which is typically a signal of a bottoming, reversal pattern. The breakout was rejected at the original \u201cneckline\u201d of the topping pattern, and retested the breakout point on 7/2/21 - and has held. This is the beginning of a text-book trend-reversal breakout. The chart setup is a buy.  But what is it we\u2019re buying?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvxgqryh4l971.png?width=694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5eb3169a68bc1f3b007a499fde379b8bef0c0f1\n\n**So What Exactly is Pubmatic?**\n\nIn short, Pubmatic is an advertising technology company. For most of human history, business owners have been using ads to sell their products, inform their customers of a value proposition, or build brands. With the advent of the internet, \u201cadtech\u201d companies like Google have grown rich and powerful by allowing advertisers to communicate with any type of customer they want, virtually instantaneously, as much as they want. No other form of advertising offers these features and as such, the digital advertising market has become *extremely* complex with hundreds of billions of dollars on the line every year. This trend toward digital advertising is expected to continue (figure 1): \n\nFigure 1 - Digital ad spending worldwide\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e5zfu5zk4l971.png?width=520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cd713dbe7aad803d15b4b88c393138caede80a9\n\nPubmatic operates and competes in this space, specifically programmatic advertising. Before programmatic, digital ads were bought and sold by teams of people on either side of the equation, which was slow and cumbersome. Now there are scores of companies that have built software and infrastructure that allows digital ad space to be traded programmatically. The market share of programmatic advertising as part of all digital advertising has been on the rise (figure 2):\n\nFigure 2 - market share of programmatic advertising\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bh073a1m4l971.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9444f4c9a7635ea35bfcd5b0cd76bdaef28c397c\n\nSince Pubmatic is a programmatic ad company \u2013 it is benefiting from these two tailwinds: more ads are becoming digital and more digital ads are becoming programmatic.                                     \n\nProgrammatic channels primarily have two sides to them: the buy side and the sell side. At a basic level, publishers generate revenue by selling digital ad space on their content, and advertisers/marketing agencies will purchase this ad space to place an ad in front of a potential customer.\n\nPubmatic is an SSP or supply side platform. Publishers will integrate and configure Pubmatic\u2019s software to allow for the transactions to take place. Publishers want the best outcomes possible for their ad slots, so more often than not, they\u2019ll integrate with multiple SSPs in an effort to increase their overall yield. I can\u2019t stress this enough: the programmatic ad market is so complex, I would be willing to bet that a single person couldn\u2019t wrap their head around the whole thing. It is mountainous in size. **Trillions and trillions** of programmatic ads are served up across advertising verticals, across global markets, and across billions of devices every month. Any sizable publisher that wants to efficiently sell their inventory at scale must work with an SSP and compete in the broader programmatic ad market.\n\nNeedless to say, most digital channels continued to grow as people spent more time inside and on their devices. Pubmatic\u2019s revenue continued to grow YoY as overall advertising spend took a big hit (due to COVID). The most exciting part about this is that global ad spend is projected to return to its normal growth pattern \u2013 you can see this already taking place in figure 3. \n\nFigure 3 - Global Advertising Forecast\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fxd9zrum4l971.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd922d833a0f3c6224f29144a3f9d59a3699e434\n\nSo not only did Pubmatic gain a greater share of the total advertising dollars in 2020, the overall advertising pie is going to grow as well. This rebound in ad spend is yet another tailwind for Pubmatic. If you\u2019re keeping count \u2013 that makes three so far:\n\n1. More ads are becoming digital\n\n2. More digital ads are becoming programmatic\n\n3. More overall ad spend in the future\n\n**Shut up and talk about the short interest!**\n\nSince short interest is what all the kids talk about these days, that was where we headed to next. In addition to looking at squeeze probability, it is good to know if a company is highly shorted. Most short-sellers know their stuff (except maybe Melvin), and if a company is highly shorted, it\u2019s usually for a reason. $PUBM has short interest that is estimated as high as 50% in some places. We actually believe this to be an inflation due to a quirk in the public float involving share types, which the aggregators such as Bloomberg and others haven\u2019t caught on to yet (will explain later). There is a chance we are incorrect about this, but according to our calculations, the short interest is closer to the 20% mark - which of course, is still very high. Price peaked at $77 during the first week in March, and shorts have hammered it ever since. The question is, why?\n\n**The insider lockup**\n\nLike most newly IPO\u2019d companies, there was an insider share lockup. These insider shares were mostly of the class B variety; these were shares awarded to VC firms and investors that have been with the company since its inception in 2008. PUBM announced during the Spring that those insiders with class B shares (of which there are 40+ million of), were free to sell as of 6/1. While we don\u2019t know if this is what short-sellers had in mind, it is probably a safe bet. A similar situation happened to PLTR a few months back when they had their own insider lockup expiration. So the next question is\u2026\n\n**Did the insiders sell?**\n\nSome did, but not many. It is estimated that roughly 4-6M class B insider shares have been sold - only one firm has liquidated, the other big players are still in. Why are they still in the game? $PUBM has an interesting quirk in their share and voting structure where class B shareholders hold a 10:1 voting advantage over the class A (public float) holders. Their one class B share gets 10 votes per share, vs our 1 vote per class A share. If you want to still retain voting power within the company, you really do not want to sell your class B shares. Furthermore, if class B shareholders sell, it consolidates the voting power of the remaining class B shareholders. Why this is important is because everytime a class B share is sold, it converts to a class A public share; this is what is missing when everyone talks about the short interest. Some of these class B holders have sold, converting their shares into class A and thus increasing the public float, and diluting the short interest. However, most insiders have held - and will most likely continue to hold if they still want a voting stake within the company. Worth noting is that two of the biggest holders, VC firms Nexus India Capital and August Capital, both have seats on the Board of Directors - so it is unlikely that they will sell a meaningful amount any time soon. So the lockup has come and gone without too much damage - share price bottomed out and has now increased. Why else would someone be short?\n\n**The privacy wave**\n\nConsumer data has been called the oil of our generation. All of the data that is generated on your devices is sold, recorded, and analyzed. Companies do this in order to serve you targeted ads based on your spending habits and characteristics. In the past, all of this has been done without the full knowledge or consent of the end user (you). Once people started to realize just how far the tracking had gone, governments and individuals started to demand better privacy from adtech companies. Apple has been leading this effort across the board since privacy has become part of their brand image. Agencies and advertisers have become drunk off of readily available third party consumer data and as the privacy wave makes its way across the world, we\u2019re going to see less third party data available to advertisers. \n\nLast year, Google said they would start phasing out browsers from accepting the third-party cookies that help advertisers, publishers and data brokers profile you to help advertisers target ads toward you. The change would prevent an adtech company  (PUBM) that recorded your visit to a trading website from later showing you ads for that stupid day trader guy with long red hair and a beard (I know you\u2019ve seen those ads before). This in effect would hinder all adtech companies from doing what they do. \n\nBut this dropped two days ago (6/23) \n\n[https://www.cnet.com/news/google-delays-chromes-cookie-blocking-privacy-plan-by-nearly-2-years/](https://www.cnet.com/news/google-delays-chromes-cookie-blocking-privacy-plan-by-nearly-2-years/)\n\nGoogle delayed this cookie phasing out until 2023 so the show goes on (Leo trading gif). \n\n**But cookies ARE eventually going away, right?**\n\nThe adtech industry is addressing this with the use of identifiers, typically in the form of hashed email addresses or phone numbers that are collected upfront from the end users. Pubmatic has been working vigorously on getting these identifiers put in place through the use of their identity hub product, which is identifier agnostic. There is a lot of speculation surrounding which of these identifiers will end up winning, but since Pubmatic can integrate with any of them, they don\u2019t much care which one wins out in the end. Pubmatic\u2019s management will need to keep a close eye on the privacy developments as they move forward, because the sunset of the third party cookie won\u2019t be the only problem. That said, the adtech industry is notoriously finicky, and Pubmatic has been able to keep up with the times. Management has repeatedly said that they take a long term approach toward their investments, and I expect them to continue to be able to deliver value to publishers and agencies as these investments like Identity Hub pay out. While the privacy wave is a headwind, Pubmatic has been working on addressing it for years now. In aggregate, Pubmatic has a lot more going for it than against it. Next stop\u2026 financials.\n\n**Financials.**\n\n*Revenue acceleration* (% are YoY growth rates - from right to left) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xatm11bo4l971.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7309e0ed0a96f48232d5cdf267a3105088e86241\n\nI\u2019ve seen this sort of thing in the past (Etsy, Livongo, The Trade Desk for example) where a company finds its stride. This revenue growth is twice that of the larger industry, so we can assume that Pubmatic has indeed found its stride and is gaining market share. Management has echoed this sentiment.  \n\nOne important risk to note is that Verizon Media accounts for 20% of their total revenue (taken from their first quarter prepared remarks):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ykm8t4at4l971.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08551f2ffad273a1601db701fe558a671e050064\n\nIt\u2019s good that this percentage has been coming down as they gain market share, but we\u2019ll want to keep an eye on that over time to make sure it continues to trend in the right direction. Also the partnership is growing over time - this is an example of SSP consolidation.\n\n*Gross Profit:*\n\nPubmatic operates with a high gross margin, as you would expect from a cloud-based software company. Their gross profit has also been trending upwards, so they are gaining more efficiency as they develop. Their long term gross margin target is 70%, which has already been achieved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dc70fn7s4l971.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83f35e2160b8e1fe72a6a7265dddf7c7c16258bb\n\n*Net Income:*\n\nWhat\u2019s more, their 2020 net profit fell in line with a highly efficient cloud computing company.\n\nWall Street analysts aren\u2019t predicting their profitability properly. If we assume a 20% net margin on $200 million in revenue for 2021, earnings per share is going to be 81 cents based on 49 million outstanding. Current estimates are only showing a high estimate of 38 cents per share, much lower than what should be achievable for Pubmatic. They\u2019ve already handily beat earnings for Q1 so they are well on their way toward the \\~80 cents figure. If they can hit these numbers, **their PEG stands at .63** at the time of writing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7m4j82nu4l971.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cd86187230bf538302d98f4b3c5dd9f86de06a3\n\n*Financial summary:*\n\nPubmatic is a highly profitable company, in a growth industry, that is stealing market share, and has **no debt**. Wall Street is underestimating them, while trading at a lower valuation than competitors (https://twitter.com/HsSajwani/status/1403342066445283330/photo/1). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a77fasyv4l971.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6d27426fbe56a2787b39f66e2a8abd6f56e184e\n\n**In closing**\n\nWe don\u2019t know why anyone would be short this company. Maybe there is something under the hood that we are not privy to, but we only know what\u2019s publicly available, and everything looks really clean. I suspect shorts are closing - there\u2019s no reason not to. But the beauty of this potential play is you can attack this from multiple angles. Want to play the short squeeze? Go ahead - it\u2019s a possibility. Want to play the value investor? That works too - Pubmatic is undervalued compared to its peers. How about growth? The digital advertising industry is accelerating, and PUBM is still trading at levels below its valuation.  How about a market mechanics liquidity play (see the bonus section)? Want to play the chart? Easy reversal pattern and ride that trend with the accompanying volume. \n\nBottom line is, most trading opportunities offer one or two avenues for profitability - PUBM has lots of different pathways for success - pick a path that suits your risk tolerance and hope the market doesn\u2019t shit itself.\n\nA wise trader once told me,\n\n\u201cYou can either trade for justice, or for profit, but not both\u201d.\n\nPubmatic may just offer the rare opportunity to trade for both. \n\n**The plan**\n\nShares and the limited calls are what\u2019s recommended for now. As some of you may have noticed, PUBM did not have an options chain up until 6/25. Some limited strike prices have been added, but still not enough. Pound \u2018em and make our friendly brokerages add more. PUBM managed to get to $77 without the aid of options leverage so I see no reason why a revisit of that price is unattainable by summer\u2019s end with the company and industry tailwinds. Considering that any case for shorting PUBM has been removed, it appears a new trend is starting. Where things may get a little spicy is in the bonus section - and it is in regards to the restricted liquidity. \n\n**Bonus section - \u201cif it ain\u2019t tight, it ain\u2019t right\u201d**\n\nThe liquidity for PUBM is very, very tight. If you\u2019ve been watching the intraday movements at all, you\u2019ll notice a barren orderbook, with share bid/ask spreads routinely above $.50, and sometimes even in the dollar range. Exacerbating the already restricted float is the high institutional ownership - which currently sits at 74%. With most of the shares sitting in the coffers of big players, there aren\u2019t many shares exchanging hands on a day-to-day basis - which makes for wild price swings.  What makes this interesting is that as mentioned in the paragraph above - options were just introduced as of 2 weeks ago. This is very unusual for a $1.5B market cap company that has been traded for over 6 months. Only minimal strike prices and dates have been added thus far, with more additions anticipated. The more strikes that get added, and the more OTM call bombs that people lob PUBM\u2019s way, the more interesting and volatile things can get. I say again, PUBM accelerated into the 70\u2019s after IPO, without the aid of options dynamite. With the company and industry headwinds dulled for now, sprinkle in the FD leverage and anyone short should probably pack up their bag, cash in their tickets, and GTFO. \n\nTrade responsibly and good luck!",

        "selftext": "**Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation and Analysis (Q2 Week 3) - $TSLA, $AAPL, $AMZN, $MSFT, $GOOG, $FB, $AMD, and More**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat's poppin' bull gang, I hope you made some awesome money last week! The spreadsheet was spot on for nearly every company, and all of my plays came to fruition! **$MT and $X ended up bagging us anywhere from 300% to 500%, $JETS gave us 1100%, and $SNAP netted us 250% on our strangles and nearly 600% on binary options!** I\u2019m looking to keep this momentum going throughout this week as well, and with all of FAAMG (I kicked $NFLX out for $MSFT after their disgraceful earnings) set to report, this week could prove to be more lucrative than the last! We\u2019ve got a large variety of trades we can make this week ranging from educated gambles, to good old fashioned theta plays. We\u2019ve even have a couple of opportunities to sprinkle in some collateral plays if we wish! Let\u2019s get into it! \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Pinterest is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $PINS has had an average post earnings move of **14%**. The options this week are pricing in a move of *roughly 6%* on both sides of the chain, which is likely going to shrink significantly going into earnings as theta eats away at the contracts. Even though I\u2019m extremely bullish on $PINS, this trade could honestly move either way, so I\u2019m personally opting to play a straddle like I did with $SNAP last week. Given that we get a historically average move, we\u2019ll be making some money on this trade. Keep in mind, this trade *is* riskier than the one we played on $SNAP, since the average historical move is smaller. Don\u2019t over leverage yourself, and don\u2019t be afraid to turn the straddle into a reverse iron butterfly to reduce your cost basis on the trade.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Over the past 24 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time!** The odds on this trade are phenomenal, and we have quite a few options for how we want to play it.  If you want to gamble directionally, call debit spreads would be your best bet from a risk to reward standpoint. Alternatively, we can also join theta-gang for this play by selling ATM put credit spreads allowing us to net some extremely nice premiums. If you want an even safer spread, $MSFT also has a similar win-rate (~65%) while having a historically smaller move, allowing you to defend your capital in the event that the trade goes against you. Since both $SHOP and $MSFT report on different days, we can look to make this play twice to ensure we\u2019re not overleveraged on any given day.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Counterintuitively, $XLE is NOT a good [collateral play](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays) this week!** $XLE actually has a *higher* IV than both $XOM and $CVS, so if you wanted to play oil earnings, you\u2019d actually be better off rolling the dice on the individual companies. I\u2019m not sure why this is the case here. Either the MMs are catching onto my bullshit (unlikely), or there\u2019s some nuances to trading oil that I\u2019m not aware of.  I\u2019m sure there\u2019s an arbitrage play you could make regarding the individual price and IV differences proportional to the ETF holdings, but I don\u2019t have time to crunch the numbers nor do I think I\u2019d have enough capital to abuse it. Regardless, I just wanted to bring this to everyone\u2019s attention since this is one of the rare cases where the collateral play puts us at a disadvantage.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll that being said, I haven\u2019t had much time to review any extra trades given that I\u2019ve been extremely busy this weekend. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nWe\u2019ve got another fun week of earnings ahead of us! I personally tend to avoid playing FAANG stocks in general, so my analysis was concentrated elsewhere. If you see any appealing plays, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you\u2019d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**",

        "selftext": "I signed up with WISH app while doing my personal WISH DD to understand more about the experience as a user. I\u2019m currently a WISH investor with 2200 shares at an average of $9.4, my views may be biased and all views are welcomed!\n\nTo start this off, here are some of my favourite comments that I read about WISH and my thoughts:\n\n1. \u201cWISH sells trash.\u201d I don\u2019t totally disagree with this. Even if 2 genius-level intellects consummate and have 10 kids, surely there will be at least one kid that is \u201cnot too bright\u201d I guess. With WISH we\u2019re now looking at over 800k merchants and hundreds of millions of products. There are bound to be trashy stuff, this is the same with Amazon, same with Taobao. \n2. \u201cI don\u2019t invest in Chinese stocks.\u201d Maybe this stupid ape mixed up WISH with another company. We can actually Wiki this, WISH is an American online e-commerce platform (based in San Francisco, United States) that facilitates transactions between sellers and buyers. (But they do have a significant number of merchants from China, this is the same with Amazon, same with Taobao.)\n3. \u201cWISH sells Chinese junk.\u201d Similar to point 1, but will just like to bring us back to reality that made in China products are here to stay whether we like it or not. I can\u2019t think of another country with a bigger population of people that works as hard, fast or cheap. China produce about almost everything from cars, to smartphones, tablets, stupid plastic toys, big city skyscrapers etc you name it. Look around your home and you\u2019ll probably find something that\u2019s made in China. Tesla cars, Iphones and many more big brand names are also made in China.\n4. \u201cScam. You\u2019re going to wait months for something which may never come.\u201d As a WISH user, I\u2019m going to have to say that this is a myth. WISH is not a scam. $2.5b revenues in 2020, projected $3.2b revenues in 2021 and over 100m monthly active users are facts. If the product you want is not available, it will be reflected as sold out. When you place your purchase for an item which is available, it will come. Like most good e-commerce platforms, you\u2019ll be able to check your order status (processed, shipped, arrival date etc) via the WISH app and there\u2019s immediate 24/7 customer support whenever you need it. If you want your items urgently, you can pay more for WISH Express. But, if you\u2019re like most WISH users that are buying not through a search query and instead from personalized browsing (basically it\u2019s mostly impulse buys and not needs based), you can probably wait for your items to arrive which lowers the cost base. And no, it won\u2019t take months. WISH quotes me an estimated 2-3 weeks for my items to arrive and I usually get them before the actual projected arrival date. \n5. \u201cGoodluck with your imitation crap that you purchased.\u201d This comment reminds me of the time when I was studying as a kid, my teacher used to say that copying from my classmates was wrong. As an adult now, I will like to share with her a quote from Oscar Wilde, \u201cImitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness.\u201d This next quote is from me. \u201cIn the business world, no amount of copying is bad unless we\u2019re copying crap.\u201d \n6. \u201cDishonest management, just look at the number of Class Action Lawsuits.\u201d On the contrary, imo one of the strongest points which keeps me convicted on WISH is actually their stellar management team and how they are incentivised for their stock price to do well over the long term through stock based compensation with future vesting periods. Although not exactly the same, it reminds me of how Steve Jobs was paid $1 and the rest through Apple stocks. Just do a search on WISH management and you\u2019ll see many familiar names to get excited about: Joe Lonsdale (ex palantir co-founder), Jacqueline Reses (ex Square Capital, ex board on Ali Baba), Farhang Kassaei (ex-Google, ex-Ebay) just to name a few. WISH is also in the select group of companies where their CEO (Piotr Szulczewski) is also the founder. Considering the amount of skin he has in the game as the founder, as a major shareholder and having rejected all the attractive buy-out offers in the past... I think it\u2019s quite safe to say that he is not looking for quick short term profits and that he has big, ambitious goals for his \u201cbaby\u201d WISH over the longer term. On the other hand, look into the Law firms and you may find no less than 50 companies per year that they are encouraging investors to file class action suits on. I\u2019m a WISH investor just as a number of you are... do go ahead and join the class actions if you really think you can get any form of settlement. Personally I didn\u2019t bother as many class actions from Law Firms just have no real basis or settlement results to show for and it feels to me like an advertising gimmick to slap their firm name on or some part of the manipulation game, a big waste of my time to even read really.\n7. \u201cLook at the net loss and profit margins, WISH is not a profitable company.\u201d Here is where we may have 2 schools of thought and the decision is entirely yours to make. Do we want to invest in a company that is contented at where they are, ie show healthy net profits and pass on those profits to their shareholders. Or, do we want to invest in a company that is ambitious, thinks big picture and re-invests those profits for explosive long term growth. WISH made revenues of $2.5b in 2020, projected $3.2b for 2021, and unlike many tech companies, this early stage tech set up can actually show net profits at any moment just by cutting back on sales and marketing expenses (look at their balance sheet). But instead, they are re-investing most of their profits into customer acquisition/retention, logistics infrastructure, scaling wish local, adding new merchants, product categories etc. Re-investing for growth is personally what I think separates a great company from a good one and I\u2019d hate to invest into a company which passes their profits to their investors via share buybacks or dividends as it just displays to me a lack of innovation, that they do not know how or what to do with their profits to scale or advance growth. Amazon in their early stages warned their investors that they would re-invest their profits in the best interests of their shareholders for the long term, the smart and patient ones that stuck with them through the years deserve to be where they are today.\n\nWhy I\u2019m a happy user of the WISH app:\n\nFor WISH users the satisfaction really comes from finding the gems, which is also probably the main reason why the average time spent per user on WISH app are far more than any other e-commerce platforms. Unlike fucking a dead fish, it is just so much more interactive and fun shopping with WISH app. Gems are basically good quality products with crazy cheap prices. A recent gem I found from WISH was a soundbar for my gaming needs which costs $24, it\u2019s about half metre long and I\u2019m serious when I say the sound and bass is unbelievably solid for the price that I\u2019m paying. I will like to encourage anyone to just log into WISH app to discover the gems for yourself to truly understand what I\u2019m saying, just search under \u201cWISH select\u201d and there are already tons of solid products which are cheap and good with many verified user reviews.\n\nJust be warned:\n\nAs a WISH user, it all starts with WISH app prompting users to log in to the app with gamification, flash sales etc. And when you eventually do decide to see what they have to offer (with no obligations of course). The software prompts further discounts (from already very Low prices) for immediate purchases, adding in similar or complimentary product recommendations based on data and advanced algorithms... it\u2019s like a dollar store on steroids. Most users and especially existing users like myself (with address/payment details done) conveniently make the purchases sooner rather than later and when we do, we potentially buy in quantity because of the low prices and understanding on the 2-3 weeks wait time. This brings me to another point: In order to truly enjoy the experience as a WISH app user, your expectations must be accustomed that lower prices come with a longer wait time. Good buys come with discovery.\n\nIn summary:\n\nThis is not financial advise, buy or sell as you $WISH... I\u2019m just sharing my thoughts on what I believe to be an undervalued, underestimated powerhouse and hope to understand the views of others on this topic. I\u2019m a long term investor and don\u2019t expect WISH to pop immediately... I feel that it needs some time to mature and I will wait out the manipulation/accumulation phase. I believe that WISH is a 20x multi-bagger (my target price: $200) that is going to give the big boys in e-commerce a good run for their money especially once they awaken with the following:\n\n1. To have a fully comprehensive catalogue of products with different price ranges, moving upstream to touch a wider demographic audience. \n2. Filling in the gaps for product categories which are lacking right now in WISH app such as grocery products that are used daily by average consumers that require routine replacement or replenishment (eg: food, beverages and household products.)\n3. Increased sign ups of WISH users with stronger demographic profiles that prioritize services (branded product range, speed of delivery etc) over savings, this in turn potentially allows for rapid expansion on their logistics platform and accelerated growth in logistics/transaction revenues.\n4. Establishing WISH as a global brand and expansion of in-house WISH products. WISH seems to be trending more than just a cool ticker, it\u2019s also trending as a cool brand with low priced, good quality in-house WISH products on their platform (such as WISH branded hoodies, t-shirts, charging cables, sun-glasses, bags etc). Back in the days, who knew a tick mark with the word Nike would move on to become a global top selling brand. Personally, I love the cool simplicity of the WISH logo and their mission to bring affordable and entertaining mobile e-commerce to consumers around the world including the underserved. With over 300,000 WISH T-shirts sold currently, in my mind it hints the potentiality of how the WISH branding might scale, in an internet world of social media trendings and smartphones.\n5. Tapping on Jacqueline Reses\u2019 (ex-square) expertise and experience to accelerate their entry into payment and financial services which will further monetize their growing merchants and user base. Imo their user base is likely to grow rapidly regardless of what haters are saying. As a WISH user myself, I can only say that my experience with WISH is just starting and it\u2019s worth referring my friends. I believe this experience is not unique to me and that I\u2019m just one out of many users that loves WISH app and the WISH brand. With over 100m monthly active users, over 500m total WISH users, over 3m of items sold daily, most downloaded app globally for past 3 years, we can\u2019t be getting it all wrong. As the saying goes, it only takes a spark to get a fire going. \n6. Expansion in WISH Local Merchant base. WISH is strategically focusing and expanding WISH Local and I can understand why. Imo this is the most underestimated revenue generating model that they have, and one that can pose a serious threat to Shopify. Wish Local can potentially create a sustainable ecosystem and rapid revenue growth while offering a lifeline for brick and mortar retailers to succeed in an era of disruptive tech and innovation fast forwarded by the pandemic. WISH will be able to store their inventory orders with WISH local merchants, saving costs on storage and last mile delivery (This also translates to reduction in time taken for delivery and further cost savings for consumers). WISH local merchants get to increase their personal product sales through WISH inventory pick ups as it translates to increased customer footprint and potential sales opportunities. Wish local Merchants can also tap on the millions of WISH users by advertising their products through the platform. It\u2019s basically a potentially easy win for WISH, their merchants, their customers and ultimately shareholders.\n\nIn addition to the above potential catalysts:\n\n1. WISH have massive cash on hand of about $2b and no long term debts (Reduced risks from inflation fears + potential buy out candidate) \n2. Strong potential growth in WISH users spending and new user sign ups from their existing marketing strategies, pandemic driven consumer behaviour towards digital/online shopping, referrals/word of mouth from existing users and social media hype. WISH also participates in an huge e-commerce market that\u2019s expected to reach $4.5T by 2024, benefits from emerging countries/markets growth and is also a large beneficiary from the huge market of Gen Zs. (Potential monster earnings growth + COVID play) \n3. Super undervalued at $6b market cap vs $3.2b revenue projections. Great entry point below $10, we\u2019ll have an average which is below most retail and institutional buy in. At these prices we\u2019re looking at a 60% discount from IPO and 70% discount from all time highs. This is imo the last e-commerce powerhouse which still haven\u2019t popped, just take a look at Etsy, Shopify, Sea Limited to name a few. If you see bear reports on WISH, like as if they had a crystal ball telling you where the stock is headed, please think through whether if it sounds logical or suspect to you. All I can say is that trust no one but yourself and your DD, it\u2019s your hard earned savings after all. To share a true story: When NIO stock dipped to $10 from $15 back in July 2020, a friend of mine sold all his holdings at a loss trusting on a report from Zacks and \u201canalysts\u201d and bought other stocks recommended by the same \u201canalysts\u201dwhich were deemed \u201csafer\u201d. Almost just after he sold, NIO went on to 6x within 6 months and today he is still in the red. I don\u2019t hope this for anyone, but in summary, weak hands that lack conviction or patience may regret months down the road when they make silly decisions. Maybe that\u2019s just another catalyst and what it takes for a stock to rocket, when the weak hands are shaken out and new short positions opened based on bear reports. (Reduced downside risks vs potential upside + squeeze play.)",
