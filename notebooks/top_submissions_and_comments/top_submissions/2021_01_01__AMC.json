        "selftext": "Guys, first off i\u2019ve been part of this community for only a short time, a little bit before this whole short interest craze but I seriously love the amazing things we\u2019ve done for peoples lives. I\u2019ve read about college kids paying off their student loans, people being able to afford to pay for family members cancer treatment, pet owners being able to afford their pups surgery. It\u2019s incredible and I couldn\u2019t be more proud to know I have a stake in this historical moment in time with all of you. \nYou see those headlines? That pushback from the big suits of wall street? WE did that. Together. If today was any indication at all, they are shitting their pants right now. I urge all of you to hold AMC and take advantage of dips if you\u2019re inclined to do so. Please do not fall for hedge funds manipulating the market to send you into a panic sell frenzy. The squeeze may not be tomorrow, and maybe not Monday, but it\u2019s coming. I was DEEP in the red today and in any other scenario, I\u2019d be panicking but this is bigger than me. It\u2019s bigger than you, yes you reading this. This is a chance for us to come together as a collective and revolutionize the economy for better. \nDo your DD, stay on the ball, don\u2019t let emotions cloud your judgement.

AMC Has a High Short Interest % [https://www.highshortinterest.com/](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)\n\nAMC is #2 on the list with a whopping 78.97% of float being shorted. and looking at the % held by institutions( 37.24% ) and assuming that these institutions are long on the stock, we're looking a short to float percentage of about **116.21%.** \n\nIf this is not enough to cause a short squeeze I don't know what will.\n\n# 2. AMC Got 2 Big Unexpected News.\n\nJust like how Ryan Cohen's involvement has started this crazy investing phenomena, AMC has also receive a bunch of unexpected news that caught the ears of boomer investors. \n\nRecently it has received a lot of funding to not go bankrupt and even wiped off their debt by diluting shares. This was a great move as many investors will be looking forward to hop in for brighter prospect of the company. Plus with the vaccines being released AMC will get back on their feet in no time. Also, since they recently raised money by diluting shares and wiping away their debt, there won't be more share dilution in the near future.\n\nLastly, with the whole GME scandal, it received soooo much coverage on media and the public  which is only going to hurt the shorts. \n\n# 3. New Shorts are In The House\n\nIf you look at [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/amc](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/amc) and [https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc](https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc) The shares available to short has gone down significantly. JUST 4 days ago the short availability was at **7 million** and now this morning it went all the way down to **500**(0 on fintel). \n\nThis means a lot of shorts possibly jumped in due to the recent jump in the stock price. However, what they don't realize is that this is an unprecedented time where millions of retailers are buying the stock to HOLD...because they like the stock. Not to bring down corrupt hedge fund fuckers of course. \n\n# 4. GME Steam Has Cooled Off a Bit\n\nI know I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this last point but, personally, I think GME has potentially gone up to a point where retailers are not hopping in as much because of the high stock price but the ones who already got in are holding/adding to force the shorts to cover. This could explain why it really hasn't moved all that much in the past 2 days(except when it went down to like $132) despite people saying there will be a gamma squeeze today.\n\nAMC is sitting at $13.00 as of now and it is at a relatively more \"desirable\" price for normal people to hop in. Psychologically it FEELS better to hold 30 stocks than 1 stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not suggesting you should sell GME and buy AMC but I can see about 5x return on AMC and about 3x return on GME in the near future. and I like to make more money so my money goes to AMC. I can write about how I got those 3x and 5x but that's for next time.",

        "selftext": "I just wanted to throw this out there in the middle of the outrage, in the hopes that someone can take it in and strategize, rather than be upset. Worked @ Merril as an analyst from 2015-2017.\n\nI also like to keep it concise so follow along. This ain't a fucking Qanon fan fiction.\n\nDisclaimer: I own GME. This is not financial advice. This is just some dude chatting with his old buddies.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n1) **Robinhood, restrictions, suppression**: \n\nWhen you place an order through RH, Citadel or some other HFT front runs your trade and pockets the spread; However, the transaction is not complete.\n\nEnter: Clearing house. The clearing house is the intermediary between the counter-parties. Because they stand between sellers &amp; buyers, they have very defined levels of risk, risk management and regulation to be in front of.  The clearing house is who gives you the \"title\" for your shares, the folks who make it official.\n\n**What Likely Happened**: The risk department retard @ the clearing house, who does jack shit all year other than flag Stacy's trade so he can get some face time with her runs to the C-Suite frazzled; He has looked at option open interest expiring this week, has done the math and there simply isn't enough float for GME in anyway, shape or form; turns out WSB is printing out their stock certificates and burying them in the Mojave Desert. It's simply not enough.\n\nIn addition, they got a Snapchat from SEC/OCC which said hey, if you fucking keep selling open positions, you're on your own; we ain't gonna help you it. SEC is sneaky like that; they like sending messages through the backdoor, not the front because they used to be hedgies themselves. If you're not following, Front door is making a public statement while the backdoor is a threat sent to an intermediary who you and millions of investors don't even know exists.\n\nSo, they call up the risk department at RH and tell em to stop fucking selling GME, there simply isn't enough float, the SEC told the clearing house they're on their own and who tf is gonna take the blame/liability if there's a \"failure to deliver\"? \n\n---------------------------\n\n2) **Failure to Deliver**:\n\nThis is a pretty fucking big deal. Bigger than you imagine, because it's basically a slam-dunk law suit. \n\nFailure to deliver means that one of the counterparties (in this case, RH or the clearing house) has failed to deliver you a contractually obligated position, profit or certificate. Since there's no float and ITM calls get exercised by HFT bots at the end of the day, how in the fucking hell are they gonna deliver the option holders their contractually obligated merchandise if there is no merchandise to be delivered? There simply isn't enough for everyone.\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n3) **Liability**: \n\nYou must be asking so what? Fuck them; They should be the ones figuring it out and they gotta give me, the customer, the right to choose or whatever the fuck; That sounds great in a boomer fashion but it's not that simple. Robinhood is contractually obligated to deliver you those shares or positions. If they fail to, they become liable for any losses or profits that you may have endured and they will LOSE in court cause they FAILED to DELIVER. How many people have options on GME on RH? Half? Imagine if half of these fine RH customers were legally owed benefits and they were engaged in lawsuits with Robinhood. There would be no Robinhood left. There would likely be no clearing house left.\n\nHence: Bad Decision &gt; Bankruptcy or worse (WSB finds Vlad's mom and becomes her boyfriend collectively)\n\nWhat will happen now: Based on my previous short squeezes, Friday (tomorrow) will be nuts; All this gamma has to go somewhere and since there's not enough float, I'm guessing up up up up up.\n\nI personally don't believe it was out of malice or a coordination for RH; there's definitely coordination all around, but occam's razor says this is not such an ordeal.\n\n---------------------------\n\n- **TL;DR**: There's simply not enough float and the broker/clearing house will fail to deliver if they keep letting new positions be opened, hence restrictions.\n\n\nCouple of semi-related notes:\n\n-Fuck Billionaires. Parasites of modern society, simply existing to leech off every slurp of alpha and take up resources meant for billions of poor people. Burn them in the street, shoot them in the head, whatever is needed to discourage hoarding of resources of this tiny fucking planet.\n\n-I very much doubt that Ken Griffin and Citadel (the HF) would engage in blatant market manipulation or coercion of Robinhood or other brokers to make a few bucks on Gamestop or AMC. They cleared over 6 billion net last year, so just logically, it seems pretty unlikely to risk it for this. It is also very unlikely that Citadel Securities would engage in illegal behavior for the profit of Citadel, simply because it's such a money maker. If you were an evil genius, would you let your money maker go to shit because you were getting squeezed on some short?\n\n-The media just wants clicks and engagement, so they will bring the worst people on, simply to pad their own bottom line. Don't get engaged. Don't give in to them. Be the captain of your own ship and fuck over wall-street however you please.",

I decided to do my own Due Diligence (DD) to determine which stocks I will be holding next week, and hopefully this can start up a meaningful conversation in the comment section to help out our new friends who mostly want to know what to invest in.  I pulled the top 15 stocks with the greatest Options Volume from Friday (1/29). You can see all 4 of the $BANG stocks make this list. Despite understanding that GME is a heavily shorted stock with a Short Float greater than 100%, it is important to look at the Put Volume as well. This is the numbers of option contracts that are shorting the stock. GameStop is the only company of the batch that has a Short Float of greater than 100%, which is why this short squeeze is working so well, but it\u2019s also the most heavily shorted on the options side. I think it\u2019s important to see all 4 of the BANG stocks are heavily shorted on the put side too. If you look up who is buying these Put Contracts, it is mostly big institutional investors, whose best interest is to artificially depress the stock price so their puts pay out (look at what happened to BB and NOK on Thursday and Friday). This is why we have to stand together as a community and embrace the $BANG index that we created.\n\n**GME** \\- This is a short squeeze. Not much to say here. Buy, hold, don\u2019t sell.\n\n**BB** \\- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. 66% of the float (shares available) are owned by institutional investors, so while the float might seem big (550M), we are only dealing with 34% of the shares. Buy, hold, don\u2019t sell.\n\n**AMC** \\- Also a short squeeze. The Short float isn\u2019t above 100% but this is still a great potential candidate.\n\n**NOK** \\- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. This is the weirdest one to me because everyone was claiming this was \u201cbot\u201d propaganda last week and then has the 3rd highest option volume on Friday. Not sure how to feel about this one, but hey its popular.\n\n**Defining some terms:**\n\n**Short Float:** Percentage of shorted shares in relation to the total number of floated shares (shares available to be traded)\n\n**Options Volume:** Total number of **option** contracts bought and sold for the day\n\n**% Put:** Percentage of total option contracts that are puts (think the stock will go down)\n\n**% Call:** Percentage of total option contracts that are calls (think the stock will go up)\n\n**Put/Call Ratio:** Ratio of puts to calls option contracts (higher the ratio, higher the short %)\n\n**FAQ:**\n\n\\-Where did I get this chart from? [https://www.barchart.com/options/most-active/stocks](https://www.barchart.com/options/most-active/stocks)\n\n\\-Which Stocks do I own? I own all 4 $BANG stocks\n\n\\-Which options should I buy?

        "selftext": "This sub appears to have saved two companies from possible bankruptcy over the last week.\n\nIt\u2019s important to realize that when you purchase a stock, the money you pay does not go to the company, it goes to the previous owner of that share. By buying stock you\u2019re owning a (often) tiny piece of that company from someone else, unless the company itself did a direct stock offering their own. \n\nIf you want to inject cash into a company the best way to do this is bonds which are basically loans, but this is WSB and no one is interested in a low risk return of 4% over half a decade.\n\nAMC and AA were able to take advantage of the insane stock surge to offer new stocks, with which they received a cash injection of 300M and 1.3B over the last week respectively.\n\nFrom Bloomberg News:\n\n*\u201cAmerican Airlines revealed plans on Friday to sell as much as $1.1 billion of stock through what is known as an at-the-market program, which allows companies to issue additional shares at market prices. The announcement came after their stock was up as much as 38% at its peak last week.*\n\n*Just a couple days earlier, AMC said it had raised more than $300 million through a similar program. Investment firm Silver Lake, one of the company\u2019s main creditors, also seized on AMC\u2019s surge to convert $600 million of bonds into equity, before selling the shares in the open market for a gain of over $100 million.\u201d*\n\nThat\u2019s insane, obviously there\u2019s others buying shares but it started on Reddit, the momentum, hype, initial rallies..... led to the bailout of two multi billion dollar companies facing the very real risk of bankruptcy. Redditors probably just saved AMC and AA which is mind blowing to realize.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-31/the-reddit-army-bailout-desperate-companies-get-new-lifelines?srnd=premium&amp;sref=lmaDXFyR",

I have been in the fucking game for about seven years now. \n\nI don\u2019t typically do posts like this and so this is fucking new to me. Anyways, it seems like a shit ton of you are falling out of favor with NOK. I don\u2019t know what the fuck is wrong with you if you expected to gain a shit ton of money in a day, but what the fuck I have never seen such \ud83e\uddfb\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb in my fucking life for the past two days. \n\nAre you guys really just going to stand there and let the enemy beat the fuck out of us. \n\nAnd of course some of you are going to mention the total float as if that fucking matters because the stock is still cheap as fuck (for now lol \ud83d\ude80) and because we managed to trade one fucking fifth of all the NOK stocks in circulation. They literally had to stop our asses from buying a couple of times. Just like you autistic retards I have lost thousands of dollars in this shit. My paychecks, birthday money, dividends, money from the sale of blue chips and Ark ETFs, etc.\n\nSo where\u2019s the upside? Well let me fucking tell you where the upside is and when you can expect to pull off the biggest fucking heist alongside GME and AMC Wall Street will have ever seen. \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcb8\n\nNOK is well known to be the bigger beast when it comes to the BANG stocks (BB, AMC, NOK, GME). It has a fuck load of shares to go around and there\u2019s a lot of paperhanded pussies out there, so I understand why it may be daunting to expect a Juggernaut like NOK to moon anytime soon. \n\nBut it doesn\u2019t have to be. \n\nNOK releases its earnings on Thursday and its expected to blow the competition out of the fucking water. I wouldn\u2019t even be surprised at all if it were to get a higher price than ERIC in two weeks (hell, possibly by EOW). NOK even plans to merge with top tier companies in the near future due to their prowess in the 5G tech that they\u2019re developing. The \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b have had their big meaty claws ever since its ATH of $62 all those years ago. Do you really expect a change if you don\u2019t fucking BUY and fucking HOLD. No, with a team of fucking retarded  superstars in this sub, NOK is prepping for a fierce comeback in the upcoming weeks. GME is top dog right now, but let\u2019s be honest. GME hype can\u2019t last forever (even tho it can for a long time as long as we remain retarded). However being on team NOK makes me feel like I\u2019m on a loosing, shitty ass baseball team and no one is hitting over .100\n\nWhat\u2019s the plan, Stan?\n\nThe fucking plan is that you don\u2019t buy market price. You look at the ask price and you fucking buy it. This is how we destroy walls. The $5 barrier battle today was hard fought and we fucking lost to the hedge funds. This next week is going to be fucking spectacular \ud83e\ude84\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e and I need to know if my fucking NOKle heads are even in it to win it or just downright frauds. \n\nYou say NOK was a plan by the boys? Take a look at fucking BlackBerry. That shit took the same swerves NOK did that it\u2019s pretty much identical. If NOK is a sham, then the idea of the BANG stocks is a sham. \n\nI know for a fucking fact you don\u2019t believe that. I know that there\u2019s dreamers in this sub. I dream just like you. I am trying to build a life just like you guys are. We are in something way bigger than ourselves so if you can for ONCE IN YOUR LIFE consider that maybe that the process is a trustable process then maybe we can win this shit.\n\nIf NOK hits $50, I will literally buy new fucking silverware (like expensive handmade shit with sterling silver cutlery) and eat my own shit. I don\u2019t give a fuck whether you\u2019d want to see it or not, because honestly boys I\u2019d eat my shit to go to the moon and I am 200% willing to take one for the team. \n\nThis year, BANG is for real.\n\nSo hedgefunds, keep your ears out for the NOK NOK sounds on the door.

        "selftext": "Mom To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:\n\nAMC current status (30JAN2021) :\nAMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) \n\nNow what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. \n\nToday\u2019s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)\n\nSo Monday when they\u2019re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. \n\nBut this isn\u2019t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.\n\nOver the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. \n\nShort squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there\u2019s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we\u2019re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.\n\n1. HOLD\n2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it\u2019s going to violently rise\n3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it\u2019s highest.",

        "selftext": "Hear me out here. I think Nano is going to make us all rich. It's what's gonna get us all a Tesla, plus a second Tesla to launch to Jupiter and beyond \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Altstreetbets, the crypto buddy of this holy sub, [is already dtf with this](https://np.reddit.com/r/AltStreetBets/comments/l66mhv/the_gme_case_for_nano/).\n\n**# 1. What the f is Nano and why are you shilling this**\n\nTo keep it short for us retards: Nano is a cryptocurrency that boasts zero fees, instant transfers (sub-second), is green, and increases the size of your pp. It has a good claim to being better than Bitcoin but has 1/1500th its market cap. [Daddy Elon tweeted about whatever has least error &amp; latency will win](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1349977642708168704) \\- that shit is literally what Nano is.\n\n**# 2. We're in this together**\n\nApes together strong, right? Nano has a huge community, so big that most of the crypto subreddits aren't sure how to deal with the constant Nano enthusiasm. Not kidding, the banned Nanites could fill a subreddit by themselves. They're tireless on Reddit, Twitter, or anywhere else you dare utter that you pay fees for any crypto or money transfer. These are people that held through a 90% loss, then didn't sell when Nano suddenly pumped 400%. Diamond hands doesn't even begin to describe it. When the price pumped even slightly, they all jumped on it to pronounce Nano the best thing since before sliced bread, and went to town on Twitter and Reddit.\n\nMy point? **AMPLIFICATION**. As soon as Nano starts getting some price action, the Nanites will jump on it, will keep going, and they **ARE. NOT. LEAVING.**\n\n**# 3. Rumours of Nano being suppressed**\n\nThe rumour that Nano is being suppressed by crypto miners and Bitcoin maximalists has been around for a very long time, and it makes sense. Nano works ridiculously well, and is there to eat the cake of all the miners who are raking in millions a day. BTC maxis and miners *hate* the word Nano, and have a strong incentive to literally pay to have it disappear from the face of the earth. Bitcoin influencers on Twitter have muted the word Nano because they know their thesis is fucked when it gets mentioned.\n\nMy point? **F EM**. Bitcoin is king, Bitcoin was literally birthed by the virgin Mary, and everything else is a \ud83d\udca9coin that doesn't deserve to pump. **F THAT**. And F maximalism in general. We're here to make money, and Bitcoin doesn't offer enough gains.\n\n**# 4. Solid pumpamentals**\n\nAside from the strong community and the ridiculously good tech, it also has the other pumpamentals needed. It just got listed on AnchorUSD meaning it's now easy to buy in the US, and was recently added to KuCoin for 10x leveraged trading. Volume actively on the books on exchanges is low, right now it would take only $600k to pump it 30% on Binance pair. What else does it have as pumpamentals? The Nano team recently applied for the Coinbase listing and Coinbase just so happens to have removed pruning as a prerequisite from their website. Coincidence? Maybe, but when asked earlier Nano's lack of pruning was mentioned as the obstacle for a Coinbase listing. **COINS GETTING LISTED ON COINBASE ALWAYS PUMP BECAUSE COINBASE HAPPENS TO BUY A BUNCH OF WHATEVER THEY'RE LISTING BEFORE THEY LIST IT.**\n\nPlus, it seems like we would have Raoul Pal from Real Vision Group in our camp. When he recently asked for altcoin recommendations the Nano Twitter shills did their job as usual, he replied to them it was a good thread. Coincidentally there was a huge (for Nano) buy order right around that time.\n\nMore pumpamentals? The Nano tagline writes itself. It transfers in the blink of an eye, it has no fees, it's greener than the big dildo that's currently fucking Melvin Capital, has the best wallet in all of crypto and can be demonstrated to anyone within a minute. It's the ultimate antidote to the high fees narrative of Bitcorn, and shames institutions for holding a CO2 emitting coal guzzler on their balance sheets through Bitcorn. As soon as the price starts going up, this thing sells itself. Hell, institutions can even buy it since recently through Bitcoin Suisse, where Nano was added because of demand. And keep in mind - this has a market cap of $450 million. Throwing $100 at Nano does more than throwing $1000 at AMC.\n\nMy point? Well, exactly the title. **SOLID PUMPAMENTALS**. Seriously this thing is so ready to be hyped.\n\n**# 5. The plan**\n\nAm I saying to leverage this x100 to pump it into the skies? Maybe, but also no. I am saying that whatever you do, Nano is going to pump anyway because if us retards can figure it out, others can too. This shit can be 10x leveraged on KuCoin without even needing to do KYC. I'm doing that right now, and am expecting you all to do the same. At a 3000% gain ($100) we can call this a success, if it gets to $250 I'll buy the top comment on this post a Tesla because fuck it, I'll be rich.\n\n**My credentials?** My post karma when I posted this on another sub was 420. Due to the mass upvotes my total karma has now increased to 1337. I'm counting on this post shooting me to 42069. Need I say more?\n\nPositivity, not disagreeing with anything I've said and more examples of solid pumpamentals (also places to leverage it more than 10x) are welcome in the comments \u2b07\n\nPROOF OR BAN [https://i.imgur.com/9eHQw6K.png](https://i.imgur.com/9eHQw6K.png)",

        "selftext": "First of all let me pay my respects to the king $GME. Now that $GME is on the verge of squeezing it appears that $AMC has been anointed as $GME's little brother. This is a mistake because $AMC is diluting via debt to equity swaps and other forms of dilution. $AMC did a 600m debt to equity swap from silverlake this week and I believe they will sell more shares into the market this week or next week to deal with their debt load and lack of cash flow. $AMC is going to take this opportunity to de-lever and avoid bankruptcy. As more $AMC shares are created the squeeze will end.   \n\n\n$BBBY is more similar to $GME and it was Michael Burry's second biggest holding behind $GME. $BBBY and $GME both have cash on their balance sheet, generate free cash flow, and have their debt under control. $BBBY is buying back between 5-10% of their shares through February 27th and will not sell shares into the market. I think some retards are mistaking $BB for $BBBY. Blackberry has a low short interest and will not squeeze but Bed Bath and Beyond is the the 2nd or 3rd most shorted company behind $GME. Melvin is short $GME and $BBBY but not Blackberry. When Melvin is finally defeated he will have to close out his $BBBY position alongside his $GME position. We can inflict maximum pain on Melvin by raising the cost to borrow $BBBY shares but this tactic will not work with $AMC or $BB shares.  \n\n\n$GME is the best choice but the most effective way to crush Melvin and get bonus tendies is $BBBY not $AMC  \n\n\ntl;dr $GME $2000 $BBBY $250 $AMC dilution (no tendies)",

        "selftext": "As we all know, AMC is the [second most shorted stock in existence](https://www.highshortinterest.com/), behind only GME of course. However, the actual situation between the two companies could not be more different. GME was never really at risk of bankruptcy. GME always had more cash than debt and was paying back debts ahead of schedule, because it has a flexible business model where it can easily close down underperforming stores, which GME did in large numbers this past year. In place of the underperforming stores, GME is expanding furiously into e-commerce. With RC now at the helm strategically, its future is bright.\n\nAMC is in the exact opposite situation. It operates theaters, which it cannot close down without permanent, serious consequences. There is very little room for AMC to cut operating losses during the pandemic. There is no e-commerce pivot. It has theaters, and that's it. For a while now, AMC has been teetering on the edge of a cliff, facing a massive debt load and mounting operating losses, while hedge funds were relentlessly building short interest on its stock like a flock of locusts. AMC had been just a step away from Chapter 11 several times. The shorts almost won.\n\n****This is where we come in.****\n\nThe recent rise in AMC's stock price is not just a middle finger to the short interest hedge funds. It is a lifeline to the **real world** operations of AMC. A few days back, one of AMC's debt holders [converted $600 million worth of debt into stock](https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-silver-lake-swaps-debt-for-equity-as-cinema-chains-stock-surged-1234682417/), and there were additional share offerings and other debt conversions.\n\n&gt;It an SEC filing this morning, AMC said it will be issuing around 44.4 million shares of Class A common stock to Silver Lake and related noteholders in the transaction, which will reduce its debt by $600 million.\n\n&gt;Earlier this month, AMC stockholder Mudrick Capital Management also swapped AMC debt for equity, in this case 14 million shares, plus another 8 million as a fee for separate loan.\n\n&gt;As part of its recently announced fundraising, AMC yesterday finished issuing a further $300 million of equity at $4.80 a share.\n\n&gt;It\u2019s been a wild ride for the nation\u2019s largest exhibitor but CEO Adam Aron told Deadline Monday that the chain should have cash enough to ride out the year.\n\nNow, a valid concern might be that the additional stock offerings will increase float and ease the pressure on the shorts. But that didn't happen! The good news aspect of these moves significantly outweighs the additional float. With the freedom to raise capital and reduce debt load, the threat of bankruptcy is all but gone. The shorts will not win anymore, it's just a matter of how much they lose. \n\nThis movement is legitimately saving a real American company. This is not patriotic jingoism. AMC, by the nature of its business, employs US residents and supports local economies across the entire country. AMC is a huge corporation but at the same time extremely local and intimate. The vast majority of its screens are in the US, with a solid representation in Europe as well. Yeah, the popcorn is overpriced, but at least it's going into the pockets of US residents and circulating in the local economy. \n\nAnd the enemy? Bloodsucking vampire hedge funds who literally produce NOTHING and do NOTHING except amass capital through underhanded and despicable means. \n\nThis is a once in a lifetime opportunity to smash those hedge funds and save a beloved company at the same time.\n\nThis is not financial advice. I just love the stock, and hate hedge funds.",

        "selftext": "For many of you reading this you may not understand what truly happened Thursday morning. We were on the brink of a Bear Stearns moment. Basically, these funds were so leveraged that many of them were blowing up, and it threatened to take down the entire market with it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nTLDR; Had the \"FREE MARKET\" remained free this would have caused a massive systemic crash due to forced deleveraging of hedge funds.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Understanding Leverage:**\n\nMany people don't quite understand the game that goes on between these big funds and the market. These big hedge funds are leveraged up so say Melvin Capital has 12 Billion in AUM (Assets under management) they are likely leveraged up 5-10x meaning they actually own stock positions worth 60-120 Billion. If enough hedge funds blow up at once, the whole system collapses because they are forced to sell longs and deleverage. This is what happened in 2008, and these guys saw it happening again.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The entire market was at systemic risk.**\n\n\nThey had no out so they changed the game. The clearing firms, and Depository Trust Company suddenly changed the entire margin requirements for every \"meme\" stock. Basically when you buy a stock normally your broker has to give a clearing firm 2% of the collateral of the stock price, and the trade is matched with a seller/buyer and sent to a firm like DFT who then records you as the new owner of that share of stock.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Changing collateral requirements suddenly**\n\n\nWell guess what they changed the collateral requirement to 100% yes you are correct they changed it to **100%**. This FORCED many brokers to not allow buys on the stock. This is the true culprit behind whats going on. ***The Citadel*** was at risk of blowing up which means big banks like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs were gonna take heavy losses. This would cause a massive market pullback probably between 15-20%. They COULD NOT let this happen. You think President Biden wants to watch the stock market blow up on his second week in office?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**A coordinated attack on retail investors:**\n\nI have never ever seen the level of manipulation that existed on Thursday and Friday. These funds are all on the brink of collapse so they cut off access to over 95% of the people from buying, and forced sells or hit stop losses on every single open position. Interactive Brokers HAD been my broker for many years, and I had promoted them for ages. Watching their Chairman Thomas Peterffy say we will stop trading UNTIL these stocks return to a reasonable price angered me to my core. You run a broker firm YOU DO NOT DECIDE THE PRICE OF A STOCK PERIOD. This was a coordinated takedown of the young retail investor who was on the verge of a HUGE win.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Where stocks would have ended the week causing a market blowup:**\n\nSo what is the real price these meme stocks would have ended up at you ask.\n\n$GME 1000\n\n\n$BB    50\n\n\n$AMC  30\n\n\n$NOK  12\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. Just a man who has worked in and around the industry for over a decade with a lot of experience about what goes on behind the scenes.",

But every single day I keep seeing people tell others to sell their AMC, BB, NOK, etc etc shares because they\u2019re \u201cdistractions\u201d. That\u2019s terrible fucking advice even outside of the GME hype. Especially considering how many newcomers are on here and WSB that are *listening to that advice*. The number one piece of advice when it comes to investing is diversification, not putting all of your eggs in one basket. \n\nNone of the aforementioned stocks will be the \u201cnext\u201d GME. If you only got into investing due to the GME hype, just know that this is not a common occurrence. However, these shares have a lot of potential and if you can\u2019t afford GME shares, it\u2019s definitely a great idea to get in while the price is low. Then hang tight and enjoy the ride, but just know it will probably take awhile. \n\nWhatever shares you have right now, HOLD THEM FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY. STOP SELLING YOUR SHARES. I say this as someone who had five shares of GME that I bought for $15/piece in November and sold them in the beginning of December when I went red lmao. JUST.

Millions of people suppressed by the 1% are coming out in droves to fight back. To take back a small, but significant piece of what we\u2019ve help build. We\u2019ve lined the pockets of the greedy corporations, who have exploited the working class. In 1965, CEO employee ratio was 21:1, today it is 320:1 and rising.\nThis move has provided an opportunity for new and veteran retail traders to regain some of that capital back.\n\nThis forum\u2019s open and transparent dialogue has helped people pay off loans, make their rent payments, and perhaps get back on their feet after a horrific and painful 2020. It\u2019s time the world gets to enjoy some tendies. Today, some kid\u2019s $2k to $50k trade can help him regain some footing. Perhaps he can buy something supporting a small business or even start his own. \n\nThis forum has transformed the economic narrative. Short traders pushing to bankrupt businesses at 138% of a company\u2019s value will forever need to reconsider their moves. America was built on the backs of hard working people. Many of these people still work at some of these companies earning minimal pay. Shorts like this puts more people out of work and further into debt further suppressing their ability to make a sustainable living. Billion dollar hedge funds will need think twice about trying to bulldoze America simply for the benefit of a few.\n\nMany of us grew up with some of these companies. Companies like GameStop and AMC are part of\nAmericana. Sure, you may not have liked the $3 trade in for your game or perhaps you always wondered if the popcorn attendant came in your bucket, but fuck did you not still enjoy the movie experience. Other\u2019s like Nokia and BB helped transform the way we communicate, share and communicate today. Way before we would browse Reddit while shitting, we were playing snake on our 6160. BB was, and still is Canadian. We hated their phones, but love our neighbors. These companies, who have lived among the most shorted companies, finally tells corporate greed that their game stops. \n\nSo, to my fellow autist, as we rise this morning and gain further momentum, get ready to B.A.N.G. hard.

        "selftext": "To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect AMC in the coming week:\n\nAMC current status (30JAN2021) :\nAMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) \n\nNow what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. \n\nToday\u2019s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)\n\nSo Monday when they\u2019re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. \n\nBut this isn\u2019t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.\n\nOver the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. \n\nShort squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there\u2019s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we\u2019re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday \n\nMy recommendation: \n1. HOLD\n2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it\u2019s going to violently rise\n3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it\u2019s highest.",

        "selftext": "DISCLAIMER: \nI am not a financial advisor. This is a DD (Due Diligence) post in regard to the upcoming squeeze aimed at AMC. The information is a collection of research from credible sources with some of my personal thoughts on the topic.\n\nNOTE: ANYONE WHO IS INFORMED ON THE MARKET AND HOW IT WORKS, SKIP TO PART 2.\n\nThis DD will cover more than average DD's since WSB has gained a large following of new traders who can benefit from a full description.\n\nPart 1: $AMC, what is it? \ud83c\udf9e\ufe0f\ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f\n---[Source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Theatres)---\nAMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. is an American movie theater chain headquartered in Leawood, Kansas, and the largest movie theater chain in the world. Founded in 1920, AMC has the largest share of the U.S. theater market ahead of Regal and Cinemark Theatres.\n\nPart 1.2: What is a squeeze?\ud83e\udd0f\ud83c\udffc\nA squeeze in the market ($GME, $AMC) is a phenomenon that occurs when shorts have to be covered, especially by high class traders (hedge fund managers). \n\nPart 1.3:What are shorts, why are they popular with the top 1%?\nIn short selling, a position is opened by borrowing shares of a stock that the investor believes will decrease in value by a set future date (the expiration date of the short). The investor then sells these borrowed shares to buyers willing to pay market price. Before the borrowed shares must be returned, the trader is betting on the prices decline and then can purchase them at a lower cost. This stategy is HIGH RISK HIGH REWARD.\n\nPart 1.4 (final intro peice): Why do squeezes cause losses up top?\nSimple. In the case of $GME the hedge funds bet that $GME would fall. Logically, they should have been right. But as I'm sure everyone knows, WSB and working class investors from all over the world flipped the trend on its head. So, since the hedge funds bet on a fall they had to cover the losses caused by their BORROWED positions becoming absolutely useless (nice). \n\nPart 2: The stats on $AMC. \ud83d\udcc8\ud83e\udde0\n---Paraphrased from \"Yahoo Finance\", Some IMO.---\nAMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted and 14% are being longed. Now what everyone is waiting for it when shorted shares expire and the hedge funds have to cover what they bet and lost on. Keep in mind not every share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. Today's target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 and we closed at $13.29! This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Feb 1/21) So Monday when they're forced to cover the $8.63 they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher from said stimulus. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96.  Over the next few trading days it is going to be a strong squeeze. $AMC is standing where $GME did a week ago. Hold your ground. Gains coming in hot next week. \n\nPart 3: What are our targets for buying and selling?\ud83d\udcb5\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcb5\nTHIS REQUIRES DIAMOND HANDS \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\nFrom what I have read, buying into $AMC at $17 or below is a safe bet. My exit plan is to secure some profit next week as the squeeze reaches it's height, and reinvest (into $AMC)  a comfortable amount based on collected gain. I plan to keep shares for up to 12-18 months so long as $AMC keeps on the track we can see now.\nAGAIN, I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. MY WORD IS NOT LAW.\n\nPart 4: Beware The Big Man (Reason for Holding)\ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udeab\nBig money managers and short sellers are going to manipulate the stock in the after hours session to scare us investors out of buying and holding with the intent of executing their shorts as planned or to cushion the blow from failed investment. Again, \ud83d\udc50\ud83d\udc8e.\n\nPart 5: The Conclusion on $AMC in short (wording wise) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\u2022The statistics on this stock are legit. \n\u2022The company is longstanding (70+ years)\n\u2022The company is legit\n\u2022A squeeze is seemingly inevitable\n\u2022Being the largest theatre company, post COVID gains are likely as cinemas will re-open.\n\u2022The hedge funds are in a position to be bent over again via their shorts in $AMC.\n\u2022Last but not least, I know alot of you autists lost alot of money gambling during highs on $KTOV, $XSPA, $GNUS, and many others... So why not get some tendies for once.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAGAIN I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, THIS IS A COLLECTION OF DATA AND RESEARCH BASED ON RECENT TRENDS AND $AMC's POSITION IN THE MARKET AS OF CLOSE ON (1/29/21)\nI AM NOT LIABLE FOR LOSSES OR THE REASON FOR GAIN.\nTHIS POST IS STRICTLY FOR SHARING INFORMATION GATHERED.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nTL/DR: \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\n\n(typed on mobile, computer format may be fucked up)",

        "selftext": "**NOTE: By \"next TSLA\" I mean a stock that grows far beyond what talking heads think is \"reasonable\". Not that they are company *like* TSLA or that they will see similar returns.**\n\n---\n\nBB has some elevated short interest for sure. That short interest may even be increasing. However the float on the stock is massive compared to GME. There are over 550 million available shares of BB, and the short interest is below 100%. While there may be some movement up based on shorts covering, GME is a once in a lifetime thing.\n\nNothing is the next GME. Not AMC, not NOK, not BB. The large players aren't ever going to be caught this way again in a place where retail investors can screw them, and GME isn't over. If what you want it to participate in that, then you should buy GME.\n\nBut I think BB is *fundamentally* more valuable than its current price.\n\n## Current Situation of the Company\n\nBlackBerry, which started as Research In Motion, was the \"original\" smartphone company, before Apple ate them alive. They didn't have the product pipelines or the money to compete against Apple, and the company was nearly killed by the iPhone and later the Samsung Galaxy brand.\n\nOver the last several years, BlackBerry has pivoted into a software security company. They mainly sell security products with a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n\nFrom Fidelity:\n\n&gt; BlackBerry Limited provides intelligent security software and services to enterprises and governments worldwide. The company leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to deliver solutions in the areas of cybersecurity; safety and data privacy; and endpoint security management, encryption, and embedded systems.\n\nOver the last year, BB has re-positioned itself to take advantage of the nascent market of autonomous and intelligent vehicles. (Source: [AWS and BlackBerry QNX join forces to accelerate auto innovation with BlackBerry IVY, a new intelligent vehicle data platform](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/aws-and-blackberry-qnx-join-forces-to-accelerate-auto-innovation-with-blackberry-ivy-a-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform/))\n\n&gt; BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that allows automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences as well as provide valuable product insights back to the manufacturer.\n\nThey also have a partnership with Baidu for that company's Apollo autonomous driving open platform. (Source: (BlackBerry Expands Partnership with Baidu to Power Next Generation Autonomous Driving Technology)[https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology])\n\n&gt; BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) today announced an expansion of its strategic partnership with Baidu, whose high-definition maps will run on the QNX\u00ae Neutrino\u00ae Real-time Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of GAC Group (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.).\n&gt; \n&gt; ...\n&gt; \n&gt; The QNX Neutrino RTOS foundation for Baidu\u2019s high-definition maps is a robust real-time microkernel operating system that provides deterministic performance as well as flexibility to address the limited resources of the embedded system.\n\nTheir QNX system is already used in over 100 million cars that are currently on the road, including a direct partnership with [Ford](https://www.industryweek.com/technology-and-iiot/article/22007012/blackberry-ford-extend-partnership-to-develop-car-software) that they've had since 2016.\n\nThey are in the final stages of completing an amazing turnaround as a company, and it looks like they have a good chance of doing it successfully. So what are the challenges?\n\n## Balance Sheet Issues\n\nBB has almost 2/3 of their current \"assets\" tied up in patents. This can be seen on their 2019 balance sheet as \"Intangible Assets \u2013 Total: $2.352 billion\". Their assets which are easier to liquidate are nearly exactly their current liabilities ($1.196 billion vs. $1.121 billion), as they added $638 million in debt in FY2019.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, BlackBerry sold 90 of its smartphone patents to Huawei. It also signed a licensing deal with OnwardMobility and Foxconn to allow it's name and software to be used in making a new 5G Android-powered smartphone that has a physical keyboard, filling a small but important niche in the smartphone industry that is mostly untapped at this point.\n\nThese moves signal the intent of BlackBerry to leverage parts of its balance sheet that have been mostly sitting idle since 2016 when they exited the smartphone market for good as a manufacturer.\n\nThe challenge is that their cash flow and income have been negative or paltry for quite a while. That was never going to turn around until they were able to monetize some of their existing IP and position the company for a solid market segment. At this point, they have successfully done both.\n\n## Earnings\n\nThis section definitely depends on your focus and perspective. For instance, BlackBerry's GAAP EPS has been negative more than positive since 2016. But on the other hand, their adjusted actual EPS has beaten consensus estimates for every single quarter going back to Q3 2015.\n\nIf you believe in Chen's ability to execute the turnaround, then this seems positive. If you think the company is destined for failure and a slow death, then this seems negative.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nOverall, I think BB is undervalued at its current price. They are very well positioned to take off as autonomous vehicles become more common, and most importantly, they have extremely valuable partnerships in many different markets, including some fantastic access to the Chinese market through their partnership with Baidu.\n\nAutonomous vehicles are a market that doesn't exist yet. Not truly. But many people believe that autonomous vehicles are going to turn into a HUGE segment of the market over the next decade. While car companies (particularly TSLA) provide direct exposure to that, they come with manufacturing risks and other things such as supply-chain risks. TSLA, Toyota, Ford... they could all face issues that simply come down to \"we ran out of good suppliers of Cadmium\" or something similar, while what you want is exposure to autonomous vehicles.\n\nBB has none of that. Their revenue and exposure to the market is entirely within the software, and because of their wide range of partnerships they shouldn't be dependent on any particular manufacturer. I expect to see them reporting positive earnings during FY2021 (though only slightly), and a much more obviously robust performance in FY2022.\n\nTheir patent portfolio alone in 2020 was worth about what their market cap was, that's how undervalued this company was due to concern about earnings. Once those earnings turn around, I think the valuation based on *only* fundamentals should but the stock at about $20 *right now*, and about $30-$35 by the end of this year.\n\nThere is also a non-trivial chance of a purchase by another company such as Alphabet that wants access to their partnerships, patent portfolio, and machine learning software.\n\n---\n\nOverall, BB benefits from its meme-stock status, and a bit of a short squeeze could happen for sure. But based just on my reading of their business itself, I think the stock has room to as much as triple within a year.\n\nCurrent position disclosure:\n\n100 BB @ 14.2687  \n+4 19 FEB 21 15c @ 4.125  \n+2 19 FEB 21 40c @ 1.93  \n+1 19 MAR 21 25c @ 4.64",

This could indicate that the shorts have been losing a ton of money, and is now trying to double down. However, this is nowhere near GME or AMC levels but could increase a lot more over time as seen in how much the short volume has increased these last couple of days. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Short volume interest - Latest data from https:\\/\\/fintel.io\\/ss\\/us\\/bb ](https://preview.redd.it/p7urdnrjuhe61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99c6f6397db19891afddf34baff974d7269385c9)\n\nAs seen in this picture you can clearly see that the short volume has been increasing over time, and will most likely have an effect on how much the short float % currently is. Since the latest data for the short float % is from the 15th of January, we would have to wait for the 9th of February to see newly updated data on the short float %. \n\n  \nThe question is now, will they keep shorting BB into oblivion as they did with GME and AMC?   \n\n\n**It's also important to look at the options flow and the possibility of a gamma squeeze.**  \n\n[Graph from: u\\/Strig1 ](https://preview.redd.it/dkcek800whe61.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9388763aca6f8fa1109d460f6831034d107242b)\n\nThis week we saw something that very well could have been manipulation of the price based upon how many calls that would expire ITM of the price was above $30. They kept the price under $15 to let all these contracts expire OTM. But how does the options table looks like next week? See picture below\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/finance.yahoo.com\\/quote\\/BB\\/options\\/](https://preview.redd.it/ra9imjdzwhe61.png?width=1320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3e8fa9c42368fc23590bd56ef2d8875385d137d)\n\nAs seen in this picture there are far fewer calls OTM next week compared to this week. So I would think that the stock price has a better chance of moving higher this week. However the possibility of a Gamma squeeze next week is small but if the price can get above $25 there is a chance to see a push upwards due to call sellers buying back shares to cover.   \n\n\n# And of course BB \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not here to distract people from GME, but I\u2019m just trying to highlight what these HF\u2019s are doing, by showing how they just continue to short companies with potential like BB.",

        "selftext": "  \n\nTo everyone that held, you\u2019ve leveled to diamond-hand generals. In game theory, the only way you could have maximized your gains was if you all stuck together, and you did! They had counted on you guys scattering, and that\u2019s why they took out new shorts on GME.\n\nGME was on the cusp of a short squeeze on Wednesday, before they closed off all buying, and did the short ladder attack. \n\nIt shows that they\u2019ve learned nothing since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). They play by one primary rule: Heads we win. Tails you lose. And they can change the other rules last minute to drive to the primary rule.\n\nNext, they will try to block/limit buying across RH and more brokerages so there\u2019s not enough volume to drive to the short squeeze. Meanwhile Hedge Funds are free to buy/sell unlimited amount of shares and create short ladder attacks \\[1\\]. Different rules for different players in this game!\n\nBut let\u2019s move back to the whiteboard.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low (average \\~$67--I have to admit, the drop today was too tasty so my cost basis went up from yesterday)/share with my later buys averaged in), and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours. In this post I will go a little further and speculate more than I'd normally do in a post due to the questions I've been getting, so fair warning, some of it might be very wrong. I suspect we'll learn some of the truth years from now when some investigative journalist writes a book about it.*\n\nToday, I\u2019ll describe what a margin call is and explain a High Short Interestt trading strategy around it. In Particular, I\u2019ll use Melvin Capital presumed short book as a case study.\n\nNote: I\u2019m not a financial advisor, this is just me whiteboarding.\n\n# Long/Short Strategy\n\nIn the Hedge Fund industry they have a strategy called long/short. They go long on momentum stocks and short undesirable ones.\n\nIe buying Apple and shorting Gamespot.\n\nThis trade is profitable if Apple\u2019s stock price rises and Gamespot\u2019s (GME) share price decline.\n\nHowever, let say the trade doesn\u2019t go their way and Gamespot share prices dramatically because of a short squeeze. In this case their net position is negative. Let\u2019s say 30% negative. If it becomes large, their brokers calls them up and ask them to put more cash. Then they raise 30% more cash or sell stocks that been paid off to meet the reserve requirement. This is why you see the general stock market deep red, while GME moons. Hedge funds are selling their winning longs to raise cash for the margin requirement.\n\nWhen GME short squeezes, they may have to liquidate (sell off all their longs) and cover their existing short position. Moreover, they have other leverage short positions that are also highly shorted (&gt; 50% of the float). This becomes what\u2019s known as an arbitrage trade. I\u2019ll call it the High Short Interest (HSI) Trade. It\u2019s a high risk trade but with potential for very high profits/returns should it go your way.\n\n# The High Short Interest Trade\n\nShould Hedge funds start to cover short positions because of a margin call or liquidate, they will be forced to buy up shares in the open market. However, if those shares are scares, it will create a huge short squeeze in which they will have to pay higher prices to meet their obligation to return shares.\n\nI\u2019ll use Melvin Capital as a case study because they have publicly declared they had a high short interest in GME, so most likely be margin called or liquidiated, should the GME short squeeze happen.\n\nFurthermore, I\u2019ll analyze their possible short position to justify why the squeeze may happen. Again, this is all conjecture and thinking out a possible trading strategy\n\nIn this case study, a high short interest stock is defined as one in which the short interest is greater than 50%. The reason why we will focus on these stock is because of the difficult of buy back all the shares before the market discovers how these shares are valuable because you have to buy them back at any price to meet contractual obligations.\n\nGoing forward, everything I write is based on conjecture but backed up by evidence. Shorting is a opaque dark art and it\u2019s hard to get concrete data. But it shouldn\u2019t block us in this whiteboarding session.\n\nHere is a Melvin Capital possible short interest based on their sec filing of put positions \\[2\\]\n\n1. Gamespot (GME)\n\n2. AMC Networks (AMC)\n\n3. Dillards (DDS)\n\n4. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)\n\n5. The Macerich Company (MAC)\n\n6. Tanger Factory Outlet Center (SKT)\n\nI\u2019ll analyze short interest based on data from ortex.com \\[3\\]. This data is not confirmed but estimate and such has a possibility for high errors. However, ortex has been very reliable in the past.\n\n# AMC \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/s48vgAV](https://imgur.com/a/s48vgAV)\n\nEstimate Short Interest: 63M\n\n Float: 102M\n\n % of float shorted 62%\n\n# Dillards (DDS)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/smZwIeB](https://imgur.com/a/smZwIeB)\n\nEstimate Short Interest: 4.2M\n\n Float: 5.5M\n\n % of float shorted: 76%\n\n# Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/DI18mYL](https://imgur.com/a/DI18mYL)\n\n  Estimate Short Interest: 58M\n\n Float: 109M\n\n % of float shorted: 54%\n\n# MAC\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/JpXcPrP](https://imgur.com/a/JpXcPrP)\n\nEstimate Short Interest: 71M\n\n Float: 113M\n\n % of float shorted: 63%\n\n# SKT\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/mcyDYuE\n\nEstimate Short Interest: 48M\n\n Float: 90M\n\n % of float shorted: 53%\n\nAs you can see all these positions are heavily shorted, and should this hedge fund need to acquire shares of them on the market because of liquidation, it may have trouble to close out its short position. Hence, a very high likelihood of a short squeeze.\n\n# Short Ladder Attack\n\nA common maneuver Hedge fund deploy to vacuum up shares is a short ladder attack \\[1\\]. They do this to drop the price and scoop up shares. For hedge funds with big short positions this is effective because it makes it seem like the shares aren\u2019t valuable when they are.\n\nUsually, they will borrow 1-3% of shares and short, causing people to panic sell. If they do this repeatedly after like 10 days, they can close out 30% of their short position before the market notices. Do you see now how they can leverage 1% to scoop up 30% of the shares with this attack? It\u2019d be difficult for them to vacuum up all the shares at once without the price increasing or the market knowing, so they manipulate the price lower and do it over a period of time.\n\nThat is why you\u2019ll see the days to cover metric. Based on the volume, it suggest how many days they can get away with this before they are whole. However, should people realize that their short interest is too high, they can HOLD and buy more to force hedge funds to buy the shares at a higher price.\n\nBut you can see that the volume is increasing, so the market is aware of a potential short squeeze.\n\n# Short Squeeze Precedent\n\nIn the week of March 20, 2020, Blue Apron had a short interest of about 50%. And then they experienced a short squeeze which led the price to climb 1000% in a week. So you can see how explosive the share price can climb, should a short squeeze occur, for stocks with a short interest of 50% or greater.\n\nNever trade more than you\u2019re willing to lose. Diamond hands.\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l72r36/what\\_is\\_a\\_short\\_ladder\\_attack/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l72r36/what_is_a_short_ladder_attack/)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F\\_X01/infotable.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml)\n\n\\[3\\] [http://ortex.com](http://ortex.com)",

        "selftext": "One of my good friends is an analyst at one of the bigger financial firms and during market hours yesterday, he pulled up the updated short interest on AMC. Here is the data: https://imgur.com/a/VRS7vLY\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNow, as of market close on Thursday, shorts on AMC have doubled down on their positions. Almost no shorts exited their positions during the criminal and illegal period where brokerages halted AMC/GME buying. This looks good for us, because a short squeeze has yet to happen.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs seen on the short shares data, around 165 million of AMC shares are being sold short. To calculate short interest, we mainly want to look at 2 things: shares outstanding and market float. For all you autists out there, the difference between these 2 numbers is that market float is the total number of publicly available shares in the market. ON THE OTHER HAND, shares outstanding includes restricted shares (like executive stock options) that cannot be exercised without special permission from the SEC.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat's important to look at here is the market float, because that is what we are competing against the hedge funds with. The current market float of AMC is around 100 million shares. With some quick monkey math, we see that the short interest with respect to the market float is 165%.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat does this mean for AMC? The squeeze has yet to happen. Buy shares and hold baby. Hedge Funds playing the short side will have nasty tactics up their sleeve, but they played their biggest trick on Thursday by restricting clearing firms and brokers. If we hold and buy shares, they are FUCKED.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNOW, ONTO GAMESTOP: Based on the data from my friend, the news is not as great for GME as it is for AMC, but it is still VERY good. Here is the short interest data for GME: https://imgur.com/a/N77KcfS. As we can see, those criminal hedge fund bastards closed a fuck ton of their short positions when the brokers restricted GME buying. As of now, the shorted GME shares is hovering around 60 million shares.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLet's do some more quick monkey math: Based on Yahoo finance, the market float of GME is around 47 million shares. This means the short interest with respect to market float is around 127% for GME. Although it is not as high as it used to be, the squeeze has yet to be squoze.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo what do we do with GME? The same as AMC. We buy and hold and buy and hold until the criminal bastards at the hedge funds are forced to close their positions. I asked my friend for the short data on our other beloved stocks, and I will say that AMC has the highest short interest currently with respect to market float. However, if we buy and hold everything, the price will eventually squeeze. I know that RH is being retarded right now, but do everything you can to purchase these shares if we want to squeeze AMC/GME. Open Webull, Fidelity, etc. Personally, I hopped over to Cashapp to buy a fuck ton of AMC shares on the dip. Anything works. It's us against them.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf this get's enough attention/if all of you guys are interested, I will ask my friend to pull up the updated short data over the weekend to update you guys on Friday's (yesterday) price action. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTLDR: AMC/GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy positions: 50x AMC calls, 4x GME calls, 10k in AMC shares.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGodspeed retards.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

        "selftext": "The punchline: Citadel and Point72 own shit tons of AMC, BB, and NOK, and presumably want them to increase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've found it somewhat suspicious that most accounts saying to buy/hold AMC, NOK, and to a degree BB are new. In addition, when each of these stocks started getting promoted here, other than GME (which was pretty much all that was talked about at the time) we were still almost exclusively an options subreddit. It took forever for most of us retards to learn that shares were important for GME as a special case, but all of the support for AMC, NOK, and to a degree BB was/is about holding shares, which was grounds to get booted to r/investing prior to GME. We're wallstreet*bets* after all. We trade high-risk options and share in our love of excruciatingly erotic loss porn. The people promoting AMC, NOK, and BB didn't/don't seem to fit in with their recommendations of shares. So I decided to look into this more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter being reminded by Cramer's video that hedge funds will often manipulate sentiment premarket by pushing the stock up and then slowly dumping it, I decided to look into a premarket comparison of GME and AMC on a random recent day. As you can see below, GME and AMC are both pumped up premarket, but by open GME has been shorted down (and it pops up) whereas AMC is in the stratosphere and falls sharply once everyone in the market is trading freely:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zgykmt8mqqe61.png?width=1678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeae992d385ba8529a99e2558b270146099f7646\n\nThis seems like they may be trying to manipulate GME and AMC in opposite ways. This premarket activity can make people pile into non-GME stocks if it looks like GME peaked and others haven't. I haven't looked at BB or NOK, but my guess is that we'd see a similar divergence between GME and those stocks in after hours/premarket as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost importantly, Citadel and Point72 are long on BB, AMC, and NOK. \n\n# BB\n\n[According to 13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/bb), Citadel owns a whopping 1,068,700 shares of BB, and Point72 owns 519,200 shares. No options are owned by either fund. Point72 and Citadel clearly profit from BB's rise.\n\n# AMC\n\n[According to 13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/amc) (Ctrl+F citadel or point72), Citadel owns 292,926 shares of, call options on, and put options on AMC, and Point72 owns 21,758 shares. It's not possible to know what options strategy (e.g., long straddle) Citadel has in play, but it's clear Point72 and Citadel have both benefited from AMC's enormous increase. \n\n# NOK\n\n[According to 13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/nok), Citadel owns an enormous 2,950,823 shares of, call options on, and put options on NOK, and Point72 does not own shares of NOK. It's not possible to know what options strategy (e.g., long straddle) Citadel has in play, but it's clear Citadel has benefited from NOK's rise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe already learned this morning that Citadel owns a humongous stake in silver, so that is most likely being shilled too. Importantly, if any of these funds sell off AMC, BB, NOK, or silver during their increase, they all have more capital to short GME with.\n\n***The only stock increase that really hurts either of these funds or Melvin is GME*****.** *These funds shorted a viable and successful company to 140%. I know I would prefer to specifically focus on hedge funds that seem to have knowingly engaged in illegal naked shorting (Melvin, probably), appear to have forced Robinhood to stop allowing purchase orders (Citadel, Robinhood's primary financer), or are literally run by people who have been convicted of securities fraud (Point72).*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why did AMC, BB, or NOK get restricted too, then?\n\nThe question remains as to why all of these stocks were restricted by many brokers at around the same time as GME. My belief is that purchases on these stocks were restricted in order to make them look like they were stocks that these hedge funds didn't want us to buy. Alternatively, *some* hedge funds are short these other stocks, so it's possible that they were having liquidity issues that also affected the market. But, like I mentioned above, I'd prefer to focus on hurting hedge funds engaging in illegal activities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** hedge funds profit off of your buying AMC, BB, and NOK calls/shares. These stocks seem to be shilled on here as alternatives to GME to distract us. Unless you want to line the pockets of Citadel, Point72, and indirectly Melvin, stay away from AMC, BB, and NOK. **BUY AND HOLD GME IF YOU WANT TO REALLY HURT THESE ASSHOLES. GME TO THE MOON \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: I am retarded and not a financial advisor, so this isn't financial advice. I am long GME and not long any of the other positions mentioned in this post (for the reasons I have outlined in this post). I also regularly scrub my post history but have been on this subreddit long enough to be a member of tanker gang.",

        "selftext": "For those new comers who dont understand what is going on with Gamestop. As you can see there are 69.75M outstanding shares of which 46.89M shares are float (meaning they are available on the market to trade, other shares are held by the GME corp, CEO etc). The Shares (short) as of Jan 14 2021 shows  61.78M shares short. Meaning when there are only 46.89M shares available on the market, the shorted shares are more than the available ones. They need your shares to get out of their short positions. They have shorted more shares then the number of shares which exist. If you people HOLD or BUY more shares, the higher the value goes once the squeeze happens (When their short contracts expire, they would have to buy. If there are no shares to buy, the price goes to the Moon and beyond because of simple demand and supply. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday was a ladder attack which showed very low volume when the stock was halted. It was there to scare off investors. Everyone should keep their shares held to themselves and buy more at any given price. May Gamestop be the most valuable company for a while on the squeeze just like Volkswagen did back in 2008.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S ignore people who are buying BB, AMC, NOK because they think there may be a squeeze with those companies too or think they are too late to jump into GME squeeze. Remember, the squeeze will happen eventually. Volkswagen squeeze took almost 2 years, but GME will be wayyyy quicker because of the spread of the news and the sheer amount of people jumping in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Buy GME in any way or HOLD it if you cant buy more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S: This is not financial advice.

We've come so far. \n\nNow listen:\n\nIf you think Wall Street is shitting their pants over the GME short squeeze you are 100% right. Jim Bianco lays out a [convincing case](https://www.financialsense.com/podcast/19847/jim-bianco-gamestop-and-great-short-seller-takedown#.YBTK3GAFZmU.twitter) that SPY was down 2% on Friday because hedge funds were dropping their \"safe\" stocks to raise capital for collateral against their rising margin debt on GME. \n\nBut you also got to know this. At the same moment Robinhood halted purchases of GME, after calls from their hedge fund buddies, they also put on limits on $SLV. \n\n([Here is the list of all limited stocks](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) \\- they've since added weird stuff like Starbucks, but $SLV was one of the first along with $GME and $AMC). I think that's pretty weird, considering that, unlike these other stocks, $SLV was up only a few percent on Thursday. It's even weirder when you consider that Robinhood had just been [bailed out by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult?sref=rY0z5sRB)! These fuckers are two of the worst silver manipulators out there. (Seriously. Link for [Goldman](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bank-nova-divestiture-goldman-sachs-idUSKBN1DS2C5). Link for [JPM](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html))\n\nThese banks have been raking it in on suppressing the price of silver for  decades.

Silver was well over $30 for several years in the ***fucking 1980s.*** And now it's $27???\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8rf9ip323je61.png?width=1914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8bfdbed2e78d08ef1d411241adc6d68141ede47\n\nThe fair price of silver, conservatively is CERTAINLY over $50, but it seems that there were some strings attached to JPM and GS's little loan to Robinhood. \n\nI'm balls deep in GME, but am riding this silver train too. Already last week $AG and $SLV were surging despite Robinhood's best efforts. If this thing breaks, both of those tickers will at least double. My personal price target for Silver is $70. The tendies from silver will be extra sweet for me  - nothing like breaking up the greatest cartel in modern history (apologies to OPEC). \n\nKeep fighting the good fight apes. We'll bring these bastards to their knees. \n\nMy positions: $GME shares, $AG and $SLV shares and July calls. \n\n&lt;Obligatory rocketship emoji&gt;",
