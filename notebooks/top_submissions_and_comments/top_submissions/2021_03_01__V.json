        "selftext": "Hey there folks! Today I want to talk to you about what\u2019s really going on in the stock market and what we should expected next\u2026\n\n**\\[Don't Read/Dislike Before Reading - Very Long Post\\]**\n\nSo, in the last couple of weeks, we have seen a very fast correction in the tech heavy Nasdaq [Index](https://imgur.com/aK26hjA) after the bond yields rapidly spiked over 1.5% for the 10y, as a lot of investors kept getting spooked by the employment numbers coming in slightly better than expected, though many important things are still hidden in those numbers.\n\nFor example, last week we saw the US gaining almost 400K jobs, but this barely moved the unemployment [rate](https://imgur.com/7PJTWUA) which still stands at 6.2% (and this doesn\u2019t even include people who just quit searching for jobs). Almost all of the job [gains](https://imgur.com/B3av5gb) were seen in the leisure and hospitality sector, which has started to regain some momentum after it was the most affected by the events of last year, as this sector is still down more than 3.5M jobs since a year ago.\n\nThese past weeks we also [saw](https://imgur.com/yeudkin) jobless claims continuing to go down, with the latest initial jobless claims coming in at the lowest level since last early last year at just over 700K, as the continuing jobless claims also coming in at just over 4.1M.\n\nBut guys, regardless of the jobs &amp; unemployment numbers, the main thing that will keep investors on edge will continue to be treasury [yields](https://imgur.com/rDjy9fO), the interest rates and how this are affected by the inflation [numbers](https://imgur.com/awXUGgw) which are expected to see a huge bump in the next months as we will have very low comps compared to last year when we saw the rona starting to pick up steam.\n\nWe can see [here](https://imgur.com/QbuiSot) the core inflation came lower this month with an increase of just .1% which jolted the stock market and started a recovery after the sell-off in the past weeks.\n\nGiven that tech names &amp; EVs were some of the biggest hit stocks we should also take a quick look at NIO, as the company lost almost half of its value in the past month, dropping from over $66 to just $35 after the big sell off in the past weeks.\n\nNIO\u2019s drop was also amplified probably by the fact that they posted mixed [results](https://imgur.com/t0jRJEW) for the 4th quarter of last year, as they just missed the top line but did manage to post a solid beat on the company\u2019s bottom line, losing just $0.14/share.\n\nInvestors might not have been happy to see a guidance of just 15% above their 4th quarter given the huge valuation and expectations of the company and the huge global chip shortage that will limit NIO\u2019s production capacity to just 7.5K in the 2nd quarter of 2021.\n\nI still have a mixed opinion about NIO\u2019s stock, but after this huge sell-off, it has become more attractive given the continued [growth](https://imgur.com/cI1TNWJ) of sales the company has seen in the last years, while I also believe NIO will remain one of the winners of the EV disruption.\n\nThe other stock that I wanted to mention after what has happened in the past weeks is Zoom.\n\nI really like Zoom\u2019s products and I understand the hype of the stock, but I also really believe they will struggle to keep the huge growth rate going, as the company might have seen its peak growth after the massive work-from-home movement in 2020.\n\n[Zoom](https://imgur.com/UygZxJZ) also reported a beat on the top &amp; bottom line and I expect them to continue to have another great first half to start 2021, but after that, the company will have very though comps to go against, which might really put some downward pressure on the stock, especially as more people go back to their workplaces.\n\nYou can see, even the company doesn\u2019t expect the huge growth to continue, with the revenue growth expected to only slightly continue to grow during 2021.\n\nZoom is valued at almost $100B which is really hard to justify unless the company continues to innovate and bring more &amp; more products to the market, as the industry they operate in will only become more competitive over time with other big players like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce &amp; many others looking to take market share.\n\nGuys, if you are still in doubt about what to do next in the stock market, you should just take a look at the chart below and start thinking long term, because investing, if you are really looking to make money is all about the long-term.\n\nYou can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/ZlO593t) in the past 100 years we've had 8 bear markets previous to the one we saw in 2020, with the average bear market lasting just 1.4years compared to over 9 years for every bull market with a staggering difference in gains vs losses as well.\n\nWe can also see in this [chart](https://imgur.com/wM39iSQ) that it only took 15 days for the Nasdaq to enter a 10% correction this time, but you can see the average 12 month return after a 10% correction is almost 30% which is huge, with the likelihood of the index posting a positive return in the next 12 months standing at over 90%\n\nSo, given that we had a bear market last year, I believe it\u2019s highly unlikely that we will see a huge drop in stocks even if yields continue to rise, as the real return of the treasury yields will continue to be close to 0, as I don\u2019t expect them to jump more than 2% for the 10y anytime soon.\n\nMoving on, I recently saw some [comments](https://imgur.com/I3ijkKT) made by David Tepper which I wasn\u2019t really aware of but which made a lot of sense to me, he highlighted that the other downward pressure put on treasury yields, which will keep them in check, will come from investors in other countries like Japan, Germany &amp; many others, as the US treasuries have become way more attractive than others.\n\nOne other thing that I think should be mentioned is that the [Dow Jones](https://imgur.com/undefined) has continued to make new high after new high in the past week, being led by companies like Disney which has just surpassed 100M [subscribers](https://imgur.com/fCTDNGX) on their Disney+ platform while also getting a boost from their other revenue streams starting to come back online, and of course the stock that has led the DOW in the past week, Boeing, as the [company](https://imgur.com/K6SPGY1) had more sales than cancellations for the first time since November 2019 as the 737 MAX crisis is finally starting to fade away for the company, with even more possible [deals](https://imgur.com/4XYgfs9) likely to close in the next period, as airlines start to have a better view of what the future will bring for them.\n\nFriends, you shouldn\u2019t be scared of stock market corrections or dips as we have [seen](https://imgur.com/74dAwZO) a 10% pullback once every 11 months as you can see, with the frequency of bigger crashes decreasing significantly, but as always, because we are highly emotional beings, it\u2019s very hard for us to handle our emotions after a series of red days.\n\nYou should remember though, most often than not, the best way to go is just to ride out the dip and even starting deploying more cash into the stock market the more it drops. I think you should develop a strategy of not selling on big red days and deploying an increasingly higher % of your cash into great stocks the more the stock market drops.\n\nI also fully expect some part of the next stimulus check, which was just signed by Biden, to end up in the stock market, which might help push the stock market on the right path despite increasing pressures from rising yields and possible short-term inflation fears.\n\n**So just to end this post guys, is the stock market going to crash? My short answer is NO!**\n\nI don\u2019t expect that to happen any time soon. Even if we continue to see volatility in the stock market you should use that to your advantage and smartly deploy cash into great companies, which leads me to my other question, should you buy stocks today? Well, at the moment of writing this post, futures are currently trending down pre-market (SP &amp; Nasdaq in the Red, Dow +0.2%) and If they continue to do so it might be a good chance to deploy some cash, but don\u2019t rush into the first red day you see, slowly build your positions or add to them. As a rule of thumb, I like to buy more once a 5% dip occurs in the stock market and slowly deploy cash the more it drops.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "Guys, stop panicking and buy the dip. \n\nSocial Finance (SOFI) is literally at dirt cheap price (in the 17s).  \n\nIPOD and IPOF are literally $12-12.75 each. This is the same forum that was buying CCIV at 45 dollars. This was the same forum that took PSTH to 30 dollars pre target. This is the same forum that had RTP AGC at $16-17 WITH NO RUMOUR OR DEAL. \n\nI'm buying the dip because I know this tech downturn will be short lived. Its backed by fundamentals. The same thing happened at the end of 2016 when Trump was elected. Rates were raised and yes tech stocks were rocked. But do you know what happened after his election? 2017 was a record year for stocks. \n\nIts because when tech goes down after record highs and at the same time we see industrials/value stocks go up like banks, industrials etc - that means its healthy. That means the more stocks like airlines and DOW stocks keep going up, the more juice we're fueling for tech stocks to have a MAJOR year this year.\n\nStick with the winners: BFT, IPOE are safe long term holds that are going to rebound at least 25-30% as they **both close their mergers at the end of the month**.\n\nAfter IPOE closes, its likely that Chamath will announce IPOD and IPOF around the same time. Theres so many great SPACs with great leadership teams on sale like RTP, AGC, or AJAX. \n\nIf you guys don't believe me, go check out this video where Cathie Wood literally explains why she thinks this downturn is healthy. Look at what shes buying - PLTR, OPEN, etc. She's literally buying the stocks that we've been right about. Don't lose hope.\n\n**Watch the video. The first 15-20 minutes.** \n\n**The question is are you ready to go to the moon or are you a boomer thats going to cave and buy an ETF?

Pundits blamed the market plunge on Fed hiking rates, the 'china trade war', and fears of economic slowdown. But recall that 1) the market recovered in a V shape days after December ended, without the Fed deciding to reverse course on the rate hike, 2) that the market was unfazed by trade war headlines nearly all year long, and 3) the economic growth data remained incredibly positive and strong. **The December 2018 drop was irrational.**\n\nThis look back at recent history goes to show how irrational markets can be and it is up to us to take advantage.\n\nFor today:\n\n1. the Fed is NOT raising rates and have said this repeatedly.\n\n2. the economy is recovering and there is little data suggesting any upcoming slowdown or recession.\n\n3. The fear now is about the fear of inflation/yields rising. Note that we don't have any data suggesting inflation is permanently here to stay. \n\nI think there are two solid conclusions: \n\n1) This is not a bear market happening before our eyes. It's a correction and buying the dip is the likely right move. An overall selloff right now, is irrational, **just like in December 2018**, with the exception of growth stocks that are very overvalued especially in the context of rising yields. \n\n2) No one can predict how deep this correction goes, but it would be prudent to buy the dip on cyclicals, financials, and growth stocks that are already undervalued \n\nPlease also note that the SP500 is now so heavily weighted to the top market cap growth tech stocks like FANG, that a 10% correction in them will require 90% increase in the bottom 100 stocks of the SP500 to avoid a fall. So the best way to increase your portfolio CAGR may not be to simply buy the dip in the SP500 index, but rather choosing the above sectors or stocks that avoid this weighting.",

        "selftext": "Hindenburg Research \u2013 and if you don\u2019t hate them yet, you will soon when they attack one of your holdings.\n\n**Who is Hindenburg Research?**\n\n\u201cHindenburg Research\u201d is a tiny[ 5-man shop](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-nikola-stock-got-torched-by-a-short-seller-11600867055) based out of an[ apartment in New York](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ny/5471661). They are primarily known for their hit-piece on Nikola last year - which further exposed the company for misleading investors and caused the stock to continue crashing down.\n\nThey take large short positions in companies, put out extensive and detailed hit-pieces against them, induce panic (causing people to sell), and then they just take their profits and move on to their next target. They don\u2019t care if they are right or wrong on their \u201cresearch\u201d because they will profit on their short position regardless.\n\nTheir ideal targets are early-stage growth company stocks that have a low float \u2013 these types of stocks are more volatile (thus, allowing them to make exponentially higher profits from their short positions after releasing their \u201creports\u201d).\n\nHere are examples of other stocks they have attacked: $CLOV, $SOS, $MVIS, $JCOM \u2013 to name a few.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Where do they get their research?**\n\nThis is the million-dollar question.\n\nThey rarely cite their sources, yet they produce very detailed reports. These reports historically contain many inaccuracies while damaging the reputation of legitimate companies and hurting retail investors like us.\n\nIn their most recent attack against [GM-backed Lordstown Motors](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) on Friday, the basis of over half of their report is based on \u201cconversations they had\u201d with undisclosed \u201cformer employees\u201d of the company.\n\nFormer employees??? That is their source??? These are probably ex-employees that got fired.\n\nThat is the equivalent of someone asking my ex-girlfriend what she thinks of me.. Don\u2019t imagine she\u2019s going to have too many nice things to say.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here is why what they did to Lordstown Motors is wrong:**\n\nLet\u2019s be clear. This is no Nikola.\n\nHindenburg neglected to contact Lordstown Motors for a tour of their [6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html) and refused to take a test drive of their Alpha Endurance vehicle. \n\nHindenburg also RUSHED the publishing of their report during a \u201cquiet-period\u201d right before earnings this Wednesday because CEO Steve Burns mentioned in a [video last week](https://video.foxnews.com/v/6237427669001#sp=show-clips) that production is on track for September, and, starting on March 17th, LM would begin reporting actual orders instead of pre-orders.\n\nLordstown Motors has already said they are preparing to release a [\u201cthorough\u201d statement](https://www.mahoningmatters.com/local-news/is-lordstown-motors-a-mirage-a-stock-market-research-firm-just-published-a-deep-dive-into-the-voltage-valley-leader-3539242) and will \u201cabsolutely\u201d be refuting the Hindenburg Research report.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In summary:**\n\nI will include a link to my full DD post / Hindenburg rebuttal in the comments below as well if you want to read a more in-depth analysis into Lordstown Motors and their business model. They are initially targeting fleet/government/business contracts with their truck. *Disclosure:* I am long $RIDE and felt like these allegations from Hindenburg Research were unfair to Lordstown Motors and investors alike.\n\nIn addition, I\u2019ll let you be the judge \u2013 should Hindenburg be allowed to continuously get away with these attacks?\n\nWhat I love most about this WSB community is that we can come on here and speak freely when we feel like us apes have been wronged. \n\nI wanted to raise awareness into what Hindenburg Research has been getting away with and hopefully *prevent it from happening to you in the future*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I\u2019ll leave you with this question: Who has more credibility in the following scenario?** \n\nA 5-man \u201cresearch firm\u201d ran out of an apartment in New York **or** a company with 500+ employees, the 3rd largest automotive plant in the country, and the backing of two different multi-billion dollar corporations via investments and partnerships.. The answer here is pretty obvious. \n\nAlmost 20 million $RIDE shares were shorted on Friday as a part of this attack. I think this weekend is a great time to rally the troops and make sure those that didn\u2019t close out their short positions get burned this week \u2013 and it begins tomorrow.\n\n$RIDE or die baby! #MadeInAmerica\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;**\n\nHindenburg Research attacked a company based out of a small town in Ohio that is producing electric pick-up trucks for the hard-working men and women of this country. The American dream is all about building a company from the ground-up that will make the world a better place \u2013 for Lordstown Motors, that means bringing the first **full-size** electric pick-up to market this September. The goal of this post is to raise awareness into what Hindenburg Research has been getting away with and refute their allegations into Lordstown Motors.",

        "selftext": "Okay, for the record, I'm a novice investor and don't really fully know what I'm doing.\n\nI looked at my portfolio and.... It's bad. I realized some gains and flipped some money around and kept myself only 7% in the red. But I've got some holdings seriously deep in the red! Especially my Arks and QCLN. \n\nBeing new I'm sure you know where this goes, lol. \"Do I sell before I lose all my money??\" I calmed myself down and reminded myself I have high risk investments but they're mostly ETFs and are very unlikely to hit zero as they're being managed by people far smarter than me who are far greedier than me. \n\nSo I decided to read the news, not for answers but to just see if I notice any trends and red flags. And everything is just talking about a \"tech sell-off\" and a \"growth sell-off\" (which, duh?). But the interesting thing to me is there's really no discernable pattern. All they really got is \"Oh well Ford announced this so Tesla slipped, oh growth is down because growth is down.\" On Reddit I've heard about retirement accounts being rearranged, I've heard of big industries shorting to drive price down, I've heard people think a reopen will be this and that, I've heard it's a correction because those markets were in a bubble...\n\nBut I don't know. Something just feels like hysteria here. The fact boomer stocks are going up proportionately to tech going down has me suspicious. If tech is in a bubble and crashing because the price wasn't justified, what the hell's justifying the relatively large rise in banking and oil etc right now?? So are we just moving the \"bubble\" into a new industry?\n\nI feel like this could just be that boomers overgauged the impact our pandemic has been having on society over the last few months. I really don't think $BOA was somehow less valuable just because we had to wear masks, just to give an example. What world does tech suddenly lose value just because we can go to Pink Floyd cover band concerts with our grandchildren again, too? Better switch back to the good ol' reliables because we're going to shut off our phones and hug each other in a few months?\n\nWhen people realized they jumped the gun buying in on old money stocks, aren't they just going to buy back the same tech stocks they had before? What industry could they possibly hop to next? \n\nEven considering politics, this shit is weird and nonsensical! Why would tech advancements, green energy, etc hit an all time high during a regressive presidential administration and then become irrelevant? It's like people forget Biden will be president still after his 100 days and that he's just going to spend 4 years vaccinating us and nominating people. I'm not a fan of the guy but but green energy has been his headlining issue and I have a feeling as soon as \"Green New Deal\" is a headline again, my $QCLN will skyrocket before anything is even passed as people rush to buy back in to renewables. \n\nJust wanted to verbalize all of this to see if anyone else feels the same way - like this is some dumb sham being led by stubborn short sightedness and good old fashion boomer ludditism (and of course boosted by big dogs in the industry, no doubt). I feel like April will hit and we'll see another V shape tech recovery like we did during the pandemic's start because people realized they're too stuck on their old ways that are probably never fully returning.",

        "selftext": "I posted this in r/CCIV but Ill share here also \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEarlier today I posted my Lucid YOLO options purchase here.... \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/CCIV/comments/m26uib/lucid\\_cciv\\_yolo\\_part\\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CCIV/comments/m26uib/lucid_cciv_yolo_part_1/)\n\nthe entry point seems to be ok, we have found a rounded bottom on the 5 day chart and looking to move about the $25 mark as we get closer to merger and use that as a floor. I sold my warrants and rolled into leap options, with extremely small common position. I can then add to the dip if we retest $21.50 easily, won't get called on warrants, and having the majority of capital in options that will keep me personally from over trading.\n\nSo I thought I would post up my DD and thesis why I think this is a great value investment that has a lot of potential. Here we go.... TLDR at the end\n\n**CCIV / Lucid Motors**\n\n**Background**\n\nFirst and foremost I am not a professional trader nor am I a financial advisor. I do however have A LOT of experience in the automotive field, in particular BMW. I have been trained, and worked on pretty much all BMW electric or hybrid models with the exception of the last 3 current model years or so. I have met with BMWs engineers over the years (foreign and domestic), toured factories and of course owned and/or driven almost every BMW model ever made. Also managed one of the largest BMW Service departments and loaner car fleets in the USA. I know.....what the fuck does this have to do with LUCID. The old saying.....I might know a thing or two, because I\u2019ve seen a thing or two. Im also no longer working in the car business but that's for another day.\n\n**Lucid Motors leadership:**\n\nYou can find the list of executive management here: [Board of Directors | Lucid Motors](https://www.lucidmotors.com/company/board/)\n\nPeter Rawlinson \u2013 CEO/CTO As you know he\u2019s a former Tesla, has over 30 years of automotive experience, including leading the model S team at Tesla. Extensive engineering background with multiple automotive companies. Although I love Peters proper CEO leadership and great speaking ability, I do not believe in the future he will be still be leading both roles of CTO and CEO. There is room to grow on this board and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if someone left the Silicon Valley to join Lucid (as Peter has already encouraged a partnership with a large cap tech company).\n\nShelby Chen \u2013 Hes got M&amp;A experience mainly in China with Tsing Capital. There is not a lot of info around on him, but he could be the key to Asia markets based on his experience when the brands wants to grow into again markets.\n\nTurqi Alnowaiser \u2013 Representing the PIF, that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\nTony Posawatz \u2013 Non Executive Director \u2013 40 years of auto experience, lead the turnaround and resale of Fisker Automotive (Polished the turd and sold it in a year). Hes pretty active on twiiter [u/TonyPosawatz](https://www.reddit.com/u/TonyPosawatz/)\n\nAndrew Liveris \u2013 You already know the Michael Klein connection to Churchill Capital, the relationship has proved its purpose.\n\nOnce the merger is completed I do expect Lucid to add to its board, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Alan Mulally joined based him being on the Churchill board, or he might make an excellent recommendation for them.\n\n**Technology**\n\nOne thing that sets Lucid apart from other competitors is their technology. Everything is in house! Battery design, electric motors are all designed and manufactured in house. They do not rely on someone else to make powertrains or batteries somewhere else and ship them. Why is this sooooooooooo important? Well let me tell you\u2026. When you don\u2019t engineer and manufacture your own shit you leave exponential risk to supply chains and potential defects. Ill use BMW as an example\u2026 The N54 engine was to be the first twin turbo motor produced in the brand and the first with a gasoline high pressure fuel system that ran as pressure of 300 bar. This fuel system was designed and supplied by another manufacturer. When troubles arose, vehicles were repurchased, the company got sued, bad headlines for the brand and dealers suffered. When you are the designer and manufacturer you are always 100% in the know and are not being sold on the NEXT BIG THING trying to chase automotive awards or competition. The next thing that goes seriously undervalued in this company is their experience in racing\u2026.. Im sure most of you are thinking why does that apply? Well my favorite engineering term that\u2019s always often used to describe new parts is \u201cROBUST\u201d. When you test parts like batteries from constant abuse (Formula E) you tend to learn a thing or two pretty quick what works and what doesn\u2019t. Lucid\u2019s experience in being the battery supplier for Formula E has have them not only an edge in efficiency, but I am willing to be a more ROBUST battery than other EVs. By manufacturing their own battery you have now entered into a technology race with TESLA which for the moment, Lucid appears to be winning.\n\n[2021 Lucid Air: Digging Into the Luxury EV's Tesla-Beating Tech (motortrend.com)](https://www.motortrend.com/news/2021-lucid-air-technology/) You can read some supporting information here.\n\n[Atieva Powers Season 6 of Formula E with Spec Battery Pack of Its Own Design | Lucid Motors](https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/atieva-powers-season-6-formula-e-spec-battery-pack-its-own-design/)\n\n**Models**\n\nThe Lucid Air being available in 5 different model variants from $69,900 to $161,500 make the car more available to luxury buyers more than just BALLERS. The SUV market is HUGE in the US and also the most competitive. By leading the technology race Project Gravity will sure to be a hit in 2023. If you are unsure why the SUV should be the next model, ask Lamborghini how many of the Urus they sold last year (4,391 Urus produced to 3039 of combined other Lambo models in 2020). Peter specifically said a high production, low priced vehicle will be the last item on the list to produce, and he's right. There is no point to rush into a high produced, low margin vehicle right away, that's for last (Tesla model 3 playbook).\n\n**Production**\n\nThe first phase of the factory (999,000sqft) \u00a0has been completed which took about a year to complete and production of the Lucid Air will be rolling off early summer 2021.\n\nYou can see some of it here [Inside Lucid Motors\u2019 new electric vehicle factory in Casa Grande, Arizona - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy6Lcz7CsQY) .\n\nPhase 2 of 5 has already been approved by Arizona and will begin construction immediately for Project Gravity. The total size of the factory will reach 5.1 Million sqft once all phases are completed. Phase 2 should be complete roughly Feb 2022, which will be the perfect ramp for Gravity in 2023 MY.\n\nWhat is not so talked about is the battery and powertrain factory is at another offsite facility in Arizona. This is a smart move allowing Lucid to scale the business from the automotive side and from the industrial side simultaneously without slowing either business.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Diverse Portfolio**\n\nLucid is also following the footsteps of Tesla and allowing their battery design to be used for non-automotive power supply\n\n[Electric-Car Startup Lucid to Follow Tesla Into Energy Storage - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-09/electric-car-startup-lucid-to-follow-tesla-into-energy-storage)\n\nWhy is this important? Well when you become the leader in the technology race of EVs you can become a supplier to other OEMs and apply your patents to a broader space of other industries. This allows you to have a higher space of growth or \u201cblue ocean strategy\u201d.\n\nPowertrain and battery factory is separate from the auto manufacturing location so both sides of the business can grow without stepping on each other.\n\n**Competitive Advantage of Lucid Air Model**\n\n1. Battery design \u2013 not only is the battery range longer (over 500 miles), its smaller and more light weight then its competitors ( 3-5 year technology advantage in my view)\n2. Motor design \u2013 Much smaller with less moving parts than competitors (3-5 year technology advantage in my view)\n3. Model advantage to Tesla Model S Plaid \u2013 When the Plaid becomes available the specifications are going to be pretty close in performance. I would give the Lucid the advantage in luxury especially with the back seat design. The model S will have a slight autonomous driving advantage.\n4. 900V proven platform with the most range available in any electric vehicle at the moment.\n5. The ability to use your vehicle as a power supply for your home without having to buy a Tesla Power Wall or other battery supply system (10-20K cost advantage).\n6. Charging ability via Wunderbox \u2013 Fastest charging available to date.\n7. The vehicle is built for tomorrow, not just for today.\n\n**Electrify America Partnership**\n\nI wont be the first to tell you that Lucid is not going to be rolling out its own charging stations and it DOESN\u2019T MATTER!!!!!! Now, let me explain. When TESLA launched to Model S the biggest consumer backlash was over range. I will tell you that this is the BIGGEST pushback on all EVs. TESLA burned CASH to build out a charging infrastructure to support their own vehicles (own chargers and their own proprietary charging connector). The reason for this was they were the only manufacturer trying to build the consumer case for EVs. There was no other true competitor, thus the reason they needed to have a charging infrastructure to support the product. EVs have now surpassed the need to OEMs to be the sole source of charging. This would be like FORD having to supply all the gas stations, it just doesn\u2019t make sense and its not a good use of capital.\n\nThere are several charging companies out there now, some established and some starting. The car of any brand can only charge at the level of what the power is available, and what the car can accept. The fastest way to charge cars with a large battery capacity is with a DC power supply (Level 3 Charger). The charging speed dictation will be with the available power and the cars capability. The Lucid battery has the capacity to charge faster than any other OEM at the moment.\n\n[Lucid Air to be the Fastest Charging EV, Featuring a 900V+ Architecture Delivering a Charging Rate of Up to 20 Miles Per Minute | Lucid Motors](https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-air-fastest-charging-ev/#:~:text=The%20Lucid%20Air%20will%20be%20a%20groundbreaking%20EV%20in%20terms,to%2080%20miles%20per%20hour)\n\nThere will not be enough DC chargers to put out the speed today that Lucid can accept. This is a good thing, you are not buying a 10 year old out dated laptop that only accepts floppy discs. The car is BUILT for the FUTURE. As EVs grow, charging station companies will be expanding their fleets and the power available for charging at fast rates will grow.\n\nLast, with a 500 plus mile range you wont need to charge this thing everyday. Tell me how many times the average driver leaves home, drives over 500 miles before returning home? The answer, very few time a year which is why the growth of home charging networks will also grow. How many cars have 500 mile range gas tanks? Pretty few with the exception of some big diesel trucks. You don\u2019t need to keep making the battery bigger, after all it\u2019s the most costly expense. 500 miles of driving range will calm the nerves of almost all previous anxious EV drivers.\n\n**Autonomous Driving**\n\nThis is the largest and also smallest hurdle for Lucid. Here is the current autonomous levels for reference.\n\n[The 6 Levels of Vehicle Autonomy Explained | Synopsys Automotive](https://www.synopsys.com/automotive/autonomous-driving-levels.html)\n\nAlmost all manufacturers can get to level 2 right now with a simple camera and lidar system. Tesla has released its beta autopilot and its basically close to level 3, more like 2.75. Lucid has developed the car again for the future with a combination of 32 sensors and cameras.\n\n[Lucid Motors Announces Lucid DreamDrive, an Advanced Driver-Assistance System that Debuts in the Lucid Air | Lucid Motors](https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-motors-announces-lucid-dreamdrive/)\n\nHow important is autonomous driving to customers? I will use the Tesla Model Y (which I own) for reference. The model Y like the Lucid Air comes will all the hardwire required for autonomous driving. The model Y comes with a basic version of Level 2 autonomous driving, if you want to upgrade to the FULL autopilot which is basically level 2.75 its an extra $10,000. **Tesla only sells about 15% of all capable models with full autopilot.** Now at least Tesla will sell it to you\u2026 other manufactures like Cadillac are discussing 2-3 years for free and then you pay a subscription beyond that. This is A LOT of LIABILITY to take on as a manufacture to sell AUTO PILOT as a permanent feature. You are basically on the LIABILITY hook with NHTSA for life by offering this feature including any potential recalls. With only 15% of drivers willing to pay for it now, this feature is not the make or break for the company, electric range will be. I believe long term, ALL manufactures will offer autonomous driving as a subscription model. Another great example, Microsoft Office is now Microsoft 360, yearly subscription revenue. Easy way for public companies can show steady \"SERVICE\" revenues without product sales. Who says they can't license it from another company if for some reason theirs is not as good? Less risk also.....\n\n**History of EV success and failures**\n\nTESLA is successful, we have covered most of the reasons why already and Peter has experience with those. **WHY** people choose Teslas over other EVs? First reason is technology (we have outlined those). Second, non-polarizing looks. How many EVs have you seen where you looked at one and couldn\u2019t tell if it was gas or electric? Almost all EVs have some type of lame wannabe futuristic design that people don\u2019t necessarily care for. Now up and til the debut of the Cyber Truck, most Tesla Models were not polarizing to consumers. I think the consensus of the Cyber truck is about 50% love, 50% hate. Tesla makes a descent looking car, but really has the technology people want and enjoy.\n\nOther failures\u2026. I can start by generalizing the majority of existing OEMs by saying they outsource their electrical powertrain technology and you will find that they are all about 5 years behind and 150 miles short in driving range. There are several examples but the most recent one I was excited for what the Porsche Taycan Turbo S. The prototype was sick AF with suicide doors, fast and a 800V battery and promised driving range just over 300 miles. Well, what did we get? $185,000 gets you 192 mile driving range, and a basic Porsche interior. This is the typical OEM response to chasing Tesla. I expect more of this with the new BMW I4 (its gonna be ugly), Jaguar I-Pace and the hideous Mercedes concept.\n\nIMO other EV startups that may not make it:\n\n1. Polestar \u2013 the 200 mile swiss electric volvo. Seen 2 in person, not terrible design but lack EV technology.\n2. Fisker \u2013 The abortion of Henrik Fisker (BMW designer of the 6 series and Z8) from 2008, used outsourced A123 battery supplier which went BK (car was shit anyways, plagued with electrical issues from body harness design amongst other things (my friends worked there), sold to Chinese auto parts company. Henrik retained the name and trademark to try and relaunch it. They wont produce their first SUV until 2022, which will be at an outsourced manufacturing facility in Austria (again same narrative as previous company history, and it will probly repeat itself.) Id stay the FUCK AWAY from this one.\n3. Rivian \u2013 Its got a chance, huge backing from Ford (again chasing), Amazon (why not) debuts in June 2021, but the large truck and large SUV design is not really a competitor with Lucid.\n4. Karma \u2013 See Fisker, it was the Chinese abortion and the 20 year old laptop someone thinks might work.\n5. Faraday Future -\u00a0 feel free to read the wiki, but they have poor leadership, lackluster product and cannot manage money. STAY AWAY!!!!! [Faraday Future - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_Future)\n6. Nikola \u2013 you already have heard, cant trust em, nothing proven, GM already wasted money on a pipe dream, and they aint got a working model.\n7. Lordstown \u2013 More of a competitor to Rivian and Nikola, but again 250 mile range, lacks technology, not a direct competitor.\n\nHybrids\u2026 more trouble than they are worth. Many oems have come out with hybrid cars to get the range out of cars and too be honest they don\u2019t work that well. There is too many parts, a lot of engineering to get both systems to work well together flawlessly. You still have to meet combustion engine emissions requirements. Greatest flop\u2026.. BMW I8. Super hyped, descent looking, what did we get? A 3 cylinder turbo motor on one axle, and really small battery with 13 mile range on the other and a ton of carbon fiber. The car was super expensive to make, weak performance and dealers still have trouble selling them. In fact you can pick one up used for as little as 60K.\n\nALL ELECTRIC WORKS! There\u2019s is library\u2019s full of stories why EVs work, but heres the reason TESLA and LUCID will continue to work.\n\n1. Simple standard aluminum chassis, cheaper and less expensive than carbon fiber but not has heavy as steel.\n2. Basic cost effective design, and not POLARIZING!\n3. Technological advantage over competitors, without a doubt 3-5 years ahead.\n4. Room for technology advances without the need to upgrade hardware in the vehicle (autonomous driving upgrades in the future)(Fast charging)\n5. Luxury braded EV\n6. Vehicle engineering, design and production is vertically integrated (no outsourcing)\n7. Proven tested technology\n8. No internal combustion engine, no smog requirements, which also means less governance. \n\nNow why TESLA and LUCID will continue to achieve... These brands complement each other, one is more value branded and the other luxury branded. Its like Toyota and Lexus, but different parent companies with similar technologies. They are both vertically integrated from design, production and retail distribution (they CONTROL the NARRATIVE).\n\n**Marketing**\n\nLucid is running the same playbook as Tesla, stores in the mall and eliminating the franchise agreement. Ive been to the one in west LA (next to Beverly Hills), its literally right by Apple and Tesla. It works well!!! Keep running with it... run the play til it stops working. \n\n**Launch**\n\nWell Elon said it himself, prototypes are easy, production is hard. Thats why Im ok with rolling back the initial delivery a month or two. Its better to work hard to keep the quality high and under promise and over deliver. Once the the Air Model is out, the roll out of the Gravity should be much easier. They don't use the same production line which means there is no retooling to do between runs (TESLA had this problem).\n\n**Possible OBSTACLES**\n\n1. Production, will be the hardest part no matter what.\n2. PIF intervention and influence of next factory placement. (Control can be eliminated with board member voting rights)\n3. Saudi violations of human rights intervention from US (appears to be low risk based off latest journalist incident)\n4. Initial delivery issues\n\n**Potential GREEN SHOOTS**\n\n1. Great new board members (there's room for a good CTO)\n2. Lucid Air well received at launch by customers\n3. High gasolines prices drive EV sales (See recent mentions of comedy super cycle with inflation, it appears to be happening.)\n4. Government incentives to switch to EV increased or extended\n5. Partnership with Large Cap tech company for vehicle integrations (apple?)\n\n**Value Investment Proposition**\n\n1. You are getting a Tesla like product, without having to convince customers the first real EV proposition and without having to build a charging infrastructure.\n2. This is now going to be a CASH rich company that can get them to 2023 without debt since they over subscribed the PIPE invest with an extra 1.5 Billion (Churchill says sorry) in a economic environment in which interest rates will be rising putting pressure on other high growth/high levered competitors.\n3. SPACs in the last 2 weeks have come under scrutiny and you now have an entry point much lower than the DA with plenty of room to run.\n4. We have a cordial, well spoken CEO who you don't have to worry about being removed as CEO by the board for something he said on twitter.\n\n**Price Point**\n\nTesla burned a fucking wad of cash the first 5 years and raised money with stock multiple times. There will be cash burn from Lucid, but I don't think it will be the levels of Tesla. I think they get to 2023 without having to raise some cash via stock offering. They will need this for the final factory expansion.\n\nI think Lucid can ramp up faster than Tesla because they have the cash and can operate freely, they have secured facilities and a road map to success already. They will have less road blocks since Tesla has paved the way for direct sales to consumers, charging network and proven concept.\n\nHeres a 3rd party article that argues some valuation with a somewhat bearish view so I'm not hyping anything\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/10/how-lucid-motors-stock-could-double-your-money/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/10/how-lucid-motors-stock-could-double-your-money/)\n\nNow it states that a valuation of 64B at $40 a share is lofty and I do agree for today. Remember, stocks trade based on forward earnings and sales, and lets not forget Teslas sales were weak and the product was out of favor until recently. Since then the growth of Tesla has been exponential. We have the country pushing for EVs and consumers will drive them. I mean a fucking sedan doing a 9.9 1/4 mile time with a 500 mile driving range. I mean that's like a Ferrari assassin sleeper shit, and this is a REALITY.\n\nMerger Complete Price Point: **June 30, 2021 - $30**\n\nVehicle deliveries have been rolling at 75% of expectations **EOY December 2021 - $40**\n\nLucid Air production is ramped up and bugs are worked out for 2022, Gravity debut and second facility completed for Gravity production **March 2022 $75**\n\nGravity production running 100%, Air 100% **December 2022 $100**\n\nOther Exponential factors in Lucid valuation that have not been factored into sales +/- 20%\n\n1. Battery and Powertrain units being sold to other manufactures\n2. Cash raise at the end of 2022 to fund future production facilities\n3. Licensing of proprietary technology to other OEMs\n4. Expansion of powertrain and battery factory\n5. A world of unfucking knowns\n6. Tease of other models or new concepts (Coupe sports car would be my next limited production high profitable model choice). \n\n**TLDR**\n\n**I like the stock**",

        "selftext": "Hi Everyone, below is a post about Lemonade, which has fallen 30%+ over the past few days. There\u2019s a lot of hype around the stock, but based on my diligence, I think investors should **not** buy the dip.   \n\n\n**Q4 2020 Financial Results - The Good Stuff**\n\n* I want to start this post actually with the positives for the company from the latest earnings. Numbers are from their [latest shareholder letter](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/169142121000019?cik=1691421) \n* From 2019-2020, Lemonade\u2019s **in force premium, increased by 87%** from $114 million to $213 million \n   * This was driven by **higher premiums per customer ($213 in Q4 2020 vs $177 in Q4 2019)** and an impressive **56% year-over-year increase in number of customers (which now sits at \\~1 million)** \n      * If you\u2019re not familiar with insurance, **premiums** are just the amount customers pay each month, so if you pay $10 a month for renter's insurance, your monthly premium is $10 \n      * The **in force premium is annualized,** so in our previous example, your in force premium would be $10 a month times 12 months which equates to $120 for your in force premium \n   * Lemonade **started off as a disruptive rentals insurance company** but has since then launched new products including **homeowners, pets, and life insurance** and this is how the\u00a0company has been able to increase the premium it charges per customer by cross-selling its products to the same customer \n* The company also grew their **gross earned premium to $50 million** which represents a 92% year over year increase \n   * Gross earned premium represents the amount of the in force premium Lemonade collects once the service is fully delivered \n   * So for example, if a customer pays $10 on January 1st for 1 month of rental insurance, Lemonade's gross earned premium is $0 and only becomes $10 once the full month of January has passed \n* The company\u2019s **annual gross loss ratio also fell from 79% to 71%** (Q4 2019 to Q4 2020), signaling better operating margins \n* Basically, Lemonade has experienced an increasing customer base, has been charging more per customer, leading to higher in force premiums \n* In addition to this, management strongly hinted that it\u2019s working on a new product that will launch later this year, and it\u2019s most likely going to be car insurance (watch starting 3:12 of this [video from CNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIuGUEX4S04&amp;t=155s)\u00a0with LMND\u2019s CEO) \n   * This could be a significant revenue driver for the company and I do like that Lemonade is expanding aggressively into multiple products as long as the company can grow its customer base \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q4 2020 Financial Results - The Bad Stuff**\n\n* The first thing I need to do is set the stage by explaining the **company's sky-high valuation to explain why the stock plummeted 16%\u00a0after earnings** \n   * Right before earnings, the company was trading at $132 per share, which gave the company a market cap of $8.5BN. Adjusting for the\u00a0company\u2019s cash of $1.2BN (incorporates company\u2019s latest follow-on offering), the company had an **enterprise value of $7.2BN** \n   * In the most recent quarter, the\u00a0company guided to a midpoint of $115.5 million in 2021 revenue. **This meant Lemonade was trading at a 63x 2021 revenue multiple,** which is higher than pretty much all of the fastest growing software\u00a0companies in the world \n      * Here\u2019s a [list](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2172588b-b60a-427d-9815-f523942b2183_1145x631.png) of some of the fastest growing software companies in the world for reference \n   * But that\u2019s the thing, Lemonade is **NOT** a software company. Many hype investors forget that it\u2019s an **insurance company f**irst and foremost \n      * The most obvious proof of this is in the company\u2019s **gross margins** which jumped in the latest quarter to 37%, but for the **full year of 2020 was at a very sub-par 26%** (vs. 70%+ for a good software company) \n* Given that Lemonade is trading at a revenue multiple higher than pretty much all of the best software companies, **Lemonade really needed to crush earnings in order to propel its stock further.** It did not: \n   * While customers have increased year over year by 56%, if you take a [closer look at the quarter by quarter data,](https://content.bamsec.com/0001691421-21-000019/q42020lmndshareholderlet027.jpg) Lemonade added \\~60K new customers, which is the smallest increase in the past 2 years \n      * And [it\u2019s not like the company is spending any less in marketing](https://content.bamsec.com/0001691421-21-000019/q42020lmndshareholderlet021.jpg), which is pretty much in line with previous quarters \n      * The reduction in customer growth is something I would really worry about as a Lemonade investor because that is what is the true driver of the company\u2019s growth \n   * In addition, to all of this, about **a quarter of Lemonade\u2019s customers are in Texas,** which as you probably know was recently hit with a huge power outage \n      * In the latest earnings call, management stated that\u00a0there will be a spike in its gross loss ratio but no material affects to its financials, which I personally find a little hard to believe \n   * Some may also point to the company\u2019s [improvement in its operating expense margin](https://content.bamsec.com/0001691421-21-000019/q42020lmndshareholderlet034.jpg) when compared to its gross earned premium and it\u2019s true that it\u2019s gone from negative 156% to negative 89% (lol) \n      * But the $44.5 million spent in Q4 2020 earned the company a total of just $7.5 million in gross profit (pretty terrible unit economics) \n      * Personally, I\u2019m okay with companies during their growth stages spending tons of cash and being unprofitable, but given Lemonade\u2019s slowing customer growth and poor gross and operating margins, Lemonade\u2019s insanely high valuation cannot be justified \n* Combined with all this, I do have to mention that the stock is also largely down the recent jump in bond yields, which punishes growth stocks, especially the ones overvalued \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What I Think Lemonade\u2019s Stock Price Should Be**\n\n* If we take a look at some of the [fastest growing tech stocks](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2172588b-b60a-427d-9815-f523942b2183_1145x631.png) in the world, of which all are growing quickly and have gross margins in the 70s or above, then\u00a0I think it\u2019s safe\u00a0to say that at maximum, Lemonade deserves to be trading at a 35x next twelve months (i.e. 2021) sales which I think is still generous \n   * **If we assume a 35x 2021 sales multiple,** then given LMND\u2019s guidance of 2021 revenue to $115.5mm (midpoint of $114-$117mm), then we get to an enterprise value of \\~$4BN \n      * After we add back $1.2BN in cash, we get to an estimated market cap of $5.3BN which when you divide by Lemonade\u2019s fully diluted shares comes out to a **$82.68 share price which represents a \\~17% drop** (LMND currently trades at $97 at time of post) \n   * But, I think 35x is a really\u00a0generous multiple given that the company\u2019s\u00a0growth is in\u00a0question and has poor margins and believe **the company should be truly trading closer to 20x,** which gives us a share price of **$55.57** \n* Now do I think the stock will go down to $55? I think if bond yields continue to push higher and we have a big tech correction, I definitely think it\u2019s possible but probably not likely given how irrational the market has been these past few years \n   * Also, any reversal in bond yields will likely push the stock up but I believe over time, the stock will fall to a more reasonable level into the \\~70s and so I personally do not recommend buying the dip \n\n**TLDR:** LMND is growing impressively but has terrible unit economics and valuation is far too ahead of itself (even with the recent dip).",

        "selftext": "Good Sunday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 15th, 2021.\n\n# **The Fed could be a catalyst for bonds, and that could drive growth stocks in week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/the-fed-could-be-a-catalyst-for-bonds-and-that-could-drive-growth-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Bonds could be volatile in the week ahead. If yields go higher, that could make it difficult for big tech and other growth stocks to gain traction.\n*****\n&gt; Rising bond yields have been challenging growth stocks. Names like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon have been lagging as investors move to cyclical groups that do well in an economic recovery. Even so, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow both closed at record highs Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite was lower.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq, home to big tech, did gain 3% in the past week, but it is down 5.5% over the last month.\n*****\n&gt; The bond market in the coming week will likely take its cues from the Federal Reserve, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank is expected to give a nod to much better growth. Bond pros are also watching to see whether Fed officials will tweak their interest rate outlook, which now does not include any rate hikes through 2023.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; \u201cThe markets have way too high expectations around what the Fed is going to do or say,\u201d said Gregory Peters, head of multi-sector and strategy at PGIM Fixed Income. \u201cI think the message is going to be consistent.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to sound dovish and is unlikely to give any time frames on when the central bank will change its bond-buying program or other policy.\n*****\n&gt; Bond yields, which move opposite price, have been rising on an improving outlook for the economy.\n*****\n&gt; That trade also showed up in the stock market, with the Dow up 4% for the week to end Friday at a record 32,778. Consumer discretionary stocks, which include retail, were among the best performers, up 5.7%, boosted by optimism that individuals will spend their $1,400 stimulus checks.\n*****\n&gt; Yields were higher Friday after President Joe Biden said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine by May 1. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a high of 1.642% \u2014 its highest level in more than a year.\n*****\n&gt; It is the key rate to watch since it affects mortgages and other consumer and business loans.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe economy is going to be unbelievably strong this year \u2014 deficit spending, reopening, vaccines,\u201d said Peters of PGIM.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt looks like for next year, all the numbers are being revised higher,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this thing could have some sustainable growth, so I think there\u2019s going to be pressure on rates moving higher.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bond yields rose sharply over the past month. The rapid pace of the move has made stocks jittery as investors adjust to higher rates. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% on Feb. 12.\n*****\n&gt; # Growth vs. cyclicals\n&gt; Over the last month, energy stocks have risen nearly 20%, financial stocks are up 10.2%, and industrials are up 7%. The S&amp;P technology sector is down 5.4% over the last month, and communications services, which includes internet names was up 0.8%.\n*****\n&gt; Higher rates are a challenge for tech and other growth stocks because those shares are expensive and have high price-earnings ratios.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen rates are very low, valuations don\u2019t matter to people,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Global Advisors.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf rates are low, there\u2019s no penalty,\u201d he said. \u201cIf rates start to go up, people become much more sensitive to valuations, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen here.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com, follows short-term stock market technicals and trades many of the growth stocks. Lately, however, he\u2019s found himself sitting in many value names and cyclicals.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe names that I\u2019m in \u2014 Visa, GM, Ford, Macy\u2019s, 3M. Those have been my biggest winners this week,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been really hard to make money in Apple, Facebook and Tesla.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq has been hardest hit by the rise in interest rates. Apple was down 0.3% in the past week but down 10.6% in the past month. The S&amp;P 500 finished at a record 3,943 and was up 2.6% in the past week, but is flattish over the last month, up just 0.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cRate volatility could cause another inflection point in tech,\u201d Redler said. \u201cLast week, tech hit its reactionary low, and this [past] week it had an oversold bounce. The question is, \u2018Was that it?\u2019\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext Wednesday, Powell could be the determining factor,\u201d he said. \u201cRates made higher highs and tech is way off last Friday\u2019s lows so maybe the market is getting more comfortable.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Apple\u2019s stall out is unusual for the tech bellwether. It helped power the market\u2019s gains last year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWatch Apple because it\u2019s a little bit of everything. Apple is growth, tech, retail. If anything is doing well, it should be Apple,\u201d Redler said.\n*****\n&gt; # Bond volatility\n&gt; There is some important data in the coming week, including February\u2019s retail sales and industrial production, both on Tuesday. There is also a $24 billion 20-year Treasury note auction on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; The biggest catalyst for the bond market remains the Fed.\n*****\n&gt; The bond market has been speculating about something the Fed may not discuss after its meeting Wednesday afternoon. In one of its moves to shore up the economy during the pandemic, the Fed allowed banks to hold Treasury bonds without counting them against the bank\u2019s leverage ratio. This strategy allowed institutions to have more flexibility to use their balance sheet for activities like lending.\n*****\n&gt; The program expires March 31.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is a huge issue basically because you have so much Treasury supply coming and reinstating [the rule] basically makes it highly punitive for banks to own Treasurys,\u201d Peters of PGIM said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe markets are kind of divided on what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI think most experts believe an extension is the appropriate path.

This event is often referred to as Quadruple Witching or as we prefer to call it in the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac (2021 page 106), Triple Witching.\n\n&gt; March\u2019s option expiration week performance is second only to December\u2019s and has a bullish bias. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have recorded weekly gains in about twice the number of weeks as declines. NASDAQ\u2019s track record since 1983 is slightly softer with 23 advances and 15 declines, but all three indices have logged gains in options expiration week in ten of the last thirteen years. However, the week after is bearish for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. S&amp;P 500 is weakest, down eight of the last nine. Last year as covid-19 began spreading globally and economies began to shut down, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 suffered their worst weekly declines during March\u2019s quarterly options expiration.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/6ef1d4cbdd86a8efa09b8c2942d48517/32ed3896b2fe9623-1a/s500x750/f4254e1e0edf858dbfd4e67344757c69c48d30b6.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/81d51a4dd39b5941b831de20b28314c7/32ed3896b2fe9623-0e/s500x750/3ef3515466260a5660a9ec6eadb8a91cd697cf96.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/92b861530dfd9673b236fb0cd7af89c0/32ed3896b2fe9623-3c/s500x750/23c07978c0f660d7070cc8e2dd6c81aa392a92b7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Signs of Life in Europe?\n\n&gt; Few equity sectors on earth have been as poor as European financials since the Global Financial Crisis. The sector still sits more than 50% below its 2007 all-time highs, hampered by regulations, low to negative interest rates, and all around slow growth in the Eurozone. However, despite those headwinds, the sector has benefitted from a recent rotation to value, and has certainly been assisted by rising interest rates, a phenomenon we discussed earlier this week.\n\n&gt; Not only is performance for European financials improving in absolute terms, as global equities continue to recover from the worst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but since early October the sector has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by more than 20 percentage points. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the pattern relative to the S&amp;P 500 appears to be on the verge of breaking out of a nearly year-long technical base, similar to where US financials stood just two months ago.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture-3.12.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; While we don\u2019t think European financials are going back to all-time highs anytime soon, remember, the sector still needs to gain 12% from current levels just to eclipse its 2020 pre-pandemic highs, a bar that certainly now seems attainable in 2021. \u201cWe remain broadly skeptical of foreign developed equities compared to their U.S. counterparts,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, financials are the largest sector within Europe and improving performance and the continued rotation to cyclical value stocks make this a development to keep an eye on.\u201d\n\n&gt; For now, we recommend sticking with US financials, which we recently upgraded in our latest Global Portfolio Strategy report, and is now the second best performing sector year to date, trailing only energy.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # NASDAQ Bounces Off Support As Dow, S&amp;P 500 &amp; Russell 2K Log Record Highs, But Beware the Ides of March\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve been tracking the NASDAQ 100 Index ($^NDX) (represented by the ETF Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ) as a proxy for the market\u2019s technical picture. It contains many of the tech stocks that have been driving the economy and market for the past year through these Covid times as well as for quite a while prior \u2013 and likely to do so for some time to come.\n\n&gt; There has definitely been some rotation out of this sector of late as DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 logged new highs today. But we would like to see confirmation with new highs in NASDAQ and NDX.\n\n&gt; The NAS and NDX are still lagging, but today\u2019s stronger rally in the techs is encouraging. In this updated technical picture you can see that as the NDX logged a 10% correction from its February 12 closing high of 13807.70 to its closing low on Monday March 8 of 12299.08 it bounced off key support just above 12200 (intraday low on Friday March 5 was 12208.39). Check last week\u2019s technical analysis post for reference to previous support levels that were broken.\n\n&gt; This 12200-level lines up with the October high which is also the high of that W-123 swing bottom pattern we mentioned last week. Back then it was key resistance that we cleared in late-November and early December. It now forms key support and lines up with the uptrend line from the September and October lows we discussed in our Almanac Investor December eNewsletter Outlook just before Thanksgiving.\n\n&gt; However, as the Ides of March are upon us, we must remind you that the end of March has a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously as noted in the 2021 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac in the March Almanac and several places on pages 30-39. The Week After Triple Witching is often prone to weakness with DJIA down 22 of last 33 and the last few days often succumb to end-of-Q1 selling pressure. If any late-March weakness materializes it should be a solid buying opportunity for top-ranked April, the last month of the Best Six Months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/264401d95b5a55c592a6f8f10df22c5e/24ec511e4e033f88-38/s500x750/fe7be5042338b6e7e7b428a0f8fd5208691e48d7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Versatile Outperformers\n\n&gt; There's still a lot of time left in the day, but the tone of the equity market has been much different today compared to Monday. Whereas Monday saw tech stocks get creamed while cyclical areas of the market rallied, today we're seeing tech stocks rebound while cyclicals lag. To illustrate, within the entire S&amp;P 500 there are just 14 stocks that have so far managed to outperform the index by at least one percentage point both yesterday and today. The table below lists each of those stocks, and looking through them, they aren't the flashy, high-profile names that you always see discussed in the media. Who said boring is a bad thing? In terms of sector representation, there's also no clear trend as eight of the eleven sectors are represented by the list of just fourteen names!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we show six-month price charts of each of the 14 names listed above from our Chart Scanner tool. Here again, no clear technical theme links the stocks together. While stocks like AES, Global Payments (GPN), McKesson (MCK), and Ross Stores (ROST) remain close to six-month highs, others like Ball (BLL), Domino's (DPZ), and Market Axess (MKTX) aren't far from six-month lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308a-768x515.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308b-768x509.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308c-768x253.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/1a03fHd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/QfVfqx2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/Is3mMmC.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.15.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/k2c0t0O.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/VKvrx46.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  3.16.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eoFBwOW.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ujRMr7q.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/myM4TrG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.17.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jVQLr1k.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.18.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AWKlUdJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.18.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SWuSo8l.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.19.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/VyDOWFI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.19.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # FedEx Corp. $270.20\n**FedEx Corp.

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: obviously not a financial advisor and long on CCIV (20% of my portfolio). Please do your own due diligence. This posting is just for entertainment :)\n\n**Let's start with the Lucid facts:**\n\n1. Rawlinson \"said six well-known automakers have reached out to him over the last month \\[January 2021\\] and expressed interest in Lucid Motors\u2019 technology\" (Source 1)\n2. Lucid has indeed great technology and is not vaporware, a recent drive by a reputable auto magazine confirmed a prototype range of 490 miles (Source 2)\n3. Tesla Model S Plaid S + is delayed to mid 2022, thus if Lucid doesn't delay again, Air Grand Touring will be the number 1 EV for up to 1 year.\n\n**Here are facts from Jaguar and BMW:**\n\n1. Jaguar and BMW are working for almost 2 years on an EV platform (Source 3)\n2. They are failing (BMW's newest EV has less than 300 miles range and Jaguar had to cancel its newest EV and lost 1.4b USD) (Source 4) - in other words, BMW and Jaguar are now barely passing Tesla's Model S range from 2012 with 265 miles.\n3. Therefore Jaguar is actively looking for a partner (Source 5)\n4. The Englishman Rawlinson worked for Jaguar before Tesla and Lucid's top management has many Germans\n5. Jaguar and BMW are still working together on their EV strategy (Source 6)\n\n**Putting the pieces together:**\n\n1. It's in Lucid's interest to partner up and license its technology to a premium brand to gain credibility from investors but also customers. Right now, Lucid is a 0 revenue 0 products company. The brand \"Lucid\" is nowhere near established.\n2. Of course, BMW, Jaguar and other premium brands who have missed the EV transition are ready to pay for technology that its customers expect from a premium brand (400+ miles range)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs this a win-win?

        "selftext": "First DD post, wanted to give back to the pennystocks community. \nGoing to just go straight into it:  \nAtari has a market cap of 154.797M with a low float of 173.63M shares(compare this to e.g. AMC's float of 285M) and currently trades around 60 cents.\n\nIt owns its own cryptocurrency, the [Atari token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/atari-token/) which itself has a market cap of $113,971,281.  \n\nIf you haven't heard of NFTs yet, I highly recommend looking into it as its blown up and I personally believe will continue blowing up as it penetrates the mainstream audience further. I just saw a guest mention them on CNBC the other day. [CNBC video from two days ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prqHJReP9II). [WSJ coverage from today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpROwouRo_M). [Reuters coverage from today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_AugmQpwho)\n\nAnyway, Atari is setting up a [crypto casino](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-08/atari-partners-with-crypto-gaming-operation-to-launch-casino) involving NFTs in order to \"move the Atari gaming experience onto the blockchain\". This idea has been well received, there's a post on the CryptoCurrency subreddit discussing it that I can't link here, but the general consensus is that it's a good idea.\n\nThey're also [pairing with Bondly](https://bondlyfinance.medium.com/atari-and-bondly-announce-strategic-partnership-to-launch-dedicated-nfts-followed-by-the-atari-68621044666d), a NFT marketplace. I don't understand the whole impact of this, but part of it is that Bondly will now make NFTs purchasable using the Atari Token. This should spike the value of that token, which should then spike the value of Atari. Look at the other NFT tokens like Enjin and Flow etc, they've mooned the fuck out of their minds since the NFT trend started.The other part of this is that they're going to create something called the \"Atari Metaverse gaming platform\" which utilizes NFTs as part of the experience, which I'm going to be honest I have no idea what the fuck this will end up as. But it sounds sexy.  \n\nThey also [partnered with ICICB Group](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/10/2190694/0/en/Atari-Partners-with-ICICB-Group-and-Grants-Licensing-Rights-to-Build-Atari-Hotels-in-Dubai-Gibraltar-and-Spain.html) to build Atari Hotels in Dubai, Gibraltar, and Spain to start. As part of this deal, they receive a small payment and 5% of all revenues generated from the hotels moving forward.  \n\nThey also have a [new gaming console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_VCS_(upcoming_console)) that also serves as a PC. It utilizes a AMD Zen processor and 4-8 GB DDR4 RAM. Don't know much about this other than it started shipping to initial backers in December 2020.  \n\nFinally, Atari is memeable. Everyone knows Atari or an Atari game. A lot of people grew up with Pong, Asteroids, Missile Command, and so on. It's a good nostalgia/crypto/NFT play that hasn't hard mooned like all these other plays yet.",

        "selftext": "I don't normally like these \"options for dummies\" kinds of posts and absolutely don't like seeing them but I keep seeing people try to make a stupid person's guide to how options work and being **really irresponsible** about explaining theta. I have a few points I want to make about theta then hopefully we can put this to rest. I'm not going to talk about Delta or IV that's a different conversation and motherfuckers need to read.\n\nReal quick:\n\n* Not a pro\n* Not investment advice\n* Advice about how you need to actually learn shit\n\nIf you're too retarded to understand basic math or you're too lazy to try to actually better yourself then click the back button now. For the retards that stick around I'll include pictures and a fun little story.\n\nOkay about 3% of you should be left so let's dive in.\n\n# Theta\n\n The term theta refers to the rate of decline in the [value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/value.asp) of an option due to the passage of time. It can also be referred to as the [time decay](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timedecay.asp) of an option. This means an option loses value as time moves closer to its [maturity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp), **as long as everything is held constant**. Theta is generally expressed as a negative number and can be thought of as the amount by which an option's value declines every day. \n\nTheta is an estimate of value decay. It's a rate that's continuously adjusted. Every second that passes makes your option worth less and less. The biggest misconception is the one I want to focus on the most. We talk about it it terms expressed in decay on a day I think for our simple brains but it's not that simple just like days aren't really exactly 24 hours and there's complex reasons why.\n\n# THETA. IS. NOT. LINEAR.\n\nYou dickheads remember y=mx+b from middle school? that's linear. Here's theta on an option graphed for a 1yr contract.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.optiontradingtips.com\\/greeks\\/theta.html](https://preview.redd.it/k3zpzuyfzvm61.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=359ec39cb38f082a8ca2fe69f7f562cf2ec441da)\n\n Theta is exponential. the theta decay on your option accelerates over time. Look at that last little sliver of the chart. See how sharp it goes down? That's 'FD' range. That's when all the value of the option evaporates nearly instantly like your wife's interest in you when she met her boyfriend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.optiontradingtips.com\\/greeks\\/theta.html](https://preview.redd.it/br6wnmc31wm61.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63e4ca62032511a0b8e3ee2e43feed83b645def8)\n\n# Theta will eat your lunch\n\nLast week I had a C250 FD on GME that I had to close on a loss even though it was ITM. WHY? Because the rate of decay on the option was so fast that GME **wasn't rising fast enough to increase the value of the option and make up the difference**. Buying OTM and going ITM is good but it's important to understand that even IF you are ITM it still won't save you from theta and sometimes it's smarter to take profit rather than waiting. **You COULD even take the profit and buy the underlying**...\n\n# Retard/Ape edition incase you're somehow still here\n\nYou live in Loserville and want to move to TendieTown. The distance is 1000 miles. You have 1 work week to get there( 5 days). So first thing you realize is that you can travel 200 miles per day and you'll get there on time. Great. Say you take Monday off. Suddenly you need to travel 250 miles per day. Not impossible but okay that's not a fun speed to move at. Take note it's a 25% increase. Let's say again on the second day there's no 'movement'. Now you need to cover the same 1000 miles in 3 days. Okay now you're looking at 333.3 miles. That's a 33.33% increase from the previous day. Holy shit now you need to fucking move and move fast. But let's say for one reason or another you, \"**G**ary **M**ichael **Edward**\" can't get out of bed on Wednesday. Still have 1000 miles to travel. Now you need to cover that distance in 2 days with an average velocity toward your goal at 500 miles per day. That's a 50% increase from the previous day. And on the last day you need to do all 1000, which is a 100% increase from the previous day.\n\nThis is a gross over simplification but it at least gets point across.\n\nDo you guys get it now? Every day without progress makes the goal much more unlikely because the burden just shifts and grows exponentially to the remainder of time. As the likelihood of the open hitting ITM increases and time passes, theta acts as a decaying agent on the price bringing it into balance.\n\n* Please stop reading option tutorials from plumbers / dog walkers / high school teachers\n* Please read about these concepts on actual investing websites and not the worlds Instagram of trading addiction or watch video from actual professional investors\n* If someone tells you they're not a pro/ are retarded think twice about letting them explain shit to you.\n* Read a book motherfucker\n\nFD's made this casino notorious because people who were here well before I was started posting crazy yolo FD's -  who knew how acidic theta was and still bought and occasionally made disgusting returns.  \n\n\nGood luck everyone. I know all you are going to pump FD's with your stimmy so I guess just have fun and please try to learn how to read.",

(OTCQB: RXMD)**  \n\nProgressive Care Inc, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, is a Florida technology and health services organization that provides prescription pharmaceuticals, compounded medications, tele-pharmacy services, anti-retroviral medications, medication therapy management, the supply of prescription medications to long term care facilities, 340B services to charitable organizations, and health practice risk management.   \n\n\n**Subsidiares**\n\n**PharmCo** \\-  PharmCo provides contracted pharmacy services for 340B Covered Entities under the 340B Drug Discount Pricing Program (a $29.9 billion market in 2019). PharmCo filled more than 530,000 prescriptions in 2020, compared to 323,000 in the nine months ended September 30 2019.\n\nIn addition to fulfilling prescriptions, PharmCo operate a proprietary tele-pharmacy software service called Tele-PharmCo. This multi-platform technology software facilitates two-way video conferencing between patients, healthcare professionals, and PharmCo\u2019s team of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians through a secure video interface. Tele-PharmCo allows patients and their care providers to connect and interact with licensed pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in real-time and speak directly about medications, prescription refills, adverse reactions, and other concerns. PharmCo established this in **2018.** Three years ago! I'm sure most have witnessed the explosive growth of the likes of Teladoc in the past few months. Well, the leadership at Progressive Care saw this opportunity coming years ago and it undoubtedly helped them through the Covid-19 pandemic where in-person consultations will have decreased. That is how forward thinking this leadership team is. You can see how Tele-PharmCo works [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzlH1N12_Wo).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ClearMetrX** \\- ClearMetrX launched in 2020 and is a wholly-owned data management company with services designed to support health care organizations across the country. It uses AI to help physicians make informed decisions in the medication therapy management process.  Through ClearMetrX, the Company has increased its third party administrative and data management fees to over $700,000 in 2020. These fees have gross margins significantly greater than those generated from their pharmacy operations. At the end of the first quarter of 2021, they expect the ClearMetrX digital platform will be fully operational, which will allow them to expand their third-party administration services to 340B covered entities nationwide.  \n\n\n**Partnerships**\n\n**DeliverSTAT** \\-  In September 2020, the company entered into a partnership with DeliverSTAT,  a provider of an all-in-one pharmacy delivery logistics solution. The new platform will allow PharmcoRx to compete and possibly partner in the future with pharmacy delivery apps such as Capsule, PillPack, NimbleRx and UberHealth in terms of functionality and technology. The platform connects directly with the pharmacy to help manage the prescription delivery process from end to end, reducing overhead, simplifying operations, and improving both patient and physician satisfaction. \n\n**EagleForce Health, LLC** \\-  In February 2021, the company entered into a service agreement with EagleForce Health, LLC to integrate its proprietary telehealth platform, called \u201cmyVax\u201d, and develop a platform for the Company\u2019s Digital Passport for COVID-19 Testing and Vaccination Results.

Despite the massive opportunity here it\u2019s definitely worth considering the spanners that could delay or prevent progress for SAV and other EU lithium projects. \n\nHopefully you find this of use \u2013 welcome any feedback as my first shared DD.

Additionally, metallurgical test-work results have produced an \u201cexcellent\u201d **6% Li20 low impurity concentrate**, which according to chief executive David Archer, is **\u201cideal\u201d for the EV battery industry**\u201d\n* *Note: A scoping project in 2018 highlighted \u201cthat for a capital expenditure of just US$109mln Savannah could build a mine likely to deliver an internal rate of return of over 46% and with a net present value of over US$240mln\u201d* \n* *Note: Compare this timeline to another key player European Metal Holdings completing their feasibility study a year later*[ *in 2019*](https://www.europeanmet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/20190617-AIM-EMH-PFS-Update.pdf) \n* [A new **definitive feasibility study is excepted this yea**r that will pave the way for next steps in production](https://www.savannahresources.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/December-and-January_Newsletter_EN.pdf) \n* [Recent announcement that a partnership is all but finalised with GALP](https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/938158/savannah-resources-set-to-team-up-with-galp-for-portuguese-lithium-project-938158.html), who will have 10% stake in company at 6.4$m and roughly 50% of production agreement, in return are supporting the commercialization study and funding the set up of production. \n* *Note: GALP are a local* ***multibillion pound local organisation that specialise in energy.*** *They can provide all the scope to commercialise quickly, expand and unlock other partnerships.* \n* And last but not least, the **Portuguese government are pushing to make Portugal the hub for local lithium supply in Europe**, aiming to set-up for [complete end-to-end production chain](https://primetimezone.com/business/portugal-and-spain-will-create-a-lithium-industrial-chain-on-the-border/).

This is a key risk currently [highlighted in Portugal with local advocacy protestin](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/dec/08/the-curse-of-white-oil-electric-vehicles-dirty-secret-lithium)g the advancement of the mine. \n\n*The counter:*\n\n* *As mentioned in the same source, local sentiment is not set either way, being worn out by the plans and as well having long-term economic and employment problems this project would help to solve (same source as above)*\n* *SAV are proposing a host of actions to help provide employment and support for local communities* \n* *David Archer (CEO) has also already alluded to the fact* [*SAV will be incorporating new more environmentally friendly extraction methods*](https://pemedianetwork.com/transition-economist/articles/electrification/2021/lithium-price-surge-fuels-mining-innovation) *due to this overall consideration*  \n* *And the Portuguese government push in favour of the industry will help massively get things through*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Risk 2)** Being locally sourced is not the only way to reduce climate impact. Direct Lithium Extraction is a relatively new process making headlines recently because of its much lower emissions innovation and could impact future demand for a direct European supply. \n\n*The counter:* \n\n* *This is something to definitely keep a lookout for as it becomes more commercialised, but for the next 5-10 years demand for lithium and local supply will outweigh innovation here most likely unless there are any huge advances.*\n* *This could also help organisations like SAV as they begin to reduce their impact and become more accepted across Europe*  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Risk 3)** In Europe there are much tighter regulations and restrictions in comparison to much of the RoW - this can and will increase cost, harming pricing competitiveness and slowing timelines.\n\n*The counter:* \n\n* *This is where we\u2019re relying on the Portuguese Government's push to develop their local industry to push through negative sentiment and accelerate timelines.* \n* *It's worth noting that Portugal has some serious issues with unemployment (pre-existing COVID), especially in-land with a lot of coastal migration for work, and is very much* *an economy still fighting for its life after real struggles in the last decade.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Risk 4)** Is the demand for Lithium a sure thing? Innovations in recycling and new more efficient batteries could reduce demand and impact price. \n\n*The counter:* \n\n* *Yes, all valid innovations and a diverse long-term portfolio in this sector should try and cover promising organisations here as well.* \n* *But for now many innovations are years of being scaled and implemented properly and the demand is skyrocketing \u2013 the level of investment in Europe (*[*from practically 0 to 2017 to 22 cell manufacturers*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMSxu_pTbQk&amp;ab_channel=MinesandMoney)[ *in development/operations currently*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMSxu_pTbQk&amp;ab_channel=MinesandMoney)*) and sentiment stated above from EU bodies makes me very positive here* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Risk 5)** The stock has a large float. This reduces the risk of volatility in some ways obviously, but does certainly in its current state cap the potential for growth - it's unlikely this stock can get close to \u00a31 for example in its current state (but that would be 20x current prices and a lofty ambition). I'm not an expert in the impact of reverse mergers and that potential here so would welcome further insight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**\n\nSavannah Resources, namely through their Mina Do Barroso project in Portugal, look set to be the first in Europe to meet the massively increasing demand for locally sourced lithium. They have lots of a high-quality resource perfect for EVs, and are closer to production than other EU competitors. \n\nA new partnership with GALP, a local multi-billion energy organisation, plus Portuguese government support driving the development of the lithium industry in the region give reason to be confident that the project will move swiftly beyond feasibility and into widescale production. \n\nShort-term catalysts exist with the upcoming final feasibility study this year and new announcements around the GALP partnership, but those really looking to make real gains should be looking long to when production is getting into full flow in the coming years.",

        "selftext": "Colonnade Acquisition just completed their merger with Ouster, a digital LiDAR company. The ticker changes to $OUST tomorrow (1).\n\nToday, they received a $25 price target from Craig-Hallum (2).\n\nOn Feb. 22nd, they held a phenomenal investor day which everyone should watch (3).\n\nHere is the investor deck (4).\n\nOuster has arguable the best LiDAR technology on the market. They use digital LiDAR which has fewer parts, requires less power, is cheaper to make, is smaller and weighs less, and has the best resolution on the market. Their technology is ahead of analog lidar used by VLDR and LAZR. Their tech uses silicon CMOS (similar to digital cameras) and is rooted in Moore's law. This means their technology will exponentially improve while continuing to reduce costs. Their sensors require only a handful of parts while traditional analog LiDAR requires 100's.\n\nDon't trust me? Fine. Trust the market. They have over 500 customers and just inked major deals with Plus and Outrider. The Plus deal is the largerst LiDAR-AV trucking deal in history (4). It has the potential for 160,000 sensors. While other LiDARs have prototypes and \"partners\", Ouster actually has a product and customers.\n\nOuster currently has more revenue than Luminar, Aeva, Aeye, and Innoviz. In addition, they are projecting the largest revenue and EBITDA of all five LiDAR companies. Their technology not only applies to auto, but also every vehicle on Earth. Drones, mining equipment, Postmates last-mile delivery...you name it. \n\nThis is the best kept secret on the market and is criminally undervalued.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(1) [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210311006025/en](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210311006025/en)\n\n(2) [https://www.benzinga.com/stock/cla/ratings](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/cla/ratings)\n\n(3) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6FGxewcC6A&amp;ab\\_channel=Ouster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6FGxewcC6A&amp;ab_channel=Ouster)\n\n(4) [https://s27.q4cdn.com/377532724/files/doc\\_presentation/2021/02/Ouster\\_Investor\\_Day\\_Slides\\_022221.pdf](https://s27.q4cdn.com/377532724/files/doc_presentation/2021/02/Ouster_Investor_Day_Slides_022221.pdf)\n\n(5) [https://www.forbes.com/sites/sabbirrangwala/2021/02/22/plus-commits-to-ousters-digital-lidar-for-autonomous-trucks/?sh=30450ae81967](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sabbirrangwala/2021/02/22/plus-commits-to-ousters-digital-lidar-for-autonomous-trucks/?sh=30450ae81967)",

        "selftext": "This is my first time talking stocks in here;  I am by no means a financial advisor because my mouth is too full of crayons to talk in a way that people can understand me.  This is not financial advise at all.\n\n$SNDL is gearing up for a round 2 and here is why I believe that is the case:\n\n**EPS**\n\n$SNDL is a pretty strong performing company;  Quarter over Quarter they have seen rise in EPS.  I expect this next quarter report (coming 3/17/2021) to be no surprise that they had a good quarter; even considering the recent investment into Indiva (producer of edibles). [source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sundial-and-indiva-announce-22-million-strategic-investment-301228664.html)\n\n**Trading Sideways**\n\nSNDL has been trading sideways since 2/19/2021.  It has stabilized at 1.40 a share; so the current price (today, in my eyes) is still a good deal and it is poised for movement any day.\n\n**Options Activity**\n\nLooking up Options expiring 3/19/2021 we can see that Open Call Interest at or above $1.5 strike totals 196.1k with a whopping 44.5k of those at a $4 Strike vs the Open Put Interest and or below $1.5 Strike is 61k.  This is close to 3x Open Calls v Puts as of today's trade price of $1.36 (at the time of writing this line).  This is very Bullish for a 3/19/2021 rise in stock price which associates with the release of quarter performance above.\n\n**EDIT: Volume Activity**\n\nAt the end of 2/23, 2/24, and 3/1 someone has been scooping up HUGE volume at this price point.  Most likely a large firm looking to capitalize on the future price change. Since the price is going down most of today I expect another big volume spike close to closing bell today which will further solidify my views that Round 2 is coming.\n\n**Weed is good**\n\nIt is..  and if I am totally wrong you will still own a portion of a very great company that will be a strong long position.\n\n**My plan**\nI own about 350 shares of underlaying and a few call options between 1.5 and 3 strike for 3/19 and 3/26 expiration..  The shares are at a discount to a very likely $1.5 rebound.   if you favor shares over options I would say HIGHLY LIKELY to gain at least $0.20 or more per share in the short term.\n\nMy first ever DD so please be kind.  I am welcome if other monkey's want to check into my claims.\n\nAgain; I eat crayons for breakfast, lunch, and dinner; this is not investment advice, do your own DD and make your own decisions.",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, we (5 guys and disclaimer: long on CCIV) did a deep dive into the Apple and Lucid rumors and created also this overview. Feel free to share it:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1u9ac91ljvk61.png?width=1139&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81d57fcfb8f58ccb46aab93356af59f0c4ef4282\n\nWe also made an as objective as possible video about an upcoming potential partnership between Apple and Lucid:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3LL0c3AK2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3LL0c3AK2U)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe think we put some aspects into the video, that are not discussed yet. For example: in the video we mention that 9 out of 11 Lucid studios are less than 3 min walk from an Apple store. And it's possible to guesstimate if they are in talks if Rawlinson gets asked the question, if Lucid will build the Apple car. \n\nNo talks: He *must* deny it according to NYSE rules\n\nTalks: He will most likely say \"no comment\" just like 2-3 weeks ago, when he was asked whether they are in talks with CCIV.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Reasons in favor and against a partnership:**\n\n([5:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3LL0c3AK2U&amp;t=309s)\u200b) 1st reason in favor: Tesla Dream Team Doug Field (current project leader of Project Titan) &amp; Peter Hochholdinger (Vice President of Manufacturing at Lucid) \n\n([6:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3LL0c3AK2U&amp;t=360s)\u200b) 2nd reason in favor: Fit in what Apple and Lucid want and need \n\n([9:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3LL0c3AK2U&amp;t=568s)\u200b) 3rd reason in favor: Brand fit \n\n([10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3LL0c3AK2U&amp;t=621s)\u200b) 1st reason against it: Currently just rumors \n\n([10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3LL0c3AK2U&amp;t=635s)\u200b) 2nd reason against it: Lucid is not established yet \n\n([11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3LL0c3AK2U&amp;t=667s)\u200b) 3rd reason in favor: Lucid is currently relatively small \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think on a scale from 1 (no talks) to 10 (talks are happening) ? :)",

        "selftext": "Happy Sunday everyone!  What a wild couple weeks it has been for all of us, I know I like many others suffered from the pullback and are looking to move on and start making those delicious gains again.  As I am sure a lot of you already know, oil is in high demand right now and the price has been skyrocketing since finding annual low prices.  The result of this demand increase is causing a surge of money to flow into the abandoned oil drilling sector.  I feel very fortunate to be able to bring you this DD as it was not written by myself, but by a friend of mine who has worked in the oil drilling sector, specifically abandoned well drilling for quite some time.  It is always nice to have an expert in the field weigh in on the subject, so please take a minute and look over the data that is being presented.  He truly took an amazing amount of time to put this together for all of us and I really implore people to give it a read through. I hope that everyone has a great weekend, good luck this next week!\n\nLast week high: .06 cents \n\nLast week low: .015 cents\n\nCurrent value: .036 cents\n\nFirst PT goal: .15 cents \n\nSecond PT goal: .50 cents \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**XFLS**: A Exploration and Production company, a Well Service company and a Hydrocarbon Technology company all wrapped up in one working to break into the American market as well as being a mainstay in the Albertan oilfield.\u00a0\n\n[Cycle Energy Corporate Structure](https://preview.redd.it/v80xdr3zr0n61.png?width=484&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=265bba21285dc0e2b7f1f4c4a5879dc736712616)\n\n&gt;Lets start off by talking about the giant **Red Flag.** This company has a Stop sign, and is currently listed as Dark/Defunct. That will be a no go for a lot of people, but before you walk away I implore you to read all of the evidence I have to post here.  It is my firm belief that you will not find a more educated DD on this company or this subject on Reddit.  This is what I do for a living and I know if you are able to look at the information below without bias you will see why I believe in this company.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nThe\u00a0**CEO has stated**\u00a0in numerous emails to multiple investors that their application has been submitted and is now being processed by OTCMarkets. You can watch for updates on their filing status here &gt;&gt;&gt;\u00a0[https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/XFLS/security](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/XFLS/security)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n**First we will see \"Verified Profile &gt; Financial filings &gt; Attorney letter &gt; Yield Sign &gt; Pink Current status\" When all that happens we will blow the doors off the PT's listed above.**  \n\n\n[XFLS Shares](https://preview.redd.it/kwekmx7bv0n61.png?width=1026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fda494a9935e8b5eec224792e26d0978b9605453)\n\nIts share structure is ideal sitting at a float of 180 Million unrestricted shares and 290 million outstanding shares.  Compared to most stocks that are pushed through this sub, the float is TINY.  $TSNP had a 4 billion share float before doing their reverse split for those of you that are looking for some sort of reference point.  $SANP had a 9 billion share float, 50x larger that $XFLS.  With the right amount of attention and traction we would see this absolutely fly past the PT listed above.  Currently it only has 1700 watchers on stock twits and has hardly been noticed at all on its run up.    \n   \n$XFLS often gets left out of the discussion because it has listed its Oil \"RESERVES\" like others MDMP and EEENF. However out of the 3 companies\u00a0**XFLS produces on average 80 to 150 Barrels**\u00a0of oil a day out of the ground.\u00a0**MDMP produces 1 BBL**\u00a0a day and\u00a0**EEENF HAS NO CURRENT PRODUCTION** as they are exploring still.

Here is a breakdown of how that works and how it applies to XFLS  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n**How a Well becomes an Orphan and How it Relates to XFLS**  \n[https://www.orphanwell.ca/about/orphan-inventory/](https://www.orphanwell.ca/about/orphan-inventory/)  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_uCKjJVVACk&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uCKjJVVACk&amp;feature=youtu.be)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nWells, pipelines, and facilities are plugged and decommissioned (\u201cabandoned\u201d) when companies decide to stop using them for oil and gas development. In Alberta, companies are responsible for cleaning up their sites when the sites have reached the end of their productive life and returning the land to a natural state (known as \u201creclamation\u201d). Doing this job properly is often costly.  \nIf a company goes bankrupt before properly decommissioning its wells, facilities, or pipelines, and reclaiming the associated sites, we take action. We will order anyone who owned a part of the site\u2014known as a \u201cworking interest participant\u201d\u2014to carry out this work to properly close the project.  \nIf there is no legally responsible party, we designate the wells, facilities, pipelines, and associated sites as \u201corphaned.\u201d The Orphan Well Association (OWA)\u2014an industry-funded nonprofit organization established in the 1990s\u2014takes over to decommission these wells, facilities, and pipelines, and reclaim the land. The OWA helps to protect Albertans from footing the bill.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n**SRP (Site Rehabilitation Program)**  \nThe Site Rehabilitation Program \u2013 which provides grant funding to oil field service companies to do closure work on oil and gas sites in Alberta \u2013\u00a0**launched on May 1, 2020.**\u00a0It is vital in achieving one of government\u2019s top priorities, by helping get thousands of Albertans back to work. This program is expected to\u00a0**generate almost 5,300 direct jobs**\u00a0and lead to indirect employment \u2013 and economic benefits \u2013 across the province, as other businesses will benefit from the increased closure work occurring in many rural areas across the province.  \n[https://www.alberta.ca/site-rehabilitation-program-overview.aspx](https://www.alberta.ca/site-rehabilitation-program-overview.aspx)  \nTens of thousands of applications have been received and staff are working diligently to review all applications, evaluate project contracts, and process grant funding payments in order to get as many Albertans back to work as soon as possible.  \nWe are in the process of notifying successful and unsuccessful applicants of the status of their grant application. Applicants who are not successful are encouraged to apply in coming application periods, where\u00a0**$800 million is still to be awarded through the program.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n**XFLS RECIEVES 1.1Million In SRP Contracts:** [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cycle-energy-services-receives-1-124500874.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cycle-energy-services-receives-1-124500874.html)  \n   \n**Well Abandonment and servicing via SRP program**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n**Sources:**  \n[https://www.aer.ca/protecting-what-matters/protecting-the-environment/orphan-energy-sites](https://www.aer.ca/protecting-what-matters/protecting-the-environment/orphan-energy-sites)  \n[https://static.aer.ca/prd/documents/enerfaqs/Closure\\_FS.pdf](https://static.aer.ca/prd/documents/enerfaqs/Closure_FS.pdf)  \n[https://www.orphanwell.ca/about/orphan-inventory/](https://www.orphanwell.ca/about/orphan-inventory/)  \n[https://www.orphanwell.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/OWA-Annual\\_2019.pdf](https://www.orphanwell.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/OWA-Annual_2019.pdf)  \n[https://cycleind.wordonthepress.com/](https://cycleind.wordonthepress.com/)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n**Blue Hydrogen Tech:**  \n[**https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cycle-energy-industries-positioned-key-152500095.html**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cycle-energy-industries-positioned-key-152500095.html)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nCycle Energy Industries Inc. (OTC: XFLS) announced today it continues to push its technology towards commercialization which includes its Non Thermal Plasmatron, the front-end reformer of the company's Gas to Liquid system and the upcoming blue hydrogen market being initiated by the Canadian government in Alberta would make Cycle Energy's Non Thermal Plasmatron an ideal fit according to Michael McLaren, CEO of Cycle Energy Industries Inc.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nBlue Hydrogen is Hydrogen production made from breaking down Natural gas. XFLS plans to build a pilot plant that they can install on their own well sites to create hydrogen production on site giving them Oil, Natural gas and Hydrogen all in one facility  \n   \n   \n**Conclusion:**\u00a0XFLS is a great value play, it is a true diamond in the rough with real world Oil and Gas production, Service and Technology. They produce **MORE OIL THAN MDMP and EEENF COMBINED** and are continuing to bring wells online while also executing their government contracts for well abandonments...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nUltimately its your choice what to invest in, I choose research, DD and provable assets above all else.\u00a0**Oil out of the ground is KING**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nThis is not investment advice, this is to get the truth out there about a small undervalued company  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nThis is all IMO.  \nTheGuy870",

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: obviously not a financial advisor and long on CCIV (20% of my portfolio). Please do your own due diligence. This posting is just for entertainment :)\n\n**Previous DD posting:**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/m6hkgt/cciv\\_rawlinson\\_said\\_six\\_wellknown\\_automakers\\_have/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/m6hkgt/cciv_rawlinson_said_six_wellknown_automakers_have/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Let's start with the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) + Lucid facts:**\n\n1. PIF will hold 62.83% of Lucid after the merger (Source 1) \n2. No insiders sold their equity in Lucid to CCIV (not even Venrock, which was an early investor in Atieva/Lucid). CCIV &amp; PIPE proceeds go almost entirely to the cash position of Lucid (except for transaction fees) (Source 2). \n3. PIF didn't sell and they actually even bought more of Lucid in form of the PIPE investment (USD 200m in form of PIPE) (Source 3). They invested (at USD 15 per share) and they cannot sell until September 1st, 2021. \n4. On top of that, PIF paid 100% of an internship training program for young Saudis to intern at Lucid (Source 3). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Some facts about the PIF's plans and its portfolio:**\n\n1. \"The PIF has a total portfolio consisting of over 200 investments\", Lucid is 1 of 200 and they plan to invest every year until 2025 USD 40b in these 200 companies (Source 4).\n2. They identified 13 focus sectors where this money is going. \"Automotive\" is 1 of the 13 (Source 4). \n3. We don't know of any \"Automotive\" investments by the PIF other than Lucid (PIF exited Tesla in early 2020; Uber, another PIF investment, is rather in the \"Transport &amp; Logistics\" sector, not \"Automotive\").\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Some facts about Saudi Arabia:**\n\n1. An oil-based economy is not sustainable. The resources are endless and some experts indirectly state that Saudi Arabia has only 20 years left to transform its economy (if you take into account the yearly production of barrels by Aramco: 3.5b) (Source 5).\n2. Mohammed bin Salman, future king of Saudia Arabia, is 35 years old. If he doesn't transform the economy now, he will face serious problems in 20+ years. \n3. Dubai managed to go from 50% oil based economy to 1% (Source 6). China of course also managed to completely change their economy in the last 4 decades. Authoritarian governments (with thought out investments) can do things that take a longer time in other countries.     \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Putting the pieces together:**\n\n1. We don't know the 200 portfolio companies, in which the PIF is invested in, but it's likely that the PIF will in particular invest into those portfolio businesses that a) they control (so, they profit the most themselves) b) actually need the money (capital-intensive) and c) are sustainable and can help move away from Saudi's oil-based economy.    \n2. If Lucid was vaporware or highly risky, would it have been so easy to get the largest PIPE investment with a 6 months lock-up period in SPAC history? After all, PIPE investors make their DD before investing and they have better access to insider information than we do. Also, the PIF invested even more instead of selling part of their stake to CCIV. \n3. If a Lucid factory was to be built in Saudi Arabia, PIF would very likely take care of the costs (Source 7). Also, all additional costs (building out a supply chain etc.) are likely to be covered by the PIF, since it's in their interest to change their own economy. And it's actually really urgent they do something about it. In contrast, it's not in their interest to pass to Lucid high burdens and costs, which would endanger their own investment. \n4. A factory can cost between USD 1b to 3b, that's easily within the yearly USD 40b that the PIF wants to spend on their portfolio companies. \n5. If we conservatively assume that out USD 40b for 200 companies, Lucid gets 1/200, that's USD 200m per year, which is nice. And if we optimistically assume Lucid is the only portfolio company in the \"Automotive\" focus sector (next to 12 other sectors) and the investments are equally distributed, that's 1/13 or over USD 3b per year.  The truth lies probably somewhere in the middle. And again, this is yearly until 2025, not a one time thing. It could also well be that the PIF finances Lucid's China factory. Why? Because Lucid is owned with 62.83% and controlled by the PIF and it's in their interest to push Lucid forward to succeed.\n6. China bailed out Nio with USD 1.4b in 2020. Remember? (Source 8) If Lucid was for whatever reason in struggle, it's likely the PIF aka Saudi Arabia will also bail out its hope for a better economy and future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you agree or disagree? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR and mission:**\n\nWe have made a 10+ min video diving even deeper into this topic: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlY68nWYs\\_c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlY68nWYs_c) \n\nWe are 5 Germans (3 PhDs) and our YouTube channel [https://www.youtube.com/growthstockresearch](https://www.youtube.com/growthstockresearch) focuses on deep dive research on Lucid instead of daily price updates (which don't make much sense in stocks for long-term investors anyway). We don't use cringey thumbnails with surprised/shocked faces or caps like \"HURRY! THIS STOCK WILL EXPLODE (actually I cannot see into the future, but oh well)\" or \"EVERYTHING IS CRASHING. WHAT NOW?! (I also have no clue whatsoever, but I certainly hope I will get many views for my low-effort video)\".

        "selftext": "Today,   Relief Therapeutics, in partnership with NeuroRx, announced the 60 day   results of their recent 196 patient phase 3 study for Zyesami  (synthetic  vasointestinal peptide). The results blew out of the water  any existing  therapies. They were the COVID treatment studied to  demonstrate  advantages in BOTH survival AND recovery from critical  COVID-19 in a  randomized, double-blind multicenter trial. The most  recent PR is  available to read here:\n\n[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/neurorx-announces-zyesami-aviptadil-rlf-100-met-the-primary-endpoint-of-its-phase-2b3-clinical-trial-and-also-demonstrated-a-meaningful-benefit-in-survival-from-critical-covid-19-301257291.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/neurorx-announces-zyesami-aviptadil-rlf-100-met-the-primary-endpoint-of-its-phase-2b3-clinical-trial-and-also-demonstrated-a-meaningful-benefit-in-survival-from-critical-covid-19-301257291.html)\n\n    So What is VIP/Zyesami?  \n\nVIP is a peptide which   is naturally produced by the body. It is mostly produced in the GI tract   with neuronal, epithelial, and endocrine cell functions in the lungs,   brain and bowel.\n\nLike insulin   (also a peptide), it is a small but mighty molecule. It has five   separate mechanisms of action that set it apart from any other existing   COVID therapy. Thee are:\n\n1. It directly inhibits viral replication\n2. It has broad anti-inflammatory effects with decrease in II 6, cytokines and TNF\n3. It causes surfactant production\n4. It has direct bronchodilator effects to improve pulmonary blood-flow and increase the V/Q ratio (level of oxygenation)\n5. It inhibits apoptosis (cell death)\n\n&amp;#8203;\n\n    What were the Phase 3 Trial Results?  \n\nWell, for one, they were   extraordinary. First, consider the population. This was a study that   included 196 critically ill COVID positive patients on noninvasive   positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), high flow nasal cannula (HIFNC)   and mechanical ventilation.\n\nThe trial met its primary endpoint of improvement from respiratory failure.\n\nFurthermore,   per the NeuroRx CEO on a conference call regarding the phase 3 trial   results, the trial met ALL of its secondary endpoints. Please see a copy   of a the RLFTF/NRX/BRPA Conference call transcript here: XX\n\nSecondary end points included:\n\n1. Improvement on NIAID Scale\n2. Survival through day 28 and day 60\n3. Time to ICU discharge\n4. Time on ventilation (Time on mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, or high-flow nasal oxygen)\n5. Time to extubation\n6. Time to discharge alive\n7. Multi-organ failure free days\n\n&amp;#8203;\n\n    So what did the 3/29/21 Conference call regarding Zyesami Results actually talk about?  \n\nWell, for one, the CEO   of NeuroRx indicated: \"We certainly plan to meet with the FDA as soon as   possible. In general meetings and regulatory correspondence with the   FDA, our private correspondence, and as soon as we have met, have gotten   guidance, determinations have been made, you should see expect to hear   about that\"\n\nFurthermore, the CEO   noted\\*:\\* \"At the same time, we now have the key efficacy data in hand,   combined with a strong safety record that we must have in order to   approach the FDA in order to request Emergency Use Authorization. We are   starting that process this week. As you recall the FDA advised us in   December that they were highly interested in this trial and that they   would review randomized prospective data promptly, which is a word that   does not appear routinely in regulatory correspondence. I made a  comment  online about wearing a bow tie that was made for me by a  patient's  relative when we meet with the FDA about our drug. That  remarks seems to  have started a rumor that we are meeting imminently  with the FDA, a  rumor that is not true. However, we are confident that  such a meeting  will be scheduled in the near future\"\n\nCEO LinkedIn page commenting on that bowtie made by a patient\u2019s family member: [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jonathanjavitt\\_zyesami-covidehi19-activity-6780918203771035648-7ObK](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jonathanjavitt_zyesami-covidehi19-activity-6780918203771035648-7ObK)\n\n     Why did RLFTF/BRPA not fly to the moon on these results?  \n\nWell, 35% and 25% share   price increase are nothing to sneee at for BRPA and RLFTF respectively.   However, if you\u2019re wondering why this didn\u2019t double or triple its  value  overnight, it simply because word hasn\u2019t gotten out yet.\n\nTo   wit, at the time of this write up, major press articles are currently   being written. The small number of Reddit apes and luddites who read   these DD articles know how great this drug is\u2026but few other people do   because this drug is produced by a small Swiss biotech that no one has   ever heard of. However, make no mistake: Relief Therapeutics will soon   be on many peoples lips just like the small biotech Moderna was on   everyone\u2019s mind 1 year ago at the start of the pandemic. Good things   come in small packages. The small size of this company has allowed it to   pivot to rapidly and efficiently create on the best therapeutics on  the  market for critically ill COVID 19. Furthermore, unlike other   manufactures, VIP is cheap to produce and shelf stable prior to   reconstitution. It does not require extreme temperature for transport   and is good for a prolonged period of time upon receipt of the   medication. This makes it highly attractive to second and third world   countries which are currently struggling with the current pandemic   (ahem, India, Mexico and Brazil).\n\n    So how much will RLFTF/BRPA be worth?  \n\nWell, lets put this into economic terms and compare it across similar biotech companies.\n\nFirst, we must understand what a market cap (market capitalization) refer to.\n\nSpcifcally,   market cap refers to the total value of all a company's shares of   stock. It is calculated by multiplying the price of a stock by its total   number of outstanding shares.\n\nEx.   RLF has 3.2billion shares selling at .37cents. Therefore, at present   day on 3/29/21, RLF has a market cap of 1,184,000,000USD (1.18B). This   market cap suggests that RLF is severely undervalued compared to its   competitors because it has two separate pipeline drugs (aviptadil and   ACER-101) which are both expected to be submitted for NDA within the   next 6 months.\n\nTo put this in   perspective, a recognizable competitor is CytoDyn. CYDY has a drug which   has recently failed all primary and secondary endopoints for COVID 19   critical respiratoyr failure. That drug, leronlimab, was a consummate   failure and is at the center of a large lawsuit at present regarding   malfeiscence on the part of the CEO ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cydy-alert-klein-law-firm-204300464.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cydy-alert-klein-law-firm-204300464.html)).\n\nCYDY   has 598million shares selling at $2.13 as of 3/29/21. Therefore, at   present day, CYDY has a market cap of 1.27billion with no viable data to   warrant consideration from EUA from its recent phase 3 trial.   Furthermore, the company lacks any additional drugs in its pipeline upon   which to derive revenue.\n\nNow,   imagine if you will: RLFTF has amazing Phase 3 results for their drug   Zyesami (aviptadil/VIP). The drug has been proven safe &amp; effective.   Given these results, two major catalysts are expected near term:\n\nEUA will be granted by the FDA allowing Zyesami to be ordered by any doctor in America for critically ill COVID 19 patients\n\nOperation Warp Speed stock piling is anticipated with the Department of Defense.\n\n    So what is an EUA worth?  \n\nWell, currently,   Remdesavir and dexamethasone are the only FDA approved therapeutic for   critically ill COVID patients. Remdesavir is charged at 3k per   treatment. Relief has noted in their January Biotech Showcase that   Zyesami is likely to be priced equivalently to Remdesavir.\n\nIe. The CDC indicates how many COVID patients are hospitalized on any given day here: [https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/covidnet/COVID19\\_5.html](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/covidnet/COVID19_5.html)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nUS Based CDC Hospitalizations\n\nCDC Chart of 3/20/21 COVID Hospitalizations Nationwide in the USA\n\nOn   3/20/21, in the US alone, 1546 patients over the age of 18 were   hospitalized in the US with COVID 19. Hospitalizations are acknowledged   to be rising.\n\nSo: 1546 patients x365 days = 564,290 patients in the US Hospitalized with COVID in 2021 at present rate of viral penetration.\n\n564,290 patients x $3000 per treatment = 1.69Billion dollars worth of treatments.\n\nSoooooo\u2026.more than double RLF\u2019s existing market cap.\n\nTHEN,   take into account that the BRPA/NRX S1 filed on 1/27/21 indicated that   NeuroRx has already been negotiating with the DOD for OWS stockpiling   with an agreement for 30k doses initially and 150k doses quarterly if   Phase 3 results are good. ([https://fintel.io/doc/sec-big-rock-partners-acquisition-corp-s4-2021-january-27-18654-7](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-big-rock-partners-acquisition-corp-s4-2021-january-27-18654-7))\n\n30,000   doses at $3000.00 =90million up front AND 150000 doses quarterly (x4) =   1.8Billlion (divided in half between BRPA and RLFTF per their profit   sharing agreement)\n\nSo, add this onto RLF\u2019s market cap as well.\n\nErgo: market cap becomes: 1.18B (present day) + (.845B on EUA) + .9B on OWS = 2.925Billion\n\nIn   other words, RLF becomes a 2.925 Billion dollar company with an   estimated share price of $0.91/share (2,925,000,000/3,200,000,000). This   represents a 246% upside from today\u2019s present share price just on US   sales alone.\n\nThe agreed upon Profit split between BRPA/NeuroRx is: US, CANADA &amp; ISRAEL = 50/50; EUROPE = 85/15; ROW = 80/20\n\nIf   you factor in estimates sales and stockpiling for European and Rest of   World Sales, RLFTF is rapidly approaching a $1.20-1.50 per share   price....representing a potential for 3-4x upside from current share   price!\n\nSee the Valuation Lab Financial report on RLFTF's LinkedIn Page for estimated RLF/BRPA Earnings for detailed financial breakdowns  (page 33 and page 36)\n\n    So what other catalysts does RLF/BRPA have upcoming?  \n\nGood question. Well, the   following catalysts are going to offer potentially, and massively,   greater upside to the current share price:\n\n1 .EUA\n\n2. RLF \u201cnear term uplisting to NASDAQ\n\n3.   Announcement of Amiersource Bergen, Cardinal Health and Mckesson as   distribution partners for Zyesami overnight availability to hospitals   nationwide\n\n4 .BRPA/NeuroRx completion of merger onto NASDAQ\n\n5. Inhaler trial results for nebulized/inhaled Zyesami for Mild/Moderate COVID patients\n\n6. Possible second EUA for Zyesami Inhaler\n\n7.   RCT trials and results for other indications (smoke inhalation,   sarcoidosis, ARDS, interstitial lung disease with check point inhibitor   induced pneumonitis)\n\n8. Government stockpiling\n\n9.

        "selftext": "Short term the market is unpredictable, and very long term also becomes increasingly difficult to prevede what will happen, because of the cumulative effect of future new events.\n\nSo what do you think are the best bets today, considering both potential upside and risk, if you hope to see a profit or simply are willing to completely change your portfolio composition within a couple years?\n\nI\u2019m long on the aerospace industry, with Boeing, Lockheed, Airbus and Rolls Royce. They have been beaten up because of the pandemic but I assume they will recover nicely within the time. They can be volatile though.\n\nLong Visa and MasterCard, as the move to cashless payments is surely a continuing trend.\nI see a couple risks here. One is disruption by other companies. Consumer facing brands with a large user base, especially Apple Amazon and Google, have already stepped in the field and could eventually try to create their own payment networks. Then there is possible government disruption, with the move to digital currency, that could affect their margins.\n\nGetting more speculative, PayPal is tempting because it had such a great run and then a pullback, but seems also a lot more risk, both comparatively overvalued and easier to replace.\n\nTravel recovery looks also like a safe bet, Delta United Hilton Marriot are some interesting names, Airbnb even, but I\u2019d be interested in finding good alternatives.\n\nE-commerce, Amazon MercadoLibre and Alibaba are at the moment in widely different situations, but on the whole I suspect they will do well in a couple years.\nMELI is a growth stock, which is toxic these days, but appears it may honestly grow. BABA is undervalued because China, but I\u2019m confident Jack Ma and the government will find a middle ground as they have largely common interests.\n\nStill the relations between China and much of the rest of the world are rapidly deteriorating, something I\u2019m very concerned about, but the greatest worry is that the effect could spill well beyond Chinese stocks.\n\nShorting a bunch of EV and Green energy names is a temptation, but handling the volatility would require a huge margin and the risk high. Meh.\n\nPSTH is a tempting speculative play, mostly because of the name of Ackman, since it\u2019s back close to the initial offering price. Even though SPACs are fast falling out of favor, this one has been widely publicized and could see a nice bump of a merger is announced.\n\nYour thought on the above and other ideas?",

Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.\n\n\\- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH?\n\n\\- Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias?\n\n\\- Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?\n\n\\- Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?\n\n\\- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing my writing.

It\u2019s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, **trustworthiness and accountability must be established**. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B\\*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you\u2019re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img shluc14va1n61...*\n\nJust take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The KYC Solution](https://preview.redd.it/2oueufhxb1n61.png?width=1457&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b3d6e4bb85aa337ed3a0f581929b4d8c2e70eed)\n\nIt is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B\\*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Black American Enterprise](https://preview.redd.it/xbdw0cnxa1n61.png?width=1006&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32e45ab15c55d54201f82e349bb86594c74cb68c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ss98jxya1n61.png?width=1082&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=500ac4256347d8810ac273321f726ad42e466696\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hxtz1n00b1n61.png?width=1772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd766d326a1d46368526d32f4701c209ca90397c\n\n# The Underbanked\n\nJack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The playbook](https://preview.redd.it/1eiwe2j1b1n61.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f81927188476f40d136d884d18be7a5cb172ef49)\n\nInterestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards.\n\nIn my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America. while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things:\n\n\\- Cash App\u2019s Twitter and advertising strategy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Urban strategy](https://preview.redd.it/c4gc0lvfb1n61.png?width=1487&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2b69447ee9c822aef198c97fcb83d7c992b886b)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Youth strategy](https://preview.redd.it/dyhd7ssgb1n61.png?width=1482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd5780a188b29e1a930b5d85cdd0272e01844a65)\n\n\\- The geographic results on Google Trends when searching \u201cCash App vs. Venmo\u201d. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Underbanking strategy](https://preview.redd.it/xruw28aib1n61.png?width=2949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58c21fefe36277359c1d37adfa86b592d009af52)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water.  That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square\u2019s youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You\u2019ve heard it before, \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?\u201d. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers:\n\n1. The ability to start a business\n2. The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks\n3. The ability to invest and educate in B\\*tcoin\n4. The ability to save on basic purchases\n5. The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Reality](https://preview.redd.it/hb2b2zljb1n61.png?width=1402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5aa1cce454480fe56d30489feeae3a52809dc559)\n\nWhat this inevitably means is that we probably won\u2019t even see Square operating at \u201cfull-force\u201d until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials.\n\n# Speculation\n\nThis is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks:\n\n1. Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank\u2019s regulatory offerings.\n2. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services.\n3. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process.\n4. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard.\n5. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify.\n6. Square will foray into equal housing.\n7. Square will improved loan systems.\n8. Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease follow for more content.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/reviews/06hGKT6YUeRY99vz4MVPPh0-7..1569477220.jpg](https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/reviews/06hGKT6YUeRY99vz4MVPPh0-7..1569477220.jpg)",

        "selftext": "Mohawk Group Holdings is a small cap (1B) AI enabled consumer product company.  If you frequent Amazon, chances are you've encountered some of their brands while shopping. Simply put, Mohawk's business model is leveraging their proprietary AI tool \"AIMEE\" to research, develop, market, and manage their 400+ SKUs . Along with making their own products, Mohawk is in the business of consolidating 3rd party sellers on Amazon through acquisitions. Based on their technology's determination of market opportunities present on Amazon, Mohawk decides on whether they can become a market leader in segments by either building the product themselves in 6-8 months (much faster than the typical product development life cycle for larger CPG companies) or acquiring a brand (typically at 2-5x EBITDA) and reducing the contribution margin for all of the brand's products with AIMEE.\n\nSome of their successful brands you can find on Amazon: Healing Solutions, Truweo, hOmelabs, Vremi, Rif6\n\nIn a recent interview, CEO Yaniv Sarig also explained that through their integration of AIMEE, they onboard these SKU's supply chains and revenue streams in their system within 24-48 hours of the deal closing (much more efficient than any other CPG like P&amp;G, Unilever, etc.).\n\nTo put a cherry on top of everything, Mohawk operates at the moment with **ONLY** 53 employees, yielding around 3.5million per employee in revenue (using 2020 net revenue). In an interview with Sarig he also explains that his vision is to allow for the technology to enable everyone at the company to become \"Super Heros\" and what 1 employee can do with AIMEE, would require 50 employees at a large CPG company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLets look at the financials:\n\nCurrently at the price of $35\\~ $MWK trades at an attractive 3.13 P/S  with a 50% CAGR since 2017. Mohawk also has improved their gross margins to 45.6% from 39.4% in their latest quarter.\n\nWhile the CAGR  of revenue is 50%, I believe the revenue growth of the company to be closer to 100%+ growth for next year due to further acquisitions and a recent announcement of potential M&amp;A targets. Direct quote from earnings:\n\n*\"We are currently evaluating a strong pipeline of potential M&amp;A targets that in total have trailing twelve month\u2019s net revenue of $522 million and trailing twelve month\u2019s EBITDA of $97 million.\"*\n\nThese deals which have letters of intent signed are **not** yet included in guidance (which was already raised this quarter) making me even more bullish. Additionally, Mohawk plans to expand to other countries as quick as possible as they have made a recent acquisition in Photo Paper Direct, their first UK based e-commerce move. I believe this expansion to other markets will be a recurring theme with Mohawk in the future.\n\n I believe that at the growth of Mohawk warrants a higher P/S ratio (closer to 6 to 8 P/S like Thrasio, a comparable company). Along with the higher P/S I believe the market is underestimating the potential revenue growth of the company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is important to understand the risks of any business so here they are and my opinions:\n\n1. Mohawk is primarily on Amazon and relies on them\n2. Expanding too quickly / Dillution\n3. Competitors\n\nFor the first point, it is not too much of a concern in my opinion as Amazon also wants their 3rd party sellers to succeed on their platform. You wouldn't want to see Amazon made products in the top search for every product you search for. CEO Yaniv Sarig also discusses this point in the interviews and does not seem too concerned about Amazon interfering with their products.\n\nOn the second risk, for any small cap, expanding too quickly can always be a problem, but I do not see this as a major problem for Mohawk since they acquire EBITDA positive brands and have such low overheads with their technology and low human capital. Along with this, I believe that the way they are acquiring companies, they are growing at a much faster pace than their potential dilution.\n\nTo the third point, Mohawk's counterpart would be Thrasio which is another innovative CPG company consolidating sellers on ecommerce platforms, valued at 3 billion. I believe that this consolidation of sellers on ecommerce platforms has room for many players and while Thrasio is a competitor, there is room in the market for both since ecommerce has such a large TAM.\n\nHere is a link to their most recent earnings:\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/08/2189029/0/en/Mohawk-Group-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Full-Year-2020-Results.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/08/2189029/0/en/Mohawk-Group-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Full-Year-2020-Results.html)\n\nRecommended interviews to watch before investing:\n\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFDAbkirUg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFDAbkirUg)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlkyqX2PBTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlkyqX2PBTY)\n\n**Disclaimer**: I have a 10% position of $MWK @$36.20 in my portfolio.

        "selftext": " You  know what fellow 'tards.... I've been thinking (it hurts, but i'm  stubborn so keep at it) - there are many out there who subscribe to and  promote the notion that at current MC of \\~ 17B $GME is grossly, and i  mean GROSSLY overvalued  ( last SP of \\~$266 X 65M Float = 17B) and the  only thing that GME has going for it is this stubborn pack of apes who  like the stock and diamond hand their shares as if those were last  bananas on Earth and therefore presenting and causing all kinds of  nuisances and troubles to otherwise sophisticated investors getting in  their way of  making big bucks as usual by doing all kinds of complex  calculations on smart machines, forecasting, prognosticating, staring  and squiggly lines all day, pontificating to ignorant masses etc. etc.  etc.\n\n\\-  well you know what\n\ni  know it's maybe a bit \"apples n oranges\" ; but let's take a quick look at DASH shall we...?\n\nNow  if DASH can take on most of delivery business in US  (including  business w no or in-house delivery services start outsourcing to DASH  and of  course they can start collecting/mining info get into  advertising etc etc ) -  then yes - i say DASH might be worth 46B maybe  even much more (btw - DASH currently is doing less in Sales and looses  as much as GME)\n\nMarket  is forward  looking so considering GME and it's potential in - gaming;  e-sports;  betting; e-sports tournaments/events and the fact that the  brand name  is getting a positive FREE SYMPATHETIC PUBLICITY around the  world  especially among GME core users and considering demographic -  who's  then to say that GME is not actually worth the current SP of \\~$300  and  why should it be valued 3 times LESS than DASH???!!!\n\nAlso I ran a quick \"back of the envelope\" screener (all data are from [Finviz.com](https://finviz.com/) link below // );\n\nI  only specified few fundamental and technical parameters to try to see  what I come up with - take a look-see; snoop around a bit; click away on  some of the familiar names... and some of those business are app's (of  course i'm over-simplifying!!! don't get on my case - I'm VENTING!!!)\n\nThere  are currently more than 20 Co's (some of which might be hailed as  disruptions, innovators and all around trailblazers) who's MC is larger  than GME's - in some cases considerably larger; most if not ALL (i have  not checked one by one) are loosing some big bucks - in the billions;  some have triple digits F/PE; ROI/ROA/ROE in deep double digit red - but  hey you don't see a band of apes getting assigned the responsibility of  unreasonably and blatantly \"manipulating\" and  inflating the SP and  keeping the MC where it's at..... (btw reason DASH didn't make the list  is coz they currently don't have ROI/ROA listed)\n\nSo in conclusion: **TLDR**\n\nGME SP is currently in \"no-man's\" land and \"Who's to say GME is over-valued....??!!\" - (fundamentally, of course, we all understand it is currently, but again, markets are forward looking, GME has A LOT going for it now and is taking active and tangible steps to adopts and fine tune it's business model and is no more \"over-valued\" than some of the market \"darlings\" currently trading at considerable premium)\n\nTo  the moons!!! (yeah you got that right - MOONS - plural - i am maybe a  retard ape but i know MARS has two moons, M  A  R  S - Mars biches...  and don't get me started w Jupiter and Saturn - take that suits...!!!!)\n\n(100 rocket emojis)\n\n[https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&amp;f=cap\\_largeover,fa\\_div\\_none,fa\\_roe\\_veryneg,fa\\_roi\\_veryneg&amp;ft=2&amp;o=marketcap](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&amp;f=cap_largeover,fa_div_none,fa_roe_veryneg,fa_roi_veryneg&amp;ft=2&amp;o=marketcap)",

        "selftext": "**TICKER**: $ARBKF (US) $ARB (UK)\n\n**Introduction**\n\nFirstly, I would just like to point out that I have tried to be as unbiased as possible in this analysis, and I hope this comes across.\n\nThe following is an attempt to value Argo blockchain as a business now that we know the 200MW facility is definitely going ahead. The valuation is compared to the 2 other large bitcoin miners that are listed on Nasdaq exchange - Marathon Digital Holdings $MARA &amp; Riot Blockchain $RIOT.\n\nA price-to-sales valuation model has been used due to its simplicity. It is my personal belief that a like for like price to sales valuation comparison of bitcoin mining companies to the Nasdaq average gives a fairly conservative estimate of the value of bitcoin mining businesses due to their relatively high margins. For example, Argo blockchain achieved a margin of 81% in February. Nonetheless, a valuation again the Nasdaq average over the past 5 years will be the primary multiple used here (3.6x).\n\nThe downside of this valuation model is that it doesn\u2019t take into account each companies current holdings or hodling rates. \n\nAn increase in difficulty of bitcoin mining has also been applied to future revenue predictions. A 30% increase has been used. The details of the estimate is given below.\n\nFinally, a comparison of the 3 companies in question is given below using an estimate of the increase mining revenue of Argo blockchain (assuming full capacity of the 200MW facility) and the data that Riot blockchain and Marathon Digital holdings provide on their website.\n\nFinally this is piece of work is my own personal research that I thought I would share. I am not a financial advisor, this is just for education.\n\n**TLDR \u2013 Argo shareprice increase of between 300% (low estimate) and 2000% (high estimate) is estimated at current bitcoin prices if they can fully utilise the new Texas facility within the next 12 months.**\n\n**Difficulty Increase Calculation**\n\nUsing data from Feb 2018 to Feb 21, an estimate is made for Feb 22. Average increase over the past 4 years is 6 points. This equates to a \\~30% increase from Feb 21 to Feb 22.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uc2f72qtg6m61.png?width=562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2bf52b1f3a3173d602bb9b9c23d03920f48c38f\n\n  \n\n**Argo End Q1 2022 Monthly Revenue Calculation \u2013 Texas 200MW Facility Estimation**\n\nArgo blockchain have stated that it is their wish to get the facility running within the next 12 months, thus end of Q1 2022 is the estimated timeline.\n\nThis estimation is calculated from the increase in PH/s capacity that the new 200MW facility may bring. The assumption is that the current 35MW capacity equates to 1685 PH/s, then approx. 9600 PH/s of additional computing power is possible. \n\nA low estimate of this is given which equates to a 20% lower hashrate assumption and conversely a higher outcome is also given (+20%).\n\nThe amount of Bitcoins produced with this range of hashrates, can be seen below. The revenue is given for a range of different bitcoin values.\n\nAn online calculator has been used to calculate the revenue. The source is at the bottom. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x14dfljug6m61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0354a46adaa69bbb1e0f4e7050d94e08bddad39a\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4mk59ajvg6m61.png?width=573&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a22949ea1ad7ae5cfee9080803f437c41ce3c5e\n\n**Riot &amp; Mara End 2021 Monthly Revenue Calculations**\n\nThe same methodology has been used to calculate the estimated monthly revenues at the end of 2021 for Riot and Mara.\n\nThe difference here though is that Riot and Mara have both published their own estimations for Hash rate capacity. They are given below.\n\nNote: Mara data is based on their stated mining capacity for end of March 2021 as this is the most recent update for the company. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lvlpyk4wg6m61.png?width=565&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbc20e77a25d7c5ccb056312551a944f6fe3e784\n\n  \n\nIt is assumed that the Riot and Mara will have the same output in Q1 2022 as they had at end 2021. This is assumed as neither companies have given any details about any increases in output beyond 2021.\n\nThe end 2021 monthly revenues for Riot and Mara can be compared to Argo end Q1 2022 using the +30% difficulty assumption with a range of BTC prices (using Argo mid capacity estimates). Revenues in $Millions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sgyx9xlwg6m61.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0520f07bcfb34dc91b0b9a0a1769103f16d41bcd\n\n  \n\n**Comparison to current valuations (Price-to-sales valuation)**\n\nThe Price-to-sales (P/S) ratios for each company using the current known mining capacity is shown below. \n\nNote: As above, Mara is end of March 2021 data.\n\nAs can be seen below, the current P/S ratio of Riot is 29.7 and Mara is 21.71. Argo is currently 14.16.\n\nThe mean of these 3 is 21.9. This will be used as an estimation for future value along with the Nasdaq average.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z3cbb3bxg6m61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97b0dc18e18135e624d92101ffbaf607fddc6bb0\n\n  \n\n**End 2021 / Q1 2022 Price-to-Sales Valuations**\n\nFinally, using all of the data outlined above, a price to sales valuation can be given for each company. Also as stated above, the average Nasdaq P/S ratio over the past 5 years of 3.6x will be the focus here.\n\nA high ratio of 6x is also used, as well as the current average P/S ratio of Argo, Mara and Riot (22x). Some examples of other companies using end 2021 estimated data can be seen below as a reference. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ztj0tz2yg6m61.png?width=553&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df28eff28251e2f8595d7ba2c8dbe6666b0effd6\n\n  Note: data above is \\~4 weeks out of date.\n\nNasdaq price to sales valuations can be seen here: [https://ycharts.com/companies/NDAQ/ps\\_ratio](https://ycharts.com/companies/NDAQ/ps_ratio)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/73ytfrjyg6m61.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3acf82ea1fbd037f3e28177081df5f6768da59cc\n\n  \n\n**Summary**\n\nUsing the current P/S ratio, both Mara and Argo could achieve significant upside to their share prices. However, it is possible that the future mining capacity is somewhat price in for Mara. Using a 6x P/S ratio still provides significant upside to Mara over the next 12 months.\n\nRiot blockchain shows to be fairly overvalued currently based on all ratios.\n\nUsing a 22x valuation at current Bitcoin prices, Argo has potentially 20x upside to its share price if the new texas facility can be fully utilised. However, using a conservative 6x estimate, a 5x upside is still present. A 3x upside is still present using a very conservative 3.6x valuation.\n\nIf bitcoin continues on its upward trajectory, then clearly all valuations will lift significantly.\n\n**TLDR \u2013 Argo shareprice increase of between 300% (low estimate) and 2000% (high estimate) is estimated at current bitcoin prices if they can fully utilise the new Texas facility within the next 12 months.**\n\n  \n\n**Sources** \n\n**Bitcoin calculator**\n\n*https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/calculator?h=3800&amp;p=3250.00&amp;pc=0.05&amp;pf=0.00&amp;d=21434395961349.00000000&amp;r=6.25000000&amp;er=1&amp;btcer=52759.32800000&amp;ha=PH&amp;hc=2407.00&amp;hs=-1&amp;hq=1*\n\n**Network Difficulty**\n\n*https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty*\n\n**Riot**\n\n[*https://www.riotblockchain.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/99/riot-blockchain-achieves-milestone-of-1-ehs-in-hash-rate*](https://www.riotblockchain.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/99/riot-blockchain-achieves-milestone-of-1-ehs-in-hash-rate)\n\n***Mara***\n\n*Feb 01 press release \u2013*\n\n[*https://ir.marathonpg.com/press-releases/detail/1226/bitmain-ships-4000-antminer-s-19-pro-asic-miners-to*](https://ir.marathonpg.com/press-releases/detail/1226/bitmain-ships-4000-antminer-s-19-pro-asic-miners-to)\n\n*End Jan Bitcoin purchase-*\n\n[*https://www.marathonpg.com/news/press-releases/detail/1224/marathon-invests-150-million-in-bitcoin*](https://www.marathonpg.com/news/press-releases/detail/1224/marathon-invests-150-million-in-bitcoin)\n\n*End March 2021 mining capacity*\n\n*https://ir.marathondh.com/press-releases/detail/1228/marathons-bitcoin-mining-fleet-to-produce-approximately*\n\n***Argo***\n\n*January Operational Update \u2013* \n\n[*https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/argo\\_blockchain/news/rns/story/ry4z38r/export*](https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/argo_blockchain/news/rns/story/ry4z38r/export)\n\n*Q2 Est.

Castor estimates to generate approximately $2.8 million of gross incremental revenues for the minimum scheduled period of the charter and approximately $4.2 million should employment extend to its maximum period, in each case assuming no off-hire days.\"\n\nNot a significant catalyst because I believe this was priced in when the vessel acquisition was first announced but it's still some good PR. \n\nAnother potential catalyst is Castor's NASDAQ compliance status. The stock held over a dollar for 10 consecutive days so it should be hopefully receive a compliance letter soon and should also be safe from delisting. \n\nEarnings are also expected to drop soon (today according to my search).",

        "selftext": "Here is a quick trading idea for those of you messing with options like a power ball lottery machine. \n\nIt was just before the peak of the meme explosion on Jan 25, as I was texting this screenshot over to my friend, *\"Hey how do you like this trade for $100? Max Profit of $600, I am planning to get 5 of these.\"* \n\n[AMC 2.00 \\/ 10.00 Debit spread, as on Jan 25, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/lh04jkx9ajn61.png?width=1503&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da936662039853a5d6b98e60956e72b6e022fe57)\n\nTwo days later AMC would shoot up to 20.00 and beyond on an epic trading day of 1.3B volume, and Robinhood would become RobbingHood soon after. I was following AMC for over 6 months. This company is on the verge of bankruptcy, and any sign or progress against that would make the shares easily 2x or 3x from there. The CEO Adam Aron had just secured a [major funding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQq0y9NMM98) earlier that week, which would put to bed any imminent talks about bankruptcy for the rest of the year.\n\nThe stock was trading at $4.60, but the IV was already so high, a 2.00 / 10.00 spread costed just $1.00. Of course buying just the 10.00 call would have been way more profitable as it turned out, but look at this risk reward. \n\n**Even if AMC stayed FLAT for 2 months at $4.60 per share, the spread will be worth $1.60 and you are still walking out with a 60% winner.**\n\nRight now this trade is near Max Profit, as AMC is trading at a price above the 10.00 mark. \n\n[AMC 3.00 \\/ 10.00 Debit Spread, as on Mar 16, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/ykxwqqy6cjn61.png?width=754&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=829ec7f17929172d15ccf09f7f2fab6ddad6634b)\n\nWhile all of this is very easy to say on hindsight, I had already closed my trade for 70% of Max profit because the meme explosion pulled AMC along with it and I was uncertain where the stock was heading. \n\n* I know many of you buy AMC 20.00 calls, 30.00 calls, 40.00 calls, but how often do these go ITM? \n* The options chain is like a book. If you see the numbers, you see clues all over it. \n* The greeks and options strategies are your friend. Start embracing them. Turn the weakness into your strength.\n* Betting on AMC to hit 40.00 has a 1% chance of success, where as a spread like this will win over 75-80% of the time. \n* Even if the stock DID NOTHING, this trade is a 70% WINNER.\n\nThis sub is not meant for gambling with OTM options, but turned into one, and I had appreciate more sensible, highly profitable strategies discussed here. The sidebar rules say nothing else. \n\nMy own portfolio is a proof that it works. Started in 2017, lost over 70% of my account gambling. Took a break. Started again. Trade way less often than before, only entering when seeing highly profitable opportunities, but managed to breakeven and went beyond.\n\n[2017 - 2021 My Robinhood Portfolio. 100&amp;#37; Options. ](https://preview.redd.it/55nmdk8afjn61.png?width=1778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ab022caad9a6a7631c13eec0221fd4c2d09e193)\n\nTL;DR Please stop gambling and find real trades that make sense, put the ODDS on your side!",

Smart money isnt dumb enough to buy inflation is only at 2.9% and it is showing in equities and real estate. Many analysts/fund managers have came out and said they expect repo rates to spike as high as 3% by the end of the year.\n\n\nOn tope of this even though its not rate hikes, they just fucking rekt any corporations paying execs over 1M and made sure to put into the stimmy 60B worth of tax hikes removing deductions for large corporations and the CNBC/Bloomberg channels havent said a fucking word even though this is kind of significant.\n\n[Tax hikes snuck into stimulus bill](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/10/covid-relief-bill-tax-hikes-475051)\n\n&gt;On March 13, 2000, news that Japan had once again entered a recession triggered a global sell off that disproportionately affected technology stocks.\n\n[China seems to have censored the term 'stock market' from social media searches after stocks posted their longest losing streak in 3 months](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/china-banned-the-term-stock-market-from-weibo-social-media-2021-3-1030168063) \n\nOddly similar circumstances developing...

        "selftext": "Disclosure: I own a speculative position (&lt;2% of my portfolio) in Astra ($HOL) \n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice. Do your own due diligence before making investment decisions.\n\nAstra is a small satellite launch provider with the mission of offering frequent rocket launches into space. While companies such as Space X and Blue Origin aim to transport people and large amounts of goods, Astra\u2019s goal is to build smaller rockets that can be launched from anywhere. \n\nAstra has two core services: \n\n1. They want to provide orbital deliveries to sun-synchronous and low inclination destinations \n2. They want to provide dedicated launch services of 50kg - 100kg payloads starting in 2021 and 2022.\n\nAstra has one of the fastest iteration timelines out of any space company. The company was started in 2016 and was already testing its first Rocket 1.0 by 2017 and had competed in the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) challenge by 2020.\n\nIn September of 2020, the company made its first orbital launch attempt and demonstrated launch capability by December of that year. \n\n \n\n[Source: Astra Investor Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/e439acaomqk61.png?width=1070&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27e2f81d3f1b08cd77d0bac059939bd83bd8762c)\n\nIn addition to having a fast timeline, Astra has one of the best management teams out of any space company. Astra also falls in the category of founder-led companies, which is always a nice signal for investors.\n\nTheir CEO and co-founder Chris Kemp was the former Chief Technology Officer of NASA and previously co-founded OpenStack. The other co-founder and currently Astra\u2019s CTO Adam London previously led major rocket initiatives at DARPA and NASA and has 4 years of management consulting experience at McKinsey&amp;Company. \n\nTheir Chief Engineer Chris Thompson and VP of Manufacturing Bryson Gentile are both ex-Space X employees and their CFO Kelyn Brannon was the former Chief Accounting Officer and VP of Finance for Amazon. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: Astra Investor Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/z7526o5tmqk61.png?width=987&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f79edb107f9154b0a77b030385bd0871b5619fc3)\n\nAstra\u2019s production goals for the next few years are to build out its rocket factory by the end of 2021 and scale up its factory operations through 2022 and 2023. They have ambitious goals of facilitating monthly launches by 2022.  \n\nIn the latter half of 2023, Astra wants to begin providing spaceport services to help anyone launch rockets into space. Additionally, they also plan on building out their modular spacecraft platform in 2023, which they claim will substantially increase their revenue growth. \n\nIn terms of financials, Astra is still a no-revenue company that has plans on ramping up its productions in the next 5 years. They claim that they can grow revenues from $4 million in 2021 to $67 million in 2022, suggesting a 1700% growth over just one year. \n\nBy the year 2025, Astra is projecting roughly $1.5 billion in revenue with a 70% gross margin and 46% EBITDA margin. Their cash flows are also projected to increase significantly over the period as they reduce their CAPEX requirements each year. \n\nGiven the enterprise value of $2.1 billion, Astra is currently being valued at 3.1x their 2025 EBITDA projection and 1.41x their 2025 revenue projection. The merger with Holicity will provide the company with $489 million in cash, which will help with the production of their Rocket 3.2 and Rocket 3.3 launch\n\n**Overall Conclusion/TLDR:** Astra is still a speculative company with not a lot of track record and revenue. However, their management team is top-notch and if their product timeline comes to fruition, they could easily become one of the most impactful space companies 5-10 years down the line. Their biggest competitor Rocket Labs is ahead of them in terms of reaching orbit. However, Astra has shown that they can iterate on their products very quickly, and they are aggressively ramping up. The team has extremely ambitious goals, which is always a good sign to look for in a company. If it is between owning Astra v Rocket labs, Astra presents more risk, but a much higher upside as well.",

        "selftext": "Each week I'll address a FAQ or common misconception that I see posted by new traders dozens of times a day. Everyone is also welcome to find these answers in our [FAQ wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/index).\n\nPrevious posts in this series:\n\n[Your break-even isn't as important as you think it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/m0m7at/monday_school_your_breakeven_isnt_as_important_as/)\n\n**TL;DR**\n======\n\n* While it is possible to exercise an (American style) option early, the vast majority of options are never exercised and nearly all of those that are, are done on or very near expiration.\n\n* Exercise throws away any gains you have made on the option itself.\n\n* Exercise by exception is not guaranteed.\n\n* You may be able to file a Do Not Exercise (DNE) request to prevent an exercise by exception.\n\n* For most strategies, expiration is something to be avoided, because expiration exposes you to additional risks and costs.\n\n* If the only way to get max profit is to hold through expiration, that also exposes you to max risk.\n\n* Holding time is not the same as days to expiration.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is exercise and what is expiration?\n=====================\n\nI've combined both concepts into one post because in practice, each depends on the other. Exercise almost always happens near expiration, and, if you don't plan to exercise, you should avoid expiration.\n\nExercise is the right that you purchase when you buy to open a put or a call. It is the activation of the obligations of the contract. For a call, that means you receive shares in exchange for paying the strike price. For a put, that means you receive cash in exchange for selling shares at the strike price. You usually have to call your broker on the phone to exercise an option, though a few apps have a button that you can push.\n\nYou can find a fully detailed explainer about exercise [at Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exercise.asp).\n\nExpiration is the last day that a contract is valid. The actual expiration time is typically 11:59pm of the day of expiration. After expiration, a contract is worthless and inactive. Expired options are removed from your positions. Expiration dates for options are usually monthly, on the third Friday of the month. A few options only have quarterly expirations. Other options have weekly expirations, which means they expire every Friday of the month, not that they are issued just 5 days before expiration -- in fact they are usually issued 6 weeks before their expiration date. SPY has expirations on other days in addition to Friday.\n\nYou can find a basic explainer on the expiration date [at Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expirationdate.asp)\n\nNow that you know what they are, forget about them\n=====================\n\nNot literally, but since you can go a whole trading year without ever exercising or ever holding near expiration, they should not be in the forefront of your trading mind. If a disaster strikes and you are backed into a corner with no other choice, you might have to understand what exercise and expiration will do to your position. Similar to how you might have to understand how to make a [solar still out of a garbage bag and a tin can](https://www.instructables.com/Make-a-solar-still-to-survive/) as survival training. It's useful information, but not something you are going to need every day.\n\nThe Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) estimates that:\n\n* ~10% of all option contracts are exercised\n\n* ~60% of all option contracts are closed out prior to expiration\n\n* ~30% of all option contracts expire worthless (out-of-the-money with no intrinsic value)\n\nSource: https://www.investopedia.com/trading/beginners-guide-to-call-buying/\n\nReasons why you should not exercise early\n=====================\n\nContracts have value in and of themselves. They are not just a means to buy or sell shares of an underlying. This should be obvious from the fact that to acquire a contract, you have to bid for one in an auction on the open market. If all contracts had the same or mechanically calculated values, there would be no need for an auction or a market exchange.\n\nSo if you buy a call for $2.00, the value of that contract may go up or down. **If it goes up, you have a gain on the contract's value alone and could sell-to-close it to pocket that gain.** This means that without reference to exercise, you can trade options purely for the gain or loss in value that the contract itself experiences. If the $2.00 contract you bought a week ago is now worth $2.40, you made a 20% profit on your investment.\n\n**However, if you decide to exercise early, you lose any gains on the contract.** In the $2.00 call example, you would lose the $0.40 gain. What the contract is currently worth is irrelevant to calculating your gain/loss on an exercise. You only need the *original* cost of the call and the strike price (plus any transaction fees) to calculate the cost basis of the shares received when exercising a call. That $0.40 gain goes POOF.\n\nSometimes it works out that the gain on the call is equal to the gain you would make by exercising, so it's a wash, although keep in mind that the gain on exercise is *theoretical*. Until you realize a gain/loss by closing out the share position, which may be a day or three after you exercise, you don't really know that it's a wash. And this is ignoring an excess fees charged for exercise over doing a sell-to-close (see below).\n\n**In any case, selling-to-close the call is almost always more profitable than early exercise.**\n\nIf you like watching options tutorial videos, here is one we recommend on [Why Options Are Rarely Exercised - Chris Butler - Project Option (18 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsZsqiBFnmo).\n\nThe risks of expiration\n========================\n\nThere are too many risks to detail in this EL15 post, but I will highlight the ones that I see the most often discussed (tbh, cried out) in this sub.\n\nFirst, a quick explanation about [exercise by exception](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/automaticexercise.asp). Under certain circumstances, like a call expiring [In The Money (ITM)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneyness.asp), the OCC requires that brokers automatically exercise the contract on behalf of the contract owner. This is called an \"exercise by exception\" because an exception is being made to the requirement that exercise only happens when the owner explicitly requests it. A contract only need to be ITM by one penny, $0.01, to be exercised by exception.\n\nYou may be able to file a Do Not Exercise (DNE) request with your broker if you don't want your contract to be exercised without your explicit permission. This would cover exercise by exception (which you should generally want, rather than file a DNE) or other circumstances, such as early assignment of the short leg of spread, where you do not want an exercise of the long leg to happen, for whatever reason. You usually have to call in to your broker to request a DNE.\n\nNow to the risks:\n\n* Failure to exercise by exception risk. This risk takes many forms, from Robinhood prematurely closing the position before expiration, to after-hours trading pushing the price of the underlying down to [Out of The Money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneyness.asp). The options market closes before the cutoff for making exercise decisions, so there is a window of time where your option can go from ITM to OTM, as happened with [Tesla in September of 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ipgo2w/tsla_spread_horror_story_professional_advice/). The takeaway is that exercise by exception **is not guaranteed**. You are taking a risk by relying on it happening automatically.\n\n* Settlement delay risk. The price of the underlying may be favorable on expiration day, but by the time you get control of the shares after settlement, the price may no longer be favorable. Ownership is not instantaneous with exercise. You usually have to wait until the next trading day, and if that's a Monday after a Friday exercise, that's two full calendar days and three nights that overseas markets and futures trading could influence the price of your underlying.\n\n* [Gamma risk](https://www.projectoption.com/option-gamma-explained/). The closer a contract is to expiration and the money, the larger gamma will be. This means that small moves in the underlying price can have major impacts on the value of your contract. That impact can be for you or against you. Gamma is a major source of contract value volatility near expiration. You can see the value of a call swing wildly from very profitable to a big loss in a matter of minutes. \"So I should just exercise it then to avoid gamma risk?\" I hear you ask. Please read the rest of this post before you make that assumption.\n\n* [Deteriorating risk/reward values](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hg8ce9/risk_to_reward_ratio_changes_over_the_life_of_an/). This risk is actually about holding time rather than expiration, but since expiration defines the maximum holding time possible for any one contract, it's basically the worst case scenario for this risk. The longer you hold, the longer you put both your original capital *and any gains on that capital* at risk. For example, say your \"max profit\" on a spread is $100 and expiration is 20 days away. If you make $99 on the spread after 5 days, why spend another 15 days putting all that money at risk of loss for just $1 more of gain? It's crazy to do so.\n\n* Excessive exercise fees. Assuming the reason you held to expiration was to exercise, some brokers, particularly outside the US, charge excessive transaction fees for an exercise. As one example, in Canada, [Questrade charges $24.95 to exercise a call or put](https://www.questrade.com/pricing/self-directed-commissions-plans-fees/transaction). Arguably, this is more a risk about exercise than expiration, but as noted in the intro, they are tightly linked.\n\n**A note about holding time**: I see a common misconception in our sub that if a position is recommended to be opened with 30 to 45 days to expiration (DTE), that means **you must hold it for 30 to 45 days**. If you read the above, you already know that expiration should be avoided, so it stands to reason that you should **not hold to expiration**. As an example, I routinely open 45 DTE credit trades and end up closing or rolling them after holding only 12 days, on average. Some are closed after only 1 day.",

        "selftext": "Good Sunday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 15th, 2021.\n\n# **The Fed could be a catalyst for bonds, and that could drive growth stocks in week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/the-fed-could-be-a-catalyst-for-bonds-and-that-could-drive-growth-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Bonds could be volatile in the week ahead. If yields go higher, that could make it difficult for big tech and other growth stocks to gain traction.\n*****\n&gt; Rising bond yields have been challenging growth stocks. Names like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon have been lagging as investors move to cyclical groups that do well in an economic recovery. Even so, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow both closed at record highs Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite was lower.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq, home to big tech, did gain 3% in the past week, but it is down 5.5% over the last month.\n*****\n&gt; The bond market in the coming week will likely take its cues from the Federal Reserve, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank is expected to give a nod to much better growth. Bond pros are also watching to see whether Fed officials will tweak their interest rate outlook, which now does not include any rate hikes through 2023.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; \u201cThe markets have way too high expectations around what the Fed is going to do or say,\u201d said Gregory Peters, head of multi-sector and strategy at PGIM Fixed Income. \u201cI think the message is going to be consistent.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to sound dovish and is unlikely to give any time frames on when the central bank will change its bond-buying program or other policy.\n*****\n&gt; Bond yields, which move opposite price, have been rising on an improving outlook for the economy.\n*****\n&gt; That trade also showed up in the stock market, with the Dow up 4% for the week to end Friday at a record 32,778. Consumer discretionary stocks, which include retail, were among the best performers, up 5.7%, boosted by optimism that individuals will spend their $1,400 stimulus checks.\n*****\n&gt; Yields were higher Friday after President Joe Biden said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine by May 1. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a high of 1.642% \u2014 its highest level in more than a year.\n*****\n&gt; It is the key rate to watch since it affects mortgages and other consumer and business loans.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe economy is going to be unbelievably strong this year \u2014 deficit spending, reopening, vaccines,\u201d said Peters of PGIM.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt looks like for next year, all the numbers are being revised higher,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this thing could have some sustainable growth, so I think there\u2019s going to be pressure on rates moving higher.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bond yields rose sharply over the past month. The rapid pace of the move has made stocks jittery as investors adjust to higher rates. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% on Feb. 12.\n*****\n&gt; # Growth vs. cyclicals\n&gt; Over the last month, energy stocks have risen nearly 20%, financial stocks are up 10.2%, and industrials are up 7%. The S&amp;P technology sector is down 5.4% over the last month, and communications services, which includes internet names was up 0.8%.\n*****\n&gt; Higher rates are a challenge for tech and other growth stocks because those shares are expensive and have high price-earnings ratios.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen rates are very low, valuations don\u2019t matter to people,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Global Advisors.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf rates are low, there\u2019s no penalty,\u201d he said. \u201cIf rates start to go up, people become much more sensitive to valuations, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen here.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com, follows short-term stock market technicals and trades many of the growth stocks. Lately, however, he\u2019s found himself sitting in many value names and cyclicals.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe names that I\u2019m in \u2014 Visa, GM, Ford, Macy\u2019s, 3M. Those have been my biggest winners this week,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been really hard to make money in Apple, Facebook and Tesla.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq has been hardest hit by the rise in interest rates. Apple was down 0.3% in the past week but down 10.6% in the past month. The S&amp;P 500 finished at a record 3,943 and was up 2.6% in the past week, but is flattish over the last month, up just 0.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cRate volatility could cause another inflection point in tech,\u201d Redler said. \u201cLast week, tech hit its reactionary low, and this [past] week it had an oversold bounce. The question is, \u2018Was that it?\u2019\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext Wednesday, Powell could be the determining factor,\u201d he said. \u201cRates made higher highs and tech is way off last Friday\u2019s lows so maybe the market is getting more comfortable.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Apple\u2019s stall out is unusual for the tech bellwether. It helped power the market\u2019s gains last year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWatch Apple because it\u2019s a little bit of everything. Apple is growth, tech, retail. If anything is doing well, it should be Apple,\u201d Redler said.\n*****\n&gt; # Bond volatility\n&gt; There is some important data in the coming week, including February\u2019s retail sales and industrial production, both on Tuesday. There is also a $24 billion 20-year Treasury note auction on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; The biggest catalyst for the bond market remains the Fed.\n*****\n&gt; The bond market has been speculating about something the Fed may not discuss after its meeting Wednesday afternoon. In one of its moves to shore up the economy during the pandemic, the Fed allowed banks to hold Treasury bonds without counting them against the bank\u2019s leverage ratio. This strategy allowed institutions to have more flexibility to use their balance sheet for activities like lending.\n*****\n&gt; The program expires March 31.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is a huge issue basically because you have so much Treasury supply coming and reinstating [the rule] basically makes it highly punitive for banks to own Treasurys,\u201d Peters of PGIM said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe markets are kind of divided on what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI think most experts believe an extension is the appropriate path. You have not heard anything from the Fed on the matter.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Peters expects the Treasury market to remain volatile.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see more volatility in a high pressure growth economy with extremely large deficits and an accommodative Fed,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see these whippy moves.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fkwT5RT.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/MuJ7SlC.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lQiMjAN.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/hvH8uj8.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/AUV1ojJ.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ojOPNgp.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OtOIN5B.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AUXbpnZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sptpE1X.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1a03fHd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hb2eNGo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/YPDtJd7.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XOhfVX4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # March Quarterly Options Expiration Week Historically Bullish: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Up 10 of Last 13\n\n&gt; Stock options, index options, index futures, and single-stock/ETF futures all expire at the same time four times each year, March, June, September and December. This event is often referred to as Quadruple Witching or as we prefer to call it in the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac (2021 page 106), Triple Witching.\n\n&gt; March\u2019s option expiration week performance is second only to December\u2019s and has a bullish bias. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have recorded weekly gains in about twice the number of weeks as declines. NASDAQ\u2019s track record since 1983 is slightly softer with 23 advances and 15 declines, but all three indices have logged gains in options expiration week in ten of the last thirteen years. However, the week after is bearish for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. S&amp;P 500 is weakest, down eight of the last nine. Last year as covid-19 began spreading globally and economies began to shut down, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 suffered their worst weekly declines during March\u2019s quarterly options expiration.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/6ef1d4cbdd86a8efa09b8c2942d48517/32ed3896b2fe9623-1a/s500x750/f4254e1e0edf858dbfd4e67344757c69c48d30b6.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/81d51a4dd39b5941b831de20b28314c7/32ed3896b2fe9623-0e/s500x750/3ef3515466260a5660a9ec6eadb8a91cd697cf96.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/92b861530dfd9673b236fb0cd7af89c0/32ed3896b2fe9623-3c/s500x750/23c07978c0f660d7070cc8e2dd6c81aa392a92b7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Signs of Life in Europe?\n\n&gt; Few equity sectors on earth have been as poor as European financials since the Global Financial Crisis. The sector still sits more than 50% below its 2007 all-time highs, hampered by regulations, low to negative interest rates, and all around slow growth in the Eurozone. However, despite those headwinds, the sector has benefitted from a recent rotation to value, and has certainly been assisted by rising interest rates, a phenomenon we discussed earlier this week.\n\n&gt; Not only is performance for European financials improving in absolute terms, as global equities continue to recover from the worst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but since early October the sector has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by more than 20 percentage points. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the pattern relative to the S&amp;P 500 appears to be on the verge of breaking out of a nearly year-long technical base, similar to where US financials stood just two months ago.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture-3.12.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; While we don\u2019t think European financials are going back to all-time highs anytime soon, remember, the sector still needs to gain 12% from current levels just to eclipse its 2020 pre-pandemic highs, a bar that certainly now seems attainable in 2021. \u201cWe remain broadly skeptical of foreign developed equities compared to their U.S. counterparts,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, financials are the largest sector within Europe and improving performance and the continued rotation to cyclical value stocks make this a development to keep an eye on.\u201d\n\n&gt; For now, we recommend sticking with US financials, which we recently upgraded in our latest Global Portfolio Strategy report, and is now the second best performing sector year to date, trailing only energy.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # NASDAQ Bounces Off Support As Dow, S&amp;P 500 &amp; Russell 2K Log Record Highs, But Beware the Ides of March\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve been tracking the NASDAQ 100 Index ($^NDX) (represented by the ETF Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ) as a proxy for the market\u2019s technical picture. It contains many of the tech stocks that have been driving the economy and market for the past year through these Covid times as well as for quite a while prior \u2013 and likely to do so for some time to come.\n\n&gt; There has definitely been some rotation out of this sector of late as DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 logged new highs today. But we would like to see confirmation with new highs in NASDAQ and NDX.\n\n&gt; The NAS and NDX are still lagging, but today\u2019s stronger rally in the techs is encouraging. In this updated technical picture you can see that as the NDX logged a 10% correction from its February 12 closing high of 13807.70 to its closing low on Monday March 8 of 12299.08 it bounced off key support just above 12200 (intraday low on Friday March 5 was 12208.39). Check last week\u2019s technical analysis post for reference to previous support levels that were broken.\n\n&gt; This 12200-level lines up with the October high which is also the high of that W-123 swing bottom pattern we mentioned last week. Back then it was key resistance that we cleared in late-November and early December. It now forms key support and lines up with the uptrend line from the September and October lows we discussed in our Almanac Investor December eNewsletter Outlook just before Thanksgiving.\n\n&gt; However, as the Ides of March are upon us, we must remind you that the end of March has a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously as noted in the 2021 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac in the March Almanac and several places on pages 30-39. The Week After Triple Witching is often prone to weakness with DJIA down 22 of last 33 and the last few days often succumb to end-of-Q1 selling pressure. If any late-March weakness materializes it should be a solid buying opportunity for top-ranked April, the last month of the Best Six Months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/264401d95b5a55c592a6f8f10df22c5e/24ec511e4e033f88-38/s500x750/fe7be5042338b6e7e7b428a0f8fd5208691e48d7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Versatile Outperformers\n\n&gt; There's still a lot of time left in the day, but the tone of the equity market has been much different today compared to Monday. Whereas Monday saw tech stocks get creamed while cyclical areas of the market rallied, today we're seeing tech stocks rebound while cyclicals lag. To illustrate, within the entire S&amp;P 500 there are just 14 stocks that have so far managed to outperform the index by at least one percentage point both yesterday and today. The table below lists each of those stocks, and looking through them, they aren't the flashy, high-profile names that you always see discussed in the media. Who said boring is a bad thing? In terms of sector representation, there's also no clear trend as eight of the eleven sectors are represented by the list of just fourteen names!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we show six-month price charts of each of the 14 names listed above from our Chart Scanner tool. Here again, no clear technical theme links the stocks together. While stocks like AES, Global Payments (GPN), McKesson (MCK), and Ross Stores (ROST) remain close to six-month highs, others like Ball (BLL), Domino's (DPZ), and Market Axess (MKTX) aren't far from six-month lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308a-768x515.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308b-768x509.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308c-768x253.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending March 12th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fg64QYPl48))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3.14.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ttI9inNJ90))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$FDX** \n&gt; * **$CRWD** \n&gt; * **$SNDL** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$GEVO** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$VFF** \n&gt; * **$HQY** \n&gt; * **$VUZI** \n&gt; * **$PDD** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$NFE** \n&gt; * **$RESN** \n&gt; * **$CRBP** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$NBEV** \n&gt; * **$DM** \n&gt; * **$WPRT** \n&gt; * **$OCGN** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$QFIN** \n&gt; * **$ACN** \n&gt; * **$AGEN** \n&gt; * **$ACRX** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$PD** \n&gt; * **$FLNT** \n&gt; * **$WSM** \n&gt; * **$AOUT** \n&gt; * **$FUTU** \n&gt; * **$CTAS** \n&gt; * **$BL** \n&gt; * **$FTEK** \n&gt; * **$ACEL** \n&gt; * **$SIC** \n&gt; * **$BEKE** \n&gt; * **$MP** \n&gt; * **$WB** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$RDHL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/1a03fHd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/QfVfqx2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/Is3mMmC.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.15.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/k2c0t0O.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/VKvrx46.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  3.16.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eoFBwOW.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ujRMr7q.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/myM4TrG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.17.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jVQLr1k.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.18.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AWKlUdJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.18.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SWuSo8l.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.19.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/VyDOWFI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.19.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # FedEx Corp. $270.20\n**FedEx Corp.

        "selftext": "My fellow SPACers,\n\nI'll get straight to it..\n\nI was doing a little DD for another play and stumbled upon the fact that Ripples new General Director and GM, Brooks Entwistle,(1) (as of 2 months ago, though he just changed it on his Linkedin, profile to 1 month ago) is a member of the board of Global Synergy Acq. Corp. as of the last 5 months. I, of course, thought this was super juicy and dug a little deeper.\n\nIt turns out that $GSAQ has 6 board members,(2) one of them is of course Mr. Brooks, but also Mr. Hank Uberoi. Mr. Uberoi was, amongst other jobs in banking or tech, the CEO of a company called Earthport. Earthport was later acquired by Visa and he since left the company but the interesting thing about this is that Earthport had a partnership with Ripple which Mr. Uberoi spoke highly of, even on twitter, (3) and though that in and of itself doesn't really mean anything, it lets me know he not only knows of ripple but has worked with them in the past and assuringly proudly so. Just to circle around that, Mr. Uberoi has a background in finance, having worked at Goldman Sachs, and even Citadel, before jumping into the fintech start up world which is what eventually led him to Ripple and the rest of his career there after. He now is a Managing Partner in HU investments, which he claims invests in private and public companies; again, all interesting. (I am just painting a picture here)\n\nThe other board members have ties but are really much more speculative so ill leave them out until I can provide something more concrete.\n\nLooking at GSAQ 13-G, you also see Citadel owns about 20% of GSAQ. why is that significant? because CME Group works with Citadel on trading and Market Making, and CME Group is an early investor in Ripple. Loose tie, but I think its important to mention.\n\nAlso, as you guys know, Ripple has expressed desires to go public in the next 12 months (they said that 15 months ago) and have signaled that the pandemic has delayed those plans. GSAQ was incorporated late 2020 and started trading Jan 2021. I think it also means nothing but fits the timeline rather interestingly.\n\nAlso worth a mention, some of Ripples individual investors, are also investors in many other innovative companies and interestingly enough, at least for most Ive seen, those companies have all gone public or will soon. (Robinhood, Coinbase, Palantir, to name a few) so I don't see why this one wouldn't. I mean, nobody is debating wether Ripple will go public, just wether they will via SPAC and if so, with GSAQ?\n\nTo summarize, here we have a company that last year said they want to go public THIS YEAR, and a SPAC which was incorporated and started trading around the time they said they would do so with board members that actually work at Ripple in high management positions and ex partners in business with financial backgrounds and an understanding of blockchain and the industry who interestingly enough have pledged to merge with a company in IT which Ripple considers itself, actually, ripple has denounced the notion that they are a \"blockchain\" company, instead opting to be called a payments and information company. They are also looking to hire IT specialist BTW and all in all, all of this still means nothing but with GSAQ warrants trading at $0.50, well, fuck it!\n\nto be clear, if you think I am a financial advisor...your an idiot..\n\n(1) [https://www.linkedin.com/in/brooks-entwistle-56330847/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brooks-entwistle-56330847/)\n\n(2) [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/12/2157413/0/en/Global-Synergy-Acquisition-Corp-Announces-Closing-of-258-750-000-Initial-Public-Offering.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/12/2157413/0/en/Global-Synergy-Acquisition-Corp-Announces-Closing-of-258-750-000-Initial-Public-Offering.html)\n\n(3) [https://twitter.com/huberoi/status/954374368854970368](https://twitter.com/huberoi/status/954374368854970368)",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, March 3rd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-3-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow futures jump after Tuesday\u2019s early gain fizzles and reverses\n\n&gt; * The Dow is set to rise 200 points Wednesday after late-day selling reversed strong gains earlier in Tuesday\u2019s session. Coming off their best days since November, the 30-stock average Tuesday fell 0.5% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.7% as tech stocks pulled back. The S&amp;P 500 slid 0.8%, a day after its biggest one-day advance since June.\n\n&gt; * The latest ADP report on private sector employment is set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before Wall Street\u2019s open. U.S. companies are expected to have added 225,000 new jobs in February compared to January of gains 174,000 positions. The ADP lately has not been the best predictor of the government\u2019s monthly jobs report, which comes out Friday.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Senate to begin debate soon on $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill\n\n&gt; * The Senate is expected to start debate as soon as Wednesday on its version of the House-passed, $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill. However, it excludes a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour. President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged Democrats to stand united and approve the measure, even as some party moderates sought to dial back parts of the package. Democrats, with the slimmest of margins in the Senate, are using special rules that would allow them to pass the bill without GOP support.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. U.S. will have enough Covid vaccines for \u2018every adult\u2019 by end of May\n\n&gt; * The U.S. will have a large enough supply of coronavirus vaccines to inoculate \u201cevery adult in America\u201d by the end of May, two months earlier than previously expected, Biden said at the White House on Tuesday. The announcement came as the administration works to increase production of Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s newly cleared single-shot vaccine, and rival Merck agrees to pitch in.\n\n&gt; * The Republican governors of Texas and Mississippi both announced Tuesday that they\u2019re lifting mask mandates in their states and allowing businesses to reopen at full capacity even as the decline in new daily Covid-19 cases slows. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on Monday warned states against lifting public health restrictions too quickly.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. America\u2019s biggest firms push for path to citizenship for \u2018Dreamers\u2019\n\n&gt; * America\u2019s biggest companies are urging Congress to establish a permanent path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. In a letter Wednesday, a coalition of more than 100 companies and trade associations \u2014 including Facebook, General Motors, Marriott, Target, Visa and Uber \u2014 asked Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to pass the bipartisan Dream Act of 2021. The move comes as Biden and Democrats on Capitol Hill look to immigration as a major legislative priority.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Stocks to watch: Rocket Companies, Las Vegas Sands, Oscar Health\n\n&gt; * Rocket Companies fell 6% in Wednesday\u2019s premarket trading after more than doubling over the past three sessions. On Tuesday, the Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage parent surged over 71% on no apparent news. The heavily shorted stock appears to have garnered bullish interest from day traders on Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets forum.\n\n&gt; * Casino operator Las Vegas Sands said Wednesday it would sell its Vegas real estate and operations to private equity giant Apollo Global Management for about $6.25 billion. The properties include the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. Shares of Las Vegas Sands were up almost 3% in the premarket. Apollo fell nearly 1%.\n\n&gt; * Oscar Health is set to debut Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The health insurance startup backed by Google-parent Alphabet priced its initial public offering Tuesday evening at $39 per share, above the already-raised expected range of $36 to $38. The IPO gives Oscar Health a market value of $7.7 billion ahead of trading.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mFJEZLD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DZktsvp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/Yq2hHN9S/econcal1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/FFV78Chq/econcal2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/zRvHdP7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/PbURZ3R.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/oqzviWR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HGdMXO8.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/978P5c5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/2Ltoqja.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/d0wfH06g/upgradesdowngrades1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/52wGSzBw/upgradesdowngrades2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/nh8gm2DF/upgradesdowngrades3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/85n5bWw.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3PemF5S.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/0YIFXZl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lyft-las-vegas-sands-wendys-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Lyft (LYFT)** \u2013 The ride-hailing company said that last week saw the highest level of ride volume since the pandemic took hold last March.

        "selftext": "Reposting because of bad title last time: Here's my DD for you, **$WSGF (World Series of Golf). Don't be fooled by the name because this is not exactly or just a golf stock.**\n\n**WEBSITE:** [https://www.vaycaychella.com/](https://www.vaycaychella.com/)  ([wsgf.org](https://wsgf.org) is a website for a gaming forum, not this.)\n\n**Sector(s):** Consumer Cyclical Industry: Leisure\n\n***\"WSGF acquired Vaycaychella last year. Vaycaychella is now WSGF's primary business focus. A corporate name change is underway.\"*** [**https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wsgf-vaycaychella-app-to-expand-short-term-rental-ecosystem-spotlighted-by-airbnb-301220296.html**](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wsgf-vaycaychella-app-to-expand-short-term-rental-ecosystem-spotlighted-by-airbnb-301220296.html)\n\nAt its essence, this company began as a sports entertainment company. As you can tell per its namesake it has to do with golf tournaments, events, organizations etc. However, starting on Nov.10 2020 this company started a new path that focused on a unique form of real estate consumerism. Vaycaychella, a fresh and revolutionary business that is complacent on taking over the short-term vacation rental market.\n\n**Vaycaychella App:**\n\n* **Mission:** provide short-term vacation rental investors and owners with a peer-to-peer lending application (This P2P will take place as an app)\n* Additional apps are in development that will cover aspects such as amenities, discounted access, insurance, security, banking etc.\n* Name-change from WSGF to Vaycaychella is in the works (Major aesthetic gain)\n* A good comparison of the capabilities of this app is Airbnb with a $50B IPO\n\nReal Estate Professionals opinion on this app: *\u201cTheir vacay app is trying to bridge together a combination of 1. Crowd funding to purchase Real Estate property for short term rentals. Similar to a few websites where you can go on with as little as $5k to become part owner of a piece of rental property. There are various websites but none that stand out above the crowd. This is also not a very well-known fact and has not gained any public attention. 2. Get more visibility for short term rentals from a marketing perspective. I am not too familiar with short term rentals as I have always dealt personally with either multi-family (apartment complexes) and typical single-family homes. 3. They have mentioned a new way to get financing for upgrades and renovations, using their own lending platform. They mentioned some kind of visa card program and now talking about creating a new crypto. I am not very familiar with crypto currency to be honest, but if they can make this platform practical and user friendly, then maybe that will become another hot selling point. The key to this becoming successful is marketing and advertising. If they can really get the word out to the general public, I can see a lot of people being excited in becoming part owners of real estate. It will also be super important the company doesn't just get bought out by a major Corp with big pockets. Start-ups tend to get bought up once a hot new idea gains traction.\u201d*\n\n**Relevant News:**\n\n\u2022 Nov 24.2020 - announced adding a boutique hotel in the Caribbean to its portfolio of short-term rental properties available on sharing economy apps like Airbnb, VRBO and Booking.com. Sharing economy apps are taking an increasing share of the $32 billion Caribbean vacation market.\n\n\u2022 Nov 27, 2020 \u2013 Company published by SRT (Short Term Rentalz) after announcement to expand into Cuba\n\n\u2022 December 1st, 2020 \u2013 Company assets at approx. $12M in the Caribbean alone\n\n\u2022 Forbes recently reported that vacation destinations are the fastest growing real estate markets. \u2022 Real Estate Market valued at $30 Trillion (Opportunity)\n\n\u2022 $100 Million expected target for first 12 months of 2021\n\n\u2022 Inclusion of cryptocurrency\n\n\u2022 Inclusion of Visa card and other Credit cards\n\n\u2022 Jan 21, 2021 \u2013 Accelerated benefits from Biden's presidency pertaining to Cuban affairs.\n\n\u2022 Feb 19, 2021 \u2013 Beta app release end of February announced, production to begin in June this year as well.\n\n**Recent Catalyst:** BETA APP LAUNCHED: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wsgf-commences-p2p-alternative-real-145100696.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wsgf-commences-p2p-alternative-real-145100696.html)\n\n**Stock is pink current. $3.5 Million Market Cap Penny Stock (even after yesterday's pop) in a Market Segment of $6 Trillion. It has no dilution. The share count is insanely low for its size.**\n\nNote: CEO projecting 100M in Revenue 12 months after apps official release in June, 2021\n\n**CEO Interview:** [https://youtu.be/jAsiuGUIQ14](https://youtu.be/jAsiuGUIQ14)\n\n**Personal Opinion:** Huge opportunity to grow, which makes it an extremely valuable penny stock. With its marketing and company-structure being similar to the Airbnb construct which is listed at $206 as of today. This company is making it more accessible and affordable, therefore its potential greatly surpasses Airbnb itself. Expect this stock to start blowing up after the beta release, and rocket during production in June. Gradually by the end of the year, the stock price should be significantly high. I see a potential of $2-$20 by June and long-term I can see it competing with airbnb in the short term rental space.\n\ntl;dr: high potential stock, think airbnb competitor but luxury resorts, accepts crypto, people will travel once covid goes away +stim checks.\n\n***This is just an opinion, not professional advice.*** ***Do your own DD before you choose to buy any stocks.***",

        "selftext": "\\[This DD is fairly long, so there is a TL;DR at the end\\]\n\nRecent talk about excessive valuations got me thinking about my investment in the space spac, BlackSky $SFTW. Superficially, $SFTW has a great story. A recent tweet makes it appear to be an even greater story.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/mfk9vz/sftw\\_blacksky\\_secured\\_5\\_rocketlab\\_missions\\_with/\n\nBut digging deeper, I believe that the Investor Presentation is misrepresenting some material facts.\n\nObservation #1: Blacksky has tried to build out this network of satellites at least four times since 2015.\n\nThis is not BlackSky's first attempt to build a satellite constellation.\n\nFirst Attempt (2015):\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgilnEFP0ks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgilnEFP0ks)\n\nThe company had reportedly fundraised enough to build out a 70-satellite constellation in order to provide 70 repeat visits per day (one visit every 20 minutes if one includes nighttime or one every 10 minutes if this figure is for daylight hours only). \n\nSecond Attempt (2019):\n\nOn Nov. 12 2019, Blacksky reportedly raised $50 million in order to build out this network. \n\nhttps://spacenews.com/blacksky-secures-50-million-financing-from-intelsat/\n\nThird Attempt (2020):\n\nIn February 2020, Spaceflight Inc. spun off Blacksky and sold itself to a coalition of two Japanese companies Mitsui Co and Yamasa Co. The goal was to provide \u201cfocus\u201d to BlackSky so that it could build out its satellite constellation. \n\nA Quote: \"Spaceflight Industries plans to use the capital from the deal to invest in BlackSky, which is set to launch at least eight more Earth Observation (EO) satellites this year.\"\n\nIf that came true, the investor presentation would record 13 existing satellites in the constellation rather than 5. With the recent launch, there is now 6.\n\nWhat about those 9 new satellites being launched this year (the fourth attempt)?\n\nThis latest tweet on March 25 2021 is at least the fourth major attempt to claim an accelerated rollout of a satellite constellation. BlackSky arranged with their old parent company (SpaceFlight) to organize space on 5 missions on Electron rockets to launch 9 satellites in 2021. This arrangement doesn\u2019t seem very binding, as it doesn't involve a direct commitment to Rocket Labs despite BlackSky giving photo credit to RL in their tweet.\n\n[https://twitter.com/RocketLab360/status/1375028248539762689?s=19](https://twitter.com/RocketLab360/status/1375028248539762689?s=19)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/mfk9vz/sftw\\_blacksky\\_secured\\_5\\_rocketlab\\_missions\\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/mfk9vz/sftw_blacksky_secured_5_rocketlab_missions_with/)\n\nMaybe the rollout will be accelerated, but I am taking a \u201cbelieve it when I see it\u201d approach as BlackSky has promised and failed to deliver three times before.\n\nObservation #2 - The Blacksky Team:\n\nThe original CEO of Blacksky (and Spaceflight) was Jason Andrews. By the time of the 2020 deal to sell Spaceflight to a Japanese coalition, Jason is nowhere to be found.\n\nThe new team includes CEO Brian O\u2019Toole who created OpenWhere (bought by Spaceflight in 2016) and worked for GeoEye, a geo satellite company under DigitalGlobe. At Openwhere, Brian O\u2019Toole created a data portal for satellite imagery in 2016. Scott Herman (Chief Solutions Architect) also worked at GeoEye. The CTO, Peter Wegner, is a holdover from Spaceflight. Nick Merski (COO) had \u201cvarious\u201d engineering positions in the US Air Force. \n\nMaybe the new team will be great, but they seem to be in charge of a turnaround project for now. \n\nObservation #3 - BlackSky\u2019s technology has no moat:\n\nBlackSky is unlikely to have any enduring edge (if it even has one) in cost of image acquisition. \n\nBlackSky also has serious competitors who are ahead in their current technology. DigitalGlobe launched GeoEye-1 in 2008 with 46cm resolution ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoEye-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoEye-1)). BlackSky is planning its \u201cthird\u201d generation satellite with 50cm resolution in 2023. \\[NB: Digital Globe seems to no longer exist\\]\n\nPlanet currently has 130 satellites in its constellation providing 3-5m resolution monitoring of the earth. Planet has another 21 SkySats already deployed to provide the &lt; 1m service that BlackSky claims that it will soon start to provide to customers. \n\nhttps://www.planet.com/products/\n\nMaxar is already serving the US Military and other big government agencies. It launches its Worldview Legion constellation this year (2021) that will give the same real-time coverage that BlackSky is planning for 2023. Unlike BlackSky, Maxar already sells automated feature extraction and other data analysis tasks at scale.\n\nhttps://www.maxar.com/worldview-legion?utm\\_source=maxar.com-hp&amp;utm\\_medium=website\n\nhttps://www.maxar.com/worldview-legion?utm\\_source=maxar.com-hp&amp;utm\\_medium=website\n\nWhat makes BlackSky a better choice than Maxar or Planet?\n\nOther competitors:\n\nCommunications is probably the biggest use case for satellites (i.e. Space X\u2019s Starlink network), not Earth Observation.\n\n[https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space](https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space)\n\nI searched through a recent academic study of satellite constellations. It is hard to distinguish between the different use cases (Earth Observation like BlackSky, Space Observation, and Communications) of different satellite constellations from this list, but it is important to note that the list of existing and planned satellite constellations runs for three pages and that several companies are cancelling major projects.\n\nchrome-extension://ieepebpjnkhaiioojkepfniodjmjjihl/data/pdf.js/web/viewer.html?file=https%3A%2F%2Fres.mdpi.com%2Fd\\_attachment%2Faerospace%2Faerospace-07-00133%2Farticle\\_deploy%2Faerospace-07-00133.pdf\n\n\\[Read Pages 9 - 11\\]\n\nObservation #4 - How reliable is BlackSky's pipeline?\n\nThe investor presentation describes a $1.7 Billion pipeline, including c. $100 million pre-committed revenue for 2021. Yet how binding is this larger pipeline? \n\nFor example, Blacksky promoted in late 2019 that it was one of three main competitors binding for a government contract. In February 2020, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) chose Planet as its commercial satellite image provider.\n\n[https://www.nro.gov/Media/Images/igphoto/2002194772/](https://www.nro.gov/Media/Images/igphoto/2002194772/)\n\nRather than secured contacts, most of this future pipeline seems to be based on \u201crelationships\u201d that may or may not pan out. \n\nTL;DR Summary:\n\nBlackSky is not a first mover in real-time earth observation.\n\nBlackSky has already planned to disrupt the market three times already, and this spac is its fourth attempt.\n\nBlackSky has some serious competition and no clear path to scale to its promised 75% margins. I expect price competition from the more established players will make this goal hard to achieve.\n\nBlackSky claims to have \u201crelationships\u201d, not contracts, with the major government agencies yet the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) awarded its most recent contract to Planet.\n\nOverall, BlackSky\u2019s claim to be category definer is more wishful thinking than reality at this stage.\n\nI personally took profits in $SFTW ahead of the ARKX (Space EFT) launch and I will stay clear until this company is more established. In contrast, I would buy into Planet if it ever went public.\n\nCompare my bearish sentiments to the Blacksky Investor Presentation here:\n\nchrome-extension://ieepebpjnkhaiioojkepfniodjmjjihl/data/pdf.js/web/viewer.html?file=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic1.squarespace.com%2Fstatic%2F5d45d790e595130001acce06%2Ft%2F602d836852a6161779071daa%2F1613595497169%2FEagle%2BEye%2BInvestor%2BPresentation%2B%25282.17.2021%2529\\_vFinal2.pdf",

        "selftext": " Disclosure:\n\nI do own a position in GTEH @ .72 .\n\nI am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, do whatever the hell you wanna do.\n\nGentech  Holdings Inc. (GTEH) has been mentioned on this sub before and has  since flown under the radar after dipping quite a bit from it's high of a  little over a penny.\n\nFirst and foremost: They are in the process of removing their shell status:\n\n[https://sec.report/otc/financial-report/271582](https://sec.report/otc/financial-report/271582)\n\nThey have a real, up to date website:\n\n[https://www.gentechholdings.com/](https://www.gentechholdings.com/)\n\nand are active on social media:\n\nhttps://tw1tter.com/GenTechHoldings\n\nalong with two of their subsidiaries:\n\nhttps://tw1tter.com/sinfitnutrition\n\nhttps://tw1tter.com/secretjavas\n\nand  remember, this thing is trading UNDER A PENNY, while having everything  point to the fact that they are a legitimate, growing company.\n\nGentech  Holdings owns multiple subsidiaries, most notably Sinfit Nutritions.   Sinfit is almost always sold out everywhere you look, and have recently  hired more staff, and are looking to expand their facilities to  accompany the order growth that they have seen.  They are also  constantly looking for new advertising opportunities, including signing  multiple athletes with big followings on social media.\n\nThe  less notable would be Secret Javas, admittedly I am not very  knowledgeable about this company but to my understanding it is a premium  coffee delivery service.\n\nGentech  also has plans to launch a CBD based brand called \"The Healthy Leaf\"  which I believe was halted due to covid-19, but has plans to open 3 new  shops by the end of 2021.\n\nTheir  CEO is seemingly active and transparent with shareholders as seen here,  doing an interview with a lesser known youtuber, but still an interview  nonetheless.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNFCb5AfMhY&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNFCb5AfMhY&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nFurthermore,  liabilities have remained very conistent for the company, whereas the  YoY growth has been exponential.  There is no exact date for a 2021  earnings report but I have read that it is supposed to be on or before  March 15th.\n\nWorth noting:  GTEH has been shorted into the DIRT recently, backed up by the statistics of\n\n[https://otcshortreport.com/company/GTEH](https://otcshortreport.com/company/GTEH)\n\nI  know this is natural for a penny stock because most pennies end up as  defunct companies and are then delisted, resulting in the profits of  millions for hedge funds.  However that is why I think penny stocks that  are being heavily shorted that are growing/unlikely to go out of  business any time soon are such a big buying opportunity.  All of the  big dips get eaten up right away.\n\nCatalysts: Earnings report, new signed athlete announcement on sinfits twitter. Shell status removal. Opening of THL stores. Expansion of sinfit. Rumors of a potential merger and or acquisition.\n\nThe  volume on this stock is extremely healthy for a penny stock that isn't  in the limelight anymore and I believe that once it takes off, it's  going to be a \"man I wish I bought that when it was under a penny\"  stock, hence why I am in.\n\nKeep in  mind, to me this is a LONG HOLD, I don't expect to \"moon\" anytime soon,  but I think that GTEH has extreme growth potential with a very good  return on investment by the end of 2021, and further.\n\nThanks guys!",

That being *Add Liquidity Only orders* and Supplemental Liquidity Providers (SLP) which explains:\n\n1. Why we see huge \u201cvolume\u201d pop up on TD TOS for GME\n2. Why we see huge \u201cvolume\u201d pop up on TD TOS for other stocks\n3. Why we see it in the \u201cvolume\u201d column with no buy/sell orders lodged against it\n4. Why this \u201cvolume\u201d **can\u2019t** be used to calculate short interest, potential prices or whatever other\n\nThe middle two being points where people still had questions around and the latter other posters speculating and using them incorrectly (nothing wrong with that, this sub is about improving all our analysis when new information is found!).\n\nNow, this will be a long read which is why I'm trying to get it out on a Sunday for people to consume and take it in before the market opens.\n\nThanks to u/SmithEchoes for collaborating with me on this DD.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet\u2019s get into it!\n\nThe same assumption regarding NYSE Chicago being a sandpit for Shitadel and co remains the same from my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mdnph0/more_proof_the_115_billion_buy_order_was_real_and/).\n\nLet\u2019s recap what we saw in terms of order behaviour on this exchange over the past 6 months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y3jcvaeczrp61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d9eab1540ec5bd37c5f940cc5a4a63e986f9896\n\nWe saw volume shift **away** from *Limit Non-Routable IOC* to:\n\n1. IOC ISO\n2. Limit Non-displayed\n3. Add Liquidity Only (ALO)\n\nThese three order types are the keys to the puzzle we\u2019ve been needing, to figure out their strategy to manipulate GME prices. So let\u2019s start off by getting an understanding of what they are!\n\nBare with the explanations, pretty graphs, charts and some pretty mind boggling conclusions lay beyond the order type explanations.\n\n# \n\n# IOC ISO (Immediate or Cancel Intermarket Sweep Order)\n\nFor those who have not read my previous post find an excerpt below.\n\n[Intermarket sweep order](https://ibkr.info/article/1734)\u2019s are generally a large quantity order that is sent to **multiple exchanges**.This is how it functions:\n\n* An order is submitted in the pre market to sell at a price of 40.80 and is sent to exchange A.\n* The best offer price on exchange A is 40.63.\n* Exchange B receives an intermarket sweep order to buy 800 shares of the stock at a limit price of 40.88.\n* The best offer price on exchange B is 40.88\n\n*The trader that enters the intermarket sweep order would be required to fulfill their Regulation NMS requirement by executing the maximum available quantity on exchange A at 40.63 and then may execute the balance of the order on exchange B at 40.88 even though it is at a price that is inferior to the 40.80 order resting in the book on exchange A. The 40.80 price is not the inside quote and is therefore not \"protected\" in terms of the balance of the sweep order executing at exchange B at a price of 40.88.*\n\n**So in monke speak**, it fills the lowest alternate exchange price before filling the order at the higher price.\n\nTo make it more complicated this is an order with a modifier (ISO is the modifier), so let\u2019s understand an IOC.\n\nThese are orders which attempt to execute immediately and cancel any unfilled portion. E.g. place a buy for 10 u/180, it\u2019s only able to be filled to a portion of 5 u/180 and then canceled straight away.\n\nA key part to these types of orders is derived from the following.\n\n*\"The intermarket sweep exception enables trading centers that receive sweep orders to execute those orders immediately, without waiting for better priced quotations in other markets to be updated.\"*\n\nThis is [derived from a response](https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nyse-2014-32/nyse201432-2.pdf) to change how ALOs work by the NYSE, as they\u2019ve been a thorn in their side since 2014. A prelude to what we\u2019ll go into later. Sounds suspicious right?\n\n*\\*nudge nudge\\* Almost like they\u2019d be handy for HFTs \\*nudge nudge\\**\n\n# \n\n# Limit Non-displayed\n\nAn order to buy or sell stock at or better than a specified price, these orders are HIDDEN from us apes and others. They also don\u2019t care about [lock or cross situation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lockedmarket.asp) cases. Refer to [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mdnph0/more_proof_the_115_billion_buy_order_was_real_and/) for and understanding on this.\n\nThis means the HFT (high frequency traders) can effectively jump the line by posting [\u201chide not slide\u201d](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QmoFpdq9HeGJ-cdPP7y808uWxVufJNr2b69J0GY_-SQ/edit?usp=sharing) orders instead of visible orders. **This is because a hidden order will not be slidden, resetting the timestamp**. So if i placed an order at $120.01 for GME, they then place a hidden order for $120.01 as well, I get my timestamp reset as i\u2019ve placed a locked/cross order, but the hidden order does not get their timestamp reset therefore essentially skipping the fucking line.\n\nYet another bread and butter tool when it comes to HFT. The key here though is the fact that it\u2019s HIDDEN and how this plays out with ALO order types (IB allows retail to place these orders as well).\n\n# \n\n# Add Liquidity Only (ALO)\n\nFirst of all, major thanks to u/SmithEchoes on this bad boy as it\u2019s a complicated beast.\n\nNow this order type is a doozy, and is currently being used for nefarious purposes.\n\nALO follows a strict \u201cIf,then\u201d rule set based on if it locks [(7.31(e)(2)(b)iii-iv)](https://nyseguide.srorules.com/rules/document?treeNodeId=csh-da-filter!WKUS-TAL-DOCS-PHC-%7B4A07B716-0F73-46CC-BAC2-43EB20902159%7D--WKUS_TAL_19401%23teid-37) **OR** crosses [(7.31(e)(2)(b)ii)](https://nyseguide.srorules.com/rules/document?treeNodeId=csh-da-filter!WKUS-TAL-DOCS-PHC-%7B4A07B716-0F73-46CC-BAC2-43EB20902159%7D--WKUS_TAL_19401%23teid-37).  This rule set forces the ALO to perform these trades until it is fully consumed, or the order is canceled.

This is the equivalent of HFT when ALO \u201cactivates\u201d BUT it comes with a built in safety feature that IF the price goes UP(Sell ALO) or DOWN (buy ALO) the ALO limit price is no longer locking or crossing at the values it was getting moved to, it **REVERTS** back to its original limit order price.\n\n**Monke speak translator:** These orders create sell/buy walls that have a nifty function that essentially \u201cflips the safety switch\u201d back to the original limit order price if too much buy/sell pressure is applied.\n\nFunnily enough, the NYSE has tried to [amend how ALO orders work](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2014/10/16/2014-24547/self-regulatory-organizations-new-york-stock-exchange-llc-nyse-mkt-inc-order-approving-proposed-rule), because of how they can be used for nefarious purposes\u2026. *\\*cough\\* Shitadel \\*cough\\** The amendment would force to cancel the ALO once it crosses or locked, and not perform how it currently does in accordance with [7.31(e)(2)(b)i-v](https://nyseguide.srorules.com/rules/document?treeNodeId=csh-da-filter!WKUS-TAL-DOCS-PHC-%7B4A07B716-0F73-46CC-BAC2-43EB20902159%7D--WKUS_TAL_19401%23teid-37). Which means no buy/sell wall capability for them to use and abuse.\n\nThe last thing we needa talk about are mother fucking SLPs. This ain\u2019t an order type but it\u2019ll clear up many questions. We\u2019ll then get into analysing price action after this (the fun part).\n\n# \n\n# SLP (Supplemental Liquidity Providers)\n\nGuess who can be a [SLP](https://www.nyse.com/markets/liquidity-programs)? That\u2019s right. Market Makers.\n\nOur friend, Shitadel is a SLP.\n\nSLPs are pretty simple to understand. They are market participants that use HFT to create high volume on exchanges in order to add liquidity to the markets. This is all done to create *tight spreads*.\n\nSLPs such as Shitadel can artificially create liquidity in the market through **explosively shitting out volume** through the use of HFT methods. **This is important.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jpucmp5fzrp61.png?width=510&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d95d29d66122b4c7702e4b0e8af26e7513415d0\n\nBecause GME liquidity has been drying up bit by bit since January-2021, Shitadel and co need to use their position as an SLP to manipulate GMEs price as us apes are hodling.\n\nThe whole premise of market makers is to remain neutral and to make money through scraping cents of cents off the spread, therefore not directionally affecting the price. However, if i\u2019m on my last legs and feel like doing something illegal, I can use a mixture of the order types above in combination with SLP to manipulate GME at my will.\n\n# \n\n# SLP and Our Beloved TD TOS \u201cErrors\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s clear up this TD TOS situation once and for all as I\u2019m HIGHLY certain this is exactly what we\u2019re seeing.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said above, Shitadel and co can explosively shit volume into the market. This is exactly what we\u2019re seeing flow through TOS.\n\n**Myth 1. \u201cBuT iT IsN\u2019T BuY oR sELl\u201d**\n\n**It\u2019s neither a sell or a buy because it\u2019s both**. Which is why we see no buy orders or sell orders in TOS in the example below. It\u2019s also why we can\u2019t project prices using it, so any post you see trying to do that to justify the value of GME, it\u2019s just not true as not all of it needs to be executed. Apologies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3a2sgxgzrp61.png?width=632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a6b8d5a088a836db8fcb5c5da0008b78e548d05\n\n**Myth 1. \u201cBuT iT hAppEnS to OtHEr TiCkeRs\u201d**\n\nIt\u2019s also commonplace within the market, which is why we see it pop up for other stocks. In general, SLP is good because it does create those tighter spreads. But it sure as hell can be used for manipulation if the SLP wants to take illegal risks to shake retail investors from a certain stock *\\*cough\\* GME \\*cough\\**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8t1t4wzhzrp61.png?width=636&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1d1fcf0a6af0a70e82744c2037b0fd6383940cf\n\n# \n\n# Rewind.\n\nNow we know what we\u2019re talking about, let\u2019s go back to this table. A very juicy pattern starts to emerge which is the huge increases we see in ALO distribution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fwr7cswjzrp61.png?width=506&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe7d3ba75b4014d179c36c6cf995b145bf47fe34\n\nWhen we look at historical *NYSE Chicago volume*, we see visible step changes in the highs that sussly match up with ALOs monthly increases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n98d42zkzrp61.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76d4b13baaf6e2e2bfb57c84518083f3b74fef41\n\nThis leads me to believe they are using ALOs as a buy/sell wall in level 2 data, which helps them to control momentum. However ALOs need to be timed well, as they could be blown away due to pressure from other parties.\n\nSo what are the tools that our HFs buddies have to manipulate the price?\n\n1. **IOC ISO orders**\n   1. Cross exchange sweep that allows them to get ahead of the order queue to an extent\n   2. Used as buy/sell pressure when needed\n2. **Limit non-displayed orders**\n   1. A hidden order that does not affect the price\n   2. Used to offset IOC ISO orders so as a market maker they can remain \u201cneutral\u201d without causing buy/sell pressure\n3. **ALO orders**\n   1. A order placed to create a buy/sell wall\n   2. Used to stop momentum and turn the trend around\n\nHere are the players which they need to factor into their strategy:\n\n1. **Retail investors \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udc12**\n   1. Likely displaying a predictable buying pattern by now\n2. **Long Whales \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udc33**\n   1. Shitadel and Co likely know the strategy they are trying to employ (outside of sporadic buy pressure from the equitie side of things\n3. **Other parties such as day traders** \ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udc7f\n   1. *Don\u2019t day trade GME for the love of everything good in this world*\n\n# \n\n# Let\u2019s put it all together!!!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lmyg2mqmzrp61.png?width=634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6704aefbe17b150cd44df6dc631e3bb4985ca84\n\nI\u2019m taking the three most recent observations of SLP volume from TOS and have marked them on a GME 1 hour candle chart. It\u2019s pretty telling looking at this straight away what\u2019s going on. At each of the specific candles i\u2019ve highlighted, we see a *wall* being hit and a reversal in price.\n\n# \n\n# Strategy Breakdown\n\n**\\~630M @\\~$181**\n\n1. Place ALO **sell** order to create a wall in preparation for earnings in after market\n2. Use HFT IOC ISO **sell** order to create downward pressure during earnings call and after\n3. Use HFT Limit Non-Display **buy** order to remain \u201cneutral\u201d without creating any upward pressure\n\n**\\~113M @\\~$120**\n\n1. Place IOC ISO buy order to buy up shares on the way up\n2. Place Limit buy order to buy up shares on the way up\n\n**\\~290M @\\~$183**\n\n1. Place ALO **sell** order to create a wall to reduce upward pressure\n2. Use HFT IOC ISO **sell** order to create downward pressure\n3. Use HFT Limit Non-Display **buy** order to remain \u201cneutral\u201d without creating any upward pressure\n\n# \n\n# The question is WHY are they doing this?\n\nFTDs.\n\nThe shorts know they have to cover a certain amount of FTDs out of pocket each [cycle](https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/Current-DD/), they naturally want the price as low as possible in order to do this. Cover implies whatever they could not borrow to use towards covering their FTDs.\n\nYep, you read that right ape.\n\n**Those screenshots you see from iborrow with borrowed shares disappearing ain\u2019t being used to short the stock, they are being used to cover their FTDs.**\n\nOn that bombshell, back to HFT. As mentioned above, they\u2019d want to manage buy pressure and keep the price as low as possible so they sweep up some shares at the lowest price they can.\n\nThis is what\u2019s happening from the first SLP Volume coming through in the picture above. Drop the price, then at the point they can\u2019t drop it much further they start sweeping up shares with IOC ISOs and regular limit orders **to cover the rest of their FTDs they could not through borrowing** and this is our second SLP volume coming through. Lastly, they needa put a cap on this so it does not get out of control, so they create a sell wall and start to work the price back down again.\n\nThey knew Earnings Release was a good bet to tank the price, they had it all planned out, from the PR campaign MSM was running to even profiting off the spread from the decline to the bounce due to them adding liquidity into the market as a **SL-fucking-P**.\n\nTheory time (this whole post is, but humour me as I have the **PERSONAL** belief the above is fairly on point, do your own DD to confirm \ud83d\ude09 ).\n\n# \n\n# Theory 1 | We Will See It Again\n\nAs FTDs are cyclical we will see this behaviour moving forward until the bubble bursts as the FTD cycle slowly grows out of their control. HODL.\n\nI base this on the fact that I believe if we had noticed the SLP volume sooner we would be able to match this whole post to exactly what happened in late February below (with a few variations in strategy dependent on their options spread).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6fltgujozrp61.png?width=634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5b38abb929ece9d9c8533e8b79aab0ef0498396\n\n# \n\n# Theory 2 | Options and Long Whales\n\nShorts are trying to balance two plates.\n\n1. Covering FTDs\n2. Making money to cover those FTDs through options\n\nThey are carefully managing how they can use their HFT strategy using their status as a SLP and to make money on options as well to fund covering FTDs among other things like paying employees etc..\n\nThis is where the long whales come in, historically in MY EYES, whales are responsible for the spike in price on the 24th February to just under the $200 mark. Since then and much before, they contributed little volume. It\u2019s entirely made up of HFT and retail investors buying.\n\nWhere they do play into this and i think is a valid theory is using their weight when it matters to inflict [max pain](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mejp0k/the_concept_of_max_pain_and_why_this_is_probably/) (post suggest whales pushed up price, that\u2019s not true based on everything in this post, but it\u2019s entirely valid that they slowed it down so the price upon market close on friday would inflict max pain).\n\n# \n\n# Conclusion\n\nWow, that was a lot. As such, take time to take it in and properly understand it. As always, PM or comment and I'll clear things up as best I can.\n\nThis has been going on since as early as October when we first witnessed a huge shift in order strategy. SLPs are meant to be a \u201cgood\u201d thing for the market, but as always, there is room to misuse their positions as market makers to yet again fuck over retail investors.\n\nBest part about this is, when we see SLPs volume come through in TD TOS, we can likely with a **reasonable degree of accuracy predict price movements.**\n\nAnd last last note i promise, this is why using TA analysis ON ITS OWN is dangerous as it doesn't know what\u2019s actually going on.\n\n# \n\n# TLDR;\n\nThe shorts are in a death spiral of borrowing to cover FTDs and using HFT trading tactics to cover the remaining FTDs that the borrowed shares could not.\n\nWhales are on our side, but are putting their effort into controlling buy/sell pressure on certain days to inflict max pain on the shorts options spread.\n\nThe price action we are seeing is largely made up of HFTs, Retail, the odd day trader or two (don\u2019t fucking do it).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis ain't financial advice yo, just an ape analysing data and reading boring as fuck SEC filings.\n\nEdit: Readability changes\n\n\n**Important: Let\u2019s Spread Awareness++\nMy dear Apes check this out.\n\nLet\u2019s spread awareness of what an massive fraud is happening currently on the stock markets. What better way is there than than educating ourselves and others? ... Would you like to see how we can spread awareness?\n\nThis is no financial advice. I really have no clue what i\u2019m talking about. I just like the stock. \nOriginal Source by u/jsmar18",

With the recent tech stock beatdown, here are some of the stocks I am eyeing and looking to buy: \n\n- Corsair (CRSR) : had stellar earnings and they make fantastic products in the gaming and PC hardware space.  They're making good acquisitions in the streaming space.  \n\n- Salesforce (CRM) : another solid company that has taken a big beating for no apparent reason.  They recently acquired Slack and I dont see any other competitor being remotely close in the CRM space. \n\n- Square (SQ): revolutionizing payments for small businesses and making key moves in the crypto space.  \n\n- Cloudflare (NET): yet to turn profitable but a great tech company that is growing rapidly. \n\n- Snowflake (SNOW): another tech company that was overvalued upon IPO and climbed all the way to $429 before being brought back to earth.  Currently trading at  $213\n\n- Costco (COST): solid company that has a loyal following and great business model.  \n\n- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM): market leader in chip manufacturing and with the current shortage in chips,  their future looks great. \n\n- Teladoc (TDOC): one of the big companies in the telemedicine space that should thrive in the post covid world as more patients want the convenience of seeing their doctor from the comfort of their own home. \n\n- Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY): pharma giant that made key acquisitions recently (Celgene and Myokardia) that should boost their pipeline and revenue.  Also pays good dividend. \n\n- Facebook (FB) : social media giant that isn't going away anytime soon.  Would be interesting to see how they leverage Oculus to boost their revenue.  \n\n- CVS (CVS) : pharmacy giant that should get a boost from covid vaccine rollout and their new in-house clinics. \n\n- Tattooed Chef (TTCF): fast growing company in the plant based protein and healthy frozen foods space.  They have products in almost all major retailers and are rapidly expanding.  \n\n- Nvidia (NVDA): leader in GPU space and a tech giant.  \n\n- Palantir (PLTR): big data company with a revolutionary product that is just getting started.  \n\n- Qualcomm (QCOM): makes chips for phones and are well established for the 5G Era\n\n- American Tower Corp (AMT): they make/ rent out cell signal towers and should benefit from the move to 5G\n\n- Planet13 Holdings (PLNHF): they make giant superstores for Marijuana sale and are set to have their own brand of products \n\nOf course I would also add Apple, Visa, Microsoft, and Amazon if they dipped enough. \n\nWhat stocks did I miss?  Are there any others you would suggest keeping an eye on during the recent sell-off?  Thank you!",

It's significantly more potent than its competitors and would have increased effectiveness against variant strains.\n\nOh, but what about their immunotherapies? Glad you asked because it is INCREDIBLY encouraging.\n\n**Hep B?** Currently, in phase 1b/2a,  it has the potential to be a **functional cure** for Hep B through its T cell response.\n\n**Glioblastoma?** That horrific brain cancer with a 39.3% one-year survival rate? In ongoing phase 1/2a clinical trials, their immunotherapy has been an effective chemotherapy alternative. The study primary study lasted 3 years on a disease with a median survival of 15-16 months, you can do the math.\n\n**TLDR** Proven Hep-B vaccine about to hit mass markets, CMV and covid vaccine in development, and their Hep-B and brain cancer immunotherapies have promising results. All their products have massive potential markets (except for Glioblastoma, but theirs would be the first treatment for it).\n\nNo debt, brand new facility and only roughly 40% retail ownership. If you want to speculate on biotech, the time is now.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm a bio major, not a finance. I like the stock, but I like the products even more. 2000 shares deep at 3.40 avg baby!",

As the stimulus checks come out many will purchase on a card to collect points and use the check to pay it off. (by the way this is not what you should be doing IMO). 3rd. Very good support near 215.00. 4th. 24 analysts covering 18 strong buy 2 moderate buy 4 hold. 5th my indicators all show upward movement from yesterday's low (3/10). 6th the 200 day sma is about 200.00ish this is important because back in October it broke the 200 and quickly rebounded back above. History on V shows the 200 is a very key level on Visa. \n\nSo what's the play?  Sell the 4/16 205.00 and Buy the 200.00 This is even outside the 1 std deviation and should produce a credit of about 1.70\\~2..00 credit. good luck and please do your own DD",

        "selftext": "Armed with a fresh round of stimulus checks, Americans may be ready to shop...for some bitcoin and stocks.\n\nA new survey out of Mizuho Securities on Monday estimates that 10%, or nearly $40 billion of the $380 billion in direct stimulus checks, may be used to purchase bitcoin and stocks. Mizuho managing director Dan Dolev and his team surveyed approximately 235 individuals with less than $150,000 of household income. Of that, about 200 said they expect to receive the third round of direct stimulus payments in the coming days.\n\nNearly 2-in-5 check recipients expect to use some portion of their checks to invest. And stimulus check recipients prefer bitcoin over stocks, according to the survey.\n\n\"The survey predicts that bitcoin will account for 60% of total incremental investment spend. We calculate it could add as much as 2-3% to bitcoin's current $1.1t trillion market value,\" Dolev writes.\n\nDolev says stocks from his coverage universe that should benefit the most from people buying equities with their checks include Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, and Square.\n\nMizuho isn't alone in its call on the use of stimulus checks.\n\nA good chunk of the new stimulus money about to be funneled into American households shortly via the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill may find its way into the stock market, Goldman Sachs says.\n\n\"We expect households will be the largest source of equity demand this year,\" Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin wrote recently. \"We raise our household net equity demand forecast to $350 billion from $100 billion, which reflects faster economic growth and higher interest rates than we had assumed previously, additional stimulus payments to individuals, and increased retail activity in early 2021.\n\nThe latest round of stimulus checks will be sizable, hence Wall Streeters optimism some of the funds will find their way into asset classes such as bitcoin and stocks.\n\nRoughly 90% of American households will be eligible for stimulus checks, according to CNN. For those eligible, they stand to receive a $1,400 check. Considering dependents are included, a couple with two children could receive up to $5,600.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nearly-10-of-the-380-billion-in-stimulus-checks-may-be-used-to-buy-bitcoin-and-stocks-survey-131009531.html?guccounter=1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nearly-10-of-the-380-billion-in-stimulus-checks-may-be-used-to-buy-bitcoin-and-stocks-survey-131009531.html?guccounter=1)",

        "selftext": " **Monday, March 8th. 2021.**\n\nApproximately 120 million Americans are unwilling to take the Covid-19 Vaccine. With new strains of Covid-19 appearing and vaccines losing efficacy, Covid-19 is estimated to remain **remnant** within society for another 2-7 years.\n\nThe FDA has authorized 12 COVID-19 antigen tests under Emergency Use Authorization's; all are **low** throughput. In order to fill up a stadium for an NFL game, we NEED rapid tests with **high** throughput, we need a covid test that can process thousands of people per hour - not five people per hour.\n\nThis is where Flurotechs proprietary technology comes in.\n\nFlurotech achieved proof of concept at Albany Medical College on Sept. 8, 2020. Here: [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/08/2090133/0/en/Update-to-Previously-Announced-SARS-CoV-2-Test-Development-Initiative-With-Albany-Medical-College-for-the-Presence-of-SARS-CoV-2-Virus.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/08/2090133/0/en/Update-to-Previously-Announced-SARS-CoV-2-Test-Development-Initiative-With-Albany-Medical-College-for-the-Presence-of-SARS-CoV-2-Virus.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Product:**\n\nFlurotechs rapid-covid testing system processes 3000 results per hour, per platform. Individuals are provided a small tube where they drool saliva into, and then place the tube on a harness that will complete the process and deliver covid results to your phone within the next 5 minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p6zht857hwl61.png?width=1455&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4298afb0b59a03866de4ba70af8edbe3788400af\n\n**Who's interested?**\n\nTo summarize, the company is in contact with Schools, airports, cruise lines, stadiums, ticketing/event producers, and more.\n\nSpecifically - The NFL, MLB, NBA, Nascar, Ticketmaster (10,000 events that they can't schedule right now), large universities, AND MORE. Taken from 14:29 and onwards in the investor's presentation video they released here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAcqwoeyhM0&amp;t=913s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAcqwoeyhM0&amp;t=913s)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Product Efficacy:**\n\nBill Phelan, CEO of Flurotech said that he is currently unable to disclose the exact accuracy of his tests, however, he has made two things public:\n\n1.) Estimated accuracy of 98%+\n\n2.) A Limits of detection of 1000. For reference, Abbots *Binax Now Ag Card* rapid test has a LOD of 90,000. **90x less** sensitive than Flurotechs technology.\n\nIf you are suspicious of the validity behind their testing accuracy, wait till you hear this.\n\nIn the investor's presentation released on January. 14, 2020. We got to look at just WHO owns shares of Flurotech And what do you know? Albany Medical College, the company that verified Flurotechs limit of detections, and accuracy, owns **5%** of the company. Via here:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/etksj1q7hwl61.png?width=1449&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0591fbf790ceba8126af3e4d389230ae3e788d4f\n\nAlso. Within the last month, **3** new people join the scientific advisory board.\n\n1.) Brian Shield - The VP of IT on the Boston Red Sox.\n\n2.) Timothy J. Holzer\n\n3.) Phillip Farrelly - Hudson Robotics Founder and President.\n\nTwo out of the three new additions to the board of FluroTech are DIRECT STAKEHOLDERS to the company. People with INSIDE INFORMATION are joining the board.\n\nRandom note: After Flurotest and Flurotech merge back, the inside/institutional ownership will be about 66.6% of the float. ---&gt; 1:1 merge, according to Bill Phelan in the investor's presentation video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAcqwoeyhM0&amp;t=913s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAcqwoeyhM0&amp;t=913s))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Competition**\n\nFirst of all, I must may it clear that as of right now there are **NO** companies that have rapid-covid testing technology that can process thousands of people per hour. In fact, all rapid-covid tests up to date, have been designed for at-home/individual usage, so these tests can process 4-5 people per hour on average. In this regard, $Test is eons ahead of its competition.\n\nThe main competition of Flurotech is Sona Nanotech and Roche. Although both companies have achieved notable accuracy/results - their products have been designed for point of care testing for individuals, not groups of thousands of people. 90% of the other rapid-testing companies I discovered stopped releasing press releases, **or** have little to no information about their testing products on a designated website.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f9hmmr68hwl61.png?width=1842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abd2d6f4b3e920168b3ce7e567ed0b23d35306af\n\n**Volume.**\n\nRelative to the companies market cap, volume is extremely low - that on some days, (Friday) $111,000 was the total amount of cash that flowed in/out of the stock. (Meaning, current shareholders have diamond fucking hands and don't be phased by volatility that the paper hands cause.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Future**\n\nFour days ago Flurotech announced its Clinical trials partner - Toolbox, and how it will begin clinical trials by mid-April. Here: [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/04/2187104/0/en/FluroTech-Partners-With-Toolbox-Medical-Innovations-for-Clinical-Trial-of-Mass-Scale-COVID-19-Testing-Platform.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/04/2187104/0/en/FluroTech-Partners-With-Toolbox-Medical-Innovations-for-Clinical-Trial-of-Mass-Scale-COVID-19-Testing-Platform.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Price Prediction**\n\nIt ALL comes down to the accuracy of Flurotechs test. And we get that information after clinical trials, if accuracy really ends up as 98% or higher (as the CEO said it is) then the market cap could easily go upwards of **$5 Billion**. (\\~100x) The company would literally have a monopoly over mass rapid-covid testing in North America and finalize deals with the organizations it's currently talking to.\n\nNext, in order to determine a \"worst-case scenario,\" it is important to analyze other companies' performances after \"low accuracy\" results come out.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, Sparta Capital LTD was approved by Health Canada - with their official accuracy in the **70%** range (low accuracy). This stock blew up **283%** the DAY AFTER. (From 0.06 - 0.23ish.)\n\nThe worst-case scenario I see is that $TEST will have similar official accuracy, and even if it does, it may still result in tendies for the Reddit boys. (Extremely unlikely to have those levels of accuracy though imo.)\n\nIf accuracy is good, conservative estimate of **$10** by July.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n\\-First-mover advantage for rapid-covid testing for a **large** number of people.\n\n\\-High inside/institutional ownership post-merger. (\\~66%)\n\n\\-Clinical Trials coming up soon\n\n\\-Loyal shareholders\n\n\\-Monopoly market.\n\n\\-Huge upside!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading! Hopefully, I can help somebody out, anyways, if you really want to know more about the company watch their investor presentation because it'll answer 90% of all the questions you might have!\n\nHere: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAcqwoeyhM0&amp;t=913s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAcqwoeyhM0&amp;t=913s)",

        "selftext": "There are now several trillion dollar companies. The new asset class that didn't exist a few years ago which must not be named here is worth well over a trillion. GME, well fucking GME, Heartz, all that shit. This is the end of a [bull market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp) looks like. The gains during the final stretch are unbelievably high. With the returns from the market recently, it begs the question, is this bull market coming to an end?\n\n## Blow-Off Top\n\nA \u201cblow-off top\u201d is when the price of a stock or general market increases sharply, only to be followed by an as sharp decrease in price.\n\n&gt;*A blow-off top is a chart pattern that shows a steep and rapid increase in a security\u2019s price and trading* [*volume*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp) *followed by a steep and rapid drop in price usually on significant or high volume as well.*  \n[*Investopedia*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blowofftop.asp)\n\nAs a bull market nears its ends, the gains are too good to miss out on. As people buy into the market, fearing they will miss out on gains, it drives the price up to unstable values. Investors who have been in the market long enough, take their profits. As people start to sell and lock in gains, the price drops, causing a frenzy as others try to get their money out before the price goes even lower.\n\n## Why the Current Rally Might End\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 had its longest bull run in history ended in February because of the coronavirus. After a decade of steady gains, things came crashing down in a little over a month. Now the market is back like it never left. The market is up 65% since it bottomed out less than a year ago. *65% return in less than a year!*\n\nThe S&amp;P closed in October at $3,269. It closed the first week of January at $3,824. That is a 16% gain in 2+ months.\n\n[Tesla has been on another level lately](https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/elon-musk-just-became-the-richest-person-6a0675911677). Not only did they [dominate 2020 ](https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/2020-stock-market-review-b736a4ecff67)by returning 700%, the stock was up another 22% in the first week of 2021. How much more steam does this thing have?\n\nAs stock prices keep soaring, when will people start to realize profits? Some may be inclined to take their profits now while others may still in and not want to take their gains until it is too late.\n\nWhen Q4 earnings start getting announced, how will the market fare? Will analysts be happy if companies' top or bottom lines are still too far from pre-pandemic numbers?\n\nWith stocks at all-time highs, it may seem the risk is greater than the reward going into the next few weeks.\n\n## Why The Bull Market Will Likely Continue\n\nWhich of the many reasons do you want to hear first?\n\nI\u2019ll start with the latest from President-elect Joe Biden, as [NBC News said](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/joe-biden-wants-set-aside-deficit-concerns-invest-ailing-u-n1253638),\n\n&gt;\\[Biden\\] favors [setting aside concerns about the federal deficit](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/biden-s-agenda-gets-fighting-chance-after-democrats-capture-senate-n1253305) in order to spend more money to boost the ailing American economy.\n\nThis is on top of the nearly $4 trillion the US government has printed out in stimulus money in 2020. Easy money means easy profits right? As more money has been circulated, it has found its way to the stock market and inflated prices. With more government stimulus coming there is reason to believe the stock market will react the same.\n\nAnd as we know, the stock market looks to the future. What\u2019s in the past doesn\u2019t matter. The millions unemployed, rising coronavirus cases, growing debt, potential inflation, or slowing global growth is history. We have vaccines now. The end is in sight.\n\nThe news of vaccines and thoughts of a \u201cnormal\u201d society in the [second half of 2021](https://medium.com/technology-hits/why-google-can-be-the-best-performing-tech-stock-of-2021-25dff4a73fc7) is music to investors' ears. With life back to normal and an open economy, people will abandon these record-high saving rates and go back to increased spending, which should benefit companies and therefore stock prices.\n\nNeed a [technical reason](https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/three-technical-indicators-for-beginner-investors-to-know-3d06758e9d82) to think the market is not topping off right now? Look at the chart of the S&amp;P 500 from any time to today. 1 month, 1 year, 1 decade, 1 century. Sure there are some downturns, but it always comes back and sets new records.",

Within the US, their clients include Verizon, T-Mobile, Bell, &amp; IBM.

They recently converted 21 Million shares Series B preferred shares, reducing the float to approximately 60 million shares. They also announced on February 17, that they are debt free.\n\nHere's where things get interesting\n\nLooking at their financials, they are losing money on the bottom line every year, which is pretty common for a tech company, however, their revenue has grown YoY since they first started posting financials in 2017 and they reported 288% growth in revenues last year. Revenues in 2020 were $44 million and they announced yesterday that they are on track to meet their projection of $60.5 million in revenue.\n\nThis means that at the current share price and share structure, their market cap is below their 2021 projections for revenue AND they also announced yesterday that they are anticipating increasing their revenue projections by the end of Q2 through consolidation of their subsidiaries into one entity and through M&amp;A.\n\nAdditionally, they are currently working on beginning field testing a IoT communication platform for the chemical industry and signed an LOI with a prominent Fortune 500 company within the global chemical industry.

DO YOU EVEN MINE BRO? While Cipher might be a newly founded subsidiary, Bitfury is far from. Founded back in 2011, it's probably the youngest blockchain company in the world. In April the same year a bitcoin was worth $1. There was no FOMO, there was no YOLO. Only hopes and dreams of someday buying a pizza for a couple of coins. [https://bitfury.com](https://bitfury.com/)\n\n/\n\nSome facts about The Bitfury Group.\n\n1. \"The Bitfury Group is the world\u2019s leading emerging technologies company. Founded in 2011, our mission is to make the world more secure and trusted through the use of cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, bitcoin and high-performance computing\"\n2. On a hardware level, they provide mining &amp; blockchain equipment, as well as cooling solutions.\n3. The Bitfury Group has offices in London, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Seoul, Dubai and Moscow, and data center operations in the Republic of Georgia, Canada and Norway.\n4. Bitfury Capital supports the growth of blockchain and other emerging technologies through small-scale investment in promising innovations. Currently hold a portfolio of 11 companies. [https://bitfury.com/bitfury-capital](https://bitfury.com/bitfury-capital)  \n\n5. Video of their cooling solution [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J38GhUPGpKE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J38GhUPGpKE)  \n\n\nTake the expertise collected from 2011, instant access to hardware and cutting edge tech. That is where you find the USP for this SPAC. This is not a case of throwing $600M to some random dude who will go shopping for a bunch of RTX 3090s and hook them up in his basement.\n\nWhat have they said about projections?\n\nQ4 2021 - Q1 2022, installed capacity of 445MW. That sounds great. Can they pull it off? Maybe, maybe not. That's the risk-factor in this investment.\n\nIf we compare the capacity with a company that is buzzing lately: Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA). They are currently at a capacity of 100MW today, aiming for 500MW in Q1 2022. They are trading at a valuation of $3.45b. GWAC merge is valued at $2b.\n\n[https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\\_727c6fdf1708c46f599813b40a362293/marathondh/db/184/3127/pdf/MARA+IR+Presentation+-+January+2021.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_727c6fdf1708c46f599813b40a362293/marathondh/db/184/3127/pdf/MARA+IR+Presentation+-+January+2021.pdf)\n\nWith bitcoin price increasing, mining sector on a run I think this is a solid SPAC. Yes you can argue that it is being used for \"the wrong\" reasons (seriously when have the stock market ever followed rules?). I still think it's interesting and it's not taken out of thin air.\n\nShout at me.",

        "selftext": "Hey there folks! Today I want to talk to you about what\u2019s really going on in the stock market and what we should expected next\u2026\n\nSo, in the last couple of weeks, we have seen a very fast correction in the tech heavy Nasdaq [Index](https://imgur.com/aK26hjA) after the bond yields rapidly spiked over 1.5% for the 10y, as a lot of investors kept getting spooked by the employment numbers coming in slightly better than expected, though many important things are still hidden in those numbers.\n\nFor example, last week we saw the US gaining almost 400K jobs, but this barely moved the unemployment [rate](https://imgur.com/7PJTWUA) which still stands at 6.2% (and this doesn\u2019t even include people who just quit searching for jobs). Almost all of the job [gains](https://imgur.com/B3av5gb) were seen in the leisure and hospitality sector, which has started to regain some momentum after it was the most affected by the events of last year, as this sector is still down more than 3.5M jobs since a year ago.\n\nThese past weeks we also [saw](https://imgur.com/yeudkin) jobless claims continuing to go down, with the latest initial jobless claims coming in at the lowest level since last early last year at just over 700K, as the continuing jobless claims also coming in at just over 4.1M.\n\nBut guys, regardless of the jobs &amp; unemployment numbers, the main thing that will keep investors on edge will continue to be treasury [yields](https://imgur.com/rDjy9fO), the interest rates and how this are affected by the inflation [numbers](https://imgur.com/awXUGgw) which are expected to see a huge bump in the next months as we will have very low comps compared to last year when we saw the rona starting to pick up steam.\n\nWe can see [here](https://imgur.com/QbuiSot) the core inflation came lower this month with an increase of just .1% which jolted the stock market and started a recovery after the sell-off in the past weeks.\n\nGiven that tech names &amp; EVs were some of the biggest hit stocks we should also take a quick look at NIO, as the company lost almost half of its value in the past month, dropping from over $66 to just $35 after the big sell off in the past weeks. \n\nNIO\u2019s drop was also amplified probably by the fact that they posted mixed [results](https://imgur.com/t0jRJEW) for the 4th quarter of last year, as they just missed the top line but did manage to post a solid beat on the company\u2019s bottom line, losing just $0.14/share.\n\nInvestors might not have been happy to see a guidance of just 15% above their 4th quarter given the huge valuation and expectations of the company and the huge global chip shortage that will limit NIO\u2019s production capacity to just 7.5K in the 2nd quarter of 2021.\n\nI still have a mixed opinion about NIO\u2019s stock, but after this huge sell-off, it has become more attractive given the continued [growth](https://imgur.com/cI1TNWJ) of sales the company has seen in the last years, while I also believe NIO will remain one of the winners of the EV disruption \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe other stock that I wanted to mention after what has happened in the past weeks is Zoom.\n\nI really like Zoom\u2019s products and I understand the hype of the stock, but I also really believe they will struggle to keep the huge growth rate going, as the company might have seen its peak growth after the massive work-from-home movement in 2020.\n\n[Zoom](https://imgur.com/UygZxJZ) also reported a beat on the top &amp; bottom line and I expect them to continue to have another great first half to start 2021, but after that, the company will have very though comps to go against, which might really put some downward pressure on the stock, especially as more people go back to their workplaces.\n\nYou can see, even the company doesn\u2019t expect the huge growth to continue, with the revenue growth expected to only slightly continue to grow during 2021.\n\nZoom is valued at almost $100B which is really hard to justify unless the company continues to innovate and bring more &amp; more products to the market, as the industry they operate in will only become more competitive over time with other big players like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce &amp; many others looking to take market share.\n\nGuys, if you are still in doubt about what to do next in the stock market, you should just take a look at the chart below and start thinking long term, because investing, if you are really looking to make money is all about the long-term.\n\nYou can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/ZlO593t) in the past 100 years we've had 8 bear markets previous to the one we saw in 2020, with the average bear market lasting just 1.4years compared to over 9 years for every bull market with a staggering difference in gains vs losses as well \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nWe can also see in this [chart](https://imgur.com/wM39iSQ) that it only took 15 days for the Nasdaq to enter a 10% correction this time, but you can see the average 12 month return after a 10% correction is almost 30% which is huge, with the likelihood of the index posting a positive return in the next 12 months standing at over 90%\n\nSo, given that we had a bear market last year, I believe it\u2019s highly unlikely that we will see a huge drop in stocks even if yields continue to rise, as the real return of the treasury yields will continue to be close to 0, as I don\u2019t expect them to jump more than 2% for the 10y anytime soon.\n\nMoving on, I recently saw some [comments](https://imgur.com/I3ijkKT) made by David Tepper which I wasn\u2019t really aware of but which made a lot of sense to me, he highlighted that the other downward pressure put on treasury yields, which will keep them in check, will come from investors in other countries like Japan, Germany &amp; many others, as the US treasuries have become way more attractive than others.\n\nOne other thing that I think should be mentioned is that the [Dow Jones](https://imgur.com/undefined) has continued to make new high after new high in the past week, being led by companies like Disney which has just surpassed 100M [subscribers](https://imgur.com/fCTDNGX) on their Disney+ platform while also getting a boost from their other revenue streams starting to come back online, and of course the stock that has led the DOW in the past week, Boeing, as the [company](https://imgur.com/K6SPGY1) had more sales than cancellations for the first time since November 2019 as the 737 MAX crisis is finally starting to fade away for the company, with even more possible [deals](https://imgur.com/4XYgfs9) likely to close in the next period, as airlines start to have a better view of what the future will bring for them.\n\nFriends, you shouldn\u2019t be scared of stock market corrections or dips as we have [seen](https://imgur.com/74dAwZO) a 10% pullback once every 11 months as you can see, with the frequency of bigger crashes decreasing significantly, but as always, because we are highly emotional beings, it\u2019s very hard for us to handle our emotions after a series of red days. \n\nYou should remember though, most often than not, the best way to go is just to ride out the dip and even starting deploying more cash into the stock market the more it drops. I think you should develop a strategy of not selling on big red days and deploying an increasingly higher % of your cash into great stocks the more the stock market drops.\n\nI also fully expect some part of the next stimulus check, which was just signed by Biden, to end up in the stock market, which might help push the stock market on the right path despite increasing pressures from rising yields and possible short-term inflation fears.\n\n**So just to end this post guys, is the stock market going to crash? My short answer is NO!\ud83d\ude80**\n\nI don\u2019t expect that to happen any time soon. Even if we continue to see volatility in the stock market you should use that to your advantage and smartly deploy cash into great companies, which leads me to my other question, should you buy stocks today? Well, at the moment of writing this post, futures are currently trending down pre-market (SP &amp; Nasdaq in the Red, Dow +0.2%) and If they continue to do so it might be a good chance to deploy some cash, but don\u2019t rush into the first red day you see, slowly build your positions or add to them. As a rule of thumb, I like to buy more once a 5% dip occurs in the stock market and slowly deploy cash the more it drops \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "Stocks fell on Tuesday, after the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow (DIA) set fresh records yesterday, as market participants digested a weaker-than-expected report on retail, rising Treasury yields, and looked ahead to a Federal Reserve policy meeting later this week. \n\nRetail sales fell 3% in February from January, the Commerce Department said, worse than the 0.7% decline economists polled by FactSet expected. However, many analysts blamed bad weather and expect incoming stimulus checks to cause retail sales to spike.\n\nLast week, after months of negotiations, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package was signed into law by President Biden this week. The bill, called the American Rescue Plan (ARP), includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The passage of the bill came exactly one year after the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.\n\nWashington\u2019s aggressive spending spree during the pandemic, combined with an increased pace of vaccinations, accommodative monetary policy, and the impending reopening of the economy have pushed estimates for growth higher while also fueling inflationary fears. At the time of writing, the Treasury yield sits at 1.606%. \n\nIn light of rising Treasury yields, market participants are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting on Wednesday, where the Central Bank is widely expected to reiterate its commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy while the economic recovery gains momentum. \n\nWith large amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus supporting economic activity, analysts at BlackRock are anticipating \"a much stronger post-COVID economic restart than what we would expect in a normal recovery. The rapid upward adjustment in U.S. Treasury yields and more muted movement in inflation-adjusted yields make sense in this respect, and are still consistent with our new nominal theme of higher prices and government liquidity.\u201d\n\nSeveral countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca\u2019s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Ireland being the latest. A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said at a briefing that an advisory committee was investigating reports of individuals falling ill or dying after developing blood clots in the post-vaccination period, but that no causal link had been established. Germany, France, Italy and Spain became the latest countries Monday to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union\u2019s vaccination effort, which were already behind schedule.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Facebook (FB) said Tuesday it plans to offer a free, customizable publishing tool that allows users to develop websites and email newsletters as well as charge for subscriptions. \n* After hitting a low of more than 20% down, Gamestop (GME) stock largely recovered to finish only modestly red. \n* AMC fell around 7% at the time of writing after Citigroup analyst Jason Bazinet reiterated his Sell rating on the stock, with a $2 price target. AMC theaters are set to reopen in Los Angeles, a key market, this week.\n* Volkswagen\u2019s (VWAGY) stock is soaring after recent news that the company is making a push to become the market leader in electric vehicles in Europe. The company recently announced plans to build 6 factories to produce EVs by 2030. \n* Alaska, Florida, Montana, Nevada, and Puerto Rico have joined a lawsuit filed by Texas and others against Google, which accuse it of breaking antitrust law to boost its already dominant online advertising business, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said on Tuesday.\n* Chinese TikTok-owner ByteDance is making plans to develop semiconductors, according to the company's job postings and a source familiar with the situation. The plan is still at an early stage and the company's focus is on Arm-based server-side chips, the person told Reuters.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes\\*\\***\n* DraftKings (DKNG) with three target raises.

        "selftext": "The biggest story this month in mainstream finance media was the sudden spike in the interest rate for 10 year US government bonds and the effect it was having on the stock market. In this edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we\u2019ll be taking a look at why the 10-year interest rate is important, how it has led to rising asset prices over the past few decades (i.e. creating an asset bubble), and how GME is involved with all of this.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\nThis DDDD recycles a bit of content from some other DDDDs I\u2019ve previously posted, connecting the dots between some of the other topics covered in them; so if you\u2019re especially bored and want to learn more about things talked about in this post, check them out!\n\n[The 2010-2020 Liquidity-Fueled Asset Bubble](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/)\n\n[Cycles &amp; Human History](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqgwfg/dddd_cycles_and_human_history/)\n\n[Ray Dalio\u2019s Thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhrkwu/a_smooth_brained_guide_to_ray_dalios_thesis/)\n\n**What is the 10-year US treasury and why is the yield so important?**\n\nThe 10 year treasury is an IOU sold by the US government when it needs to borrow money, promising to pay it back in 10 years with regular interest payment in the meantime. They auction off these bonds to the highest bidder, and the price that these bonds get sold off at determines the yield of these bonds. In finance, US bonds are considered to be a risk-free asset, since it\u2019s the safest possible investment anyone can make (at least in theory). Because of this, the 10 year US bond yield is considered to be the \u201crisk free rate\u201d for any long-term investments and acts as gravity towards any other riskier investments.\n\n**Why does the 10-year affect the price of every other asset?**\n\nAs a rule of thumb, the riskier an asset is, the higher return (or yield) that asset will need to provide. For things like bonds, are pretty straight-forward - it\u2019s the yield, or effective interest rate that bond provides. For things like equities (stocks), it\u2019s a bit more complicated. As a hand-wavy approach, a lot of people use Earnings, so let\u2019s go with that. % return demanded by investors = earnings / price, meaning price is inversely proportional to % return, or **if % return demanded \ud83d\udcc8 price \ud83d\udcc9** **and vice versa**.\n\nThis is how the treasury yields affect the price of literally everything else (except GME), from real estate to SPY. Suppose that JPow decided overnight that he changed his mind and managed to pump up the 10-year rate to 10%, which is where it was at for most of the 1980s. Compared to SPY, which is maybe giving you a return of 2.5% (based on the current PE ratio of 40), any \ud83e\udd8d with more than two brain cells can figure out the better deal. So everyone sells their SPY and loads up on treasuries until SPY drops enough (i.e. falls 75%) to at very least match the return of the 10-year, and likely even more due to the increased risk and volatility (risk premium).\n\n[S&amp;P 500 Earnings Yield vs. 10Y Treasury Yield](https://preview.redd.it/pg68b4n39hm61.png?width=1450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=457e43c3379aa0cef7424de824904d2c8f66e556)\n\nThere\u2019s several other mechanisms that this rate affects various asset prices as well\n\n1. Housing prices - For the same reasons, a rise in the 10-year = a rise in mortgage rates. So if the prime mortgage rate doubles from 3% (today) to 6%, to buy the same $250K house, a 30-year mortgage will go from a $1000 monthly payment to a $1500 monthly payment, which might be more than what people looking at $250K houses can afford. This would thus cause a decline in housing prices until the people who would\u2019ve previously bought those houses can afford it again.\n2. Stock buybacks - A low 10-year = low corporate bond yields = incentivizes businesses to take on the cheap debt, even if they don\u2019t need it. What do they do with that excess capital? Usually, stock buybacks or dividend payments, which drives up their own stock prices - something executives are especially incentivized to do since their compensation is usually tied to stock price performance. What happens when the 10-year and corporate bond interest rates go back up? Those companies who took on a bunch of debt probably won\u2019t refinance their bonds when they expire, and will need to divert their resources from dividend and stock buybacks to paying down their debt, possibly even issuing more shares to raise capital to pay it back, lowering their stock price.\n3. Leverage - Treasury rates set the bar for the lowest interest rates someone can borrow at, including hedge funds to borrow cash to buy stocks on margin. To dumb it down, if a hedge fund finds some combination of trades that yield a 5% return with low risk and can borrow from their broker at 2%, they could lever up 10x (theyre not subject to the 2x leverage limit retail investors have) and get a 50% return while paying 20% in interest. What happens when treasury rates go up, causing their interest rates they pay to their brokerage go up? They sell those holdings, and since most funds are net-bullish on the market, this usually means a mass sell-off in the stock market.\n\n**How the Fed controls the 10-year yield**\n\nThe Fed\u2019s official mission is to\n\n1. Ensure price stability, this usually means that they target a 2% inflation rate\n2. Try to achieve \u201cfull employment\u201d, which is basically the lowest unemployment rate that's practically achievable\n\nThey achieve this through two mechanisms.\n\n1. The Fed Funds Rate - This is what they use during normal times. This is basically the interest rates the banks within the Federal Reserve System lends to each other overnight, which they can set a ceiling and floor to by establishing a rate that any bank can borrow or lend the Fed at any time\n2. Quantitative Easing / Tightening - This is an unconventional tool they usually resort to once the Fed Funds Rate reaches zero (for Easing) to further stimulate the economy to further pump liquidity by directly buying Treasuries / government bonds, and sometimes other assets like Mortgage Backed Securities and Corporate Bonds.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious from above how the Fed can affect the 10-year note, especially with quantitative easing, where they might directly buy it, causing the price to decrease from an increased demand and reducing the yield as a result.\n\n**What Happened Last Week**\n\nSo what happened with the 10-year yield last week? It **\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf1d**, which for reasons mentioned above, means that everything else **\ud83d\udcc9.**\n\n[10Y Treasury Yield, Daily](https://preview.redd.it/luroj2b79hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ad89ea67d4e86e555d39008d51d5cdc8fa8ec0d)\n\n*Why did the 10-year yield* ***\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf1d***\\*?\\*\n\nBasically, there was a lot of speculation recently that we might see inflation as the economy opens up.\n\n*Why does the economy reopening = inflation?*\n\nThere\u2019s this macroeconomic theory called the Quantity Theory of Money - ***MV = PQ***, where M is the quantity of Money in the system, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the GDP. A rise in P = inflation.\n\nIn this equation, the key variable is the velocity of money, which is the speed at which money circulates in an economy, or in other words, how fast consumers will spend a dollar once they earn it. Interestingly enough, ever since the 2000s, and especially after the 2008 recession, velocity of money has been steadily declining, mostly due to rising income inequality as richer people tend to spend money less quickly than poorer people who might be living paycheck to paycheck. However, when COVID hit, it really \ud83d\udcc9 fast.\u200b\n\n[Velocity of M2 Money](https://preview.redd.it/j7mi0ed99hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34d61275d0dc17bfbd82e6a16c3dc7beb1751a0e)\n\nSo with Q (GDP) and M (Money Supply) being equal, this would generally mean P going down as well, or in other words, deflation - the Fed\u2019s worst nightmare. How do central banks combat this? By increasing M proportionally to the decrease in V.\n\n[M2 Money Stock](https://preview.redd.it/hdg62w7b9hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78de5d86fb81951af79939159662a0a442dc28dc)\n\n*By what mechanism does the Fed increase M?*\n\nUsing the two mechanisms described above. Right when COVID hit, they immediately dropped the Fed Funds Rate to 0. They quickly realized that wasn\u2019t enough, and started buying government and corporate bonds on-mass until they were confident it would prevent deflation. This has the side-effect of decreasing the 10-year yield, and making all other assets go up. If you look closely, though you\u2019ll see that they really turned off the printing press after the summer.\n\nSo, what happens when the economy opens back up? V goes up, maybe back to normal. So the Fed has two options according to the Quantity Theory of Money\n\n1. Let M (money supply) stay where it is. This means that P will go up, or in other words, inflation\n2. Prevent inflation by decreasing M. This will have the opposite effect of what was described above, and sending the 10-year yields \ud83d\udcc8 and all asset prices **\ud83d\udcc9**\n\n[Fed Balance Sheet](https://preview.redd.it/h9buyb8g9hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33fe1010414625a0fa585b18d144d4a396ec86ee)\n\n*What did JPowell say?*\n\nHe basically confirmed what everyone was thinking - **inflation is coming**. However, he did say that he was comfortable letting inflation go above its 2% target until jobs recover and the Fed achieves its second mandate - full employment.\n\n*Why did what he say cause yields to go up regardless?*\n\nBasically, people were expecting him to announce that he was going to turn the money printer back on and increase the number of treasury purchases to force the 10-year yield back down. He did not do that, which indicates that he\u2019s changing his stance to actually try to be careful to not overheat the economy, and that he might actually be worried about inflation since he went against what the entire market assumed he would do, and priced in to do.\n\nAt very least, this means that we probably shouldn\u2019t be counting on the Fed\u2019s money printer continuously driving up asset prices anytime soon. In the medium term, if inflation does get bad enough, it shows at least some willingness from the Fed that they may actually intervene and decrease the money supply - causing everything else to crash alongside it. Will it happen? Well that depends on how bad this inflation gets, and how bad the Fed is willing to stand by and watch it happen until they do something.\n\n**Why I am a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b in the medium term**\n\nThe re-opening might force the Fed to do something that they haven\u2019t done in a very long time - quantitative tightening.\n\n[Velocity of M2 Money](https://preview.redd.it/8p3hqx7i9hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=205278bd73362c102770641b4f54c38d51543133)\n\n[CPI Inflation Rate](https://preview.redd.it/yrhmwgri9hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dfb5226811e57354406cc24bcd51b34d685c882)\n\n[Fed Funds Rate](https://preview.redd.it/yu9fv9aj9hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5c7370b4d7999b623f05b65e5e789b21511e764)\n\n[3 Month Treasury Yield](https://preview.redd.it/1rsq9aqj9hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=779e5c7ed33361b74878209a80dc2fa41c849834)\n\n[10Y Treasury Yield](https://preview.redd.it/arepvz9k9hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=280e9c6de172228942c2a790a35baea3b3ec547b)\n\n[S&amp;P 500 Shiller PE Ratio](https://preview.redd.it/hi6hz5uk9hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2d019a99e2b2f52df0cf4941fb4015a673a9652)\n\n[Rent to Housing Price Ratio](https://preview.redd.it/aexotxbl9hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0eac41c1f1b2c0f9e11284b9459b19804d03949)\n\n[Hedge Fund Gross Leverage](https://preview.redd.it/0jjgz0wl9hm61.png?width=1448&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f583482a4f461048f961e89158a1413121de37c2)\n\nIf you look closely at these charts, you can put yourself in the shoes of the Fed and see why stonks only went \ud83d\udcc8 in the past decade.\n\n* The 2008 recession caused a permanent decline in velocity of money that has never actually really recovered - likely due to the increased income inequality that never reversed since then\n* Decreased velocity of money = decreased P, or deflation, in the long term with all things equal\n* To avoid this, the Fed drops the Fed Funds rate to 0, followed by quantitative easing on treasuries, dropping their yield as well, to increase the money supply to keep the inflation rate near their target\n* Since velocity of money never really recovered, they just left the money they pumped in and the low interest rates they set at the 2008 recession there and barely touched it until 2017, where they slowly raised it until they abruptly stopped in 2018 - we\u2019ll get to what happened when they did that in a bit\n* With all this extra liquidity in the system keeping the 10-year low, when the economy did eventually recover from the 2008 recession, all asset prices, including the stock market and real estate prices **\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf1d** for virtually every year - except for 2018 - we\u2019ll also get to that in a bit\n\n**What Happened in 2018?**\n\n[SPY, near 2018](https://preview.redd.it/efjhgufw9hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e99c92f0e9f22bf26f2f8bf17e9c740021b6c27)\n\n[Fed Funds Rate, near 2018](https://preview.redd.it/woz6w4ww9hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e539f1f4ef0ea0a96a90e0c59dd766b603087ff1)\n\nThroughout 2017, but especially in 2018, the Fed finally decided to slowly start increasing the Fed Funds rate back up from basically 0%, almost 10 years after the 2008 recession; the first quantitative tightening we\u2019ve since then. So, what happened in 2018? First, the [yield curve inverted](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/the-us-bond-yield-curve-has-inverted-heres-what-it-means.html) (meaning the 10 year yield fell below the 3 month yield), possibly the most reliable forward indicator of an oncoming recession - in the past 50 years, every recession has happened within 2 years of a yield curve inversion, and every yield curve inversion has been followed by a recession within 2 years except for one false positive. This is usually a signal of lack of confidence in investors in asset prices, which in turn caused the stock market to crash, leading to one of the only &gt;1% decline year in the S&amp;P500 since 2009.\n\nSo my thesis for is that in the next few years, one of the following must happen\n\n* Velocity of Money never recovers to pre-COVID levels. TBH this is probably the best case scenario for the stock market, but is probably REALLY bad for the economy. The only way for this to really happen is we remain in a K-shaped recovery, where we continue to have high-unemployment for lower paying jobs and high income inequality\n* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, the Fed either continues quantitative easing or does not do quantitative tightening. This will eventually lead to inflation well above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. JPowell has shown so far that although he would accept this temporarily without doing any action but left the door open for quantitative tightening if he sees sustained over-inflation, which is possible (and imo likely) given the amount of money pumped into the economy over the year + how much the velocity of money dropped last year.\n* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, and the Fed decides to do some sort of quantitative tightening in the medium term after seeing sustained over-inflation. If this happens, we will find out how much of the last decade\u2019s stock market gains were from real productivity increases, and how much of it was from the Fed\u2019s monetary policy.\n\n*What do I think? Short term, anything can happen so no I'm not buying SPY puts again. I am, however, not going long on anything outside of a 6 month time frame. Why? Ask yourself this - what do you really think has been the primary driver of the stock market's rise over the past decade: Fundamental economic growth? Or is it the Fed's money printing. Now, ask yourself, how long can that driver keep going for? The money printer was on overdrive the past few months to compensate for COVID; how long could this last until we see inflation and it forces JPowell to turn off the printer?*\n\n***TLDR; Stonks only go \ud83d\udcc8 if you have the Fed on your side. If the Fed ever decides (or needs to) changes sides, bulls r fucked***\n\n**Why GME \ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf1d when everything else \ud83d\udcc9**\n\nNot really related to the thesis, and [I briefly talked about this a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/), but it seems to be what everyone talks about nowadays so I guess I\u2019ll talk about this too. I\u2019m sure some of y\u2019all have noticed that every time every other stock goes down, GME usually \ud83d\udcc8 and vice versa, and especially wrinkly brained ape [did the math](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lteecj/gme_may_have_the_potential_to_dictate_the_course/) and found a statistically significant inverse correlation between GME and the rest of the stock market. Why is that? Well, in short\n\n1. Virtually nobody buying GME now is doing so because of earnings yield / they did a DCF on the company and thought that it was undervalued at $50 based on future cash flows, so the 10-year yield increasing is meaningless to them\n2. Institutions / Hedge Funds that are on the other side of the trade need to de-gross their books whenever the stock market goes down. In short, some hedge funds tend to take an insane amount of leverage (eg. the mean gross leverage of a hedge fund is around 8x right now). They can do this because their \u201cnet exposure\u201d, which is their long exposure - short exposure is much lower, and isn\u2019t as risky because they are \u201chedged\u201d vs. market conditions. Gross exposure, on the other hand, is the total value of long and short positions they hold. So, if they sell off a long position, they need to sell a short position if they\u2019ve levered up in this way, and vice versa. It\u2019s pretty well known that hedge funds love big tech stocks and like shorting AMC and GME. So, if they exit out of their tech / growth longs to reduce their gross leverage, they\u2019ll also need to cover their GME shorts as well.\n\n*PS - This will probably be my final DDDD, at least for a while. I'll be back when shit starts to get crazy / interesting again.*",

IT IS JUST A WAY OF ATTACKING THE WEALTHY\".** Don't focus on *what* he said, focus on *why* he said it - He does not see us as his equals - what we are and what he is (the wealthy) are 2 separate things - **OPPOSITE THINGS.** We are the poor and he is the wealthy. It is not OK for the poor to ask for their fair share - IT MUST REMAIN UNFAIR. THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN UNFAIR THE WHOLE TIME. I consider him a canary in a mine shaft - when he makes noise something is up - **I think I can actually win.**\n3. Robinhood and the young Bulgarian boy - Since when has anyone ever gave a fuck about any bodies financial situation or future/protecting their wealth? Honestly think about it, since when has any random stranger out of the kindness of their heart wanted to give you or protect your chicken tendies? NEVER. Is this the first stock ever in the existence of humanity to have buying RESTRICTED to \"protect\" us? I haven't been investing long, I am an expert at being poor but I do know liars and scams. **Why didn't they restrict other shares?** Some stocks shoot 100% in day without any restriction, only to plummet a few days later and nothing happened. No media coverage or PSA - **It is because these were co-ordinated pump and dumps buy hedge funds - apparently those are ok -** **it is only OK when HF make money not us.** How many of the retail investors that they were trying to protect had been a victim of a pump and dump? Some brokers didn't restrict anything **AND THAT IS WHY THE BULK OF PEOPLE MOVED ON FROM ROBINHOOD TO THEM CONGRATULATIONS, YOU PLAYED YOURSELF.** *BALLSY MOVE STILL GOING FORWARD WITH AN IPO* which by the way has been changed from public to private *(to prevent me shorting it I assume*) furthermore, their app was bombarded with 1 star reviews. *(I started to respect and love this community for that response)* Google had to step in and delete 1000's of reviews (WATCH YOUR STEP GOOGLE PEOPLE DO NOT FORGET). Have you guys seen Melvin Capitals reviews too btw? 1.6 star courtesy of disgruntled apes (LOVE IT) **I was starting to build a lead and they blatantly just cheated.** That is why there are 50 law suits against Robinhood, even that guy from Independent Brokers said if RH didn't halt trading the price would have been in the thousands. **$1000's was mentioned, I am sitting on a potential fortune.**\n4. The hearing - I learnt \"I am reclaiming my time\" is a very eloquent and professional way of saying shut up. Vlad, no one cares about what Robinhood stands for, your childhood or Bulgaria (no offence Bulgaria) just answer the question. I roared with laughter when that guy said \"you should consider a career in politics\" due to your inability to answer clearly, and when you squirmed at the end and said \"I admit to always improving\" you became a national laughing stock. Now you're hiding in a hotel room because you got death threats. Ken, do you always need an entourage with a teleprompter? Normal people do not do that, you're looking very guilty. Gabe, I do not believe you closed your positions, in fact I expected you to say that. Who's still shorting GME then? It was you but now it's not? DOMO Capital has called you out to reveal your books for February to Congresswoman Maxine Waters. **Should be no issue if you are telling the truth?** Awfully convenient that SLV got pumped and dumped and your lot had the 5th largest stake in it. Since you lot act like shifty bastards and I know you are lying **my confidence has been bolstered.**\n5. Jim Cramer - I saw that video you made bragging how satisfying it is to short stocks and manipulate the market. Calling up media outlets to give false info e.g How you said with Apple, AT&amp;T and Verizon? Spread lies to make the price go down? Market manipulation is illegal and you claim it is satisfying to do, you even encourage it \"You shouldn't be in the game\" I have the video saved on my laptop. Thanks for explaining what is going on right now, it has been extremely insightful. I will reupload it if it ever goes missing. You said the SEC doesn't know what they are doing or how to stop you. You also suckered that poor man who asked if he should get out of Bear Sterns (Thank you for correcting me BADrop) You told him to leave his money and it crashed 6 days later. **He lost all his money, and I KNOW you made some**. Is it true you also said they should give us all 200USD a share for GME and be done with it? Why would a person like yourself want to help a complete stranger like me? You cheated that guy with Bear Sterns yet want to give me a hand out? You changed your ways and were reborn again as the saviour of the little guy? Truth is, it is not a hand out - it is a settlement to get off the hook. A pitiful one at that. I will hold till 100K USD. **But I find value in your poor character Jim.** You are my moral compass in this whole saga Jim - whatever you say - I will do the complete opposite, thank you for helping me in this quest of mine for financial freedom.\n6. MSM - Mainstream media. I never liked you to begin with and now seeing that you are puppets to the hedge fund overlords is no surprise. You're like that friend every teenager has that lies to be cool, gain acceptance and has zero integrity. When GME is going bad you cover it so well and thoroughly (as you should) however on the flip, when it is doing good you either remain suspiciously quiet or you try to derail things. Plus you are homies with Jim Cramer so guess what? You are my moral compass also. **Whatever you say I will do the opposite and I was RIGHT!** SILVER was a distraction. Citadel has a large stake - a fellow ape told me and I checked. ROKT has plummeted today 3/3/2021. I didn't fall for your trick. **I also suspiciously see that despite the plummet only ROKT gain porn is shown on WSB not ROKT loss porn.** Why? If you made money congratulations. WSB... has been infiltrated and is becoming possessed by the hedge fund devils. I can't believe ROKT once had a mega thread on WSB which was soon replaced with a pic of a cat. [https://www.removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets](https://www.removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets) PRO GME posts were removed. People have been getting banned for not following hedge fund agenda. Shills are privately messaging redditors under the facade of concern to abandon their positions. I will admit that I made a loss following the weed-stock-hedge-fund-orchestrated hype. I should have taken my wins but got greedy. **Holding onto my moon tickets even tighter now.**\n7. DD - There are some clever apes on reddit I call them Prime Apes. I have learnt so much about the stock market, this community has brought me laughter and knowledge. **Never invest what you can't afford to lose and set some aside for the tax man. The stock market is actually a casino (to me anyway). I will never make money watching graphs and analysing data because all it will take is some hedge fund to come along and short sell my positions.** I know to invest in the deep value of a company and then diamond hand that position. Just like I would in a casino. The DD is much better than anything my incompetent self can muster and for that I say thank you. I also read the comments and counter arguments because I am unbiased and want to see the theory faulted. I look at the graphs and see volume *not* corresponding with price. Price dips but volume is low? I see the patterns with short ladder attacks. The short sales with 3 decimal points are HF moves and I ultimately think to myself how the fuck can something be short sold over 100%? How can you over 100% anything? **When I see the price dip I think buy more.** Hedge funds are desperately trying to keep the price low and prevent the launch. **BUT are having minimal success because apes are diamond handing. (LOVE)** Where there is smoke there is fire, and the fire is underneath the hedge funds greedy, 2008 crash causing, retirement destroying, dream killing asses. I have been poor and un-privledged my whole life, the reality I am experiencing now is what I am accustomed to. **Before I wanted to make a few bucks but now it is mansion or wet cardboard box. I will hold this position with any ape who chooses to hold.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion TLDR**\n\nNo matter what new and inventive tricks the HF play I will not sell unless I get 100K USD a share. **My moneys fate was sealed the moment I clicked buy.** *If it dips I will celebrate* by liquidating other positions to buy more GME. I do not believe I can lose, if I lose then I will never ever invest in the US stock market again or trust the US government. Either I get paid or I hold until Ryan Cohen turns GME into something special. **Gaming is a multi billion dollar industry and Game stop is in a position for rapid expansion with or without a squeeze.** *If it squeezes and the apes go to the moon, I will return to Earth to buy game stock.* If it doesn't squeeze I will hold game stop - because I want to be known as the guy that got in XX @ 138 and it is now worth $1500 a share. I really can be retarded longer than they can stay solvent. **I have not attached the moon launch to a specific date, even though it is well supported and substantiated e.g (MAR 19)** it still could not happen. *But one thing I think we can universally agree on is a MOASS is bound to happen*. This horrid game hedge funds have been playing is going to implode, projecting me and the brave apes holding beside me to financial freedom.\n\nEDIT: For grammar and missing points. Forgot to mention **I also recently recruited someone I and other diamond handed apes can fully trust to hold the line. They are 16 @ 111.**",

        "selftext": "Sup dudes,\n\nNot sure if you herd of the Senseonics holdings (SENS) before. This is going to be a monster of a company very soon, SENS is in the CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring System) it basically is machine that diabetics use to monitor their glucose? I honest am not an expert on diabetes so I'm not going to pretend I am one.\n\nThis basically sums up what a CGM is\n\n[https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/managing-diabetes/continuous-glucose-monitoring](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/managing-diabetes/continuous-glucose-monitoring)\n\nWhat I do know about this company is some research I have done and also I have looked closely at their competition in the sector.\n\nSo the biggest competitor in this space is DexCom I believe they are number #1 in this sector (Correct me if I'm wrong) DXCM market cap is at 35.27B as of now, and their stock is at $366 right as of now but usually they sit around +$400\n\nDXCM CGM product is called Dexcom G6 CGM\n\n[https://www.dexcom.com/en-CA/en-ca-dexcom-g6-cgm-system](https://www.dexcom.com/en-CA/en-ca-dexcom-g6-cgm-system)\n\nSo this CGM you wear just underneath your surface of your skin. The sensor last for 10-14 days then it needs to replaced with a new sensor, here is a video showing it how it works to replace.\n\n[https://youtu.be/OJPYNp0a7d8](https://youtu.be/OJPYNp0a7d8)\n\nThe CGM business must be booming because this DXCM company is so freaking baller now, that they had enough money to hire a Nick Jonas to be a in a freaking super bowl commercial. I must repeat that again... NICK!! FREAKING!! JONAS!! on a SUPER!! BOWL!! COMMERICAL!! that lasted about 3:00mins. Why is this so important? Because those seconds you need to pay to have a commercial on the super bowl makes paying for the most expensive escort covered in caviar while you are doing 100% pure cocaine seem cheap.\n\n[https://youtu.be/zN8naTqX3TI](https://youtu.be/zN8naTqX3TI)\n\nBut anyways enough about cocaine, caviar hookers, and DXCM, I want to talk about SENS now and how I think they are going to be one of the biggest players in the CGM sector with a different approach.\n\n[https://www.eversensediabetes.com/](https://www.eversensediabetes.com/)\n\nSENS CGM product is called Eversense. Obviously like I said I'm not a diabetic or a diabetic expert but this is the DD I have done on this stock.\n\nEversense is the only CGM that last 90 days\n\nEversense XL which last 180 days (This is already approved in Europe and is waiting FDA Approval in US)\n\nEversense 365 days is in clinical study right now\n\nOther things that I have done reading forums and comments about people experiences using this devices are:\n\n1. Eversense CGM sensor is removable unlike the other devices which has to be on there for the full 14 days before replacing to a new one. Why is this important? Imagine jerking off really hard then having a cum explosion and jizzing on your CGM sensor device. Sounds like a pretty shitty situation right? Well insurance companies are going to make it worse. Why does this matter? Because insurance companies are only going to cover the days that you need the device, if you fuck it up or something goes wrong you are going to have to pay for a extra device to replace because insurance only covers you for those days. Now with Eversense you can take off the device anytime you want, Eversense includes a lot of adhesive pads that you can just replace if something happens. So you can jizz on yourself or have people jizz on you and it wouldn't be a problem because you can just wash it off and get a new adhesive pad.\n2. Traveling seem like it was a big problem with with devices like Dexcom G6 because a month supply of Dexcom G6 would take up a lot of room on your luggage, VS Eversense which you can carry a months supply in a very small amount of space. All you needed with Eversense is adhesive pads vs Dexcom you need to have the machine to replace everytime.\n3. More active life styles it seems like Eversense is the clear winner because you can remove it then put it back on.\n4. But not all things were good about Eversense I reading some people said that having the operation is really annoying every 90 days, because there were very few places you could get this operation done. But once the 180 days and 365 days sensor it is going to make a huge difference in going to get the procedure done.\n5. Another thing people were saying that Eversense was annoying was that you still had to prick you fingers twice a day to calibrate you Eversense device. But from my DD the 180 days will be 1 prick every few days, and the 365 day will be 1 prick every week.\n\nEversense also uses some high tech material shit that the sensor that is implanted under your skin is some kinda bio material which doesn't cause inflammation and helps with the scarring as well. But some people were still saying that the 90 every time to replace the sensor it still leaves a scar, but I would love to see when the 180 and 365 day comes out will it really help with the scarring and any kind of these problems.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4lepb2t4nE&amp;t=99s&amp;ab\\_channel=EversenseCGM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4lepb2t4nE&amp;t=99s&amp;ab_channel=EversenseCGM)\n\nNow on the the $$$$ Part of the DD\n\nIMO I think this device is going to end up saving a lot of money for the user, insurance companies, and create less waste in the world.\n\nHow is it going to save insurance companies you say?\n\nDexcom G6\n\nTransmitter $300 for every 90 days = $5040 year\n\nSensors $420 for a 30 day supply = $1200 year\n\n=Total $6240\n\nEversense\n\n$1400 for transmitter for 90 days =$5600 year\n\nEversense Bridge program limits the cost the $99 plus insertion\n\nInsertion for machine = not sure\n\nNow this doesn't account for the fuck ups of having to switch out the Dexcom G6 sensor before the 14 day date.\n\nThe price difference between for the machines is $640 now calculate that with the amount of people just in the US that has diabetes.\n\n\" In 2018, 34.2 million Americans, or 10.5% of the population, had diabetes \"\n\nThis is a statistic I found on [https://www.diabetes.org/resources/statistics/statistics-about-diabetes#:\\~:text=Overall%20numbers,of%20the%20population%2C%20had%20diabetes.&amp;text=Undiagnosed%3A%20Of%20the%2034.2%20million,and%207.3%20million%20were%20undiagnosed](https://www.diabetes.org/resources/statistics/statistics-about-diabetes#:~:text=Overall%20numbers,of%20the%20population%2C%20had%20diabetes.&amp;text=Undiagnosed%3A%20Of%20the%2034.2%20million,and%207.3%20million%20were%20undiagnosed).\n\nSo $640 x 34,000 000 = $21,760 000 000!! That's a lot of freaking money saved for insurance companies, but also I would like to say I'm not an insurance company expert. Like do insurance companies make more money selling you more shit? I obviously also know that not every diabetic in US uses this machine I'm just doing a rough estimate.\n\nI would also like to add that Eversense will save a lot of plastic waste that will be going into the Landfill. Why is this important because we need to take care of our freaking planet!! Just think about it every year 26 of these CGM replacements will end up in the landfill or who knows. If everyone in the US that had diabetes and used Dexcom G6, that is 884, 000 000 pieces of replacement CGM. That's a whole lot of waste right there, you could end up building a freaking house.\n\nAlso last but not least why I believe SENS is going to the moon, is because how heavily this stock is being shorted right now. Why is short interest important? Because of how hott messing with the shorts is right now, look at other shorted stocks and how badly the shorts are getting ownd.\n\nSENS short % of float right now is 50.87%!!!\n\nAnd if you look at the total shares from Dec - Feb the shares went from 23,860,000 to 69,420,000 OK wait a freaking minute here.... OK I DIDNT EVEN SEE THIS BEFORE WTF!!! 69,420,00 SHARES REPORTED ON 2/26/2021.. HOLY!! FLYING SHIT I DIDNT EVEN NOTICE THAT!!! HAAHAHHAHAHAHAAHH. GOD dam if this wasn't a sign from the gods before it's def a freaking sign now!!!! Holy crap that's so funny and either a coincidence or some kinda sign.... Anyways I'm def going buy more calls now.\n\nSeriously tho it's at 69,420,000 I can't believe it\n\n[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSEAMERICAN/SENS/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSEAMERICAN/SENS/short-interest/)\n\nAnyways I totally forgot the rest of what I wanted to throw down after I noticed the short was at 69,420,000\n\nMy positions are:\n\nSENS 7/16/21 $5c\n\nSENS 1/20/23 $10c\n\nGoing to keep buying leaps of this company, once that 180 day and 365 day CGM sensor is out it will be a game changer. I don't see SENS staying at 1.2 billion market cap for very soon. The calls aren't ridiculously expensive I'm not a rich guy and I don't trade with that much $$ so finding these companies with leaps at this price is pretty rare.\n\nCatalysts\n\nMarch 19 SENS presents at H.C Wainwright Global Life Sciences Conference. Basically a pharma orgy of stuff [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senseonics-participate-h-c-wainwright-222900050.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senseonics-participate-h-c-wainwright-222900050.html)\n\nApril 1 is suppose to be the marketing campaign they start with Ascensia Diabetes Care. So maybe we will see some marketing for the Eversense product... Maybe Nick Jonas wants to try Eversense :)\n\n[https://www.senseonics.com/investor-relations/news-releases/2020/08-10-2020-210456046](https://www.senseonics.com/investor-relations/news-releases/2020/08-10-2020-210456046)\n\nThis is DD I put together for this company, feel free to add anything additional information or DD.\n\n\\*Disclaimer, I am not a financial expert these are just my opinion and research on this company.

The company was founded by Ram Chandran, Isaac Eteminan, Anush Gopalan, Jai Kumar, Sudu Srinivasan, and Joakim Wiklund on August 5, 1999 and is headquartered in Austin, TX. \n\nThey are currently selling ruggedized mobile phones and accessories to three of the four largest wireless carriers in the United States \u2014 **AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon** \u2014 as well as the three largest wireless carriers in Canada \u2014**Bell, Rogers and Telus Mobility**.  \n\nTheir phones and accessories connect workers with voice, data and workflow applications in two end markets: industrial enterprise and public sector. Sonim have also implemented dozens of application programming interfaces, or APIs, specific to their mobile phones and have partnered with over 800 application developers to create a purpose-built experience for their end users using these applications on Sonim\u00b4s mobile phones. \n\n**Industrial Enterprise Market Opportunity** \n\nIts estimated that in the United States and Canada in 2018, there were 37.6 million task workers across verticals in industrial enterprise end markets who could benefit from Sonim\u00b4s solutions, including construction, energy and utility, facilities management, manufacturing and transportation and logistics. The extreme durability and enhanced voice and text communication capabilities of their devices enable these workers to be stationed in remote and hazardous environments, while remaining connected to their central command center at all times. \n\n**Public Sector Market Opportunity Mobile** \n\nPhones enable public safety officers to gather real-time information collected across multiple systems and to respond and react to changing circumstances. Following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, Congress, U.S. public safety agencies and other critical infrastructure entities took action to ensure that the mobile phones of first responders remain fully functional and interoperable at all times. \n\nThe establishment of a nationwide public safety broadband network, or FirstNet, in 2017 and other public safety-focused mobile networks has created a significant opportunity for Sonim Technologies to be the leading mobile solution provider for public sector task workers. \n\n# Their Ruggedized Solution;\n\n**\u2022 Durability and reliability**\n\nTheir mobile phones can withstand a variety of harsh environments and are supported by our industry-leading three-year comprehensive manufacturer\u2019s warranty, which includes physical damage. Key features of our rugged devices include: (i) puncture, shock, pressure and impact resistance, (ii) waterproof and dustproof construction, (iii) dual-shift battery life, (iv) extra-loud audio, (v) glove-friendly design, (vi) operational in and resistant to extreme temperatures, and (vii) chemical resistance. \n\n**\u2022 Increased communication and visibility through an enterprise**\n\nSonim\u00b4s solutions are used to track locations, update and manage various tasks and enable communication with and between task workers. In addition, their devices are specifically designed to capture, store and analyze multiple data types for enterprise needs, enabling them to make timely and more informed decisions. \n\n**\u2022 Enhanced functionality through software and hardware configurations**\n\nEndless solutions allow end customers and task workers to customize their mobile phones using Android-based applications and vertical-specific accessories to address their varying needs. Enterprises and agencies can leverage the millions of applications available on the Google Play Store, Sonim\u00b4s dozens of device-specific APIs, and their industrial accessories to create a purpose-built solution to meet the specific use cases of their task workers. \n\n**\u2022 Ease of use**\n\nDevices are designed to look and function similarly to the latest generation of consumer-focused mobile phones with additional features for various enterprise-specific purposes, and also run on the android operating system which has a familiar and intuitive interface. They provide familiar characteristics to many single-purpose devices, such as dedicated physical buttons for PTT and barcode scanning, and offer a simplified user interface, which helps minimize the learning curve for task workers who are transitioning from LMR or data capture devices.\n\n# Financials\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2020 and Recent Highlights**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Net revenues of $15.8\u00a0million, increased from $14.4\u00a0million in the third quarter, driven by increased sales of XP8 smartphone devices.\n*  Gross margin was 23.5%.\n* GAAP net loss was $6.4\u00a0million, or $0.10 per share.\n* Ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $22.1\u00a0million.\n* Announced (i)\u00a0the transfer of Sonim\u2019s Shenzhen manufacturing operations to Unicair, expected to stabilize factory overhead for current products, and (ii)\u00a0the transfer of Sonim\u2019s India-based software development center to Coforge, expected to further reduce personnel and real estate costs.\n*  Announced a deal with FIH Mobile (\u201cFIH\u201d), a subsidiary of Foxconn Technology Group, to support the engineering and manufacturing of Sonim\u2019s next-generation feature phones.\n* Announced commercial sales of the Sonim SmartScanner product platform starting Q1 2021, Sonim\u2019s first handheld and first tablet computer with integrated barcode scanners, which enables Sonim to enter a new $2\u00a0billion worldwide TAM (Total Available Market) and opening sales opportunities in non-US markets. - This is huge.\n* 4 Wall Street analysts have issued ratings and price targets for Sonim Technologies Their average price target is $2.50, predicting that the stock has a possible upside of 143.90%. The high price target for SONM is $3.00 and the low price target for SONM is $2.00. There are currently 2 hold ratings and 2 buy ratings for the stock, resulting in a consensus rating of \"Buy.\" - MarketBeat\n* Remained essentially debt free. \n* An agreement with Coforge to transfer the bulk of our software team in India, to their company and entered into a cost advantage agreement to continue providing software services for current and future products. - Great for financial outlook\n* Just announced that FIH is working on their next generation rugged feature phones. - For those that don\u00b4t know FIH is a subsidiary of Foxconn, this is huge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Technical Analysis\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p9uvqge976n61.png?width=2582&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47f46b051993edec3a88646c0a17efcba96cb269\n\n**Average volume; 2.2M**\n\n**20 / 200 days moving average; Positive**\n\n**Momentum of stock; 43% 12 months change**\n\n**RSI input: 47,5 - Still on a resistance support with higher lows which clearly signs a bullish sentiment - UPTREND**\n\n**MACD input: -0.01 - Bearish pattern - Resistance line has been exactly 1 usd for days and could be a sign of upward momentum, keep track on the MACD - showing signs of stability and upward momentum**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sy0r32fl86n61.png?width=2596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8c6de7de6fe22a250a8e60fb0bcd21694b91989\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Top Institutional Holders\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nntcvlarc6n61.png?width=1796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5e02993499da5daa8384577d156c5d16cc6a45e\n\nLooking into the institutional ownership I noticed Renaissance Technologies, LLC. This is the same company that brought Renesola ($SOL) from a penny stock with 150m in market cap to a billion dollar company over the past 3 months and rocketed to 32 USD which would\u00b4ve been a multibagger for those who rode it. This is just my two cents, but I believe Sonim has a great outlook and growth perspective in 2021. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Shortsqueeze - Investors VS Shorts\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/md8zn4pae6n61.png?width=742&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3eec2995f5af0dc467984df75465ce08fd355c4b\n\nAn increase in the borrow rate would mean that more people than average are borrowing it, or a few people are borrowing large amounts; either way, it reflects a changed expectation in what that stock will do.\n\nIf I borrowed a large amount of a particular stock, the purpose most likely would be to short it or to cover an existing short/options play. You will often see large increases in the borrowed numbers preceding a short squeeze, as people rush to cover their short positions and leave others holding the bag as the stock is temporarily pumped up.\n\nPositions: 16,7k shares at 1 USD \n\nThanks.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR the new DTCC rules for short sellers almost certainly aren't going into effect before March 19th--INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOW TO SUBMIT A COMMENT ARE INCLUDED AT THE END.\n\nI'm not a securities lawyer or SEC savant or even a particularly wrinkle-brained ape but I've read the DTCC proposed rules on liquidity requirements and short sellers and some affiliated communications and I think some WSB record-straightening is needed. \n\nFirst, a public comment period is almost always required for any federal rules changes. SEC or its affiliates may be exempt from this for some reason and I can't tell from the materials themselves so hopefully a smarter ape than me can offer comment. \n\nUntil I hear otherwise, I'm going to assume that this is like every other federal rulemaking and the comment period is PUBLIC and will last 30 days minimum. I'm including directions for how to submit comments at the end pasted directly from DTCC's [IMPORTANT NOTICE](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/3/5/a8974.pdf) on the proposed rule changes. If you have a strong opinion about these rules, the public comment period would be the time to voice it. \n\n**What's the actual timeline for the new rules?**\n\nIMO the more important of the two rules (801) lists an implementation timeframe that can be found on page 19 of 79 of [the SR-NSCC-2021-801 filing](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-801.pdf):\n\n&gt;*(v)  Implementation Timeframe*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;*NSCC would implement the proposed changes no later than 10 Business Days after the later of the no objection to the advance notice and approval of the related proposed rule change by the Commission. NSCC would announce the effective date of the proposed changes by Important Notice posted to its website*\n\nNOTE: the \"related proposed rule\" is [SR-NSCC-2021-002](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-002.pdf) and AFAIK has not been approved either.\n\nI believe this passage is the source of the \"10 days\" timeline I have seen elsewhere. However, by my read this is saying two conditions must be met **before** the 10 business day countdown can  begin: (1) a \"no objection\" is filed associated with this rule AND (2) **SR-NSCC-2021-002** is also approved. \n\nOnce both happen, that essentially gives everybody two weeks to prepare, make changes, etc. But before we start marking any close dates on the calendar, ask yourself: do I really think there will be \\*no\\* objection to this? \n\nTo be clear, \"no objection\" is a term of art. Once again, I'm not a lawyer or SEC expert but I assume objections can come from the leaders at SEC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and presumably other federal political leaders including House and Senate financial services committees. The list of people who could object might also include, though I hope not, industry lobbyists or trade association heads. I don't know. Again, if you know this, please comment and I'll update.\n\n**Why does this matter?**\n\nI'm not a big fan of fixating on specific dates for things like short squeezes. The market is huge and complex and there are literally millions of people doing their part to influence it in lots of different ways. But if you've got dates in mind, and they're coming up soon, IMO you are safer and probably better off assuming this DTCC rulemaking process will not be complete and the new rules will not be in effect.\n\n**How do I submit a comment?**\n\nThe DTCC Important Notice directs comments to SEC's Internet comment form here: [*http://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml*](http://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml)*.* When you click through though you'll see that's not actually a form but a list of SEC affiliated organizations. Ordinarily I would expect to find the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) proposed rules on the [NSCC proposed rule page](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc.htm) but neither of these is listed there. So you may need to skip the SEC Internet comment form and go straight to ***sending an email to rule-comments@sec.gov.***\n\nHere are the instructions for submitting a comment from DTCC's letter on [SR-NSCC-2021-002 &amp; SR-NSCC-2021-801](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/3/5/a8974.pdf):\n\n*The full text of the Filings may be obtained by visiting the DTCC website at www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings.aspx.*    \n\n*Written  comments  on  the  Filings  may  be  addressed  to  National  Securities  Clearing  Corporation,   c/o   General   Counsel\u2019s   Office,   55   Water   Street,   New   York,   New   York   10041,   Attention:  Jacqueline Chezar, Executive Director and Associate General Counsel, and your comments will be forwarded to the SEC.   You  may  also  address  your  written  comments  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Commission,  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  100  F  Street  NE,  Washington  DC  20549.*    \n\n*Electronic  comments  may  be  submitted using the SEC\u2019s Internet comment form (http://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml) or* ***by sending an email to rule-comments@sec.gov****.

Funko looks well positioned for continued growth in 2021 with potential upside from entering the hot NFT market \u201cfairly soon.\u201d (TL;DR at the end)\n\nHere are some highlights from their Q4 earnings report (3/11), Q4 earnings call (3/11), and an interview with the CEO this morning (3/12) with additional information on each bullet further down in the post (For more context please review the prior DDs linked above):\n\n\u00b7  Funko beat expectations with its second highest revenue quarter ever\n\n\u00b7  Growth is expected continue in 2021; driven by Europe, Loungefly, and other initiatives\n\n\u00b7  Operational responsiveness and flexibility has allowed Funko to thrive during the pandemic while providing a way to engage with fans in new and more creative ways\n\n\u00b7  Multiple analysts increased their price targets on the stock after the earnings release\n\n\u00b7  Funko\u2019s CEO Brian Mariotti announced the day after earnings that Funko intends to move into the NFT (Non-Fungible Token) market \u201cfairly soon\u201d\n\nFUNKO BEATS EXPECTATIONS \n\n\u00b7  Net Sales in Q4 2020 was up 6% vs Q4 2019 to $226 million\n\no  This represented Funko\u2019s second highest revenue quarter in its history\n\no  Outperformance was driven by the US market which had its highest revenue quarter in history and grew 18% vs. Q4 2019\n\no  International was constrained by lockdowns; but still grew 10% vs. Q3 2020\n\no  Non-figure product revenue grew 30% in the quarter vs Q4 2019\n\n\u00b7  Gross margins increased 37.2% in Q4 2020 vs. 29.2% in Q4 2019\n\n\u00b7  SG&amp;A decreased 6% to $53 million\n\n\u00b7  Cash Flow From Operations increased 69% to $47 million\n\n\u00b7  Funko\u2019s direct-to-consumer sales nearly doubled compared to the prior year \n\nGROWTH EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN 2021\n\n\u00b7  Funko is forecasting 30% revenue growth in Q1 2021 (vs. Q1 2020)\n\n\u00b7  Full year sales growth is forecasted at between 25-30%\n\n\u00b7  Gross margin is expected to strengthen in 2021; driven by Funko\u2019s direct-to-consumer initiative and from regional / distribution mix shifts\n\n\u00b7  Full year adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase 120 to 170 basis points to between 13.5% and 14.0%\n\n\u00b7  Many major Television, Film, and other properties held back because of the pandemic are expected to return as the economy opens up. This will create demand for new purchases.\n\no  Marvel: It is expected that Marvel will be releasing about 5 new television shows on Disney + this year and another 5 films theatrically.\n\no  Games: Several hot game properties will be releases later this year that will create more content from which to create Funko toys\n\no  Other: Funko is always making deals for new IP licenses and expects to make a \u201cmajor master toy announcement\u201d fairly soon\n\n\u00b7  Loungefly and Snapsies product lines continue to grow and provide additional avenues for Funko to drive more sales growth\n\nFUNKO THRIVES DURING THE PANDEMIC\n\n\u00b7  Despite many major releases throughout the pandemic beyond The Mandalorian, Funko was still able to drive significant purchase activity of it\u2019s brand and products\n\no  Evergreen content represented 68% of sales. (Evergreen content is essentially licensed properties that don\u2019t have a major release associated with them at the time. For example, Harry Potter and The Office would be examples of Evergreen Television properties sold last quarter.)\n\no  As the economy opens up, Funko expects more properties to become available for licensing and product development\n\n\u00b7  Funko was able to accelerate its move to create a direct-to-consumer website for Funko products in Europe ahead by two years ahead of schedule\n\no  FunkoEurope.com was launched in Q4 2020 (October); allowing Funko grow its sales in Europe despite lockdowns\n\no  Given that Funko\u2019s direct-to-consumer site just launched, we can expect continued growth back to pre-pandemic levels in Europe over time as Funko drives traffic to its website and countries open back up from lockdown\n\no  Five months ago, Funko started in three EMEA countries and has since expanded to eight countries in the region\n\n\u00b7  Funko\u2019s diversification into other products like Loungefly bags and board games help Funko maintain growth during the pandemic\n\no  Non-figure products represented 23% of revenues\n\no  Funko\u2019s expanded games portfolio grew 50%\n\no  Loungefly grew 55% in Q4\n\n\\--  Funko will be expanding its Loungefly relationship with Amazon this year\n\n\\--  Loungefly is seeing strong demand across EMEA and other regions\n\no  In board games, Funko launched new titles like Marvel Battleworld, Godzilla, Tokyo Clash, and Back To The Future to name a few\n\n\u00b7  Funko\u2019s overall e-commerce and direct-to-consumer business continued to perform well, expanding on strong Q3 2020 performance\n\no  Total direct-to-consumer sales were 8% of revenues in 2020 vs. 4% the prior year\n\no  Global mass market and third party e-commerce helped drive growth in 2020 as it represented 35% of sales in 2020 vs. 28% in 2019\n\n\u00b7  Funko adjusted by finding new ways to connect with fans during the pandemic as in-person events like San Diego Comicon were not possible\n\n\\--  \u201cVirtual cons\u201d in connection with Comicon in San Diego, New York, and Emerald City were successful in driving revenue increases\n\n\\--  Social media promotions helped drive increased engagement / awareness\n\n\\--  In lieu of attending New York Toy Fair, Funko decided to host its first ever virtual \u201cFunko Fair\u201d where they partnered with their licensors and retailers to engage fans and launch new offerings.\n\n\u00b7  The event was a big success leading to nearly 1.5 million units being pre-sold to fans through retail partners. Many of those items sold are still six to nine months away from being released.\n\n\u00b7  Funko launched \u201cFunko Pop Albums\u201d in 2020 where they release Pop! versions of classic album covers\n\no  For example, the AC/DC\u2019s classic \u201cBlack In Black\u201d record was Funko\u2019s top collectible item at one of their key mass market retailers\n\no  Given the strong initial fan reaction, Funko plans to expand the concept across new genres including sports, trading cards, and comic book covers\n\nMULTIPLE ANALYSTS INCREASE THEIR PRICE TARGETS\n\n\u00b7  Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng\n\no  Raised the target price 130% to $15.30 (from $6.60)\n\no  Q4 EBITDA beat expectations\n\no  Impressed by Funko\u2019s ability to pivot during the pandemic by leaning into e-commerce, games, and soft goods\n\n\u00b7  DA Davidson analyst Lind Bolton Weiser\n\no  Raised the target price 142% to $17.00 (from $7.00)\n\no  Boosting their modeled multiple to 17-times earnings (from 9-times earnings) \n\no  Believes the company is returning to growth while improving its fundamentals \n\n\u00b7  Truist analyst Michael Swartz\n\no  Raised the target price 38% to $18.00 (from $13.00)\n\no  Funko reported a much better than anticipated Q4 and 2021 guidance\n\no  Looks well positioned for the year ahead given the strong theatrical line-up, easy comps, product expansion initiatives, and the favorable impact of its high-growth DTC platform\n\n\u00b7  Piper Sandler analyst Erinn Murphy\n\no  Raised the target price 46% to $22.00 (from $15.00)\n\no  Strong Q4 results\n\n===================================================================\n\n*(At this point my post moves away from more traditional fundamental analysis/ information towards more speculative types of things. While I do not really understand the fascination with cryptos nor NFT\u2019s themselves, I do recognize that valuations throughout financial markets have deviated significantly from how I might value them based on more traditional metrics like price-to-earnings ratios or discounted free-cash-flow. Obviously, Tesla, AMC, and GameStop are recent examples of this in the stock market. Crpytos, sports cards, and Pokemon cards are recent examples in other markets (where there isn\u2019t really any cashflow or profit stream intrinsic to the underlying asset from which to determine value). So, if you decide to purchase the stock based on factors outside of fundamental analysis, like momentum and meme-ability, please make sure to position size and be careful. As they say, return-of-capital is just as important as return-on-capital. So, once you move away from fundamental analysis to determine entry and exit into a position, the decision becomes primarily one based on emotion and \u201cgut feel.\u201d Finally, here are two books that I recommend on understanding market bubbles.* [BOOK 1](https://www.amazon.com/Devil-Take-Hindmost-Financial-Speculation/dp/0452281806)*.* [BOOK 2](https://www.amazon.com/Manias-Panics-Crashes-History-Financial/dp/1137525754/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=)*. That\u2019s all for my PSA. I\u2019ll get off my soapbox now and go back to the DD. Thank you for reading. Obviously, the news today that Funko plans to enter the NFT marketplace soon is an important announcement. So any DD without incorporating NFT\u2019s into it would clearly be incomplete.)*\n\n===================================================================\n\nFUNKO MOVING INTO NFTs \u201cFAIRLY SOON\u201d\n\nThere aren\u2019t many publicly traded companies that I can think of at this point playing in the NFT space. You have companies like Square and Paypal getting into cryptos from traditional fintech. You have companies with a core business outside of cryptos like MicroStrategy and Tesla buying Bitcoin for their treasury. Then you have others like Coinbase and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust who were born from the crypto world. But there none I can think of that are tied directly to NFT\u2019s right now other than Funko. \n\n*(If you can think of any other publicly traded companies that have announced their intention to move into NFT\u2019s, please post their names in the comments below. Thank you.)*\n\nAfter today\u2019s interview with CEO Brian Mariotti (quote at the end of this section), Funko seems to have the NFT market clearly in its sights. As we have seen with many other crpyto-related stocks, a company\u2019s share price can swing wildly on a small announcement and the volatility can be extreme. If Funko issues a press release or makes a formal announcement about a new NFT product, the share price could move quickly one way or the other. Because of this, there is clearly additional value beyond its core physical Pops and Loungefly businesses that could be added to Funko\u2019s valuation. \n\nI don\u2019t even know how to begin to estimate the potential value of NFT\u2019s on Funko\u2019s stock price. So instead of doing that, I will try to provide some information and research on recent activity in the NFT space. Hopefully this will be useful to you in deciding whether you would like to incorporate NFT\u2019s in the estimate of what you think Funko is worth.

Both for Funko and for collectors. \n\no  For Funko it allows them to sell into harder to reach markets like Latin America, Africa, and Asia. There are probably wealthy collectors in many countries that want to own Funko and Loungefly products, but don\u2019t have immediate access.\n\no  For collectors, it allows them to buy and sell digital items across the world instantly without having to wait on receiving a physical item. There is even the potential for an item \n\n\u00b7  All collectibles and art have concerns with fakes and counterfeits. By using blockchain technology and NFT\u2019s, Funko can reduce the impact of counterfeiters on their business. When someone purchases a rare item, their NFT can serve as certification of its authenticity through the blockchain. \n\n\u00b7  NFT\u2019s allow Funko to move to blockchain based payment systems and tap wealthy investors looking to diversify out of their crypto coin holdings into physical and digital items. \n\no  There are many wealthy crypto investors that are looking to park their money in other investments to diversify their portfolio.\n\no  Additionally, there are other investors that are not currently investing in cryptos and blockchain that might be interesting in a solution that merges a rare physical item with a rare digital NFT.\n\n\u00b7  NFT \u201cartists\u201d or \u201ccreators\u201d can collect a piece of the revenue each time the specific digital asset turns over. For example, if Funko made an NFT and it was sold 20 times over the course of a year, a company Funko might collect a fee every time the NFT were sold (depending on how the system were structured).\n\no  Funko NFTs could be sold directly to the consumer through Funko\u2019s website or (what I think is more likely) through retail partners like GameStop, Target, Walmart, Hot Topic, and other retailers looking to get in on the NFT craze.\n\nQuote from Funko\u2019s CEO [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1t-SZBwBkM) about NFT\u2019s:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about it and we have a plan in place. We have some technology in place. We are going to be out in the market fairly soon. But we\u2019re going to out in the market in a very different way. We have the ability to disrupt this space in a way that nobody else is doing right now. We can tie digital NFT\u2019s to our fan base and link NFT\u2019s with physical products. And that\u2019s not happening right now. So, for example, if you had a pack of NFT\u2019s. I won\u2019t mention licenses. And there are a few rare ones. If you have those rare ones, we\u2019re going to give you a free product that is tied to that rare NFT. Which means you have a super rare physical product that ties to your super rare NFT. That\u2019s disruptive. That\u2019s new. It\u2019s different. It\u2019s only what Funko can do. And we\u2019re really excited about what the future of NFT\u2019s are. We\u2019re certainly all over this. And I think you\u2019ll see fairly soon from Funko in the market.\u201d\n\nTL;DR: \n\nAs expected, Funko had a strong Q4 2020, driven by continued strength in their core product line and e-commerce sales in the US market. Funko\u2019s sales are expected to continue to grow in 2021 as the company builds upon its wins from the second half of 2020. Funko\u2019s international business represents an area of additional opportunity as the company has not fully recovered from sales declines in the region yet. Continued development of Funko\u2019s direct-to-consumer initiatives in Europe along with store reopenings after lockdowns should remedy this. \n\nWhile Funko has not formally announced their entry into the NFT market with a press release, Funko\u2019s interview with Yahoo Finance suggests that Funko soon will. Funko announcing their entry into NFT\u2019s would probably drive more attention to the stock and more investors to Funko products. At that point Funko would become more than just a \u201ctoy company.\u201d They would become a collectibles company making products for the NFT marketplace. Many products made by Funko already command a significant premium in the secondary market.

Imagine what could happen to prices if those same products were combined with accompanying NFTs. This new opportunity with NFT\u2019s provides optionality on an already stable core business of collectible toys, games, and merchandise.\n\nPositions: Long Shares &amp; Calls\n\nDisclosure: I am long FNKO.

        "selftext": "Today was a day similar to Tuesday, tech and semiconductors rallied while the financial sector and oil lagged behind. The 10 Year Treasury Yield ($TNX) was up a little from Wednesday's low, however it is still down for the week. Current yield is 1.527%. \n\nMy portfolio is up more than 8% today, but we still have a little ways to go to reach the highest peak that I reached a couple weeks ago. Overall, it is looking like this might be a V-shaped tech recovery - a lot of overreaction. The only positions that was filled today was 10 shares of Roblox ($RBLX).

It has the looks of a more traditional American pickup and in my opinion, looks better than Rivian's version. Although super futuristic looking, the cyber truck might not appeal to everyone and the price target is around $18,000 more than the Lordstown for the AWD version. Deliveries of the Lordstown Endurance are expected to begin in the fall of 2021, with full production ramping up throughout 2022; we can preorder on their website now for only $100 deposit. Welcome to the future. Currently $RIDE is trading below the 180 MA.

The biggest IPO on the NYSE from an Asian company since Alibaba. The $CPNG IPO was, for the most part, overshadowed by the Roblox IPO from Wednesday. Coupang has been compared to the Amazon of Korea. The Korean e-commerce market in 2018 was $100B and is growing rapidly. Coupang has a unique [returns ](https://www.expatguidekorea.com/article/how-to-return-a-product-on-coupang.html)system. On their app, you can select to return the product and where the delivery courier will pick it up. It is as simple as clicking a few buttons on their app and placing the product outside of your front door. It seems to me like a big deal.

        "selftext": "Fellow apes, I am going to make a personal pledge and commitment to all of you.  But first, please indulge me with a little story about who I am and where I\u2019m coming from.  \n\nI am an attorney, and I\u2019m not too humble to tell you I\u2019m pretty damn good at it.  My firm, formed in 2017, has already brought in nearly 30 million dollars in judgments and settlements for our clients, all of whom are wrongfully terminated workers or seriously injured individuals suing some of the world\u2019s largest corporations, insurance companies, and government entities.  Nothing in life brings me more joy than cross-examining executives and administrators.\n\nBefore GME, I had never invested in the stock market, and hardly saw any need to.  I make plenty of money in my day job, and my standard 401(k) was doing just fine (I think, I honestly never even check on it).  \n\nI also had never logged onto Reddit before, and I rarely engage with social media of any kind.  As an employment attorney, I\u2019ve seen social media ruin a lot of lives, so I generally avoid it except for marketing my firm on it (e.g. FB ads).\n\nWhen I saw the news stories about a ragtag group of foul-mouth degenerate redditors taking billions in profits off hedge funds using something called a \u201cshort squeeze,\u201d I had a shit-eating grin on my face.  It was precisely the sort of David v. Goliath story that I live for and make my living from.\n\nThen, when I saw RH and other brokers halt trading in the middle of the squeeze, causing the little guy to lose a significant chunk of their gains, I was furious.  And when I get furious at something harming the little guy, I typically start suing.  But I knew I couldn\u2019t help there - I have very little background or experience in securities law, and I assumed (correctly) that attorneys who already knew this field would be filing class action suits and/or FINRA arbs right away.\n\nSo I decided to get off the sideline and join the fight.  I created this Reddit account, I started educating myself on what a short squeeze is (and so much more since), and bought my first ever securities holdings on 1/29.  Thus far, I\u2019ve put 7k into it, and I hold 100 shares of AMC and 42 shares of GME.  \n\nOn a quick side note, I am quite confident that there are other people like me all over the world, who joined in and bought GME with money they don\u2019t need and could give two shits if they lose because they were outraged at the way retail was cheated on 1/28.\n\nI\u2019ve been in the red but averaging down the entire time (GME average = approx. 130), and I\u2019ve found all the FUD and insincere sympathy posts quite amusing.  People calling me a \u201cbag holder,\u201d speculating that I\u2019ve lost my life savings and pretending to be empathetic by telling me to cut those losses and sell, discouraging me from buying more.  Here, there, in the MSM, and everywhere, FUD FUD FUD!\n\nAnd this brings me to my pledge, which I want every retail ape and more importantly every shill and hedge fund intern to hear loud and clear:\n\nI am not selling at 1k.  I am not selling at 100k.  I am not selling at 1M.  I am not selling when the markets and all civilization collapse around me.  \n\nI am NOT selling until every ape less privileged than me has cashed out and absconded with life-changing amounts of HF money.  And I\u2019m probably not selling then either.  I will GLADLY hold other ape bags if it means Wall Street learns a hard lesson about fucking the little guy and shorting American companies into the ground.\n\nSo you can fuck right off with your FUD.  It only fuels my hate fire and confirms my belief that we\u2019re winning this fight.  \n\nApe together strong, mother fuckers.\n\nP.S.:  Not financial advice, I eat crayons and throw feces",

        "selftext": "# Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.\n\n\\- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH?\n\n\\- Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias?\n\n\\- Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?\n\n\\- Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?\n\n\\- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing my writing. I\u2019m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.\n\n# The Fundamental Constraint\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s9uystsmn0n61.png?width=1613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=612d845bce1686629bd7aa7d2bedef5028891ba9\n\nThis one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It\u2019s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, **trustworthiness and accountability must be established**. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B\\*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you\u2019re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pms84rvhpvm61.png?width=2073&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11914ae63ebcb5a662e9c623e7caf558382539e5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3wqso7bkovm61.png?width=1457&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88e922d828b2fb5655e4ce433e6bfcf05f5ff891\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B\\*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5fl6iy73p0n61.png?width=1504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ab621637733790abcc73468f29aa300950f6d2c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/juszlp60rvm61.png?width=1006&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8537287a2d45d8869023d66f80d67e506c7070e6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p7cgc88hl0n61.png?width=1772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0234ebda1584799431ac5ee4936c580cd5e99d2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Underbanked\n\nJack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b83hyt7yl0n61.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf497fa79d6162b868fac37c54aed27f13efbdf8\n\nInterestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards.\n\nIn my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America. while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things:\n\n\\- Cash App\u2019s Twitter and advertising strategy\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1qvo71pmm0n61.png?width=1487&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bca7632db9415950320744b438310aba1518a105\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cjm7d1fpm0n61.png?width=1482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8604ba6d3b892c789c2a3d8a615ed2dd38b31cb4\n\n\\- The geographic results on Google Trends when searching \u201cCash App vs. Venmo\u201d. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nl52ye7ym0n61.png?width=2949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=632d7f0b5043f169520fdb1af54bc3c8a3080322\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chicago's North vs. South Sides](https://preview.redd.it/r3l5dtm7n0n61.png?width=1402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2d7b39081a3229ef0d163dc5bba00a2d861eeb7)\n\nIt is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water.  That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square\u2019s youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You\u2019ve heard it before, \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?\u201d. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers:\n\n1. The ability to start a business\n2. The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks\n3. The ability to invest and educate in B\\*tcoin\n4. The ability to save on basic purchases\n5. The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to)\n\nWhat this inevitably means is that we probably won\u2019t even see Square operating at \u201cfull-force\u201d until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials.\n\n# Speculation\n\nThis is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks:\n\n1. Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank\u2019s regulatory offerings.\n2. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services.\n3. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process.\n4. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with orgs like Visa or MasterCard.\n5. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify.\n6. Square will foray into equal housing.\n7. Square will improved loan systems.\n8. Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease follow for more content.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/reviews/06hGKT6YUeRY99vz4MVPPh0-7..1569477220.jpg](https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/reviews/06hGKT6YUeRY99vz4MVPPh0-7..1569477220.jpg)",
