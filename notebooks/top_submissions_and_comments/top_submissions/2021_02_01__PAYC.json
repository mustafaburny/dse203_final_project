        "selftext": "Friday 26 February 2021\n\n*Live Updates*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background:**\n\n* My discount bot to help Reddit. It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.\n* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.\n* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.\n* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.\n* There are a lot of SPY500/\"boomer\" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.\n* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.\n* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement\n* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only\n* This is a one man bot.\n\n**Bot Overview**:\n\nIt's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.\n\n**Key:**\n\n* Penny stocks are very risky.\n* Pharma companies are very risky.\n* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.\n* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.\n* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).\n* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.\n* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.\n* Take the \"Calls\" as very discounted, and \"Potentially A Call\" as somewhat discounted.\n* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.\n* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.\n* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**At Close of Thursday**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Batch 1:**\n\n* BA\tBoeing Co\t216.45\n* UAL\tUnited Airlines Holdings Inc\t51.78\n* ADBE\tAdobe Inc\t459.16\n* ANSS\tANSYS, Inc.\t338.46\n* ADSK\tAutodesk, Inc.\t284.03\n* PAYC\tPaycom Software Inc\t368.31\n* CRM\t[salesforce.com](https://salesforce.com), inc.\t231.08\n* SNPS\tSynopsys, Inc.\t244.09\n* TSLA\tTesla Inc\t682.22\n* FBHS\tFortune Brands Home &amp; Security Inc\t83.48\n* BBY\tBest Buy Co Inc\t102.94\n* PYPL\tPaypal Holdings Inc\t253.94\n* CTAS\tCintas Corporation\t328.05\n* CPRT\tCopart, Inc.\t106.92\n* HSIC\tHenry Schein, Inc.\t61.89\n* RMD\tResMed Inc.\t194.98\n* WELL\tWelltower Inc\t70.28\n* DHI\tD.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, February 11, 2021**\n\nMarkets traded choppily for the third-day straight as market participants digested new economic data, corporate earnings reports, and developments out of Washington regarding another stimulus package. \n\nDespite the choppiness in the market, the market remains near record-levels, likely buoyed by favorable fiscal and monetary policy support. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the Central Bank will not \u201ctighten restrictions until a robust economic recovery has taken place and the labor market rebound extends across a broad section of the population\u201d And while he acknowledged that inflation readings may start to increase this year when compared to last year, he said he does not expect to see a large or sustained increase in prices across core categories. Even with the recent speculative excess and volatility in the market, the bullish long-term thesis remains intact. We expect favorable monetary and fiscal policy combined with low-interest rates, growing corporate earnings, additional fiscal relief, and an increase in the pace of vaccinations to anchor a bull market even after the pandemic is over.\n\nA strange trend appears to be developing in the market this earnings season. According to an analysis by FactSet, despite analysts expecting another quarter of year-on-year declines during earnings season, 81% of companies that have announced beat earnings estimates by around 15.2%. Strangely, companies that beat earnings estimates have not been rewarded and instead lagged the broader market by an average of 0.5%. John Butter, the author of the analysis said, \u201cTo date, the market is not rewarding positive earnings surprises and punishing negative earnings surprises less than average. Companies that have reported positive earnings surprises for Q4 2020 have seen an average price decrease of -0.5% two days before the earnings release through two days after the earnings release. This percentage decrease is well below the 5-year average price increase of +0.9% during this same window for companies reporting positive earnings surprises.\u201d\n\nBoth the Senate and the House of Representatives voted to move forward to move forward with a process called reconciliation, which allows Democrats, who have a majority in both houses of Congress, to vote to pass Biden\u2019s new coronavirus stimulus package without Republican votes. Reconciliation is a way for Congress to enact legislation on taxes, spending, and the debt limit with only a majority (51 votes, or 50 if the vice president breaks a tie) in the Senate, avoiding the threat of a filibuster, which requires 60 votes to overcome. Because Democrats have 50 seats in the Senate\u2014plus a Democratic vice president\u2014reconciliation is a way to get a tax-and-spending bill to the president\u2019s desk even if all 50 Republicans oppose it. \n\nThere is drama developing in the world of mega-cap companies. Apple (AAPL) recently announced that in the upcoming IOS 14 update, users would be able to opt-in or out of having their data tracked and sold to advertisers. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple explained the rationale behind the decision: \u201cTechnology does not need vast troves of personal data stitched together across dozens of websites and apps in order to succeed. Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it, and we're here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom. If a business is built on misleading users on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform.\u201d\n\nIn response to the changes, Facebook (FB), which is highly dependent on revenue from selling information to advertisers, accused Apple of competitive behavior and said the changes would disproportionately affect small-business owners attempting to promote their business. The Harvard Business Review says Facebook\u2019s claim that small businesses will be disproportionately affected to \u201cmisleading\u201d and suggest any impact would be \u201cmodest\u201d([https://hbr.org/2021/02/facebooks-misleading-campaign-against-apples-privacy-policy](https://hbr.org/2021/02/facebooks-misleading-campaign-against-apples-privacy-policy)). Frankly, on a personal note, we think what Facebook is doing is quite ridiculous, given its horrendous track record when it comes to user privacy (remember in 2018 when it was discovered Facebook sold the data of up to 87 million users to a company called Cambridge Analytics without their permission). \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* First-time unemployment claims totaled 793,000, higher than the 760,000 estimate by economists.\n* After a remarkable rally in recent days following increased interest in social media, weed stocks like Aphria (APHA), Tilray (TLRY), and many others cratered in value today, with many company\u2019s stock dropping by more than 20%. \n* The US International Trade Commission recently ruled that U.S. International Trade Commission ruling against battery maker SK Innovation stole trade secrets related to lithium-ion battery production from LG Chem. SK Innovation is in the middle of building two factories in the US to provide GM and Ford with batteries. \n* Avalara (AVLR) with a host of target raises. Consensus target is $210 at Buy. Stock currently around $180\n* Bunge (BG) target raised by Barclays from $70 to $85 at Overweight. Stock currently around $75\n* Clean Energy Fuels (CLNE) target raised by Lake Street Capital from $9 to $27 at Buy. Stock currently around $17\n* Cummins (CMI) target raised by Argus from $246 to $281 at Buy. Stock currently around $245\n* General Motors (GM) target raised by Royal Bank of Canada from $52 to $67 at Outperform. Stock currently around $55\n* InMode (INMD) target raised by UBS Group from $64 to $84 at Buy. Stock currently around $70\n* LYFT target raised by Needham &amp; Co from $50 to $70 at Buy. Stock currently around $56\n* Paycom Software (PAYC) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target $480 at Outperform. Stock currently around $425\n* Sonos (SONO) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $35 to $45 at Overweight. Stock currently around $31.50\n* UBER with a host of target raises. Consensus price target is $75 at Buy. Stock currently around $63\n* Zillow Group (ZG) with a host of target raises. Consesnsus price target $200 at Outperform. Stock currently around $171\n\n\u201cThe secret to getting ahead is getting started\u201d - Mark Twain",
