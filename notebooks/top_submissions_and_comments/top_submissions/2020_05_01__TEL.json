        "selftext": "Hello fellow gamblers, going to bless you with a small DD for an upcoming earnings play next week.\n\nTD;LR: APPS 6/19 7.5c  \nPersonal # of Contracts: 10 (small position)  \nDisclaimer:  Not a financial advisor, not invested in stocks in the company, this is  not to be taken by heart without individual research so do your own DD  as per your discretion.  \nNumbers: Financial numbers presented in thousands to prevent redundancy, unless stated otherwise.\n\n**Okay so what is Digital Turbine?**  \nIn  short, Digital Turbine, Inc. ($APPS) is a media and mobile  communications platform that allows mobile users to discover new apps  easily, and assists OEM, app developers, and other third parties  (advertising platforms), to generate revenue through the use of the )%)  software provided. Essentially, this software enables mobile users to be  connected with apps based on the collection of data, creating a  tailored ad experience.\n\n**Quick Facts**  \nDate Founded: 1989  \nNumber of Employees: 161  \nTotal Locations: 6 (Austin TX (HQ), Durham NC, Tel Aviv, San Fransisco CA, Singapore, Mumbai)  \nMarket Cap: 528.69M (at time of writing)\n\nSource: Website\n\n**Main Products**  \n1.) **DT Ignite:**  The main platform offering. In a nutshell, DT Ignite assists carriers  to monetize phones that they sell, by selling ads within them. Now what  the fuck does that mean exactly? Assume you are a mobile operator or an  OEM (original equipment manufacturer). Now, through the use of APPS, you  can control and monetize the actual mobile devices through the use of  various apps and other ads within it. So basically, the phone  manufacturer, or operator, can install random ass apps that you probably  do not want or will use in your phone. Now who the hell would want that  in their phone taking up space? Almost no one, surely. However, But  it's important to actually see where the money comes from in this case,  and which part of the DT Ignite model, which in this case is the Dynamic  Installs. All that does, is pack up a bunch of apps together that are  installed as soon as a phone is activated, APPS makes money on these,  we'll get into the numbers.\n\n2.) **Mobile Posse:**  APPS acquired Mobile Posee for $66 million, on February 28th, of 2020.  Yes. Mobile Posse focuses on user UX on mobile phones offering carriers  and OEMs the ability to monetize content directly on phones, pretty much  on a similar position as APPS. Additionally, Mobile Posse offers the  same services to advertisers.\n\n**APPS** **Financials &amp; Growth:**  \n1.)  2017 - 2018: Net Revenue growth of $34,544 or 85.9%  \nMajor partner: Verizon Wireless (61.1% of revenue in 2017, and 51.5% in 2018)  \nMajor partner: AT&amp;T Inc.

        "selftext": "Mods, I\u2019m going to be upfront and tell you that my interest in this topic was piqued by researching a penny stock, so if this sets off alarms for Rule #1, I totally get it and I will rephrase the context. \n\nI was wondering if anyone could explain why there can be a large price difference between stocks listed on the NYSE and another stock exchange. Specifically, I started looking at Foresight Autonomous FRSX, an Israeli company which is listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) at a price significantly higher than what it\u2019s going for on the NYSE. On TASE it\u2019s 62.9 ila, or roughly $18 usd, per share. On the NYSE it\u2019s $.79 usd right now. Comparing the daily charts they followed each other today, falling 7.5% and 8% respectively. So they at least seem to correlate there. \n\nI did some looking and found that price differences like this are not unique among dual listed stocks, but I couldn\u2019t find anything explaining why one company could be valued so differently across different stock exchanges. Do traders feel better and perhaps patriotic about a national company listed on their local stock exchange? Or is this something else, like how many shares are outstanding? Hoping for a discussion or some pointers to put me on the right direction to find this answer out for myself.",
