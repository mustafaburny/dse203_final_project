I have to come out, not as gay, but as 16. Who knows which is worse. Despite how you may disagree after clicking on the link a line below this one, I would call myself a good trader, just an insanely greedy one. Anyways, after doing [this](https://imgur.com/a/ZF9SqAe) to my account in 4 trading days, I realize how bad my gambling addiction has become, and how much I love this shit. I told myself \"dont take profit until your account balance has a 2 in front, and that option says 500% p/l. It was in the 480's when I took that photo. For being 16, that is a shit ton of money. \n\nAnyways, Ill get on with it. You guys tell me what to trade, I do it. This WILL NOT be another CTN, I will make my own trades if you guys say some dumb shit. Ill provide daily updates, and if its looking nice, hell, maybe it will go public one day. \n\nI find myself pretty good (overall) with daytrades, but holding anything over the weekend will fuck me. That's where I want your guys's help. Also, betting against the fed is typically a very bad idea. \n\nCurrently, my account is fucked.  I'm pulling the rest of the $200 out of my Fido, and putting it in here, which will be getting YOLO'd.  I have another 200 waiting on my Paypal, so that will help save my account\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, if spy closes below $300 tomorrow, well, check my recent comments. It will save my account, and lets just say that I will be giving back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: LONG WSBX (WSBXXX COMING SOON)",

I was going around asking my friends for money so I can double down my spy puts and that's when it struck me. How are these boomers being laid off getting money for their food?

Electronic payments just like the one I was using to get money for my YOLOS: Venmo and Cashapp. So I did a lil digging while being analed on my Monday puts from last week.\n\nThe CEO of  SQ, Jack whatshisface tweeted some shit about asking govt. to let them help the delivery of stimulus tendies.

        "selftext": "**How To GET PAID $2,000 Drop Servicing \\[Get Your High Ticket Client\\]**\n\nA big question I always get from students is how do I get clients to pay me. There\u2019s a few main things to focus on with this. Other than these points it\u2019s all about simply choosing your ideal platform and sending the invoice. Before you do that though, make sure you have these things in place so you don\u2019t run into the major issues I\u2019m about to expose.\n\n**How To Deal With Clients That Don\u2019t Want To Pay**\n\nAlways make sure that you don\u2019t deliver the finished product until the client has paid in full. I\u2019ve had a few experiences in the past where a client hasn\u2019t paid on time which led us not getting paid in full or not getting paid on time. The best way to deal with those who refuse to pay is to either require them to pay 100% up front before working with you or if you go for the 50% up front and 50% on delivery option, at least ensure you never deliver the final product, add your logo to it if it\u2019s something like a video, keep everything on your systems if it\u2019s something like a website.\n\n**How To Get High Paying clients**\n\nRealize your working in an abundant market, there are too many potential clients for you to possibly be able to service them all. There\u2019s plenty of fish in the sea, so you don\u2019t need to be desperate in taking whatever you can get someone to pay you. It all comes down to knowing what your service is worth in the market and charging what you deserve to be paid. If you\u2019re skilled in conveying your worth to clients in relation to a problem they really need to solve right now while you are the very best option to solve that problem then they\u2019re going to be willing to spend very large amounts to get that problem solved. On top of that you need to remember it\u2019s nothing for these companies to spend thousands with you, it\u2019s only a big deal for you if you\u2019re not used to it yet.\n\n**How Should Clients Pay Me**\n\nI\u2019ve heard of all kinds of strange payment structures over the years with all kinda of weird explanations for each. At the end of the day you should only get clients to pay you 100% up front or 50% up front, 50% on delivery if they really push on it. Personally, I only take this second option if the sales is worth at least $2,000 otherwise it\u2019s just not worth the time of going through two sets of receiving payments. The biggest thing is feeling comfortable asking for 100% payment upfront.\n\n**Payment Methods**\n\nThere\u2019s so many platforms out there for accepting payment all of which take some kind of fee. PayPal and Stripe make things simple but they both lead to higher fees expecting payments especially if your bank currency is different to the one you accept payment in. Bank transfer is another option but it can be slower to make happen and asks a bit more of the potential client when making payment as it\u2019s simply a little more work for them but if going this route I recommend using Transferwise to save massively on fees. It\u2019s really going to be a decision between minimizing fees or minimizing the time investment in your client making the payment, all dependent on your preferences in the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Click HERE to learn more](https://youtu.be/hCCnhRKQw_0)",

I have to come out, not as gay, but as 16. Who knows which is worse. Despite how you may disagree after clicking on the link a line below this one, I would call myself a good trader, just an insanely greedy one. Anyways, after doing [this](https://imgur.com/a/ZF9SqAe) to my account in 4 trading days, I realize how bad my gambling addiction has become, and how much I love this shit. I told myself \"dont take profit until your account balance has a 2 in front, and that option says 500% p/l. It was in the 480's when I took that photo. For being 16, that is a shit ton of money. \n\nAnyways, Ill get on with it. You guys tell me what to trade, I do it. This WILL NOT be another CTN, I will make my own trades if you guys say some dumb shit. Ill provide daily updates, and if its looking nice, hell, maybe it will go public one day. \n\nI find myself pretty good (overall) with daytrades, but holding anything over the weekend will fuck me. That's where I want your guys's help. Also, betting against the fed is typically a very bad idea. \n\nCurrently, my account is fucked.  I'm pulling the rest of the $200 out of my Fido, and putting it in here, which will be getting YOLO'd.  I have another 200 waiting on my Paypal, so that will help save my account\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, if spy closes below $300 tomorrow, well, check my recent comments.

        "selftext": "**How To GET PAID $2,000 Drop Servicing \\[Get Your High Ticket Client\\]**\n\nA big question I always get from students is how do I get clients to pay me. There\u2019s a few main things to focus on with this. Other than these points it\u2019s all about simply choosing your ideal platform and sending the invoice. Before you do that though, make sure you have these things in place so you don\u2019t run into the major issues I\u2019m about to expose.\n\n**How To Deal With Clients That Don\u2019t Want To Pay**\n\nAlways make sure that you don\u2019t deliver the finished product until the client has paid in full. I\u2019ve had a few experiences in the past where a client hasn\u2019t paid on time which led us not getting paid in full or not getting paid on time. The best way to deal with those who refuse to pay is to either require them to pay 100% up front before working with you or if you go for the 50% up front and 50% on delivery option, at least ensure you never deliver the final product, add your logo to it if it\u2019s something like a video, keep everything on your systems if it\u2019s something like a website.\n\n**How To Get High Paying clients**\n\nRealize your working in an abundant market, there are too many potential clients for you to possibly be able to service them all. There\u2019s plenty of fish in the sea, so you don\u2019t need to be desperate in taking whatever you can get someone to pay you. It all comes down to knowing what your service is worth in the market and charging what you deserve to be paid. If you\u2019re skilled in conveying your worth to clients in relation to a problem they really need to solve right now while you are the very best option to solve that problem then they\u2019re going to be willing to spend very large amounts to get that problem solved. On top of that you need to remember it\u2019s nothing for these companies to spend thousands with you, it\u2019s only a big deal for you if you\u2019re not used to it yet.\n\n**How Should Clients Pay Me**\n\nI\u2019ve heard of all kinds of strange payment structures over the years with all kinda of weird explanations for each. At the end of the day you should only get clients to pay you 100% up front or 50% up front, 50% on delivery if they really push on it. Personally, I only take this second option if the sales is worth at least $2,000 otherwise it\u2019s just not worth the time of going through two sets of receiving payments. The biggest thing is feeling comfortable asking for 100% payment upfront.\n\n**Payment Methods**\n\nThere\u2019s so many platforms out there for accepting payment all of which take some kind of fee. PayPal and Stripe make things simple but they both lead to higher fees expecting payments especially if your bank currency is different to the one you accept payment in. Bank transfer is another option but it can be slower to make happen and asks a bit more of the potential client when making payment as it\u2019s simply a little more work for them but if going this route I recommend using Transferwise to save massively on fees. It\u2019s really going to be a decision between minimizing fees or minimizing the time investment in your client making the payment, all dependent on your preferences in the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Click HERE to learn more](https://youtu.be/hCCnhRKQw_0)",

        "selftext": "Hi guys, what do you think about the PayPal stock considering the corona \u201acrisis\u2018? Is it a long term investment? They had an uplift on Friday but bad news during the weekend will probably destroy the gains on Monday. I got in at 80$/share, would it be smart to realize the earnings now and get back into it?",

        "selftext": "Hi, i don\u2019t wanna keep investing alone through a broker. It\u2019s too hard and volatile. I need a fund manager to put my money on S&amp;P ETF. I don\u2019t live in USA. I need something 100% online and deposit on my account from a credit card or PayPal or hyperwallet or something like that. Anyone knows a good fund or asset manager of that type?",
