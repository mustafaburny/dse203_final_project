Keep in mind, I am currently long at higher prices, so I am biased. However, I would like to alert as many people to what I consider a tremendous buying opportunity. Atomera looks ripe for the picking by patient investors, since the stock has retraced 60% from its 52-week high. \n\nShares of Atomera peaked at $47.13 on February 8, 2021.\n\nLike a lot of growth companies, investors have seen shares of Atomera pull back on consolidation, profit taking, and a brutal market for growth companies. Then, along came the shorts. As of March 31, 2021 there were 2,952,916 shares short, according to NASDAQ. The average daily volume on March 31 was 429,749 shares, which means it is going to take the shorts 6.87 days to cover. Many investors are anxiously waiting on the April 15th numbers to come out. Atomera currently has around 20 million shares in the float.\u00a0The total number of shares outstanding was 22.4 million as of December 31, 2020. The proxy has\u00a0updated inside and board holdings on page 13, which is about 14.4%, but those in the list include a portion that is not vested/exercisable, thus, 20 million is in the float. According to the latest information from NASDAQ, there are 71 institutional shareholders who own 5,886,520 shares, or 26.02% of the outstanding shares. On the way to its $47.13 high, shares of Atomera were regularly up several points in a day. In my opinion, I would not want to be short Atomera at these levels. In my opinion, it is time to buy. I am already long the stock, albeit at higher prices, and I am planning on adding to my position. \n\nWhat Atomera does is a little difficult to understand. I believe I have provided a pretty good description of its business model in this report. Atomera has a six phases process with an end result that is the commercialization of wafers that utilize Atomera's Mears Silicon Technology. Once again, Atomera's Mears Silicon Technology bolsters the performance and power efficiency of transistors. \nIn recent months, Atomera announced it has delivered its MST IP transfer package in accordance with a JDA contract. With this advancement, the JDA customer became the first Atomera customer to enter the fourth phase of the six-phase engagement process, which culminates in commercialization of MST-enabled wafers. As I mentioned earlier, Atomera currently has 25 engagements in its customer pipeline, consisting of nine in phase one, 15 in phase three, and one in phase four. Not only do I believe shares of Atomera are heavily shorted and trading deep in oversold territory, it's only a matter of when, not if, Atomera moves additional customers from Phase 3 to Phase 4, which in turn justifies a higher and higher valuation.\n\nMears Silicon Technology\n\nAtomera has developed Mears Silicon Technology, which increases performance and power efficiency in semiconductor transistors. Mears Silicon Technology is a thin film used to enhance semiconductors results in higher performance, lower power, and lower costs. Mears Silicon Technology can be implemented using equipment already deployed in semiconductor manufacturing facilities and is complementary to other nano-scaling technologies already in the semiconductor industry roadmap. Mears Silicon Technology enhances transistors to deliver significantly better performance in today's electronics by using a material that enhances transistors to improve performance. Large semiconductor providers license the technology in order to incorporate Mears Silicon Technology into their silicon wafer manufacturing process. Some of the benefits of Mears Silicon Technology include a longer battery life for mobile phones, making smaller Internet of Things (IoT) devices even smaller, and making web servers even more powerful.\n\nAtomera was founded in 2001 by Robert Mears with a vision to develop a platform of materials technologies for use across multiple industries. In response to the slowdown in the advancement of Moore's Law, Atomera used atomic level material science to develop Mears Silicon Technology which provides multiple benefits to industry participants. Moore's Law was an observation made by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965. Mr. Moore found the number of transistors on a chip doubles every year, but industry observers have suggested that the trend, which has lasted decades, may soon end. Atomera says that MST extends Moore's Law by allowing semiconductor manufacturers to improve power and efficiency within the same process node. For semiconductor designers Mears Silicon Technology improves performance and power efficiency while potentially reducing cost. For semiconductor fabs, the technology allows them to extend the life of their expensive manufacturing facilities by providing a new, unexpected suite of material improvements within existing process nodes. After several years of research to perfect the technology, Atomera is now engaged with leading semiconductor companies to integrate Mears Silicon Technology into their manufacturing flow.\n\nBusiness Model\n\nAtomera does not intend to design or manufacture integrated circuits directly. Instead, the Company develops and license technologies and processes that its management believes offers the designers and manufacturers of integrated circuits a low-cost solution to the industry's need for greater performance and lower power consumption. Atomera's customers and partners include:\n\nFoundries, which manufacture integrated circuits on behalf of fabless manufacturers.\n\nIntegrated device manufacturers, or IDMs, which are the fully integrated designers and manufacturers of integrated circuits.\n\nFabless semiconductor manufacturers, which are designers of integrated circuits that outsource the manufacture of their chips to foundries.\n\nOriginal equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, which manufacture the epitaxial, or EPI, deposition machines used to deposit semiconductor layers, such as the MST film onto the base silicon wafer.\n\nElectronic design automation companies, which make tools used throughout the industry to simulate the performance of semiconductor products using different materials, design structures and process technologies.\n\nAtomera's revenue model is based on licensing arrangements whereby its customers initially pay the Company a fee for an integration license that provides them the right to use MST technology in the manufacture of silicon wafers for internal testing and sampling. Atomera's management plans for each integration license agreement to be the first of a three-stage licensing process with the customer, with the first integration stage to be followed by one or more agreements granting them manufacturing and distribution licenses. These are referred to as the second and third stages, respectively. Atomera expects that agreements granting manufacturing and distribution licenses will provide for substantially larger upfront license fee payments than the integration licenses and distribution agreements will require licensees to make royalty payments to us based on the number and sales price of MST-enabled products they sell to their customers. Starting in 2019, Atomera began to develop deeper relationships with several large potential customers who were evaluating MST across multiple manufacturing processes and product lines. The Company has begun proposing an engagement format called a joint development agreement, or JDA, to certain customers. Atomera expects that JDAs will be customized to a particular customer's goals but that generally they will include development, manufacturing and licensing components.\n\nAtomera's management believes that the Company's success is dependent upon the adoption of its MST technology through the Distribution stage by at least one IDM, foundry, or fabless semiconductor manufacturer. In January 2021 Atomera entered into a JDA with a leading semiconductor provider for integration of its MST technology into their manufacturing process. The JDA includes the grant of an upfront, paid manufacturing license allowing the customer to install the recipe for Atomera's MST film into a tool in their fab and to fabricate semiconductor wafers incorporating MST for use in their products, as well as development milestones that, if achieved, could result in additional revenue to Atomera. Although this JDA does not confer commercial distribution rights, Atomera's management believes that successful execution would be a significant step toward commercialization and provide opportunities for additional license revenues and potential royalty streams from one or more of its customer's multiple production lines. On March 2, 2021 Atomera announced it advanced its previously announced JDA customer to the fourth phase of its customer engagement process, indicating that Atomera has delivered its MST IP transfer package in accordance with JDA contract. With this advancement, the JDA customer became the first Atomera customer to enter the fourth phase of the six-phase engagement process, which culminates in commercialization of MST-enabled wafers. Atomera currently has 25 engagements in its customer pipeline, consisting of nine in phase one, 15 in phase three, and one in phase four. In its corporate deck, Atomera lists Applied Materials (AMAT) among its partners, as well as Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN), Micron Technology, Inc. (MU), and Intel (INTC) as its target customers. Upon delivery of Atomera's IP transfer package and issuance of its invoice, the JDA customer will move from phase three into phase four. Subject to process and subsequent product qualifications that demonstrate, in commercial scale production, the enhancements the Company believes its MST technology offers, including increased speed, reliability and energy efficiency. Atomera expects to license its MST technology to one or more of these companies.\n\nThere are currently somewhere around 370 wafer fabs operating worldwide. The adoption of Mears Silicone Technology in one fab can make Atomera profitable from royalties alone. That being said, like a lot of growth companies, Atomera has a history of significant operating losses and the Company anticipates continued operating losses for at least the near term. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Atomera incurred net losses of approximately $14.9 million and $13.3 million, respectively, and its operations have used approximately $12.1 million and $10.4 million of cash, respectively.\n\nAtomera is also working with OEMs on process development and equipment optimization to ensure that MST can be reliably and predictably deposited using their manufacturing tools. The Company has successfully deposited MST using tools made by each of the leading epitaxial deposition equipment suppliers and management believes that if the Company is successful in its commercialization efforts, these tool OEMs will promote the incorporation of our MST technology as an option to their standard offering. By doing so, it is my opinion they will simultaneously stimulate additional sales of their capital equipment and encourage more customers to adopt MST.\n\nSemiconductor Industry Overview\n\nSemiconductors are included in so many everyday things that there is now a global shortage. The size of the semiconductor industry overall has grown to over $500 billion. As its overall size has increased, the equipment makers that feed it are better positioned to generate strong returns and have seen higher levels of free cash flow. Demand for chips will likely keep the overall sector growing and semiconductor manufacturers will need to continue to increase capital spending to keep pace.\n\nOver the last few years we have seen a tremendous expansion of consumer and commercial products, especially in wireless, automotive and mobile electronic devices. The growth of the Internet and cloud computing has provided people with new ways to create, store and share information. At the same time, the increasing use of electronics in cars, buildings, appliances and other consumer products is creating a broad landscape of \"smart\" devices and the evolution of wearable technologies and The Internet of Things. Due to the popularity of mobile devices and other electronic products, there is increasing demand for integrated circuits and systems with greater functionality and performance, reduced size, and much less power consumption as key requirements. During 2020, the global COVID-19 pandemic accelerated trends toward remote work, cloud computing and mobile devices. These trends coincided with the rollout of 5G cellular networks and 5G-enable devices.\n\nThese developments depend, in large part, on integrated circuits, or microchips, which are sets of electronic circuits on a single chip of semiconductor material, normally silicon. It is common for a single semiconductor chip to combine many components (processor, communications, memory, custom logic, input/output) resulting in highly complex chip designs. Transistors are the building blocks of integrated circuits and the most complex semiconductor chips today contain more than a billion transistors, each of which may have features that are much less than 1/1,000th the diameter of a human hair. The most widely used transistors in semiconductor chips today are based on CMOS technology. Among its many attributes, CMOS allows for a higher density of transistors on a chip and lower power usage than non-CMOS technologies.\n\nBetter Semiconductor Performance\n\nFor years, the semiconductor industry was able to almost double the number of transistors it could pack into a single microchip about every two years, a rate of improvement commonly known as \"Moore's Law.\" The semiconductor industry uses the term \"node\" to describe the minimum line width or geometry on a semiconductor chip, expressed in nanometers, or nm, for today's technologies. Historically, the smaller the node, the smaller the transistors and the more closely they are packed together, producing chips that are denser and thus less costly on a per-transistor basis. Frequently, smaller nodes also correspond to an improvement in chip performance, making them the mile markers of Moore's Law, with each node marking a new generation of chip-manufacturing technology.\n\nUntil recently, the industry succeeded at maintaining the rate of improvement predicted by Moore's Law by scaling the key transistor parameters, such as shrinking feature sizes and reducing operating voltages, thereby allowing more transistors to be packed onto a single microchip. This trend was facilitated in large part by the development of CMOS technologies. However, a discontinuity in the rate of improvement delivered by scaling appeared when transistor technology reached feature sizes below 100 nanometers. The industry responded with advanced materials to supplement the ongoing geometry shrinks. Some of those materials advances included strained silicon, Silicon-on-Insulator and High-K/Metal Gate.\n\nThe designers and manufacturers of integrated circuits and systems - Atomera's targeted customers - are facing intense pressure to deliver innovative products at ever shorter times-to-market, as well as at lower prices. In other words, innovation in chip and system design today often hinges on \"better, sooner and cheaper.\" Atomera's management believes that the semiconductor industry has accepted that moving forward in the nano-era will require adoption of new innovations that extend the scaling formula, including those based on the use of new engineered materials, a market opportunity our MST technology seeks to address. Because shrinking geometries at the smaller nodes incurs higher capital and manufacturing costs, only a limited number of companies can afford to continue investing in those nodes. In my opinion, these constraints will cause semiconductor designers and manufacturers to turn to engineered materials, like MST, to solve this problem.\n\nThe Short Story\n\nThe short interest in the stock may be the biggest catalyst of all. Shares of Atomera have been crushed over the past 10 weeks. As of March 31, 2021 there were 2,952,916 shares short, according to NASDAQ. The average daily volume on March 31 was 429,749 shares, which means it is going to take the shorts 6.87 days to cover. It will be interesting to see the numbers for April 15, which should be out soon. On April 7, 2021 NASDAQ published a news story on Atomera's ticker titled \"What Kind Of Investors Own Most Of Atomera Incorporated (ATOM)?\" Shares of Atomera have traded lower every day since then. The article was written by an organization called Simply Wall Street. Simply Wall Street is not based on Wall Street. Simply Wall Street is based in Sydney Australia. Its founder is a young man named Al Bentley. According to Mr. Bentley's LinkedIn profile he graduated from college in 2009 and he was a Graphic Graduate Engineer, a Naval Architect, and a Project Engineer. After reading the articles Simply Wall Street writes, I noticed every article is negative and bearish. Either Mr. Bentley is a very benevolent soul who wants to stop people from investing in what he thinks are bad companies, or he has an interest in seeing those companies' shares trade lower. This, of course, is just my opinion.\nIn my opinion, stocks with a tight float, solid insider ownership, and strong institutional shareholders have a lot of potential to trade higher when the shorts start to cover.\n\nSummary\n\nAtomera has a high margin, recurring revenue financial model. The Company also has a strong balance sheet, solid technology, and a patent portfolio that has increased 17% year over year and includes 269 patents granted and pending. Atomera is gaining traction with many top industry players and growing its licensee base. This gives the Company the opportunity to ramp up its commercial license revenues.\n\nAtomera has 23,006,449 common shares issued and outstanding as of its March 12 proxy filing. Out of the 23,006,449 common shares outstanding, institutional ownership is 26.02%, while management owns 14.4%. In my opinion, with almost 3 million shares short and a strong shareholder base, shares of ATOM could trade much higher in the near-term. The fact that the adoption of Mears Silicone Technology in one fab can make Atomera profitable from royalties alone makes Atomera a great long-term play. Atomera plans to release its first quarter 2021 financial results after the market closes on Wednesday, April 28, 2021. The company will host a live video Zoom webinar at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on Wednesday, April 28, 2021 to discuss the results. The live webinar can be accessed through Atomera's investor relations website at\u00a0Atomera Incorporated.\n\nInstitutional Ownership:\n\nhttps://fintel.io/so/us/atom\n\n[Intel - Supporting MST](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/progress-integrated-photonics-data-centers.html)\n\nhttps://atomerastockreport.wordpress.com/2021/02/20/atomera-atom-facts-and-figures-as-of-12-31-20/",

        "selftext": "The current microchip shortage caught the world by surprise and is causing shockwaves such as temporary closings of several large automobile. manufacturing facilities. The shortages won\u2019t last forever but have nonetheless attracted investor\u2019s attention to microchips and created a new focus on sustained manufacturing practices with a strong emphasis on innovation so America can regain its leadership in the crucial tech sector.\n\nNever has the semiconductor or \u201cchip\u201d sector been more competitive, with more than 750 companies vying globally to build the insides of cellphones or the next hot device or power future mega computers. Investors may find it tricky to navigate this sector, but this major new opportunity recently announced by US Nuclear Corp. (UCLE: OTC) could become red hot.\n\nThe basic building blocks of electric circuits have always been the same . . . diodes, transistors, resistors, capacitors, transformers and wires. Most of these components have been miniaturized and duplicated on a tiny microchip but capacitors remain a problem. They have just been too big to put on a chip and are usually placed on the larger circuit board. There have been a few micro capacitors, but their storage capacity is almost useless. But now with the US Nuclear/Grapheton \u201cGlassy Carbon\u201d Super Capacitor MicroChip, there appears to be a breakthrough that could put America back on top in terms of innovation.\n\nUS Nuclear\u2019s Grapheton \u201cGlassy Carbon\u201d Super Capacitor MicroChip is believed to be a major breakthrough in chip evolution and with micro capacitors that can be more powerful than today\u2019s clunky off-chip capacitors and several orders of magnitude more powerful than the micro versions now in use that have very little storage capacity.\n\nFrom Big Circuit Boards to Tiny IC Chips\n\nThe new \u201cGlassy Carbon\u201d super capacitor microchip appears to have the potential to make circuit boards that can be miniaturized even further thereby opening the door to smaller and smaller cell phones and electronic devices. This could be the major innovative breakthrough that the industry has been looking for.\n\nThe breakthrough came about as US Nuclear\u2019s strategic partner Grapheton was developing a microchip for human body implants that would not require a battery. Grapheton developed a chip that used the body\u2019s salinity to provide power for the chip and they also developed the tiny \u201cGlassy Carbon\u201d Super Capacitor MicroChip that could store several orders of magnitude more electric energy than current on-chip capacitors so the chip would never run short of energy.\n\nAfter developing this super capacitor microchip, US Nuclear and Grapheton realized that it has the potential to be used in all microchips in cell phones, automobiles, computers, televisions and pretty much all microchip applications",

AAPL -0.60% reported record revenue Wednesday for the January-to-March quarter because of surging sales of premium iPhones and pandemic-induced buying of its other products.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDemand for new, higher-priced 5G iPhones helped fuel a more than doubling of profit to $23.6 billion off $89.6 billion in revenue. On a per share basis, the company said Wednesday, Apple earned $1.40, beating analyst expectations of 99 cents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApple didn\u2019t provide any guidance in its release for this quarter. Chief Executive Tim Cook is expected to speak publicly with analysts this evening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInvestors are looking for signs that growth will continue, even as the tech sector struggles with a microchip shortage and other uncertainties stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. Some shareholders are evidently jittery. Shares rose 1.3% this year through Tuesday, while the S&amp;P 500 was up about 12%.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just so little room for error\u2014it makes it really challenging,\u201d said Dan Morgan, a senior portfolio manager who focuses on technology at Synovus Trust Co., which counts Apple among its largest holdings. \u201cThe market always looks six months ahead.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApple and other tech giants have benefited as students and workers stuck at home turned to their products in record numbers, pushing share prices to new heights. Apple\u2019s stock almost doubled last year. Its current valuation, as a measure of its price-to-earnings ratio, is the highest since December 2007, according to FactSet, ratcheting up expectations for the company\u2019s results.\n\nGoogle-parent Alphabet Inc. beat sales records in the latest quarter thanks to an increase in digital-ad spending, and Microsoft Corp. saw its quarterly sales increase 19%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven as the world\u2019s biggest tech companies continue to post record results, they remain in the crosshairs of regulators and investigators who are scrutinizing how they wield market power. Apple\u2019s strength in the market is being questioned by smaller tech companies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApple this week rolled out software changes to iPhones and iPads to make it harder for apps to track users across the internet, a measure touted by Mr. Cook as a consumer safeguard. Facebook Inc. and others have questioned Apple\u2019s motives in the matter.\n\nApple is on the eve of going to trial in federal court to defend itself against claims by the maker of the popular videogame \u201cFortnite\u201d that the iPhone company is engaged in anticompetitive behavior in its app store. Apple has denied wrongdoing. Observers are also watching for regulators in the European Union to reveal results soon of their investigations into claims of Apple\u2019s monopoly behavior. Apple has said the complaints are baseless and defended its role in promoting businesses on its App Store.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApple stopped providing detailed guidance about coming quarters last year, as Covid-19 upended daily life around the world and initially sent markets falling amid fears of a global recession. Still, analysts and investors will be looking for any signs of how Mr. Cook is feeling about the months ahead.\n\nCombined with the previous quarter\u2019s results, the Cupertino, Calif.-based company is on pace, according to analysts\u2019 estimates, to finish with an annual profit topping last year\u2019s record tally by more than 20%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMuch of the growth last year was fueled in unexpected places. Apple saw record demand for Mac computers and an 11% rise in iPad tablet sales. That growth continued in the March period. On Wednesday, Apple said Mac sales rose 70% to $9.1 billion and iPads increased 79% to $7.8 billion. That beat analyst expectations for increases of 27% and 29%, respectively.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe real engine of 2021 is the latest iPhone: Overall iPhone revenue rose 65% to $47.9 billion. Analysts had expected a 42% rise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHigher-end versions of the iPhone 12 appear to be boosting that figure. The average retail price in the U.S. during the past three months rose $52 to $847 from a year earlier, according to data from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners LLC, which surveys buyers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe most expensive version, the Pro Max with a 6.7 inch display that starts at $1,099, saw its share grow to 20% of sales from 13% a year earlier, the survey found.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe addition of faster 5G cellular connections to this year\u2019s phone was expected to help Apple in China, where competitors had beaten Mr. Cook to market with more advanced phones. Greater China sales nearly doubled to $17.7 billion.",

This will create a substantial boost to profits. Period. No questions asked. \n\nThey've been on a steady rise anyways, with record numbers the past few market days. \n\nAs for Renesas...theyre a microchip supplier worldwide. They're especially useful in the auto industry, vehicles can't run without their product. A month or so ago, an entire microchip factory burnt down. They won't be up to full production until early fall. They saw a dip as a result, but remain fairly steady.\n\nPrediction: q3 or q4 will see a substantial boost for both companies.

        "selftext": "First of all, I would like to say that in this analysys I did not want to dwell too much into the technical aspects of the PLTR's software product or the financial performance of the company.  I am well aware that those are one of the most important fundamental elements when valuing a business and I did spend a lot of time on them while doing my research, before ultimately deciding to invest in the company. However I believe that most of the redditors on this forum , especially those that are already investors, already have at least basic understanding of PLTR's financial situation and the specifications of its software. In this thesis I will try to give my perspective about why I think PLTR is a low bottom company with significant potential for growth, based on more \"abstract\" and less known factors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nFirst of all, let's take a look at the commercial side of its business. Currently BP and Airbus contracts are responsible for 20 percent of the PLTR's revenue and some analyst think that such high-concentration is bad. However, they said the same think about PLTR's government work when the stock debuted. In short, they said that it is very worrying that PLTR generates such a high-percentage of its revenue from the U.S government and tried to convince investors to value PLTR not as a soft company, but as a defence contractor. I am glad that I did not listen to them at that time and bought the stock at 10 dollars, cuz my thinking was that if the U.S government values the PLTR's software so highly it is extremely likely that commercial businesess will do the same. Do you get where I am going? If Airbus and BP are paying the company more than 100 million dollars combined per year, then that means that PLTR's software is extremely efficient and if used right, could potentially safe customers hundreds of millions dollars of expenses or lost revenue. If you want more confirmation about how important the software could be for the business, have in mind that when partnering with the U.S Agency for Disease Control and Prevention, there are rumours that as early as January 2020 Palantir was able to build confidential models that showed the potential for a rapidly rising outbreak. Palantir then rushed in mid-February to recall staff from abroad and order them into a four-week quarantine. Now imagine if you knew about this as early as PLTR. March puts for the win.\n\nEven forgetting about the software and PLTR's growing revenue, let's take a look at some other factors that can't be measured by financial modelling. Currently PLTR is the only SaasS company in the world that is in talks to receive Impact Level 6 certification from the DoD. That means that PLTR will have access to classified information. Yeah, that is the kind of information that if you share with unauthorised personnel you go to prison for commiting treason against the state. Furthermore, the marine that participated in the operation of killing Bin Laden said in his book that PLTR soft. was instrumental in the sucess of the mission. To top it off , PLTR's lobbyist include figures like retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Terry Pau and ex- US State Secretary Condoleezza Rais and the new Director of National Intelligence in the Biden admin- Avril Haines is a former employee. Well, I think that we can say with great certainty that PLTR has become extremely important for the U.S government operations. If history has taught us anything, it is that if  the U.S government values something , it will not shy away from spending millions of taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat. But it as not only the U.S government. PLTR has won numerous contracts with government agencies of other countries like the British NHS and PLTR's head of operation in Israel- Hamutal Meridor, served as senior director of Verint, with deep ties to Unit 8200. Unit 8200  is an Israeli Intelligence Corps *unit* of the Israel Defense Forces responsible for collecting signal intelligence (SIGINT) and code decryption.\n\nIf you are still not sure about PLTR's importance maybe you would like to know more about who is behind the company. Peter Thiel is a cofounder and the current largest shareholder. Yeah, that is right-Peter fucking Thiel. This guy was a business associate with Elon Musk in Paypal, he was the first investor in Facebook and a mentor of Zuckerberg and is a close friend of Chamath. He also bankrupted Gawker, cuz they had the audacity to leak the news that he is homosexual. Many people believe that he is one of the most well-connected men in the world and it comes at no surprise that he is a member of The Bilderberg group ( conspiracy theorists believe that these guys control the world) . I forgot to mention that his nickname is King Midas, cuz everything that he touches turns to gold.\n\nPalantir's other cofounder and current Ceo- Alex Karp is also a pretty interesting guy to say the least. He is a juris doctor from Stanford University, and a doctorate in neoclassical social theory from Goethe-Universit\u00e4t, Frankfurt, Germany. He is also a regular participant in the Davos economic forum. Oh, he also actively practices Tai Chi and Quidong. Yes, this guy actually studied the blade, how could you not trust him?\n\nTo sum it up, I will use Alex Karp's own words: \u201cWe are going to deliver the world\u2019s best software with the world\u2019s most efficient way of delivering it. Investors will decide what that\u2019s worth to them. And I think you\u2019ll find in a number of years that there will be a consensus: Palantir is a truly special software company that is arguably the most important software company in the world.\u201d -Karp the day they went public\n\nPS: English is not my mother tongue and I wrote this piece in a rush, so please excuse me if there are any grammatical or spelling errors.",

Autodesk's Role\n\n[Engaging with Industry 4.0](https://preview.redd.it/kz4g5qfd3zq61.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e45fab6fc951bf329cd89d8beccad8fe7504bb89)\n\n# TL;DR\n\nMeaningful, sustainable, long-term employment.\n\nThe current administration and Federal Reserve are continuing to progress in setting the stage for long-term investments in the American economy. In combination with the USMCA trade deal of 2020, the US will see 250B in investments over 8 years for infrastructure refactoring. We take a look at how Autodesk is a core benefactor of the economic models that govern these investments. I expect Autodesk to triple in size by 2024.\n\n[Autodesk Revenues](https://preview.redd.it/aj4qbyf05zq61.png?width=1276&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfff18884011a16bded7ba20d46e3772fad4a6fe)\n\n# Purpose\n\nTo be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts tend to run head-to-head with Wall Street analysts. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation.\n\n\\- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**\n\n\\- How do we compare social media incentives? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**\n\n\\- What really is customer service? **(GameStop DD Complete)**\n\n\\- Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern Rail DD Complete)**\n\n**-** What are elements behind US lagging industrial sector? **(You are here)**\n\n\\- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? *(Cloud Compute DD in Progress)*\n\n\\- Do we understand the consequences of STEAM education (Science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics)? *(Roblox DD in Progress)*\n\n\\- How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing my writing. I\u2019m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.\n\n# The Employment Problem\n\n&gt;The **Fourth Industrial Revolution** (or **Industry 4.0**) is the ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices, using modern smart technology. Large-scale machine-to-machine communication (M2M) and the internet of things (IoT) are integrated for increased automation, improved communication and self-monitoring, and production of smart machines that can analyze and diagnose issues without the need for human intervention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A Skill Gap Problem](https://preview.redd.it/sbi6dmoy6zq61.png?width=711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cad0f9dc367ce723290f7ae65f97f702812041d)\n\nUltimately, the US is doing a pretty good job at maintaining  its engineering and architecture sectors, but there has been a glaring issue with a skill-gap that effects certain regions more than others. This is largely due to the strained relationship between increase automation vs. difficulty of learning the new tools associated with automation. People get left behind, especially when employment is lost in one factory and a worker is left to join another manufacturer with different standards, machines, or tools. In a nutshell, the barrier to entry for sustainable employment in the industrial sector has gone up in almost every facet.\n\nTools like Autodesk sit at the heart of these kinds of problems, where being able to understand and utilize a tool like Autodesk will dramatically increase your ability to get hired. In the information age, skills associated with Autodesk are ultimately as valuable as learning how to code in software or knowing the value of legislation and finance in other white-collar sectors. Autodesk lags behind these competitive sectors because the nature of industry it exists in with high capital expenditures. \n\nThe problem is a bottleneck problem, and solving the bottleneck will produce a far leaner and more efficient pipeline for industrial productivity, employment, and societal satisfaction.\n\n*Processing img kvm8z2md8zq61...*\n\n# The Education Solution\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ly24pppuezq61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ab25ce2945104acb0f3c4d3816cb713db1af238\n\nThe reality here is that the education sector is also a slow-mover where shortcuts carry heavy competitive consequences. Another big element in this process is that high-level skills are ultimately dependent on adoption and communication demands. We need adaptable engineers to be familiar with a fundamental skill set that speak similar \"languages\". Autodesk has generally positioned itself to be one of those tools in a similar way that organizations like Adobe has positioned itself.\n\nWhat I believe will happen is that the incentive of certifications and accelerated programs will increase dramatically as a way to boost lucrative employment and adoption of skills. These training programs will effectively become tickets initiate a good career.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mj3rk4a2gzq61.png?width=2528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bde08f5487ed3afdd3a760fc1b3d7a019eb89ca6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xib18z21hzq61.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bb74a3b31dda0b750b0cb19fdfc4f97a2a4515b\n\n# AutoDesk's Role\n\nAutoDesk targets the EAC sector (engineering, architecture, and construction), so it helps to think about AutoDesk as software that can handle large scale developments focusing on the nature of smaller designs like intricate screws or cars. There is a lot of work that must be completed, with a strong societal demand. This can range from multi-year developments of hospital building in rural areas, or the construction of off-shore windmill farms. This inevitably creates a powerful compounding effect with employment and Autodesk's subscription model and increasing mobile capacities.  \n\n\n\\- As employment increases, subscriptions begin to increase.\n\n\\- As subscription increases, projects of scale are adopted.\n\n\\- As projects of scale increase, employment increases.\n\n\\- As employment increases, the length of subscription increases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vk4hin3cozq61.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b569a74582ac2699904727002ae3663f530a95c7\n\nThe following is a list of Autodesk's relationship with various opportunities in the near and longterm.\n\n\\- **LEED architecture certification in civil sectors with Autodesk's architecture platform, Revit.** \n\n&gt;**Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design** (**LEED**) is a green building certification program used worldwide.

        "selftext": "This post will detail some speculation on why believe Bitcoin will soon break 60k and potentially move to 70k within the next month or two. I'm fairly confident the bull run for Bitcoin is not over yet and will continue into this year before we see a correction.\n\n\\-Current Price of BTC around time of this post is around 58k-\n\n**External Catalysts**\n\nThe past few weeks there have been an onslaught of positive news for BTC . To name a few major ones:\n\n\\- Paypal is now incorporating use and everyday people can exchange BTC and other cryptocurrency.\n\n\\- Square, Tesla, and several other companies have included it in their balance sheet. Microstrategy essentially embraced their whole mission around it. Overstock accepts BTC as payment.\n\n\\- Spending will be high with the stimulus package and other bills under Democrats. BTC can be seen as a hedge to the dollar\n\n\\- Visa and other credit cards have also started incorporating it.\n\n*More importantly, there are major catalysts that will be coming this April that will likely propel it forward more:*\n\n\\- BTC ETFs are already being submitted by major institutions like Fidelity. When the GOLD ETF was introduced, the value of gold went on bull run the year to follow.\n\n\\- Coinbase IPO will be happening in April if there are no more delays. This one is **major**! Just the event will get the talk of cryptocurrency spread and be the chatter of the month.\n\n\\- Literally today Chipotle is getting in on the fun too with their Burrito or Bitcoin event: [https://newsroom.chipotle.com/2021-03-30-Burritos-Or-Bitcoin-Chipotle-To-Give-Away-200k-In-Free-Burritos-And-Bitcoin-To-Celebrate-National-Burrito-Day](https://newsroom.chipotle.com/2021-03-30-Burritos-Or-Bitcoin-Chipotle-To-Give-Away-200k-In-Free-Burritos-And-Bitcoin-To-Celebrate-National-Burrito-Day)\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n\nBTC this week reached almost 60k three times this week.\n\nKey levels of Resistance: 60k, 64.5k\n\nKey levels of Support: 53k, 51k\n\nSettling at 58k is very bullish at it means it is bouncing *above* the 9-day and 21-day moving averages. If it's able to hold this it should be able to get to around 62k. If it passes the mental wall there, it can easily surge to 70k before correcting. If it fails to support 55k then we could see a downside\n\n**Tickers that follow Bit Coin: $MARA, $RIOT, $CAN**\n\nI chose three tickers to focus on that will likely benefit from a rally. I know there are other ones like SOS, BTBT, FTFT but those are high risk from what I've seen having short reports written up on them. And when Bitcoin goes down, they go down hard. Let me know if there are any new tickers that follow Bitcoin too.\n\n**MARA**\n\n\\- Bitcoin mining company I've been following since it was 5$. Has strong support\n\n\\- Recent News: To Launch the First North American-Based Bitcoin Mining Pool.\n\n\\- Reached a 52week high over 50+ today\n\n**RIOT**\n\n\\- Same as MARA a crypto mining company I've followed since it was 10$. It's always been slightly ahead of MARA but it seems the gap is closing.\n\n\\- Recently reported GREAT earnings 300% surprise in EPS\n\n\\- Heavily shorted (20%) which may be why it has not been climbing as hard in following BTC, but will easily soar multiple levels if Bit rallies hard enough.\n\n\\- Reached over 70 last time BTC ran\n\n**CAN**\n\n\\- The only Chinese stock I singled out that could see a strong run correlated with Bitcoin if it were to run this month.\n\n\\- Canaan manufactures equipment used for mining Bitcoin. As the price rises, more and more companies are enticed to mine.\n\n\\- Reached around 40 last time BTC ran\n\n*Bearish Warning:*\n\n\\- In the past when Bitcoin has ran, there has always been a big correction afterwards. Invest at your own risk.\n\n\\- Offerings can happen if the price climbs too much",

Paypal is having issues just keeping their shit together with simple crypto transactions, people are pissed, moving to better providers like Square (which is also a great growth stock btw). The iGaming(online gambling) industry is already in the hundred billions of dollars per annum and Paysafe is a major payment processor at the forefront with a long and trusted track record if any of you are familiar with Neteller and Skrill formerly Moneybookers etc. \n\nIf BFT - Foley's track record on the other hand is any example of success, they can prop it up massively. The best of both worlds as BFT is also bringing insurance and investment holding companies along with it for some icing on the cake. \n\nPaypal is weakening and they are falling behind in these markets, they are too vanilla and wont touch any of this and are too busy un-clusterf*cking their already KYC users frozen or blocked btc transactions, besides people want ease of use without borders and no bullshit verification processes.

Digressing. With BFT hovering around $14-$17 which to be honest is a goddamn steal right now, once it transitions into PSFE I estimate it will hit $40+ within the first few months, with far reaching upside, smack in between 2 crazy global industries that are on fire rn: crypto and igaming.\n\nLittle ex employee insider information for you right there. \n\n Jk, as i said, its all public knowledge, but these payment providers are proverbial money printers and not the bad kind and with all the Casinos shifting their business online/covid/crypto/kids stealings mom's credit card betting on their favourite twitch streamers to win at CS:GO, Fortnite,half joking. I'd say most current online betting money is in sports and poker in the 18-40 age range, you get the odd rich Boomers who drop 40k a day on coin flips or how many injuries there will be in a game, sick shit like that, who bets 40k on a coin flip? The rest are grannies hitting slots.  \n\nThe US is also lifting a lot of sanctions Federally and by state IIRC, relating to online gambling; BFT/PSFE is practically a lock. I highly suggest to anyone pick up BFT stock asap or at very least get some early wet feet. I personally own a few hundred and plan to buy more.",

        "selftext": "Paysafe has finally just gone public with a new Board of Directors, much less debt, lots more cash, new M&amp;A plans and a new ticker: PSFE During yesterday's ticker change, there were several reports of people having no access to their accounts and/or suddenly being faced with an abrupt change in margin requirements from 25% to 100%. Many suggest this was intentional manipulation to give institutions cheaper shares. Regardless, this may have created a good buying opportunity for us too. For those interested, here's some comprehensive DD.\n\nPaysafe is a unique combination of fintech, iGaming, sports betting and banking all rolled into one stock. Whether you like him or not, this is essentially why NBC\u2019s Jim Cramer recently said, \u201cThere is something about Paysafe that may be the ultimate stock for this moment.\u201d (video link below) Market analyst Steve Grasso says, \u201cIt\u2019s the most excited I\u2019ve been about a stock in a long time.\u201d Grasso, by the way, has repeated called for it to triple ($45-50). So why is that?\n\nPaysafe offers a scalable electronic payment platform used by Draftkings, Roblox, Spotify, eToro, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, EA, 888, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Microsoft, Xbox, Amelco, William Hill, Ceasar's, Betfair, Pokerstars, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, bet365, Lotto among many others.\n\nPaysafe is ranked No. 2 globally in the digital wallet space with presence in 120 countries and No. 4 globally in integrated merchant processing.\n\nImportantly, Paysafe is the No. 1 global leader in iGaming eCash network (currently 36% of revenue) with 10-15X growth projected. US iGaming continues to be legalized state by state, growing revenue by 234% in just the last year. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is enabled for digital currency (a type that shall not be mentioned in these parts) without having to go through fiat. It recently partnered with Coinbase to expand options in US and it just launched PaysafeCash in US. (Now in 40 currencies and 30 global markets enabling easier cross border payments.)\n\nPerhaps most central to this recent merger is Bill Foley, Fidelity\u2019s Chairman of the Board and now the Chairman of Paysafe, who has a proven track record for generating exponential synergistic inorganic growth. For example, in just the last five years, he grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X) and he says, \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\nOf their expansion plans Foley says, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else.\u201d \u201cI have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody. That\u2019s why I got so excited about Paysafe Group Holdings Limited as its position in iGaming is really second to none.\u201d \u201cWhether it\u2019s a lottery or slot machines or sportsbetting opening in a state, it\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate. We\u2019re focusing on gaming, particularly sportsbetting, in the United States as it becomes legal and we\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d\n\nAlong with Bill Foley, Paysafe's newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO, a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International, a legal and regulatory expert in the multi-jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries, the CEO of Dun &amp; Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight, two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone and two senior Managing Directors from CVC,\n\nBetween the new Board of Directors, Bill Foley\u2019s proven expertise in rapid M&amp;A growth and Paysafe\u2019s massive market share and diverse assets, including the world\u2019s second largest digital wallet, $362 million in free cash flow, 30-35% margins (21% CAGR), a projected $100-110 billion in transactional volume and $1.5 billion revenue, it is inevitable that institutional investors will, by necessity, include PSFE in their portfolios.\n\nPaysafe\u2019s industry leading risk management and international regulatory expertise gives them an edge in spaces where competitors have hesitated like iGaming, sportsbetting, alternative currency trading as well as offering essential banking and ecommerce services to the \"unbanked\" (1.7 billion globally). Paysafe has a global platform with integrated cloud technology (Snowflake) allowing for easier migration of eCash, integration of payment methods and expansion into global banking as a service. Paysafe is so diversified that they've identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\nFurther, major investment funds know that fintechs are the future. Fund manager Cathie Wood says, \u201cFintechs are going to, we believe, gut banks.\u201d Similarly, Jackie Reses, board member of the SF Federal Reserve and fmr Head of Square Capital, calls for fintech \u201ctaking over and revolutionizing banking\u201d representing \u201ca wholesale transition\u201d of a $16 trillion market cap.\n\nAnalyst Michael Del Grosso recently initiated coverage saying, \"We believe PSFE represents a relatively scarce asset within the payments industry given its unique business strategy, geographical footprint, and focus on the iGaming industry. Our forecasts imply revenue growth at the high-end of management's guidance and we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming. PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States.\"\n\nInvestors should be aware that there is are post-merger lockup periods before insiders can sell their shares: PIPE: = 176 days. Private Equity = 86 days (roughly 6 and 3 months respectively accounting for trading days and weekends). Something to be aware of but there are several signals that these parties aren't in any rush to sell. Eli Nagler, a Senior Managing Director at Blackstone, recently said: \u201cToday is a significant milestone for Paysafe and a testament to the excellent work of their world-class management team over several years. We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.\u201d Regarding Blackstone and CVC, who now have four senior managing directors on Paysafe\u2019s Board, Foley said, \u201cThey rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn\u2019t take all their money off the table\u2026 All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.\u201d Also, the PIPE investors are primarily insurance companies known for long term hold strategies and they are closely associated with Bill Foley. As Foley recently said, \u201cHaving a large PIPE basically validates the transaction.\u2026 The companies that I\u2019m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset, besides the fact that it\u2019s a great asset.\u201d\n\nBill Foley says Paysafe may be his \u201cbest investment ever.\u201d He says, \u201cIt\u2019s a fortress. It\u2019s got a moat.\u201d \u201cWe have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise.\u201d\n\nAs an aside, even though, \u201cRoughly 75% of online gambling operators use Paysafe for processing payments\u201d many in the US haven\u2019t yet heard of it yet. Partially because much of its presence is in back-end processing. Through its several new partnerships (Coinbase, Microsoft Rentmoola), Paysafe is just now rolling out its offerings in the U.S. In Europe, where it is more commonly used, Trustpilot rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) with over 20,000 reviews, and Skrill (owned by Paysafe) 4/5 stars \u201cgreat\u201d with over 16,000 reviews, while competitor PayPal is rated \"poor\" only 1/5 stars with over 16,000 reviews. Further, Paysafe was winner of the American Gambling Awards\u2019 \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and owns Openbucks, Neteller and Skrill, 2019 winner \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for best consumer take up and most innovative technology with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d Also, Paysafe won \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award and the gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nTo give a sense of their pace and progress, these are some of Paysafe\u2019s recent announcements that were made before going public and have not been factored into the current valuation:\n\nDec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US\n\nDec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n\nDec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft\n\nJan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood\n\nFeb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership\n\nFeb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n\nFeb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n\nFeb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency\n\nFeb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n\nMar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n\nMar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n\nMar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet\n\nMar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments\n\nMar 25 -- Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands digital currency offering to US with Coinbase\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFortunately for shareholders, even before Foley\u2019s value creation play book is put into action, Paysafe is currently undervalued compared to sector peers.\n\nSince market analyst Steve Grasso continues to his repeat his calls for a triple ($45-50), I've looked more closely at EV / EBITDA, EV / Revenue and EV / Free cash flow multiples of sector peers, including PayPal, Nuvei, Repay, Shift 4, Adyen, Square, Affirm, Stripe, Chime and a few others, using cross-referenced data from Nasdaq, WSJ, Morningstar, Macrotrends, Yahoo Finance. The conservative average of those three multiples puts Paysafe\u2019s post-merger pro forma share value at around $46.52:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price using the average multiples from the full list of sector peers:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore realistic share prices, after eliminating all outliers with very high multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: Unlike Paysafe, nearly half of these publicly traded fintechs still do not report positive cash flow. Also, these multiples reflect a collective 27% pull back from recent highs so interest rate risks have been somewhat factored in.\n\nAlso, Paysafe's CFO noted that their conservative 11% growth projection is tied to the general fintech market at large. They have deliberately excluded both M&amp;A plans that are apparently already underway and US iGaming growth that may potentially grow 10x or more over the next 5 years. Further, the above comps include fintechs with slower or similar growth while still commanding much higher multiples. For example, Shift4 reported only 4% y-o-y growth and GPN's growth projection is on par with Paysafe's.",
