        "selftext": "*\"The Elder Days are gone. The Middle Days are passing. The Younger Days are beginning.\"*\n\n\u2015 Saruman the White\n\nSince most of you degenerates have joined during the middle days of WSB (post 1M), I thought it might be helpful to remind you the stories of some of the OG legends. \n\nu/1R0NYMAN**, the master of homeless box spreads**\n\n['no money at risk'](https://preview.redd.it/21yvujixo9971.png?width=635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a990f594a9a435a6d80e230bb87550ca2a6fe917)\n\n* Discovered an ancient spell of 'it literally can't go tits up' trading strategy called \"The Box Spread\", a multi-legged options strategy involving both buying/selling calls and puts at the same time.\n* Through his wiseness, he came to the conclusion that Box Spreads, if sold at the right time, can get him credit with 'zero risk' because his blood magic told him so\n* Out of all tickers, he chose $UVXY (because why the fuck not? It's not like Volmageddon ever happened). He was confident that he set up a play that would net him a guaranteed total of $38k of riskless profit in 2 years\n* Sold hundreds of Box Spreads on Robinhood using margin and gets paid a credit for each box spread. His account goes [from $5k of his own money to about $200k worth of risk](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/aeqcvt/i_dont_know_when_to_stop/)\n* Proceeded to withdraw $10k in cash, because who woudn't? \n* If a Box Spread gets held till expiry it's risk free, but that's not how option selling works because there is always assignment risk...and 1r0nyman completely forgot about that\n* To make it worse, Robinhood didn\u2019t pick up on the risk level of his box spread trade and actually echoed back to him that there wasn\u2019t a big amount of risk on the trade. Much like other elders here, 1R0NYMAN found a glitch/cheatcode in Robinhood which ultimately added even more fuel to the fire\n* Got assigned short shares, -$58k loss, account closed out. Robinhood banned box spreads after the fiasco and emailed its entire client base about its policy change as a direct result of what happened with 1R0NYMAN\n\nu/analfarmer2**, the paragon of financial degeneration**\n\n* analfarmer2, the 19-year-old somehow got access to a $100,000 trading account, he described as \u2018online biz and margin\u2019\n* His first FD was a $110k bet on $ALGN with 2DTE calls. The company announced a share buyback, and shares rocketed the next day gaining him $180k. His account went to $343k\n* A couple of days later our guy dropped $170k on1DTE  SPY puts, and again got insanely lucky as the market tanked after a Trump tweet about the Chinese trade embargo. [**His trading account was up another $277k up to $646k**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cksrsf/spy_puts_277k_profit_in_1_minute/)\n* He took another massive bet the following day, buying $600k worth of SPY calls 1DTE. analfarmer2 sold out of his position at a $500k loss. He made a few more unknown trades and found himself down to $41k\n* [**3 days later**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/co31pq/my_final_yolo_40k_into_cgc_calls_expiring_next/) he bought $40k worth of CGC calls in anticipation of earnings the following week. This was a more responsible trade -- he had an entire week until expiration, just imagine the possibilities. Earnings were shit, the stock tanked and his FDs were now worthless\n\nu/ControlTheNarrative, **the wizard of GUH!**\n\n* ControlTheNarrative was so wise that he managed to discover the 'infinite money cheat code' deeply embedeed into Robinhood's matrix and as a result redifined what some consider to be beyond their Personal Risk Tolerance\n* He so genius and so retarded at the same time that through his Robinhood Gold he took his leverage level to 25x \n* From an inital deposit of $2k (minimum balance to access RH Gold) he bought 100 shares of AMD for 3,800 or so, with margin. He then sold an AMD Call Contracts with a $2 strike to get almost all his money back. He then used that money to buy TWO hundred shares of AMD because remember, margin doubles the buying power, then he sold 2 Call Contracts witht he same $2 strike price to get almost all his money back, which is then doubled again thanks to Robinhood's Margin\n* Robinhood let him buy AMD stock on margin that is collateralized by AMD stock he's already sold. The AMD loop he went through made his buying power go up only because RH was absolutely retardedly (even more so than he was) still counting the AMD stock for his covered calls as part of his margin collateral to buy the options. He rinsed and repeated this process until sufficiently leveraged to his Personal Risk Tolerance (25x leverage)\n* Finally, he used his increased buying power to 'maximiz' gains by loading up on $AAPL put FDs to bet against Tim Apple. Unfortunately, $AAPL destroyed earnings and blew his account\n* To make matters worse, [he recorded the market-open and the instant nuking of his account](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/)\n\nu/MoonYachts**, the leverageborn**\n\n* Credit. Debt. Equity. Leverage. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when u/MoonYachts attacked. MoonYachts was a disciple of u/ControlTheNarrative. Through his master's teachings, MoonYachts also understood that when selling covered calls on Robinhood and if he bought the shares, the stock wasn't subtracted from the buying power. The cash balance from the covered call got added to his cash balance \u2013 increasing the buying power by the premium he took in.\n* Only the Fed Chair, master of all four elements, could beat him, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. And although his QE skills were great at the time, he had a lot to learn before he was ready to save anyone.\n* So it happened, that MoonYachts' Personal Risk Tolerance was from the netherrealm and not even the Fed Chair could match him at the time. By using the 'infinite money spell', he managed to take his [Personal Risk Tolerance to 250x leverage (a $1M leveraged position on $4k of initial equity)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drqaro/robinhood_free_money_cheat_works_pretty_well_1/) on $F stock\n* To this day nobody knows the ending of his adventures, but legend has it that banks still hate him for showing us the spell of infinite leverage",

        "selftext": "We have all read that \"it is not COVID's effect on people\", it is \"how businesses and governments react with restrictions\" .. that effects stocks.  Bored of this, heard it too many times?  Not scared any more?\n\nWell the virus and variants didn't get bored.\n\nReviewing the top five economies and their case trends -------------------------\n\nSource : Worldometers.info\n\nUSA:  new cases curving upward, especially in FL\n\nChina:  they lie about their numbers\n\nJapan:  new cases increasing at a roughly linear rate\n\nGermany: new cases growing again, though off of a low base\n\nFrance:  new cases surging and strong in the numbers, curving up\n\nUK:  new cases surged though showing signs of starting to drop\n\nKeeping your elder family members safe from your infecting them is still a cultural truth.\n\nOne political party in a given country wants to make another fail.  One party will weaponize the virus and threaten the other to take action.  This is what leads to restrictions.  Before it was the Democrats shutting down businesses to make the economy worse for Republicans.  Now it is the same, but Repub states will shut down and Dem states will want to keep businesses open.  In another country similar games will play out.\n\nSo all the potential economic shut downs are still there.\n\nWhat is different is that all the technology that was bought to have the kids educate from home, such as tablets and web cams and online meeting subscriptions don't need to be bought a second time so soon.  So the 2nd set of restrictions on the population comes without a sector that gets an economic boost.  The exception is grocery stores and online shopping.\n\nThe extra unemployment benefits end on Sept 6th in numerous states, but investors know that and would sell effected stocks sooner.  The moratorium on evictions ends this fall, and so tenants will stop the games and scramble to pay their landlords, taking away their spending money.  If they don't they will get an eviction on their credit record.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow to valuations\n\n[https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe)\n\nshows that the Schiller PE ratio of stocks is 38.3.  The .com bubble was the highest it ever got, higher than this level for 2.5 years, and getting to the mid 40's.  Other then that, at no time in history was this valuation ratio this high.\n\nNote also that in 1982 at the peak of interest rates 13 to 14%, the average stock had a PE of 7 to 9.\n\nA book by O'Shoughnessy \"What Works on Wall Street\" studied 40 years of stock market data.  Its results shows that a price to sales ratio is 'the king of value factors', since sales can't be manipulated like earnings can.\n\n[https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales)\n\nshows that this valuation is higher now than at any time charted.  The book suggests that a price to sales of 1.5 is considered a good deal.  We are over twice that level on average.\n\nThe market breadth has eroded under the mega techs.  Not the Russel 2000 declined recently.\n\nHere are the price to sales of the mega techs, using data at Reuters.  This can be hard to find in navigation, but a direct link will help, for example\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.N](https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.N)\n\nuse .N and .O at the end of the symbol for NYSE and NASDAQ.\n\nprice to sales:\n\nMSFT = 13.3 ; FB = 10.4 ; AAPL = 7.5 ; AMZN = 4.3 ; GOOG = 8.76 ; NVDA = 25.2 ; AMD = 9.5\n\nThese clearly can fall and still be overvalued.\n\nSome have sighted the growth in the money supply, such as M2, as part of what has pushed the market higher.  However, it is important to note that M2 was recategorized in 2020.  So even though you can go to the Mises Institute's site and see articles of big increases in the M2 money supply, much of that is due to the recategorization and strangely the articles omit this but for a footnote.\n\nInflation ----------------------------------------------\n\nA large part of what we pretend to understand about inflation is the CPI and PCE.\n\nWe think that we know that the last CPI reading was 5.4%.  That is above the target of 2% of course when action by the recipe is needed.  This coupled with Powell not wanting to raise rates and desiring to de-prioritize inflation is \"bad enough\" from a stock perspective.  Jim Cramer described Powell as \"having a heart\" in wanting to prioritize helping people back to work.  Recall that interest rates have to be jacked up in response to inflation eventually.  Acting to late makes it worse.  From business school texts, higher interest rates put downward pressure on the value of future earnings.  Thus the forward looking value of stocks drops.\n\n  But I challenge all of you to take the CPI by its percentage components and REBUILD it yourself with online research.  I did.  While the published number was +1.6% year over year at the time, I found no component less than 2%, and most were a good deal higher.  It is easy to find information showing education expenses rising at a +5% annual rate for many years.  Medical costs I found web sites saying +4% annually consistantly over many years.  At the time, only oil was lower than 2% price growth.  Today, with oil back up above $70 a barrel, that is not to be taken lightly.\n\n  Recently the Fed has emphasized the PCE, the Personal Consumption Expendatures index.  Do you find as I do it strange that they publish the 'this month vs last month' number, making it look like small 0.1 to 0.3% rise, and not the more useful year over year number, which would show a larger % increase?\n\n  The National Debt takes no small part in the desire to have inflation be low and keep interest rates low.  But that combination is impossible over time.\n\n  I have been at individual stock investing since 1996 and I have sold most of my stock holdings.  I lived through the .com crash which I took on the chin (with small dollars since I was young and I learned from it such that I was 66% in cash for the crash of 2008.  If you have not been in the habit of thinking about economic impacts, valuations, and questioning what real inflation is, it is certainly time to start.\n\n  The great bull market of the 1980's in the USA was spurred by the acceleration of women entering the work force and the personal computer.  The great bull market of the 1990's was spurred by implementation of the internet, immigration, and foreign economies developing.\n\n  What is the story now?  5G networking is just a faster version of the same thing, but only over shorter distances.  Artificial intelligence is intended to replace humans.  Electric vehicles only reduce pollution after 100k miles according to an article in the WSJ.  I think to move on to much higher valuations we need a big economic story that just isn't there right now.",

It's the only viable options play I can come up with that ends up either being indifferent to IV crush or benefitting slightly from it. From what I understand you can also go deep ITM and survive the crush just fine as the closer your Delta gets to 1 the less effect it has on you. I would be interested in learning any other viable strategies, especially a strategy that can prosper from the move itself, without having to choose up or down. Correct me if I am wrong but straddles and strangles get crushed along with straight calls and puts, correct?\n\n2) Plays\nBased on past  moves and general market sentiment, especially predicted move base on option pricing, here are my thoughts on plays I'm hoping will print for next week. I appreciate all constructive feedback. Or even non constructive. \n$AAPL DOWN 4%\n$TSLA DOWN 5%\n$SBUX UP 3%\n$AMD DOWN 1% then UP next day 4%\n$GOOGL ? %2\n\nI have some light DD on these I am willing to debate with people, brings on your thoughts or any other juicy looking low hanging fruit for next week. I don't have a large account for next week's plays so I will probably pick the 2 I think most likely to print from different sectors and maybe a small call or put on an index containing one of them. Or maybe a collaborative play on QQQ going down as a lot of the names I am interested in are tech companies.",

        "selftext": "I bought INTC when I first started investing a few months ago when it was trading at $67, but looking back, I probably did so on past reputation instead of current situation (this was when I just learned how to research stocks, so I only looked at a few simple numbers like P/E ratio).\n\nI know the company right now isn't in the best of shape, having squandered its position atop the semiconductor totem pole, and while it's easy to kick it when it's down, is there anyone who truly believes that it can turn around and gain back what it's lost? Sure, it may take a year or more (barring a miracle), but we've seen AMD give Intel a run for its money before (though never to *this* degree), and Intel managed to recover. Plus, the current CEO looks like a huge upgrade over the last guy; not only is he an engineer, but he'd been with the company decades ago when it was just starting to become the behemoth it would eventually be.\n\nDo I have a valid reason to be hopeful, or is it just wishful thinking at this time because I can't stand to see the stock at $56 when I bought it for $67?",

Your portfolio has been jumping between positive and negative all-time. I\u2019m not worried and you shouldn\u2019t be either. \n\nI would assume that most people finding themselves in this scenario aren\u2019t index fund or \u201csafe\u201d investors. You\u2019re trying to build a high growth portfolio for the long term like I am. \n\nFor reference, here is my portfolio breakdown:\n\n\u201cSafer\u201d steady growers - HON, WMT, ABBV, GE, SONY, CLF, NEE*, and BHVN*. I see NEE and BHVN as safer compared to the other high growth stocks I own. BHVN has a very promising pipeline of drugs and has grown a lot as of late. NEE may be the most promising renewable energy company in the market. \n\nMega-cap tech - AAPL and GOOGL.\n\nMore speculative, high-growth - BABA, AMD, ZG, NIO, NOK, PSFE, PLTR, SOFI, DKNG, MTZ, ETSY, and STEM.\n\nThat\u2019s my portfolio. 22 positions as of now. Out of those, here are the ones I\u2019m currently negative in - BABA, ZG, PSFE, PLTR, SOFI, DKNG, MTZ, and GE. Besides GE, the rest of those are more speculative and more or what I would consider high growth. That\u2019s what has been getting hit as of late. I\u2019m not worried because I am confident these companies will do well long term and the stock prices will inevitably go up. In the short term, I\u2019ll continue to average down through DCA. I\u2019ll grit my teeth through the risks of inflation and rising interest rates. Short term it may be rough, but long term I think it will pay off. I will not sell any of these companies. I may add a few \u201csafer\u201d companies or buy up some VTI, but I think this aggressive approach will be well worth it.",

With the release of Ryzen, AMD began climbing from the depths in 2016 and started it\u2019s steroid cycle in 2019.\n\t- Historically Q3 has been AMD\u2019s best quarter by far, the fact that AMD crushed it in Q420 w/ $2.2 billion in q/q growth and then beat out Q420 by another 2 billion in 2021. \n\t- AMD has achieved these numbers DESPITE fucc boi COVID-19 and significant shortages/ manufacturing challenges.\n\t\n**The Balance Sheet Quick Glance**\n\t\n\t- $3.116 Billion in cash/ cash equivalent, up $826 Million q/q and up $1.731 Billion YoY (LOL GAWT DAMN THAS SUM GROWTH)\n\t- Debt $313 Million, down $17 Million q/q and down $175 Million YoY\n\t- Inventories $1.653 Billion, up $254 Million q/q and up $597 Million YoY\n\t- Accounts receivable $2.178 Billion, up $112 Million q/q and up $487 Million YoY\n\n\tAMD has a very strong balance sheet and continues to grow as a company, further proof that AMD is well on its way to the moon.\n\n**Financial Outlook Quick Glance**\n\n\t- 2021Q2 expected earnings $3.6 Billion, historically they beat their estimates by a small bit\n\t- 2021 expected earnings is 50% YoY Growth ($14.65 Billion) \n\t- Gross margin for YoY is not expected to change\n\t- Operating expenses are expexted 27% for the year\n\n**Q1 and Beyond Thoughts**\n\n\tAMD has been doing tremendous and has done nothing but grow as a company since Lisa Su took over in 2014. AMD\u2019s last 1.5 years are a sign of what\u2019s to come, I believe they will be on this incredible run for the rest of year and possibly into next before they start to slow down.

        "selftext": "Part of me has never been more confident in the future of the semiconductors. At the same time I am worried Wall Street will be unimpressed with future earnings. A company can make a bazillion dollars in profit but if they say one bad thing then Wall Street throws a fit. \n\nRegardless of what Wall Street thinks, the future of technology is dependent on semiconductor chips. \n\nFor example Micron (MU). I thought their earnings call was very positive. They had a huge beat on earnings and it sounds like their future is very bright. The CEO made is clear that as cloud storage and EV vehicle usage increase in the coming years it will be very beneficial to Micron. The future of technology relies on cloud storage and the future of transportation is electric and computerized. Its concerning that MU went down over 5% on heavy volume today. Sure looks like a heavy resistance. \n\nThen you have Nvidia (NVDA). Arguably the industry leader and growing like crazy. They are still waiting on approval on the Arm deal which I would expect to go through. It recently brokeout HUGE. I mean what? Up 21% in one month for a company that size? Thats unreal. \n\nAMD just recently broke its trading range and on its way to 100. I am concerned that volume was not as big as it was when it broke through but the catalyst of the Xlyinx deal going through should be enough? Its apparent AMD is beating Intel in their sub-sector and Intel is over 100 billion large in market cap. Will AMD be able to continue the breakout? I dont know why they wont be able to. \n\nTSM has been consolidating for awhile. I cant see any reason it would break to the down side except for a hostile take over of Taiwan by China. Then either its game on between China or the US or the US backs down like they probably will cause, I mean it would be bad business for Apple, Starbucks, Tesla, Costco, and other American companies trying to grow in China. \n\nHow are all of you approaching this situation? If youre not thinking about this industry as a 6 month to 1 year play then idk what I am doing. I got call options on AMD and Mu expiring in October and December and a few in March of next year.",

        "selftext": "^(I'm  not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advise. This is  an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard  posting on WSB  with a bias due to having a very large position of my portfolio in $F.  So, Don't act on anything posted in here and proceed on your own risk...)\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0fERECTION ALERT!\u26a0\ufe0f** Before reading this post, make sure that you are wearing sweatpants/Bras because you're guaranteed a sustained penile/nipple erection throughout your reading. So, Don't embarrass yourself in public...\n\n5 months ago, I spent so much time on part 1 and 2 and after posting them, I sadly realized that people are lazy \ud83d\ude02 Apes don't want to read mountains of DD, They just want a 5th grade level TLDR. This Ape got you, I will try to make this DD a longer version of a TLDR! I'll try to make it concise and to the point as much as possible.(5 hours later, I failed at this objective lol)\n\n**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**\n\nFor the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.\n\nOn May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video). It has all the features crucial for it's **target buyers** (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's **a Truck which actually looks like a Truck.** \u201cFord knows what pickup owners want,\u201d IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.\n\nThe reservation now have exceeded 120,000 since it's debut. An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that **about 75%, or 90,000, are new to Ford, according to the company!** If anything, this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition. almost every car manufacturer can make an EV, but only a few (I can count on one hand) can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality.\n\nNow Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **\"Potential(because they don't exist yet)\"** competitors with superior car features. \n\nIt's relevant to mention that Ford's EV sales (counting electric vehicles and hybrids) increased 177% during June, capping off 56,570 units sold so far in 2021.\n\n**As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...**\n\n^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)\n\n**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**\n\nFord-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now \ud83d\ude02(Ford is 55.64B at 14.18$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with **the most recent news being 902$million in Q1 of 2021.**\n\n**On Jul 23, it was announced that Rivian closed a $2.5 billion funding round,** led by existing investors **Ford**, Amazon and T. Prior to it, they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U.S States started submitting bids on it.\n\nFarley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** \"but that's not why we invested,\" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.\n\nFarley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too **with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car**. He understands that **the first move is the most important one in the EV Game,** and with the Mach-E and F-150, Ford executed it's moves perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices, high quality, while maintaining the demand(something which Tesla still isn't able to). Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3- Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands:**\n\n Prior to the release of the Bronco, it had 190,000 reservations. **66% of the reservations were converted to sales!** Additionally, Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70% of the 125,000 orders it has are customers of other brands. \n\nAccording to Ford, dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of **15 days!,** with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep. People are killing to get their hands on one. just go on Ebay and see for yourself. Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K$. \n\nI would understand PS5 scalpers, but that happening with Cars, I never would've imagined. This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it's 2021 Revenue expectation from $3.5 billion, to between $9-$10 billion and they'll probably raise it again in the next quarter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4- Ford's Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy:**\n\n\u201cFord clearly has business and government fleets in mind,\u201d Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.\n\nFord revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it\u2019s equipped with a standard battery that\u2019s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, which is the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.\n\nFord's vision to lead the EV market has a \u201cno-brainer\u201d component Elon Musk lacks: Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery-powered trucks and vans. Ford\u2019s focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company\u2019s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts. They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F-150. They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach.\n\n# 5- Valuation and Price target\n\nYes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.\n\n$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple\n\n(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- outdated)\n\nTSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X\n\nNIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)\n\nGM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X\n\nF - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X\n\n**(Important part starts here)**\n\nAs you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.\n\nIf you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.\n\n At that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83e\udd85**.\n\n**Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it's just starting!**\n\n[Ford Price Target Forest illustrated with crayons](https://preview.redd.it/9lbgo0lg7de71.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eea5e203cda0de8a7a7856c4f3475d0abc536519)",

        "selftext": "Hello guys! So I developed a program to track growth in reddit mentions regarding stocks. The tool scraps all the posts in various subreddits and tracks down what stocks the posts are mentioning.\n\nPlease note that this post contains stocks that are growing in mentions compared to the previous week, not meaning that these are the top mentioned stocks this week. Also, keep in mind that the tool tracks multiple subreddits. \n\nThis week the following stocks got a significant growth in mentions: $SOFI, $AMD, $SPCE, $COIN, $MU.\n\nRegarding $SOFI, there was a big jump in mentions in the middle of the week, which was correlated with a 4% increase in the stock price, but since then mentions and price are down. The sentiment was overall positive, going down 32% saturday.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fi7ho6tek8971.png?width=1743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b7d58881cb8a09af1c87c2457a2a85116e01c58\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gr4o6pkfk8971.png?width=1577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0df53b75bef1cda1cad380c7ea84d2ab35ccc88\n\nRegarding $AMD,  the 7-Day average is up 74%, with a growing conversation until thursday, going down since then. The sentiment is however, very positive around this stock.\n\nThe stock price accompanied the mention growth, stabilizing when the conversation cooled down.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mhcsbcdkk8971.png?width=1737&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=425d4c0956cec9290d9a39bc6821c2c6036ecbb4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yonq68j1l8971.png?width=1568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7ba6f7b4e8a9f3c61be5a17c051a8692e661c76\n\n$SPCE also saw some decent conversation this week, following last week's growth in the end. The sentiment for yesterday is 50% ( = null) since there was no posts about ir. For the remaining of the week there was a decent growth.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0663z6e6l8971.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=947670f9998345fcdc06008f1a02576f43a7c9dc\n\n$COIN is also growing in mentions, with the sentiment around the stock being variable along the week, but growing in the past 3 days. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tozrdtahl8971.png?width=1726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=636eb5e0ead69ce5d27ce86186866d4538cb5bf6\n\nFinally, but not the least, a big growth in conversation around $MU, with over 300% growth compared with last week. The sentiment, in average is also quite positive. This happened following a 10% rally by MU until Thursday, falling down to a 4% rally wow at the end.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vews8ynml8971.png?width=1731&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4012322e03a991a064a0ba4abd1f78f6d22210d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you enjoyed these graphs guys.

        "selftext": "Over the last four years or so AMD has come a long way. From under $6 a share to over $90 a share is a huge achievement, especially in this market.\n\nAs we all know that AMD has been eating away at INTC server market share for a while now. It's about time that things should start getting accelerated, especially how INTC has failed overcome their challenges with 7nm design etc.\n\nAMD's ER is coming up on Tuesday, and I am against playing a binary event.

        "selftext": "I'm looking into NVDA to see if I should buy now or not.  \nHere's my analysis - please give me any comments whether I'm right or wrong! :D  \n\n\nNvidia(NVDA). If you use any technology at all, you\u2019ll probably know NVDA. Let\u2019s cut to the chase, after three days drop in a row (from 835 to 726), people are starting to ask: Is it a good time to buy the dip? Short answer is: Not yet, but close.   \nNote: there\u2019s an upcoming 4-for-1 stock split on 7/20.\n\nAbout NVDA \n\nObviously, graphic cards. Recently it\u2019s expanding in AI chips, supercomputers data centers, drug development, driverless car, aaaaaand last but not least: C\\_\\_p\\_\\_o Mining. They even made a C\\_\\_p\\_\\_o-mining-dedicated graphic card (CMP). In addition, with NVDA\u2019s newly developed CPU for high-end computing and AI applications, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if NVDA became a major competitor of Intel and AMD. \n\nIs NVDA making money ACTUALLY?\n\nHell yeah it is. Here\u2019s a quick look   \nNVIDIA revenue for the quarter ending April 30, 2021 was $5.661B, a 83.8% increase year-over-year.  \nNVIDIA revenue for the twelve months ending April 30, 2021 was $19.256B, a 63.49% increase year-over-year.  \nNVIDIA annual revenue for 2021 was $16.675B, a 52.73% increase from 2020.  \nNVIDIA annual revenue for 2020 was $10.918B, a 6.81% decline from 2019.  \nThere\u2019s not much to say, it\u2019s got a really diversified and great business portfolio. \n\nIs NVDA worth investing/ trading?\n\nIf you have seen my previous articles on other stocks, you\u2019ll know I rarely feel so bullish and positive about a company like this one. NVDA will be the biggest part of my position in the near future. Great revenue growth potential, great new business outlook. When is a good time to buy you ask? Either long term or swing trade, I\u2019d probably wait until a bounce back AFTER the dip is CLEARLY over.",

        "selftext": "**Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation and Analysis (Q2 Week 3) - $TSLA, $AAPL, $AMZN, $MSFT, $GOOG, $FB, $AMD, and More**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat's poppin' bull gang, I hope you made some awesome money last week! The spreadsheet was spot on for nearly every company, and all of my plays came to fruition! **$MT and $X ended up bagging us anywhere from 300% to 500%, $JETS gave us 1100%, and $SNAP netted us 250% on our strangles and nearly 600% on binary options!** I\u2019m looking to keep this momentum going throughout this week as well, and with all of FAAMG (I kicked $NFLX out for $MSFT after their disgraceful earnings) set to report, this week could prove to be more lucrative than the last! We\u2019ve got a large variety of trades we can make this week ranging from educated gambles, to good old fashioned theta plays. We\u2019ve even have a couple of opportunities to sprinkle in some collateral plays if we wish! Let\u2019s get into it! \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Pinterest is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $PINS has had an average post earnings move of **14%**. The options this week are pricing in a move of *roughly 6%* on both sides of the chain, which is likely going to shrink significantly going into earnings as theta eats away at the contracts. Even though I\u2019m extremely bullish on $PINS, this trade could honestly move either way, so I\u2019m personally opting to play a straddle like I did with $SNAP last week. Given that we get a historically average move, we\u2019ll be making some money on this trade. Keep in mind, this trade *is* riskier than the one we played on $SNAP, since the average historical move is smaller. Don\u2019t over leverage yourself, and don\u2019t be afraid to turn the straddle into a reverse iron butterfly to reduce your cost basis on the trade.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Over the past 24 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time!** The odds on this trade are phenomenal, and we have quite a few options for how we want to play it.  If you want to gamble directionally, call debit spreads would be your best bet from a risk to reward standpoint. Alternatively, we can also join theta-gang for this play by selling ATM put credit spreads allowing us to net some extremely nice premiums. If you want an even safer spread, $MSFT also has a similar win-rate (~65%) while having a historically smaller move, allowing you to defend your capital in the event that the trade goes against you. Since both $SHOP and $MSFT report on different days, we can look to make this play twice to ensure we\u2019re not overleveraged on any given day.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Counterintuitively, $XLE is NOT a good [collateral play](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays) this week!** $XLE actually has a *higher* IV than both $XOM and $CVS, so if you wanted to play oil earnings, you\u2019d actually be better off rolling the dice on the individual companies. I\u2019m not sure why this is the case here. Either the MMs are catching onto my bullshit (unlikely), or there\u2019s some nuances to trading oil that I\u2019m not aware of.  I\u2019m sure there\u2019s an arbitrage play you could make regarding the individual price and IV differences proportional to the ETF holdings, but I don\u2019t have time to crunch the numbers nor do I think I\u2019d have enough capital to abuse it. Regardless, I just wanted to bring this to everyone\u2019s attention since this is one of the rare cases where the collateral play puts us at a disadvantage.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll that being said, I haven\u2019t had much time to review any extra trades given that I\u2019ve been extremely busy this weekend. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nWe\u2019ve got another fun week of earnings ahead of us! I personally tend to avoid playing FAANG stocks in general, so my analysis was concentrated elsewhere. If you see any appealing plays, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you\u2019d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**",

        "selftext": "**The DD:**   \n\n\nOK, look... I'm not a financial advisor, or a stock broker, or anything like that so take my DD here with a big grain of salt. This is not financial advice. Do your own DD. Don't listen to a random dude on the Internet. You may lose money in the stock market. yada yada... if you lose your ramen noodles, I'm not to blame.  \n\n\nAnyway, about a week and a half ago I was passively playing AMD stock buys during a work meeting and decided to do a little TA and noticed that there seemed to be a settling of the bottom end of a handle on a 4-month+ cup and handle formation in the classic form (round, not V-shaped) for AMD. I predicted that it might enter an upward swing in the next couple of weeks, which based on the classic cup and handle logic could run for up to 20 points.  \n\n\nThen red Monday happened, and AMD ran green while almost everything that wasn't a COVID-fix stock ran red.  \n\n\nThen AMD ran up the whole week. The trend for last week perfectly matched the cup and handle classic expected trajectory, and this is not just based on the graph. AMD had a solid consolidation phase in the mid-80s. The company has amazingly high sentiment not just in the gaming community, but across the tech field in general. They have multiple products in high demand AND in shortage. The sell-off position which started the cup makes sense as a profit-taking driven trend. The consolidation phase, being long and having a solid spike in the middle, represents a strong acquisition of solid holders for the stock, and the accumulation buy-in period makes sense on the right-end of the cup as an accelerated buy cycle matched with a gamma swing in buy volume.  \n\n\n**I DREW SOME SHIT WITH CRAYON ON THE GRAPH, WANNA SEE?**\n\nTA is guessing at best, or finding things that fit your requirement, but when you see TA come up with a perfect classic pattern, you should take notice because either it's being formed by actions, it's natural and people running algorithmic response have see it and are now behaving based on the pattern (I work in fintech, I know how these people think).\n\nThe decline on the right of the cup makes sense as a patterned sales cycle for profit-taking with a little exit escape because of the run, but this isn't people running from the stock due to a catalyst. The prior run up matched Fibonacci buying sequences, hitting resistance at $95 just like the first spike did.  \n\n\nI don't put a huge amount of value in just reading the graphs here, and often fib retracements just don't work, but with the stock price adjustment, a $96-97 stock resistance point following a $95 resistance point makes some degree of sense, and it also makes sense that algorithms would identify the same cup and handle trend here.  \n\n\n**What are people buying on the options market?**\n\nLook at the options chain for July 30th. All calls are green, and up by a large amount, and all puts are running red with most in the negative double digits.   \n\n\nThere's a MASSIVE number of calls waiting ITM on AMD for the end of next week, culminating at $135 at the $865million range IF the stock went above $135 at the end of the day.  \n\n\nOf course, it won't do that, but $301m are already ITM at the current strike price, and look at the capitalization values of all calls at each of these ranges:  \n\n\nAll current ITM contracts: $301,237,250.00\n\n$95 strike price:   $209,095,300.00 ($510,332,550.00 total)\n\n$100 strike price: $224,474,900.00 ($734,807,450.00 total)\n\n$105 strike price: $37,201,500.00 ($772,008,950.00 total)\n\n$110 strike price: $38,335,000.00 ($810,343,950.00 total\n\n$115 strike price: $38,444,500.00 ($848,788,450.00 total)\n\n$120 strike price: $2,112,000.00 ($850,900,450.00 total)\n\n$125 strike price: $3,525,000.00 ($854,425,450.00 total)\n\n$130 strike price: $5,395,000.00 ($859,820,450.00 total)\n\n$135 strike price: $1,606,500.00 ($861,426,950.00 total)  \n\n\nOf course, many of these are covered calls and there will be lots of sells competing, so I don't expect all of these to add their value to the stock as it runs, but that's a lot of buy happening with the stock at the end of next week (and during the week if people exercise these calls), and that's not even taking into account the large amount of open interest in these options over the next week. Remember, too, brokers generally assign ITM options even if they expire because who's going to turn down profit?  \n\n\nThe standing ratio of calls:puts next week already ITM is 1.33:1, meaning the market is better for AMD and a gamma little gamma event may be in the works.  \n\n\nThe wildcards I see are:  \n \\- Earnings on Tuesday  \n \\- The FOMC meeting  \n \\- Any random event which scares people on any given day.  \n\n\nAMD did drive up during red Monday last week, though. Approaching Tuesday may be a bulltrap, so set your stoplosses if you're in the stock and feel it's necessary. Who knows what the Fed meeting will do to this stock market (anyone who tells you they know is lying, but odds are there will be panic even if it's just JPOW seeing his shadow).   \n\n\nSo buyer beware, but if you're asking if there's any patterns suggesting AMD can run this week? I'd say these qualify. If this stock breaks $95-$100 this week, interesting things will happen.",

        "selftext": " \n\nIn response to DD posted earlier today by [u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/), I saw an opportunity to steal the show for myself. (Kidding, [u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/) did fantastic work and you can find their post on $AMD financials rightttttttttt: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe88ub/amd_su_bae_witness_me/h45ifrd/?context=3).\n\n$AMD is easily my fav stock and I'm perpetually bullish on it, however there's a lot of catalysts that will have effects on $AMD both negative and positive at all stages. I'm not passing this on as financial advice, just my opinions:\n\n**Chip Shortage**\n\nThis one is the most significant situation in regards to semiconductors and the wider tech industry. In many cases it helps the bullish argument since $AMD (and[ also $NVDA](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nvda/earnings) but fuckem) continues to exceed earnings estimates despite the rough environment. The[ expansion of $TSMC into America](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-says-construction-has-started-arizona-chip-factory-2021-06-01/), in my opinion, is going to launch $AMD into the fuckin' stratosphere over the next couple of years. Though still based in Taiwan, TSMC is one of the biggest players in global semiconductor production. As of March, $AMD was [\u201cTSMC\u2019s number one customer in regard to purchasing 7nm wafers\u201d](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-overtakes-Apple-as-TSMC-s-main-7nm-customer.528532.0.html). \n\nAdditionally, let\u2019s talk about the economic giant we call China. I\u2019m an International Relations student so this is right up my ~~asshole~~ alley. While current President Biden has mentioned reversing some of the hardline policies of his predecessor President Trump, however there has been little evidence of progress towards that goal. Two weeks ago, the Biden Administration [blocked an attempt by a Chinese firm to purchase Korean chip manufacturer *Magnachip*](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/06/22/biden-semiconductors-south-korea-china-trade-war/). A small company, sure, but we can extrapolate this stance to assume that TSMC could be off limits to Chinese acquisition in the future if the US and Taiwan can come to a formal agreement. Who knows how long this US-China measuring contest will go on, but the evidence suggests to me that it would not drastically affect the prices of semiconductor companies. \n\nBeing the massive pussy that I am though, I'm concerned about how an impending crash will impact overall liquidity and the supply and demand of semiconductor chips,[ which computing technology consumes about 1/3 of](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/devices/how-and-when-the-chip-shortage-will-end-in-4-charts). But obviously if we all lose our homes, we would have bigger fish to fry than worrying about $AMD share price. \n\n**Innovation**\n\nI'm an avid PC gamer. I literally have nothing going on other than my Steam account and my Fidelity account. This is (not) a cry for help. IMO, $NVDA has the best net technology for GPUs. However $AMD offers more consumer-friendly products. I believe that $AMD cards offer the best value per dollar paid. (Unless you're one of those idiots paying 5 grand for a graphics card. I mean c\u2019mon, you can watch Pornhub Premium without an RTX 3080.) This catalyst is just going to be driven by overall consumer sentiment. If people begin realizing that their value is better spent on $AMD graphics cards, that[ market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/754557/worldwide-gpu-shipments-market-share-by-vendor/) is gonna be gobbled the fuck up. Oh and processors? Yeah, $INTC is a piece of shit that I'm not concerned with. No source, just facts. Kidding, here\u2019s some cool charts [comparing processor performance](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/amd-vs-intel-cpus):\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nI won\u2019t lie, the new i9 5.1 GHz is an absolute beast, but the difference is almost negligible compared to the Ryzens, which are priced lower. \n\n**$NVDA Stock Split 20 June 2021**\n\nFuckin' $NVDA... always raining on the $AMD parade. I'm not angry, just disappointed. This stock split is actually pretty insignificant. Does this change any of the fundamentals between the two? Fuck no. Am I looking forward to it? Eh. Is there a point to me including this section? Kinda! As [u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/) said to me, $AMD is a bit of a \u201clate-bloomer\u201d compared to $NVDA which can be seen as the current titan of the GPU space. I expect the price of $NVDA post-split (1:4) to be somewhere between $150 and $250 just based on previous prices and my exceptional arithmetic skills. While this is still above $AMD stock price, I think it will be easier to perform comparative technical analysis between the two companies when the prices are closer. Compare that with the fundamentals I wrote about earlier and you have got one bullish ass stock.\n\n**Price Outlook**\n\nIf I was Michael Burry and had enough coke and psilocybin I would tell you guys the price target a year from now. But I'm a broke college student with no coke and only a little shrooms, so it's whatever.\n\n\\- Short term I'm playing AMD calls pretty close to the chest. Currently holding 7/9 $95c and 8/20 $100c. I roll up or down depending on how the week has gone. $AMD has been trading sideways since the run-up last June with a high of $99.23 and a solid floor around $72-$73. For a quick swing of shares I try to enter anywhere under $80 and exit above\u2026 let\u2019s call it $86.50. As of now, I\u2019m looking out for an announcement stating the date of the Q2 earnings call (I\u2019m guessing August) and I\u2019m looking for $AMD to continue its run and retest $95 before a post-earnings dip. \n\nI\u2019ve charted pivot points for our current trading range as follows: \n\n$85.57\n\n$86.10\n\nPsychological resistance at whole values between $87 and $93.\n\n$93.55\n\n$95\n\nATH of 99.23\n\n \ud83d\udcf7 \n\n\\- Mid-term? I don't fucking know, get back to me if the market crashes. If not, 6-12months out, $100-$120 with a floor around $85-$90 just based on how we've been growing and the fact that resistance-&gt;support. As mentioned I\u2019m expecting a bit of a pullback soon since tech has been absolutely soaring the last two weeks, but seeing $85-$90 turn into support is not unreasonable in the near future. Honestly I\u2019m much more uncertain about mid-term compared to short or long time frames.\n\n\\- Long term: $NVDA levels. I believe with all my heart that $AMD is the better company and should be valued as such. They are a company that continues to exceed expectations and make great connections in the computing industry. For shares I would just buy and hold until I retire. (Mod who reviewed my post in its baby stages told me that \u201cbuy and hold\u201d was a questionable term to use. I\u2019ve heard the term \u201cinvesting\u201d passed around other subreddits but hell if I know what that means.) \n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nMe and my good pal Tendo heavily believe in this company, as I\u2019m sure many others do. No price target if I\u2019m going to take a 1+ yr position. Under $80 if I\u2019m going for a swing trade that will last one month or less. \n\nSo yeah, that's about it. Great DD[ u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/). $AMD to the moon, not a financial advisor, blah-blah-blah. Who wants to see me lose half my portfolio this week? (Again.)",

        "selftext": "$RKT FUD is mainly revolved around interest rates rising and price war with competitors. While I think these are valid risks to earnings growth I believe $RKT is equipped to weather the storm better than anyone else as long as they use their brain and not just aimlessly go for more market share with advertising without balance. Here is what I think $RKT should be aiming for next earnings call to ease these concerns:\n\n1) Boast about their record triple digit % growth in Rocket Homes and Rocket Autos. I believe if there will be any upside surprise next earnings it will come from these two areas. With housing prices and auto prices still on the rise I think the revenue will only compound to the upside if triple digit growth in these revenue streams continue. Showing revenue growth in these two areas will prove to investors $RKT is not only a company that will make money when interest rates go down for people to refinance. I will first and foremost need to see high % growth in both of these areas to stay bullish.\n\n2) Rocket Homes. I want to hear in more detail how they plan to leverage their Rocket Homes app to compete and beat Zillow at their own game. I want them to give some data on how app users are behaving for example, downloads per month growth, number of clicks within the app, time spent on app, ect. Rocket Homes has the ability to get your loan through the app and find a real estate agent having a one stop shop for purchasing a home. Zillow is catching on and now offering loans through their app. Rocket Homes should be looking for ways to steer real estate agents away from Zillow and onto Rocket Homes along with consumers. \n\n3) Rocket Autos. Rocket Autos as far as I'm aware does not have an app yet. I want to hear some detail revolving how they plan to streamline this process direct to consumer through an app similar to how Carvana got into the game. When they do Rocket will have a unique advantage to Carvana because they can offer the loan and financing through the app, similar to Rocket Homes, so when people go to buy a car so they know what they can afford. I think a timeline on when they expect to launch the app would be necessary for shareholders to be in the loop on or at least where progress stands to confirm they are going down this road (pun intended).\n\n4) I love the Amazon logic of \"we are going to take as much market share as possible by lowering our prices and taking a lower gain on sale to win market share\" BUT I do think there is a balance and that balance can come from lowering their ever growing marketing expense line on the income statement. We've all seen Rocket Company commercials, PGA sponsorship, signs at sporting events, ect. I would love to see marketing get trimmed down in order to deliver positive or constant earnings growth in order to win the price war with $UWMC faster because I do think $UWMC will eventually drop the broker ultimatum (which is only hurting mortgage brokers not $RKT). By the way I am not against $UWMC before you start hating on me I think you can make money on both of these stocks I just like $RKT better because of all of their revenue streams and direct to consumer access. \n\n5) Finally as an alternative to point 4 about lowering the marketing budget to increase earnings would be to initiate the up to $1 billion share buy back program they announced last November. AMD share buyback was a huge catalyst for the stock to move from $75 to $90 and I think it would be a big catalyst for $RKT as well.\n\nBottom line is $RKT needs to begin caring about their shareholders and flexing a little more for the beast company that it is. This is a company that can be insanely more profitable than it currently is if it wanted to be but it's currently choosing to forgo profit to reinvest and grow their current business and new revenue streams. Either deliver earnings or show us you're going to win big in these 3 markets.",

        "selftext": " \n\nI\u2019m sure that most of you are familiar with Coupang, the \u201cAmazon of South Korea,\u201d and the most valuable foreign-based company to be listed on the NYSE since BABA in 2014. At the time of writing this, it has a current market cap of \\~65B USD. When it DPO\u2019d  on March 11th, the SoftBank backed company saw its share price jump from $35 to $63.5, an 80% single day increase. Since that time it has traded down, and stayed range-bound within a fairly narrow band. It currently trades for \\~$38. Many analysts expect it to continue to perform at this level, with some opportunity to receive a valuation catalyst when they report earnings on August 11th. While this is certainly within the range of possible outcomes, there is also a convergence of factors that create a bullish thesis for the coming quarter and years to come. Some of these factors are outside of the sort of financials and fundamentals that drive a great deal of analysis for individual securities, providing some opportunity to establish strong positions before a change in analysts\u2019 ratings and further institutional investment. Most of my analysis is based on global macroeconomic trends, with an emphasis on externalities, and \u201cstock stories,\u201d and I believe there is an opportunity to get ahead of the curve, an opportunity that I will endeavor to make the case for here through a somewhat traditional SWOT analysis focusing on the company, the economic climate of Southeast Asia, and greater market trends that make it a potentially excellent value\n\nA summary of CPNG itself:\n\nCoupang is based in Seoul, SK, and is incorporated in Delaware. It was founded in 2010 by Bom Kim, a Harvard Business School drop-out. While Coupang in its current iteration looks nothing like the company he first founded, this isn\u2019t that uncommon for tech companies, and in this respect, it bears some resemblance to the company it draws frequent comparison to, Amazon. While this is the tech giant with which Coupang is most frequently associated and the one that it emulates in many respects, I think that there are arguments to be made that its future success is tied much more closely to Alibaba, AMD, Samsung, and Sea.\n\nLike Amazon, Coupang has several different sectors. This includes their core business of e-commerce, where they are clearly taking some of the lessons of Amazon and applying them, offering their own brands of \u201cessentials\u201d on their platform, food delivery both in the form of groceries, where they once again have their own brands available for sale, and also from restaurants, small business solutions, payment processing, digital advertising, and through their recent acquisition of Singapore-based Hooq, subscription video-streaming services.\n\nStrengths:\n\nCoupang is already the largest online marketplace in South Korea. Their active customer base added 21% this last year, climbing above 16 million users in South Korea. These customers also spent more with Coupang than they did the year before, +44% Y/Y. There are 52 million people in South Korea, so there is still a large portion of the market for them to tap into. Furthermore, they actually have a higher dollar retention rate than Amazon of 346% to 278%. This means that after somebody first uses the platform, they come back and spend more money in subsequent years. In the case of Coupang and Amazon, considerably more. While we don\u2019t have information about the dollar retention rate of Chinese customers with Alibaba, it is quite possible that these are the most valuable customers in the world. You want to talk about a moat? This is a moat.\n\nTheir goal is to make their customers unable to \u201cimagine life before Coupang,\u201d and they have built a very successful brand based on the rapidity of their delivery. 99.3% of their orders are fulfilled within 24 hours of the purchase. Even foreign goods are delivered within just 3 days. This is facilitated by their logistics network, which emulates the Amazon warehouse model, and the concentrated population density of the areas in which they operate. 70% percent of the South Korean population lives within just 7 miles of a Coupang fulfillment center. Returns are as simple as using their app to notify Coupang that you would like to return an item, setting it outside your door, and then within minutes, one of their 15,000 full-time drivers will have picked it up. It really is an incredible business model.\n\nThey already have created their own end-to-end logistics network of manufacturing, delivery, warehouses, and tech. What they haven\u2019t built, they have acquired. They currently have over 100 fulfillment centers in 30 cities in South Korea.\n\nFurthermore, in 2020, Coupang is still operating cash-flow positive with $302M, despite their position as a rapidly growing company. Analysts are expecting revenue to rise another +61% this year to $19.4B. This correlates to +26.3% EPS this year.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nThe majority of Coupang\u2019s weaknesses can be described as traditional financials and the way in which they influence share price. Quite simply put, they won\u2019t be profitable especially soon, particularly as they continue to expand into new markets. There are lots of bullish indicators, even here. While net loss increased 180%, operating loss declined 36% on a revenue increase of 74%, $4.2B. It should also be noted that their 2020 gross income was also +92% of what they did in 2019. They are growing quickly, but they are paying for it, especially as their labor force jumped to 50,000 employees. The company plans to double this workforce over the next few years as they continue to grow. They aren\u2019t short on cash to fund this sort of expansionary effort however, as Coupang previously received $3B from SoftBank, and they certainly put it to work for them, yielding a $33B profit for their investor. They will be able to get infusions of cash just about any time they want.\n\nEBITDA from 2020 provides the greatest reason for concern, as their operating, administrative, and general costs rose with the completion of their network, especially their fulfillment center capacity, moving from ($42M) to ($133M). This is fairly typical of a growth company, and I\u2019m really curious to see what their EBITDA looks like on August 11th.\n\nThere are also, in fairness, some issues with these employees, and Coupang has been criticized for some of their labor practices. They also recently had a fire in their logistics warehouse.\n\nLastly, while I am unconcerned about competition in Korea, I would be remiss to fail to mention that they do not benefit from protectionist policies, and Amazon has recently tried to gain some market share in the country by taking a stake in 11Street. This is a non-issue for me, because they can\u2019t provide comparable services to those provided by Coupang unless they are willing to make a considerably larger investment and dedicate a decade to creating a similarly structured logistics system.\n\nOpportunities:\n\nMy enthusiasm for Coupang is based on the myriad diverse paths for future success, including possibly explosive growth over the next couple years. If you skipped the rest of the DD to get to this point, I wouldn\u2019t blame you.\n\nOne of the chief knocks against Coupang has been the size of the market in South Korea. There are two reasons why this is no longer the factor that it once was. \n\nFirst, I am extremely bullish on the South Korean economy in general. Even if a market is small, as long as it has more assets in it, growth can be expected. A quick look at my post history will reveal that I am also bullish long on AMD, and I should probably be taking a good hard look at Samsung. This has a lot to do with the South Korean government\u2019s plan to invest $450B into becoming a global chip-manufacturing powerhouse. For a sense of scale, this is 9x the investment that the US recently pledged to manufacture this increasingly valuable commodity. While their GDP growth rate is already nearly 3x that of Japan, this savvy national strategy is only going to bring additional discretionary income to many Koreans, among whom consumer spending has not been a historical strength, in part due to the historical division of wealth inequality among South Koreans. This is no longer the case, and the South Korean middle class now comprises 53% of their population. Over the last year personal disposable income grew at an average rate of 3.55% and private consumption jumped 2.4% from Q1 to Q2. \n\nIndeed, Korea\u2019s strong COVID-19 response helped their GDP contraction rank among the lowest in OECD countries. South Korean exports increased as a percentage of the global market share, primarily driven by about a 4% growth in semiconductors. They are already Asia\u2019s 4th largest economy, and while I don\u2019t see an imminent reshuffling of this order, having already moved to the 10th largest economy in the world, passing Russia and Brazil in the past year, they should pass Canada and Italy in the next two to three years.\n\nIn short, even if Coupang stayed concentrated in South Korea, strong economic policy has them well-positioned to be the beneficiaries of a growing economy, with steadily increasing discretionary income for a (busy) Korean middle class.\n\nThis leads me to my second point: they aren\u2019t staying in South Korea. They notably expanded their services to Japan and Taiwan this quarter, and just announced that they were about to begin their operations in Singapore, using this last expansion as a test platform to refine their broader expansion into the Southeast Asian market, with its population of 650 million. Coupang\u2019s next target for expansion appears to be Malaysia. \n\nE-commerce is thriving in Southeast Asia, reaching a volume of $62B in 2020, up 63% from 2019. The expectation is that this market will be $172B by 2025. South Korea is already this region\u2019s third largest e-commerce market.\n\nWhile some would see this aggressive expansion as a logical next step, there are two considerations that make it particularly valuable at this moment in time for Coupang: the first is that they are already past the period of significant investment in their own infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities, as exhibited by their financials. Secondly, Alibaba, the region\u2019s largest online marketplace is facing an existential crisis, which corresponds with market growth that fails to match e-commerce growth in the region. I won\u2019t go into that here. What I will say is that while I do not expect Coupang to ever operate in China, the world\u2019s second largest economy, the rest of Southeast Asia suddenly has a much larger contested market share.\n\nThreats:\n\nThere are two threats for us to consider when assessing CPNG as a growth stock. The first pertains to its business: there is a lot of competition in Southeast Asian e-commerce, with a range of players, but particularly the well-funded Shopee and Lazada. Lazada is a subsidiary of Alibaba, and there is way too much here for me to provide any sort of concrete analysis, so instead I\u2019ll focus on Shopee. There was a recent analysis on The Motley Fool, comparing Shopee\u2019s parent company Sea Ltd. (SE) to Coupang, in which the analyst suggested that SE was the better buy based on their gaming business. I reached the opposite conclusion (shocker) of the analyst at The Fool, in no small part because of Sea\u2019s connection to Tencent, particularly in regard to their gaming sector. Yes, Tencent holds 23% of SE\u2019s shares outstanding, but it is more the potential issue with the licenses of *LoL* and *Arena of Valor*, both developed by Tencent, and which Sea publishes in Asia, that has me slightly concerned. I\u2019m not the only one either, as SE has seen a share price drop of about -3.49% over the course of this week. Mitigating this concern to some extent is that Sea\u2019s most important gaming title, *Free Fire*, the world\u2019s most downloaded game in 2020, is self-published.\n\nIt should be noted that given the growth of e-commerce in Southeast Asia that I am also very bullish long on SE, but the value differential of EPS (TTM) for Sea -3.59 and CPNG -3.99 does not justify the market\u2019s current concern regarding potential over valuation of CPNG as opposed to SE. SE currently trades at 18x this year\u2019s sales, compared to Coupang\u2019s 3x. SE currently has a market cap of 149.668B compared to Coupangs 65.092B. While I do expect Sea and Lazada to grow over the next several years, there is still a sizeable market for all three of these major players in the region.\n\nThis relates to the second threat: general market perception of CPNG. There are two stories being told here. One is the apparent share price, which again has failed to impress since it listed on the NYSE and the fairly widespread FUD coming through all the typical industry mouthpieces, and the other story is the massive institutional/ insider investment over the last 6 months, as well as some extremely curious options activity. Leaving the options out of it, because that is not how I am recommending playing this position, the reality of the 147,251,715 insider shares purchased over the last 6 months tells a different story than the one currently circulating among retail investors. 86.3% of the float is held by institutions. This isn\u2019t a retail darling, and the low volume corroborates this. This is a company slowly being acquired into consolidated positions by the likes of Greenoaks and Blackrock, while the business makes significant moves not reflected in the share price. The 1.34B shares float are going to make this a very difficult stock to move quickly, so one should temper expectations accordingly, and also avoid anything but the most conservative options plays in the short-term as a result.\n\nWhy enter now?\n\nI\u2019m expecting a beat on August 11th, but that isn\u2019t driving my urgency. What makes me want to expand my position in this company sooner rather than later is the revised thesis on Asian e-commerce due to Alibaba\u2019s profound issues, the ongoing COVID crisis, and the trends in NYSE investment. Retail investors have to conduct their own research and make their own decisions, algorithms on the other hand can make massive acquisitions as soon as they are given a \u2018buy\u2019 signal, which in the case of CPNG could come sooner rather than later.\n\nThis is because of the anticipated shift over the next 10-18 months from \u2018stable\u2019 large cap to \u2018speculative\u2019 small/mid cap growth. We\u2019ve been hearing a mixed story about the \u201crotation from growth to value\u201d for a while now, and a cross section of ETFs can be used to make this case, that even with AAPL adding .5 T like it was nothing, value is up 16% YTD compared to growth, up 10% YTD, however, the \u201creopening\u201d narrative seems to have shifted since mid-May, with speculative growth such as ROKU gaining 11% compared with cyclicals and banks, any of which provide ample evidence contrary to the popular rotational narrative. Alphabet notwithstanding, even with amazing ER beats, large cap tech is selling off their ATHs. While it is clear in recent days that some of these profits are flowing into fake internet money, I\u2019m not here to tell you about that, instead to bring your attention to an opportunity in a company that actually makes things and provides services.\n\nHow to play it? LEAPS or shares only, both of which are extraordinarily cheap right now, and which probably won\u2019t be quite as inexpensive in the near future as Coupang\u2019s footprint in Asian e-commerce continues to expand, and investment in Asia further consolidates outside of China. I think you have about a quarter to establish a strong position before it becomes about 50% more costly to do so. This gives you some time to be patient with its growth, but not so long that I would hesitate to make the move. The real profits are made on surprise stories.\n\nDisclosure: This is not financial advice. I have a small position in CPNG that I am looking to add significantly to. I am a degenerate and a moron.

        "selftext": "The title is taken directly from the company's mission statement. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is the video game holding company responsible for the biggest hits in gaming including Candy Crush, Call of Duty, Diablo, Hearthstone, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, among many others. The company is one of the oldest third-party video game developers. It has a successful track record  that rivals the industry giants like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo. The company survived the great fall of revenue in the gaming industry in the mid-80s and came back strong years later. In the 90s Bobby Kotick bought the company and has been CEO ever since. Kotick is actually the longest-tenured CEO of an S&amp;P 500 company. It's safe to say that Activision Blizzard has solid and reputable management.\n\nThe success of the company is mostly attributed to quality acquisitions of gaming studios. We're talking Activision, Blizzard Entertainment, King Digital Entertainment, Infinity War, Sledgehammer Games, Toys for Bob, Treyarch, and Vicarious Visions. If you don't know of or have played a game created by one of these names you are living under a rock, under a boulder, under a mountain. Video games produced by these studios have revolutionized their genres and the industry as a whole.\n\nCountless hit games results in countless sales. The companies EBITDA has grown pretty steadily over the last 6 years and is forecasted to grow even faster over the next 4 years. EBITDA in 2014 was $1.5B. EBITDA in 2020 was $3.3B. EBITDA in 2024 is estimated to be $5.7B.\n\nThe semi-conductor \"chip\" shortage has created a great opportunity to invest in ATVI. Let's look at the numbers in a different way. Sony's PS5 sales within the first year are at 7.8 million units compared to the PS4 which sold 7.6 million units in the first year, and it hasn't even been a full year since the release of the PS5. The Xbox Series X is the same story but we don't know the numbers. 7.8 million units is not even the full potential of the PS5 sales. Sony and Microsoft have been stalled by the chip shortage. Gaming consoles have been selling out much faster than the companies can produce them. That being said, the chip shortage should calm down and Sony and Microsoft are doubling production. Limitless hype + double production = double sales.\n\nBut remember, I'm not suggesting anyone buys Sony or Microsoft in this thread. I'm suggesting you buy Activision Blizzard. The latest generation gaming consoles are equipped with SSD, AMD CPUs, and AMD GPUs that allow for ray tracing technology. The ceiling that limited the gaming experience has been shattered. Games will be more realistic, beautiful, fun, immersive, and addicting than ever before. Activision Blizzard makes the best games. Activision Blizzard's video game releases and sales are partially dependent on the gaming consoles reaching maximum sales.\n\nThe video game industry has changed drastically. The growth in the population of gamers and the diverse age groups that game today will slingshot the industry to a $300B market sooner than you might think. Adolescent kids, young adults, and older people that don't have jobs spend hours playing Call of Duty. Stay-at-home moms stare at their phone screens without breaks and relentlessly swipe their credit cards for more lives in Candy Crush. Everyone loves Activision Blizzard games.\n\nTake a look at the technicals. Two years after the release of the last generation of gaming consoles (PS4 and Xbox One) ATVI stock price doubled. Less than five years after the aforementioned release the stock price quadrupled.  Following a sharp dip in late 2018 the stock traded a wide base. The price then broke out from a C&amp;H trend in late 2020 and has recently formed a bull flag. Currently, the stock is consolidating and should soon bounce off long-term support and break out from that bull flag. The stock is primed for a rally. My price target before the end of the year is +130.00.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2q2wyegcwa71.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4a8ff4a9a038e157a909d933d67f1253470f392\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ua2ijlxgcwa71.png?width=1909&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=865bcbb6b874bd25bdfaccec0c17a8cdf6c7dab8\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR** \n\nThere has never been a more exciting time for the gaming industry and Activision Blizzard is a great company with an impressive portfolio. \n\nI bought shares of ATVI this morning at 92.95 to start a position and I'm looking to add more over the next couple months. I'm also looking to buy LEAPS but I have only glanced at the option chain. I don't suggest short dated options.",

        "selftext": "https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/\n\nIntel Corp\u00a0(INTC.O)\u00a0said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc\u00a0(QCOM.O)\u00a0chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co\u00a0(2330.TW)\u00a0and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd\u00a0(005930.KS)\u00a0by 2025.\n\nAmazon.com Inc\u00a0(AMZN.O)\u00a0will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips.\n\nBut Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc\u00a0(AMD.O)\u00a0and Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NVDA.O)\u00a0produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries.\n\nIntel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years.\n\nThe most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML\u00a0(ASML.AS)\u00a0that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph.\n\n\"We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,\" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors.\n\nIntel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like \"Intel 7\" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies.\n\nIn the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in \"nanometers\". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive.\n\nIntel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes.\n\nAmazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and \"chiplets\" or \"tiles\", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say.\n\n\"There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,\" Gelsinger said.\n\nIntel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a \"major mobile platform\" and engaging in a \"deep a strategic manner.\" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip.\n\nThe biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids.\n\nBut David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the \"hubris\" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology.\n\nThis time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming \"Intel 18A\" process if it is not ready.\n\n\"Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,\" Kanter, the analyst, said. \"Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.\"\n\nReporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by David Gregorio",

The company operates through six main segments:\n\n1. **Data Center Group** \u2014 33.75% of revenue \u2014 Developing workload-optimized platforms for computing, storage, and network functions. These include their cloud service providers, enterprise and government data centres, and communication service providers.\n2. **Internet of Things Group** \u2014 3.89% of revenue \u2014 Developing high-performance computing for retailers, manufacturers, healthcare, energy, auto, and government.\n3. **Mobileye \u2014** 1.25% of revenue \u2014 Driving assistance and automation with their Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) products.\n4. **Non-volatile Memory Solutions Group \u2014** 6.93% of revenue \u2014 Computer memory and storage products.

Regrettably, for punters late to the party in \u201899/\u201900, investors had already bid the stock price up exponentially in the tech bubble. These late punters paid the price during the ensuing collapse and period of price stagnation.\n\n[Investors bid up Intel\u2019s shares and then wiped them out through the tech bubble.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5699c62-f84c-4eb1-8df8-7568c261a101_2400x1164.png)\n\nAfter the tech bubble collapsed, growth in demand for microprocessors began to slow, and Intel\u2019s competitors (most notably AMD) began to etch away at their previously dominant market share.

Over the following 15 years, successful iterative improvements of the company\u2019s technology and the continued rapid growth of Apple helped Intel grow.\n\nIntel is a mature company with a dominant position, long-term stable margins, and slow structural growth.\n\n[Long-term stable margins and slow structural growth](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab8f5259-a0d5-4018-84e3-a9a2add3c701_2400x1166.png).\n\n\\--\n\n**The Story**\n\n*This mature semiconductor business has lost the Apple contract. After a substantial short-term hit, they will continue growing slowly and steadily, while their leading position and manufacturing capabilities will help them defend margins.*\n\n**Growth:** Intel has had an average CAGR of 5.7% since the mid-2000s. This growth has been broadly in line with market growth over this time and shouldn\u2019t be a surprise given Intel\u2019s dominant position, size and success of Apple products.\n\nHowever, looking forward, given that Apple announced it is transitioning away from Intel processors to in-house ones, we think this will deliver an immediate hit to revenues. Analyst consensus is for an FY21 loss of revenue of 6.7%, and we believe this is about right.\n\nFurther, economists estimate that the global client computing market and cloud data centre markets will grow at 0.1% and 19.0% CAGR, respectively, over the medium term. Based on Intel\u2019s segment weightings, this suggests ongoing medium-term market growth of 5.8%. Given the loss of the Apple contract and the fact that Intel has fallen behind on manufacturing, we think that medium-term growth is likely to be closer to the company\u2019s fundamental growth rate of 2.45%.\n\n**Margins:** Intel has had an average R&amp;D adjusted operating margin of 28.68% over the last ten years. This margin is far above the industry (weighted by segment) average of 14.62% over that time. Over the TTM, the company\u2019s margin was 29.91%.\n\nIntel\u2019s leading position in the microprocessor has helped them scale up and defend margins. The enormous R&amp;D and capital investment required to extend manufacturing processes and capacity for new products act as a consistent call on capital. They have helped act as significant barriers to entry. Intel is now one of a handful of remaining semiconductor companies with the capacity to manufacture chips internally.\n\nGiven this position, we expect Intel to maintain its current average margins by either pushing higher costs through to customers or improving manufacturing processes.\n\n**Net Reinvestment:** We expect Intel to remain an extremely capital intensive business (generating $0.61 of revenue per dollar of invested capital), especially compared to the industry ($1.71 of revenue per dollar of invested capital). Moreover, we expect their extraordinary R&amp;D requirements, which have averaged $13.5B p.a. over the last five years, will not diminish.\n\n**FCF:** But, given how profitable the business is, we expect it to remain highly FCF generative.\n\n**Cost of Capital:** Intel is a semiconductor and electronics business (66.2%) and a cloud services business (33.8%) serving China (26%), Singapore (22.9%), the United States (21.3%), Taiwan (14.9%) and other international markets (14.9%).\n\nThe company has a 0.2x average operating leverage ratio and a 15.7% D/E ratio. Moody\u2019s has assigned Intel an A1 credit rating, which is the same as our long-term synthetic rating but lower than our short-term rating of Aaa. We\u2019ve gone with the former because we agree with Moody\u2019s reasoning:\n\n&gt;\u201cDespite Intel's strong credit metrics, the rating is constrained by the relatively high operating and technology risk associated with leading-edge semiconductor design and manufacturing, and the volatility inherent to the semiconductor sector.\u201d  \n\u2014 Moody\u2019s Investors Services, 21 Sep 2020\n\nMoreover, the A1 rating drives the low (1.08%) chance of distress.\n\n**Other Assets &amp; Minority Claims:** Intel has $17M worth (at book) of investments carried under the equity method, $6.8B of investments held at fair value, and no minority claims outstanding.\n\n**Debts &amp; Other Claims:** Finally, the company owes $35.6B NPV in debts and leases.\n\n\\--\n\n**The Valuation**\n\nThe company reports in USD.

They manufacture tech products.\n\nOk, you already know all that, but what is the deal? The main thing with tech products are they all need metal to work, and while they all use different quantities and types of metals in their production, them being mainly cooper and zinc.\n\nElectric cars in general use 4 times more cooper than a normal car and every tech product in the world use a combination of copper and zinc for heat dissipation, you guys know that because of PCs and stuff. The thing is everyone is looking at the final product going up that no one is noticing that the provider is getting even bigger with even less possibility to fail or go down because they aren't industries that are affected by how the public views them.\n\nThe general price of minerals in the last year to now is up 50% for almost every mineral.\n\nI research mining companies and none of their shares went down, they went up at LEAST 45% in the last year, for comparison, AMD went up 31% with a lot of fluctuations and AMZN 18% with the same fluctuations, mining companies just don't go down, they just go up.\n\nVALE3: 88,62% up in the last year, BHP: 45,01%, RIO: 45,27% in the last year as well. \n\nIf we are going for the year overalls, TSLA went down 7,18% while RIO ended up being the worst performing mining one with a 14,58% UP just this year. \n\nI made my research and I ask everyone to do the same, but I really feel like mining companies shares are the future, they are safe, most of the time have no real competition at all and their products are necessary by pretty much every company, if AAPL makes a new product, they need stuff to manufacture them, the advance of electric cars will only makes their prices go up.\n\nI don't know how to end this and I hope I wrote enough for not get caught in the auto-moderator.",

The market has a high cost of entry, a high level of specialised knowledge and a very long time from research to having a prototype to eventually having a working quantum computer. Therefore the market in and off itself looks like it will only be ruled by a few players.   \n\nMore specifics: Those are my  bear case bullet points concerning the specific companies and not the technology they are employing.   \n\nHoneywell: Honeywell initially tried to sell a subscription service for their Ion Trap Quantum Computer. They promised the subscribers access to increasingly strong QC (1). Since IonQ made a massive leap, those subscribers have no reason to stay subscribed. Therefore the funding dried out and Honeywell is selling part of their Quantum Business to cut losses. No one gives away their golden goose. They are not even planning on catching up to where IonQ is now in the next 5 years. \n\nRigetti: Rigetti had a massive valuation cut in their last round (2). They also had a mass exodus of employees (3). They do the same thing that IBM does, but perform worse.   \n\nPsiQuantum: Not much information available to the public, due to their history of being \u201cstealth\u201d. Based on their investor base, what they say in private isn't mindblowing. Microsoft is among the worst to get as an investor in this space to get credibility. Again the Founder Fund is really what keeps them on the map, appart from their claims concerning the future.\n\nGoogle: Googles lead Software went to IonQ, while their Lead Hardware went to another company as well (4). I don't think this is a huge indicator, but it's not great either. Both of them didn't see a future in the Google quantum effort.   \n\nIBM: I have nothing \u201cbad\u201d to say about IBM. Their business strategy seems to be working, but they are giving a good chunk of QC time away for free (5). It is no surprise that they have a huge developer base. Once the QC become commercially interesting, the customers will come to the person supplying the best QC.    \n\n(1) https://www.zdnet.com/article/honeywell-introduces-quantum-computing-as-a-service-with-subscription-offering/ \n\n(2) https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/rigetti-computing-took-a-71-million-down-round-because-quantum-computing-is-hard/  \n\n(3) https://www.wsj.com/articles/quantum-computing-remains-a-challenge-for-tech-firms-11578345473 \n\n(4) https://www.wired.com/story/googles-head-quantum-computing-hardware-resigns/ \n\n(5) https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/quantum-computing-at-ibm/ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**7) Ion Traps have a cost advantage against other types of quantum computers.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/im04sahov7971.png?width=1466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d5adecb79dc5b94fcce8fe585ba4c6c0a676ac8\n\nI will go a bit into detail for Superconducting Qubits and Photonic Qubits. I group the rest. \n\nThe main case against superconducting qubits is the cost to keep them at a temperature close to the absolute minimum (-270 celsius or 0 kelvins). The fridge itself costs about 300.000 thousand dollar for the systems used to day, which doesn't include the electricity costs of running them (1).  The other factor is that everything that goes on in the fridge needs to be able to work at those temperatures, which is no easy task. Additionally they have a naturally higher error rate, which creates an bigger overhead. Therefore they need more physical qubits to build a error corrected qubit (2).   \n\n\nPhotonic qubits are also sometimes mentioned. The biggest problem for them is the extremely high overhead. They claim that they will use about 10.000 physical qubit to build a error corrected qubit (3). Additionaly they need some refrigiation aswell, but it's not extremly cold. \n\nAnother factor which is important here, is that IonQ's chips aren't \u201cquantum\u201d in a sense. The only thing quantum about them are the Ions (4). The rest of the chip uses technology that is already being produced, therefore if you compare the cost of a single qubit, IonQ won't be that expensive, while IonQ's physical qubits can do a magnitude more of work.   \n\n\nFor both competing systems, if you look at the performance to costs metric (not per phsical qubit, but cost for performance) IonQ will most likely beat them! Comparing them directly right now is pretty hard, because IonQ is to far ahead. Right now, IonQ pays about 2 million in parts and capitalized labour to build a system, not including a sales mark-up and service fees (5). That's hard to beat. Rough estimates put a price tag to IBM's system at \\~15 million, while those are significantly less useful (6).   \n  \n\nConcerning the other technologies:   \n\n\nTheir are about 7 different methods as of right now, but some are still at the early ages.   My main reason why I\u00b4m not concerned for now goes back to costs. Let's assume the other technologies get their first prototype in 10 years. At that point, if we compare the costs of qubits, the early scalers will already see a massive increase in cost savings. It is probably wise to stay informed about new developments, but I didn't stumbled into something that made me seriously worry yet. IonQ expects the per qubit cost to decrease by 90% over the next 5 years (7). Therefore as time goes on, new competing technologies will have a increasingly hard time to keep up. Time is on IonQ's side.     \n\n\nThe main question that arises here is: Why isn't everyone doing Trapped Ions then? The main idea is that Google and IBM went with superconducting qubits, because the manufacturing process is close to conventional chips. Ion Traps just wasn't their circle of expertise. Another question is, why didn't they buy IonQ? I think they tried, but IonQ said no. The founders where initially hesitant to even take private money.   \n    \n    \n(1) https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:199846-2018:TEXT:EN:HTML \n\n(2) Quantum Computing: Progress and Prospects (2019)   \n\n(3) https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.4612 \n\n(4) https://www.hpcwire.com/2019/06/05/quantum-upstart-ionq-sets-sights-on-challenging-ibm-rigetti-others/ \n\n(5) https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521114527/d138876d425.htm \n\n(6) https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/03/ibm-q-50-qubit-quantum-computer/ \n\n(7) https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521114527/d138876d425.htm \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **8) Smart money is taking notice of IonQ**   \n\n\nI intensively check for the awareness curve when it comes to IonQ. Therefore I compiled a list of FinTwit accounts who are recognising IonQ. The most important part here is that they aren't SPAC investors, but regular investors. I intentinally excluded SPAC investors, to get a sense of how normal investor look at IonQ. One part of them is \u201cSmart Money\u201d, e.g. Wall Street. They need to use burner accounts in order to get compliance of their back. The other part are FinTwit accounts with a following above 5K, e.g. \u201cInfluencers\u201d. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI included cramer here to show that he is \"aware\" of QC. I think he will say something like \"I was always interested in quantum computing\", when I invites a member of IonQ on his show.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zujg2mfxv7971.png?width=1428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59eb21352fb8e1ea7e5c5873a1a70c4d24760914\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **9) IonQ is cheap compared to similar tech companys** \n\nThis part is dedicated to the valuation of IonQ. First of all, in 2018 their was this thing called \u201cQuantum Winter\u201d. For some time, the whole industry struggled to get funding. This suppressed valuations. Without quantum winter, I think we would already see IonQ at atleast double the price, which is nice.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wu1ws1t1w7971.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07e036f926eb04704099ac35f9887cfd840606cd\n\nThe question is as to who you compare IonQ's valuation to.   You can either do it by checking for unprofitable hyper growth stocks or you can try and use forward multiples. The big thing about IonQ is that there doesn't exist a public company yet to compare them directly to. Therefore we will have to see how the public prices them.     \nIf you compare IonQ to other hyper growth stocks, we should see a valuation somewhere between 5-10B. I think this is justified by the story. Right now the EV is at 1.4B. There is no other company that can carry the title \u201cleader in quantum computing\u201d for the next 5 years. The story is there. What I really like about IonQ is that there is also a very good businesses case to make. Some of the meme stocks definitely have a great story. Unfortunately some of them lack the margins, the competitive position and a few other variables that turn a great story into a great business. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to value IonQ on forward multiples, the closest thing we have are Nvidia and AMD. The problem I have with this notion is a quote from the nobel prize winner William Phillips: \u201cA quantum computer differs more from a classical computer than a classical computer differs from an abacus\u201d.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8ut2ig4w7971.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=139681528809538488567dccdc97ddd13ae32ea1\n\nAdditionally Nvidia and AMD are in a different product cycle right now, therefore even assuming that those are comparable, still makes it hard to compare them. If you want to do it nevertheless here is the slide:   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9air9lk7w7971.png?width=1520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf288f11ca3471ce32ed338191f827afe7e6b3ca\n\nTwo things concerning the slide: For one, after using the multiples and discounting them, IonQ is trading at a \\~40% discount . Second, just having time passing should generate a return of 20% a year. Therefore, you get paid for waiting until IonQ develops balance sheet momentum. I will talk more about the ability of IonQ to hit milestones in \u201cPredictions\u201d part.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/upmmi82cw7971.png?width=1520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3a5eccb4150f30c3f11ad96b3f9a42e5fab46e8\n\n Two things concerning the slide: For one, after using the multiples and discounting them, IonQ is trading at a \\~40% discount . Second, just having time passing should generate a return of 20% a year. Therefore, you get paid for waiting until IonQ develops balance sheet momentum. I will talk more about the ability of IonQ to hit milestones in \u201cPredictions\u201d part.   \n    \n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**10) IonQ will only have a float of \\~ 250 million after the merger.**   \n\n\nThe PIPE and insiders are all locked out (1). Therefore if the merger creates enough hype in the beginning, this thing will trade like a 250 million market cap company. Why does this matter?   \nThere is a fun trick one can use to price stocks in the short term. We all know the \u201cmarginal buyer and marginal seller\u201d story, but this is kinda hard to quantify. What is really easy to quantify is to ask: \u201cHow much money will people put into this stock\u201d. In our case, I ask: \u201cHow much money will people put into the stock in the first month\u201d We have a float right now of 250 million at 10 per stock. If people collectively decide to put 1B into the stock, we get a stock price of 40. At 2B, we get a price of 80 and so on. Therefore if IonQ gets the meme/hype status that I assume it will get, it can be very profitable to get in early.     \n\n\n(1) https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1824920/000119312521193217/d70340ds4a.htm \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**11) IonQ is a high performance team**   \n\n\nI wanted to include this paragraph because I was checking if I can find any bad blood ex-employees. Anything that indicates that they have internal problems. Therefore I collected what I could find on the internet. What I found was that the  people who work at IonQ seem to have a great collegial connection. Mentally I always kinda connected IonQ to Quantumscape, therefore I wanted to find out if there is anything that indicates that the leadership runs a one man show, is not engaged with the team or anything like this. (Basically to make sure that there is no ammo for a short report)   \nMy two main points I found:  \n\nLeaders in IonQ having a their own secret language going. (Or whatever that is) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/do4vu6agw7971.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae083f7e136a47c8b01a755feb7120e5ef08d77f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ba1ynkkhw7971.png?width=1182&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dec696482c89ae173fa00109cc82749faf660990\n\nI'm pretty sure that the hiring of Dave Bacon went like this: Kenneth if there is own person in the world you want to work with, who would that be?   Kenneth Brown, Jungsang Kim and Monroe are the authors of the initial white paper that got IonQ started \n\nEmployees getting matching vanity plates with one of their bosses:   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cf4wnqimw7971.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d82dccb0071cf8be639745a43e30c3326a0a5a06\n\nAnother intern talking about the good time at IonQ:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/46uq2s0ow7971.png?width=729&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7685b63214ac862784eda9289e68887baa7afc5\n\n I could show some other chatter with people who are not working for IonQ but are working on Ion-Traps, but I want to keep it short.   \n\n  \nI checked glass door as well (1). They have a total of 5 reviews, in a company with about \\~70 employees. Two are positive and 3 are negative. They are all from this year, even though IonQ existed for \\~5 years now. The most common complaint is that they are overworked, followed by underpaid, followed by bad management.  \n\nI think overworked should get better, since they are hiring. At the same time, the past year was probably extremely hard, since they wanted to hit their QV target. Underpaid should get fixed by the capital raise plus they can easily pay people in equity now, which was mentioned by the CEO. Concerning the management, I can see Chapman (CEO) being very ambitious when it comes to timelines. He is a software guy and not a hardware guy, so it is hard for him to judge how long stuff takes. Keep in mind that the founders are the science guys and the \u201cmanagement\u201d is external. I have this idea that Chapman came into the company and saw that it was too easy for IonQ. I think that made him push harder. It's like a soccer team winning all the championships without hard practice.     \n\n\nThe only person that where I once found a non glassdoor complaint was the contractor who put together the slides for a investor presentation. He said he didn't get paid. IonQ immediately messaged him to figure it out. I think this was more or less one of those problems that just occur. IonQ didn't have a CFO nor the classical company structure at that time and I can see that just being victim of the special organisational structure that IonQ used to have.   \n    \nAnother thing I wanted to check was to find out why people left IonQ. My main idea is that they simply didn't have anything new to contribute. The science part is mostly done for IonQ. Pure scientists are not needed anymore. I think about John Preskill (big deal in the QC world) for example, who used to be an advisor. He now works for Amazon, who is still doing the \u201cfundamental work\u201d Another one is the ex-president of Bell Labs, who served on the board. IonQ needs engineers now. Ex CEO founded his own company. (He wasn't part of the original team, IonQ just needed a \u201cmanager\u201d). I couldn't find any movement of ex key employees that I considered suspicious. \n\nOne journalist wrote: \u201cIonQ does the right things at the right time\u201d(2) This also includes getting the right people onboard.      \nAt some point, the fact that IonQ behaves like a high performance team is no surprise. I think this is a necessary condition to constantly hit those results. Therefore this is no coincidence. It's fun to watch nevertheless.      \n  \n\n(1) https://www.glassdoor.de/Overview/Working-at-IonQ-EI\\_IE2421266.11,15.htm?countryRedirect=true \n\n(2)  https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2021/03/23/ionq-takes-quantum-computing-public-with-a-2-billion-deal/ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **12) The bull case is easy to understand and to follow.**   \n\n  \nSome tech companies that are going public right now or that have been public for a while have tech that is not easy to put in a nutshell. Therefore following their progress can be extremely difficult for someone who is not in the industry. In the case of IonQ, even a normal person can follow! There is 1 gate fidelity, 2 gate fidelity and qubit count. You put them together by checking for connectivity, which gives you the performance. You do the same thing once we are in the phase of error-correction. There is one technical breakthrough on the horizon, which can also be quantified by checking 2 gate fidelity (photonic network). At last, you need to check if the clock speed is fast enough so that the qubits stay in superposition long enough. (This is more or less a yes or no question). Once you have an intuitive understanding what those things are, you are good to go! Just check where they are at and you know the progress.   \nKnowing those few things will allow you to do a rudimentary \u201cBayesian updating\u201d (ascribing a new probability to outcomes based on the result of past outcomes) when it comes to checking the progress of IonQ and the rest of the industry.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **13) The IonQ meme has not been meme'd**   \n\n\nFor those of you who didn't here about quantum computing before: This one of the most hyped technologies on the horizon. It stands next  to fusion energy, strong AI, full self driving, blockchain, you name it. Their is also a good chunk of commentary on the hype itself. In order to get an idea where it stands, I used Google trends as a proxy for the hype.   \n\n\nWhat I try to capitalize on with my call options is the disconnect between the quantum computing hype and the knowledge about IonQ. Once those two things converge, we should see the price action.   \n\n\nLet's try to gauge the hype! \n\nFirst I compare quantum computer to solid state battery.\n\nSecond I compare Quantumscape to solid state battery. \n\nThird I compare IonQ to quantum computer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSolid state battery to quantum computer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fr15a49tw7971.png?width=1452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95b926cc9d31f2b8f826beef5c7e7412a00d8f5e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuantumscape to solid state battery. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6jvnytfuw7971.png?width=1430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c0b1c38b0f1cfa120389520444203e72a4640b0\n\nIonQ to quantum computer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0u0hkpfvw7971.png?width=1445&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9a2d2ab73eb97d9b70fc1f36296ad7cac0c8641\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hype:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/plcp37y2x7971.png?width=1356&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbcccd0929df12a75b19c6f20d0293e66cb7bceb\n\nFurther evidence of the disconnect between the quantum computing hype and IonQ can be seen if you google something like: \u201cWhat companies are doing quantum computing stuff\u201d. Some of those companies mentioned in those articles don't even have a serious quantum effort, while IonQ is unmentioned. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**14) IonQ's predictions are reliable as long as they are useful** \n\nIn this section, I will look at two sources of predictions. One is based on press releases, one is based on a video. \n\nFirst press releases: They don't make many prediction here, but the few they made are:   \n(July 2017) IonQ plans to bring general-purpose quantum computers to market by late 2018. (1) \n\n(July 2017) Within a year, IonQ expects to have quantum computing systems available for commercial use via the cloud with about 30 reliable, scalable qubits to start, Dr. Moehring said. (2)   \n  \n\n\u2192 IonQ breaks records for quantum computing performance. (December 2018)                                  (They don't have an announcement when it went on the cloud)   \n  \n\n(June 2019) IonQ plans to double its qubit count roughly every year. (3)   \u2192\n\n(To be seen) They will demonstrate their optical network this year(4):   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe original roadmap. A victim of the great benchmarking shift. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bj6dnp5ex7971.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87312bcbb90cdf0bd75e4a7b70fb3d5e16f02159\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see in the above picture, the roadmap used to consist of physical qubit number and single gate fidelity. The number of gates referred to single qubit gates. The \u201cobjective\u201d used to be Quantum Supremacy. \n\nThen the benchmarking shift happened. Quantum Volume was introduced. Therefore, now what mattered was the interplay between 2 qubit gate fidelity, number of qubits and connectivity. In order for IonQ to go with the time, they needed to present their success based on slightly different metrics. They didn't need a huge amount of qubits anymore, and the single qubit gate fidelity doesn't matter at all for quantum volume. Therefore they pushed quality over quantity, to show their competitiveness. The new objective for them is quantum advantage, which means that you rather use a quantum computer for certain tasks. Quantum Supremacy is nice for academic purposes, while Quantum Advantage makes you money. This is what ultimately allowed them to make the claim today to have the best quantum computer. They need funding after-all, so they need to go with the time.     \n\n\nIf we then my ask, well what would they have done differently if quantum volume never came along? They would have focused on ion shuttling and the optical network, in order to get more qubits connected. They will demonstrate the optical network in a industrial setting this year. I have no information when it comes to Ion Shuttling.   \n\n\nIn the end, they will need the full kid anyway. What changed was the order in which they achieve the different kinds of objectives.   \n\n\n(1) https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ionq-raises-20m-series-b-round-led-by-nea-gv-to-advance-quantum-computing-for-commercial-applications-300494456.html \n\n(2) https://www.wsj.com/articles/startups-trapped-ions-could-lead-to-better-quantum-performance-1501074264?tesla=y \n\n(3) https://www.hpcwire.com/2019/06/05/quantum-upstart-ionq-sets-sights-on-challenging-ibm-rigetti-others/ \n\n(4) https://www.zdnet.com/article/ionq-ceo-peter-chapman-on-quantum-computing-adoption-innovation-and-whats-next/ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**15) This is not just a liquidity event for investors, since IonQ is in need of the IPO money and the investors have a strategic interest** \n\n  \nTo be clear, I can see some of the investors taking profit. The ownership on IonQ is split between tech companies and Wall Street. Wall Street might be looking to take profits, but the strategic investors like Google, Amazon, Samsung etc. have a strategic interest in staying involved. IonQ is their ticket to Ion-Tap quantum computers. For those tech companies that have their own quantum program, IonQ is the way to diversify. I think it is unlikely that they will be quick to take a profit as long as the story doesn't change or the price becomes unreasonable. Tech companies can not afford to be not invested.   \n\n\nNow let's look at the need for money for IonQ.   \nYou can split this up into 4 areas where they need to have a big war chest.   \n\n\n1) They are hiring right now. Since IonQ is starting to scale, they need employees with a vast amount of experience and a specialised skill set. Those people aren't cheap and need job security. If you are a 50 year old engineer, you don't want to work for a startup that promisses you pay by giving out stock option. You need job security. IonQ can guarantee that by having the war chest ready. This is especially important if you look at other places like Google, who are also hiring. The cash increase levels the playing field.   \n\n\n2) Brute forcing results. There are two ways of getting stuff done. One is to think it through and find the best solution for a problem using brain power. The other way is simply trying it out until you find the right way. The trial and error method is costly. Not having enough resources to use this method puts you at a disadvantage. At the same time, telling a potential employee that he can \u201clet loose\u201d is a dream for those people.   \n\n3) Suppliers need security. Once IonQ starts mass production, they will outsource the chips. The suppliers building those need to be sure that IonQ has the cash to pay them. This way the suppliers can comfortably free resources for this task.   \n\n\n4) IonQ will most likely consolidate the industry. As you might imagine, IonQ is not the only company involved. At the same time, being in the lead gives them two advantages. People have an incentive to join them, since other quantum computing companies might not survive. The other advantage is that they stand ready to buy their patents or the whole company, once they give up. In order to flexible here, they need cash.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Finnaly:**\n\n**Bear Case of the internet**   \n    \nIn this part, I will start with the strongest bear case I have read so far. The next part will be a more more of a collection of criticism that I came along.   \nThis bear case was brought forth by Fernando Brandao on twitter. He is the Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology and the Head of Quantum Algorithms at Amazon Web Services. Smart guy but also part of the competition. \n\n I will just copy the thread here: Since those are well ordered, I will go over my counter argument step by step   \n(0) IonQ latest announcement with their roadmap is out: https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ionq-plans-to-launch-a-rack-mounted-quantum-computer-for-data-centers-in-2023/. Also check Peter Chapman talk on Q2B 2020 for similar content. The thread below hopefully will foster more discussion by the community. Disclaimer: all I write reflects only my personal opinion 1/20     \n\n\nIonQ claims to have today 22 qubits, all-to-all coupling, and 2-qubit error rates of 0.4% (achieving quantum volume of 4 millions). It\u2019s a big improvement over their latest published result of 11 qubits with 2.5% error rate (https://nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13534-2). 2/20   \n\n\n*My part: The qubit 2-qubit error rates they are claiming is 0.1% and they say they will achieve 0.04% in the future. 0.04% would add 3 zeros to the quantum volume claim. I think he messed up the zeros after the comma as well. It's 0.1% now resulting in a quantum volume above 4 million. I think this was an honest mistake in the heat of the moment.* (1)   \n\n\nIn their previous PR on October 2020, Chapman also said: \"In a single generation of hardware, we went from 11 to 32 qubits, and more importantly, improved the fidelity required to use all 32 qubits,\". I look forward seeing data on the experiments, which is not available yet. 3/20     \n\n\n*My part: They will publish the data, but they say it's more important right now to make the QC constantly hit those numbers. (Remember me talking about Honeywell in the beginning).* *They already published a paper that indicates that they can hit those numbers.(2)*   \n\n\nHere's a plot of their roadmap. \u201cAlgorithmic qubits\u201d in their plot means log\\_2(q. vol). By 2028, depth 1014 circuits on 1014 qubits. That would be amazing progress, but does it get us to useful applications of quantum computing? 4/20     \nChapman says: \u201cAs soon as you hit about 40 algorithmic qubits (...), you\u2019ll start to see quantum advantage probably in machine learning\u201d. Unlikely! QML is far into the future if ever. Also one can still easily simulate circuits on 40 qubits classically. 5/20     \nChapman also says: \u201cAnd then, I think it\u2019s pretty well accepted that at 72 qubits is roughly when you start to do quantum advantage fairly broadly\u201d. Not true! There are a few known applications for qubit counts close to 72, but one needs circuits of depth &gt;&gt;100k for that. 6/20     \nWith 72 \u201calgorithm qubits\u201d we can only run circuits of depth 72. You might hope for early advantage with variational/hybrid methods, but that\u2019s just a hope from today's facts. Depth 72 seems pretty small even assuming variational methods will eventually work. 7/20     \nHe continues: \u201cSo that would be in 2025. When you start to get into 2027, you\u2019re now getting into hundreds of qubits if not early 1000s of qubits in \\[2028\\]. And now you\u2019re starting to get into full-scale fault tolerance\u201d. 8/20     \nDepth-1000 circuits on 1000 qubits would be awesome progress, but far from what we believe is required for applications and what full-scale fault-tolerance would give. Ultimately we want a good number of qubits that we can run very, very!, long circuits on. 9/20     \n\n\n*My part: All those points refer to the question: \u201cWhen do quantum computers become useful?\u201d. Initially I assumed that someone can just tell me a number of qubits that they need to run an algorithm and I know. Unfortunately, this is not the case.(3)* \n\n*There are 2 ways of determining when QC will create value when it comes to algorithms. One is theoretical, one is practical. Theoretically you can \u201cmath out\u201d at what point a quantum computer can do useful things. Just check the equation and you know how many qubits you need for an idealised problem. People who are bearish can quote those numbers and say: QC will take forever and is useless for most problems.* *One guy in this camp is him: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEgBdWQdvfk. (min 43:22)* *He says: Don't believe anyone who claims that quantum computers can solve the travelling salesman problem\u201d*   *Theoretical this is most likely true, IF you choose to talk about the hardest possible instance.*   \n\n*Practically, the world doesn't create the hardest instances of problems. At the same time, we use \u201capproximations\u201d for those problems today, that aren't \u201cclear cut\u201d in their mathematics.*   *People who actually work with those real life instances will tell you that real life instances are solvable by Quantum computers and we can get an advantage of using them.*   *This guy is one of them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmtVNuAQMM0 (min 11:30)* *My argument is basically his argument. He is a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley working with Umesh Vazirani (who is an advisor for IonQ). He completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science at MIT under the guidance of Scott Aaronson (Who is a authority in the field).*     \n\n\nIonQ plans to get 64 \u201calg. qubits\u201d using 16 physical qubits to encode 1 logical qubit. I assume they plan to use Bacon-Shor codes, building on the beautiful recent paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11482). But details of their scheme for FT computation are not available yet. 10/20     \nsays: \u201cother technologies, because of their poor gate fidelity and qubit connectivity, might need 1,000, 10,000 or even 1,000,000 qubits to create a single error-corrected qubit.\u201d 11/20     \n100-1,000 overhead is the estimated number required to get very small error rates (&lt; 10\\^-10), capable of running useful algorithms. 12/20     \n\n\n*My part: All of this concerns error correction. \u201c100-1,000 overhead is the estimated number required to get very small error rates\u201d IF you have a very low (if not the minimum) of physical errors. IonQ doesn't calculate their overhead using the minimal physical error rate, so if they compare themselves to others, why should they assume the minimum for others and not themselves?*     \n\n\nIons are not different! If their physical 2-qubit error rate is &gt;0.1%, they will also require similar overheads. Right now, with IonQ current 2-qubit error rates of &gt;1.5%, error correction is not possible even with unbounded overhead. 13/20     \n\n\n*My part: 1.4% is the biggest gate they have (the worst gate so to speak) and they are predicting their overhead based on the 99.6% average 2 gate fidelity. Fernando later says that he was quoting the numbers from their older system (Gen 4)?. Ok. We need to keep in mind that IonQ has some of the best experts on error correction in their company. I think they know when error correction is possible and when it is not possible.*   \n    \nIonQ has long argued that scaling its technology doesn\u2019t necessitate any technological breakthroughs\u201d. To scale &gt;30 qubits, IonQ plans to use optical interconnects between different ions traps. That is an old idea, but has shown to be very challenging to get it right. 14/20     \nSeems IonQ is giving itself 5 years to figure it out. Experts have been trying to do it for at least 10 years. While I hope IonQ will pull it off in the fullness of time, functional optical interconnects are a major tech breakthrough required for ions scalability. 15/20     \n \n\n*My part: It has been demonstrated in the lab already and IonQ will demonstrate it this year in a industrial setting.(4)*   \n\n\nIt would be great if IonQ was upfront about it and reported on their progress towards optical interconnects. If anyone can do it, I believe it's them! 16/20   \n\n*My part: Yes, they will do it this year.(4)*   \n\n\nI have deep respect for IonQ scientists and I think they have the right to be excited about their approach as much as anyone else. It\u2019s still early days for everyone and all different platforms have to circumvent major technical challenges for scalability. 17/20     \n\n\n*My Part: Those technical challenges are not similarly hard. There is a difference between a white paper and the best performing prototype*.   \n\n\nBut I question if the over-the-top, never-ending, PR campaign of the company in recent years is the right approach to give value to its customers and help the world realize the dream of scalable quantum computers. 18/20     \n\n\n*My part: What PR campaign? Never heard about them before the IPO. They didn't publicly claim quantum supremacy even though they say they did it before Google. (5) (I know that this a a touchy subject, but Google didn't care that it was disputable when they came out with it). It's not in their press releases either. Their last QC did beat all the others QC on the benchmarks, when it came out.(6) I think it's fine to put that on the website. First quantum simulation of a water molecule?(7) They did that. Nature articles? (8)*     \n\n\nTo all our community (and unrelated to my comments on IonQ): we should be very grateful of all the investment our field is getting. But we have the responsibility of keeping hype down. 19/20     \nThe focus must be on tech and science development, not on vanity and greed. We owe it to the future generations of quantum scientists, investors and end-users. 20/20     \n\n\n*My part: (Unrelated to what he said in the last part) Monroe doesn't have any stock and pays himself close to nothing. (9) He himself was initially hesitant to take investor money, because he didn't want to be an \u201cindustry sell out\u201d (I here this term a lot on Quantum Twitter). I think allocating money to IonQ is probably not the worse use for money in general. I'm well aware that this will eventually lead to other groups receiving less money, since IonQ is setting the bar pretty high, but that's not IonQ's fault.* *I think Kenneth Brown doesn't even get a salary. Jungsang Kim and Peter Chapman are the only once that have classical stock. (9)They didn't yet publish what the stock based compensation looks like.*     \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n**Now I will focus on the three biggest criticisms brought forth**: Number one is their quantum volume claim, number two is the roadmap, number three is the clock speed.   \n    \nQuantum Volume Claim: \u201cthe statement fails basic sanity checking\u201d an editor wrote on Wikipedia, referring to the QV claim by IonQ (13). I think this just shows how far IonQ got in a short amount of time and how unlikely it is that people will catch up to them soon. The other paper they published indicates that they can hit the QV    \n\n\nRoadmap: I'm not sure why people complain about the roadmap, since Google and PsiQuantum have basically the same roadmap. I'm not saying they can do it, I'm just saying they are claiming it.   \u201cGood guy Google, presenting a timeline that is realistic and devoid of hyperboles, crazy made-up numbers, and extrapolated plots. \u201c (14)  Dude, it's the same roadmap. Google is even more optimistic than IonQ. Concerning the plausibility of the roadmap of IonQ. Their are 2 things that need to happen and IonQ is done. One is miniaturisation, the other is the optical network. They already have the right amount of numbers of qubits that allow for error correction on the chip. The miniaturisation will decrease the physical error further, since the laser doesn't need to travel that far anymore. They need an increase of 0.06% of 2 gate fidelity. Keep in mind that they went from 97.5% to 99.9% in \\~ 2 years while increasing the number of qubits(15). Now they want to get to 99.96 with the same number of qubits.  Additionally, the miniaturisation has already been demonstrated. This is not that hard.  The other thing is the optical network. They will demonstrate it this year in a industrial setting (16). This has also been show in the lab already.   Once they got those 2 things done, they will start mass production and are done. Mass producing those things is not that hard, since nothing about them is \u201cquantum\u201d.    \n\n\nClock speed: Clock speed refers to how fast you can do gates. Their are two things to consider here: One is the \u201cgeneral speed\u201d. I don't really care how fast the QC is, as long as it can perform. QC are already really fast. The second, more interesting point is that you need to perform the Gate fast enough, so that the qubits stay in superposition. This could be a problem, but up until it wasn't the limiting factor. I have heard no one make an argument that this will limit the capabilities in the future.      \n    \n\n\n(1) https://ionq.com/algorithmic-qubit-calculator/  and https://ionq.com/news/october-01-2020-most-powerful-quantum-computer \n\n(2) https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11482 \n\n(3) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmtVNuAQMM0 (4) https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10841 and https://www.zdnet.com/article/ionq-ceo-peter-chapman-on-quantum-computing-adoption-innovation-and-whats-next/ \n\n(5) https://www.afr.com/technology/why-google-wasn-t-really-the-first-to-achieve-quantum-supremacy-20190927-p52vg6 \n\n(6) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Lg1nSd6Y min 10:50 \n\n(7) https://ionq.com/news/february-26-2019 \n\n(8) https://ionq.com/resources/publications \n\n(9) https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521098621/d70340ds4.htm \n\n(10) https://jqi.umd.edu/news/quantum-bit/2013/11/25/coherence-time-survival-quantum-state \n\n(11) https://www.nature.com/articles/npjqi201634 \n\n(12) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a00GwjvFhw&amp;t=420s (min 3:53) \n\n(13) https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum\\_volume&amp;action=history \n\n(14) https://twitter.com/anuragsaharoy/status/1394745248799023105 \n\n(15) https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13534-2 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If you want to discuss anything I wrote, go for it!** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: I'm long 6200 commons, 1360 of the 20c 10/15 and 400 of the 15c 10/15.",

Nice gain for SPRT on Friday, up almost 13% before giving back a little AH. Call options more than double puts in open interest. IV is so elevated that even deep out of the money calls are stupid expensive. I've seen a lot of people throwing out crazy numbers for stock valuations. Call option buying could be what's driving the price right now. For market makers, when they sell call options, they buy stock to hedge, remaining delta neutral via the Black-Scholes model. Or they could be long other call options. The caveat with this is with elevated volume on out-of-the-money call options, if the stock price stalls and there is no gamma pressure, market makers can unwind their hedges (sell the stock they bought to protect their ass from selling naked calls), putting further downward pressure on the share price. Premiums are crazy right now, so MMs are more than willing to sell these options. Things to keep in mind: IV crush and the potential that this merger may already be priced in. I closed my $4.5 calls for over 100% gains.\n\n\\- **EDU** \\- I expect this to be the next ~~stock~~ falling knife about posted with a bunch of \"but look at what it was valued at before!\" or \"available at a huge discount!\" Well, there's a reason. The CCP is probably going to make private tutoring companies non-profi7t. In the last 3 months, this stock has lost 80% of its value. It's not trading a discount, it's going down in flames. Let it find a bottom first.\n\n**- ATOS** \\- welcome back, old friend. The set up is starting to become eerily similar to last month. MM's making a TON of money selling options on this.\n\n\\- **GOTU** \\- see: EDU above.\n\n\\- **BBIG** \\- hype, run up, completes acquisition aaaaaand price tumbles. Not a ton, but a bit. Keep this in mind SPRT holders.\n\n\\- RLX - being sued for securities fraud following its IPO. Chinese companies are toxic AF right now. The big put volume was either a long hedging their bet OR closing their hedged bet.\n\n\\- **CEMI** \\- another gap-down day for CEMI after exploding earlier in the week. Ouch.\n\n\\- **IGC** \\- are we seeing a pattern here yet? IGC was juiced to the tits on Thursday and came back to Earth on Friday. [I wrote about this company 4 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/mh9to5/no_position_dd_igc_dont_get_burned/). This stock rocketed off news of a patent for Alzheimer's treatment with THC. The company has been claiming this product would be on shelves since 2018! Their revenue is \\~$900K for fiscal 2021. Lots of red flags with this company.\n\n\\- **ACOR** \\- big gap-up for ACOR on new of commercializing one of their drugs in Spain. Gap-down Monday? We will see.\n\n\\- **ADVM** \\- big loss after the company announced one of they're drugs sucks in clinical trials, basically. In April the stock dropped over 60% in one day because one of they're drugs sucked in clinical trials. Will probably keep falling.\n\n\\- **XSPA** \\- the ticker name always makes me imagine a spa specifically for X-Men. No news, looks like algos picking up discounted options.\n\n**- NMTR** \\- considering the $1 put is the most active, and stock price is over $1, I can infer that most likely this a long hedging their position through buying puts.\n\n\\- **WISA** \\- when you fly too close to the sun, sometimes your wings melt, right Icarus? This company did investors DIRTY. After two positive days, which drove up the share price, WISA announced an offering. Way to kneecap your investors. This is one of the scummiest moves, IMO. What a gift for call sellers, though.\n\n**- CYCN** \\- gap-up on announcing that it will announce results of a clinical study soon.\n\n**- ARDX** \\- the stock price tumble continues. It seems to be slowing, but this stock still has not found bottom. Open interest continues to rise on call options, which is just goofy. High IV means people are overpaying for these options. Just wait for this to find bottom and calm down. If it has a dead cat bounce, don't rush in.\n\n\\- **CBIO** \\- the company announced they screened their first patient for a study, which is necessary before starting phase 1 of trials next year. I think this news is reflected in the Dec call buying.\n\n\\- **ADTX** \\- looks like credit call spreads establish for February. Bearish move\n\n\\- **IMV** \\- no real news, just looks like the stock finally got a bit of volume. Maybe its the purchases brought on by a public offering that was recently offered at a 16% discount to the market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhew. Lot going on there.

If I buy it back, then I get about $4 in premium which would bring the loss to $6.50, but I also recapture on gains in AMD stock north of $100 which represents $500.

With that said here's some targets I'm looking at for new entries, I have limit buys set on all tickers below:\n\nPINS - &lt;$60: We've retraced to this level in May and seen a bounce, I love the company but I sold at $76 when we started to lose steam, high conviction for $100 on this ticker but it could be years away still, looking to take profit around the $75 region again.\n\nSPCE ~$15: Meme stock I know, and I think people are starting to see how poor the revenue model actually is for this company, with that said I think the buy wall at $15 is massive and cannot be ignored, with the price bleeding towards that value for the second time in 3 months after breaking ATH, both before and after said $15 crash. I think this one may be a dumb money move.\n\nCRSR ~$30: I love this stock already and own many Corsair products. I'd be going all in now if I had the balls but there is a steep cliff edge on this stock, next support may be far away if we can't hold above $29, will be watching this carefully and maybe stopping out below $28 as this is one of the only stocks in my portfolio currently\n\nAMD - &lt;$75: Another favourite of mine, again sold around $81, similar principle to PINS but with the recent chip shortage (bullish long-term imo) and market losing steam I'd look for a cheaper price, it's relatively stable which is why the entry is still pretty high for what it is\n\nNIO - &lt;$34: Not sure if we'll see this price again due to the unpredictability of China/EV Market/Memes but I see it running again if it hits around these levels - I actually avoided this stock in early May when I thought I saw a head and shoulders forming on the 1-month chart and still chastising myself for that one\n\nShips that have unfortunately sailed for me: NET, NVDA, TSLA, change my mind?\n\nThese are my thoughts for now, any circuit breakers like COVID-20 or WW3 would obviously make me change my tune but my 2 cents for now, let me know what you guys think!",

        "selftext": "So I've been thinking about risk management in a way that works for the new aggressive retail trader. The traditional 1% of your portfolio value in trades(PV= $10,000 thus each trade should be $100)  is the recommendation but might not be worth your time or seem realistic. \n\nHeck, if you are working a decent job and have a good budget on your finances you might be willing to sacrifice a bit more is probably what you're thinking. \n\nWell that's what I did and it brought me great success in 2020 and 2021 so far. Though I'm not recommending everyone that needs to do this. This is mostly for the aggressive trader.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d7rb0wakfud71.png?width=1355&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ecf408a2bd32a64fefbd069bc2705eb208d98b7\n\nWe are in a new era of trading where we get excited about yolo gains but ignore the fact that this is a small sample size of a mass group of people. We tend to leave out does that fail and how times has that person failed to get to that point.  Well this is survivorship bias in action. Any who, you might be  thinking.. If that person can get 400% gain, I can at least get 100% or a piece of that. Very motivating..inspiring..intoxicating..right?\n\nHowever if catch yourself throwing more than 30% of your portfolio value into just ONE TRADE\u2026then this is for you to put the brakes on sabotaging your account and prevent you from quitting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Buying options, for me is consider going on offense and Selling Options going on defense.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we are going to focus on the buying options first since that's what most traders start off with and I might make a selling options post at later date. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo to start with the basic assessment question:\n\n1.  What am I willing to lose?\n   1. . This can be tricky, causing new traders to abusively diamond hands their options/shares and baghold. Raise your hand if this is you. So we must ask a more detailed question: \n      1.  **How much am I willing to lose, so that my lost doesn't wipe out my monthly/ YTD profits?**\n2. By asking this specific question, it lead me in a **performance based mindset.** I wanted realized profits on a weekly and month basis. NOT unrealized( when you don't sell). This gave me the space to think about the chances of  making back those profits, if I lost the money in one or few bad trades. So I narrowed it down to these percentages. \n3. Calls or Call Debits Spreads - 10% or less of Portfolio value (graph below)\n   1. It seems risking to losing 10% of PV to make 20-50% gain on trade is a good mix\n   2. Some plays overtime might zoom pass your price targets and you might just let some run, just remember to take profits because you need your portfolio to grow and not get stuck with a lucky win. \n   3.  As the Portfolio grow in value due to great trades, inject new capital, long position growing, you will start to use less capital for calls/puts/debit spreads. \n   4.  New trader make a mistake and risk it all and then have to wait **MONTHS to restart or they just give up and blame stock market sucks.** You might also here, **it works until it doesn't** lol.  Thus being stuck in the hamster wheel of the rat race. **Re-read this point again.** 5x Don't write yourself off too soon, especially if you haven't put in at least 1 year of trading. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Debit Spreads for more consistent gains?\n   1. Almost becomes a cheat code, because typically there is still equity in the trade as time passes, and your losses is limited. If your underlying goes against you, and there is more than 5 days to expiration you mostly can close out early or place a stop loss order to prevent further loss. With Calls and puts time decay and IV crush is a bitch..point blank period.  \n   2.  It's best to stick with SPY, IWM, and/or QQQ but if you want to gamble with individual stocks, just know it very difficult to save the trade or escape quickly, since most of you are probably doing weeklies. \n   3. With debit spreads always close out your trade yourself to **avoid assignment**\n\nBelow is the difference between Call and Call Debit Spread. \n\n\t1. Both serves as a purpose of a bullish move but if the stock price is at or above the short strike price the debit spreads is also a neutral strategy \n\n\t2. The Call option, is roughly double the cost but infinite profits(this is on SPY so a rapid price movement in a day would typical not exceed more than 1-1.5% in a day. \n\n\t3. Notice how the call loses premium each day if price action stay stagnant and the debit spreads preserves capital in this scenario and as each day gets closer to expiration, the potential of profit is higher than the call but profits is limited. \n\n\t4. Below is both ATM options for call (1) and Bull Call Debit Spread (2)  on the Same expiry date. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Call \\(1\\)](https://preview.redd.it/4vwz1y5aeud71.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66f9de7971cdd2196d6b76d85e8b303eb4682a9b)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Bull call Debit Spread ](https://preview.redd.it/apxh23jceud71.png?width=1250&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72c7ded707f915627c4accd663d8236e656af9ec)\n\nI'm not against Calls. I used them only strategically or for gambling trades on GME, AMC, SNDL, AMD due to the low premiums plus expected rise in volume at the time **where it didn't make sense to do a debit spread due to opportunity cost.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelow is a visual and potential outcome, you can look to see if you had 25 winning trades per year, hence executing more and being responsible is key. So 50 winning trades could be a goal or 25. This is just for motivation and the numbers below isn't compounding based off reinvesting the profits. Obviously as PV grows your trades will become larger if you follow some sort of guidance, like below.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vptp6e1jeud71.png?width=948&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=434bfeb31f3233930e9e31df9c1a5a13991a8547\n\nYou see with the small account you might be wondering..mhmm I should just put $990 in a trade and keep going..right but that will be 20% of your portfolio value meaning all it will take is 5 trades to destroy your account. \n\nThose who built an account to $25,000 or more through trading have some experience but still may be a beginner in trading if they are only executing a few trades a year and go \"lucky\". \n\nThere is even 6 figure professionals, who start off with a large account , think they know how to trade based off their professional 1confidence and risk it all as well without having any proper risk management and business sense. \n\nBut if you feed your portfolio with new capital in the beginning, eat crow, go on defense with expenses and be a student of game putting 25 hours of homework and trading a week, then you can get your goal asap. \n\nPretty Simple stuff but the questions is.. **Do you really want to put in the work?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSidenote: Highly recommend keeping a options journal. I thought I didn't need but ever since I started putting into practice it has been a game changer for honing in my risk management skill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o5snmnnneud71.png?width=1618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dd79e4f893997bb58b23d486675ef0c33f8e8f7",

        "selftext": "**Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation and Analysis (Q2 Week 3) - $TSLA, $AAPL, $AMZN, $MSFT, $GOOG, $FB, $AMD, and More**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat's poppin' bull gang, I hope you made some awesome money last week! The spreadsheet was spot on for nearly every company, and all of my plays came to fruition! **$MT and $X ended up bagging us anywhere from 300% to 500%, $JETS gave us 1100%, and $SNAP netted us 250% on our strangles and nearly 600% on binary options!** I\u2019m looking to keep this momentum going throughout this week as well, and with all of FAAMG (I kicked $NFLX out for $MSFT after their disgraceful earnings) set to report, this week could prove to be more lucrative than the last! We\u2019ve got a large variety of trades we can make this week ranging from educated gambles, to good old fashioned theta plays. We\u2019ve even have a couple of opportunities to sprinkle in some collateral plays if we wish! Let\u2019s get into it! \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Pinterest is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $PINS has had an average post earnings move of **14%**. The options this week are pricing in a move of *roughly 6%* on both sides of the chain, which is likely going to shrink significantly going into earnings as theta eats away at the contracts. Even though I\u2019m extremely bullish on $PINS, this trade could honestly move either way, so I\u2019m personally opting to play a straddle like I did with $SNAP last week. Given that we get a historically average move, we\u2019ll be making some money on this trade. Keep in mind, this trade *is* riskier than the one we played on $SNAP, since the average historical move is smaller. Don\u2019t over leverage yourself, and don\u2019t be afraid to turn the straddle into a reverse iron butterfly to reduce your cost basis on the trade.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Over the past 24 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time!** The odds on this trade are phenomenal, and we have quite a few options for how we want to play it.  If you want to gamble directionally, call debit spreads would be your best bet from a risk to reward standpoint. Alternatively, we can also join theta-gang for this play by selling ATM put credit spreads allowing us to net some extremely nice premiums. If you want an even safer spread, $MSFT also has a similar win-rate (~65%) while having a historically smaller move, allowing you to defend your capital in the event that the trade goes against you. Since both $SHOP and $MSFT report on different days, we can look to make this play twice to ensure we\u2019re not overleveraged on any given day.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Counterintuitively, $XLE is NOT a good [collateral play](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays) this week!** $XLE actually has a *higher* IV than both $XOM and $CVS, so if you wanted to play oil earnings, you\u2019d actually be better off rolling the dice on the individual companies. I\u2019m not sure why this is the case here. Either the MMs are catching onto my bullshit (unlikely), or there\u2019s some nuances to trading oil that I\u2019m not aware of.  I\u2019m sure there\u2019s an arbitrage play you could make regarding the individual price and IV differences proportional to the ETF holdings, but I don\u2019t have time to crunch the numbers nor do I think I\u2019d have enough capital to abuse it. Regardless, I just wanted to bring this to everyone\u2019s attention since this is one of the rare cases where the collateral play puts us at a disadvantage.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll that being said, I haven\u2019t had much time to review any extra trades given that I\u2019ve been extremely busy this weekend. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nWe\u2019ve got another fun week of earnings ahead of us! I personally tend to avoid playing FAANG stocks in general, so my analysis was concentrated elsewhere. If you see any appealing plays, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you\u2019d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, July 28, 2021**\n\nThe market staged another remarkable reversal today, with many names that were hit yesterday clawing back their losses. The three major indexes were mixed, with Nasdaq (QQQ) climbing 0.35%. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) dipped towards the end of the session to close 0.6%  down. The Dow Jones (DIA), which tracks industrial and financial stocks, fell 0.37%. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed, rising 1.53% at the time of writing. Just like last Monday, today demonstrates that, while there are risks present in the market, investors and traders remain eager to buy up every dip.\n\nToday, market participants continue to digest a slew of earnings reports, with three of the largest companies in the market, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) reporting yesterday. Today, after-hours, Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) are reporting, among many others. \n\nMoreover, market participants also eyed the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) July Monetary Policy Report, which largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed\u2019s stated goals. The statement read, \u201cLast December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage\u2011backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings.\u201d In other words, the Fed says substantial progress has been made and that in the coming months, we will increasingly begin to hear more about a timeline to taper quantitative easing. \n\nOn inflation, the statement largely reiterated what it has in months past. The statement read, \u201cInflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses\u201d and \u201cThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer\u2011term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.\u201d\n\nHowever, the report did acknowledge potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if \u201cappropriate risks arise\u201d. The statement read, \u201cIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\u201d\n\nRead the entire July FOMC statement here: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm)\n\nShares of Facebook (FB) fell 5% after-hours despite largely beating analyst after the company warned of a significant slowdown moving forward. Here are the numbers.\n\n* **Earnings:** $3.61 per share, adjusted, vs. $3.03 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.\n* **Revenue:** $29.08 billion, vs. $27.89 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.\n* **Daily active users (DAUs):** 1.91 billion, vs. 1.91 billion as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.\n* **Monthly active users (MAUs):** 2.90 billion, vs. 2.91 billion as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.\n* **Average revenue per user (ARPU):** $10.12, vs. $9.66 as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.\n\nImportantly, however, with respect to guidance, Facebook warned of a significant deceleration in growth moving forward. The company said it expects \u201cyear-over-year total revenue growth rates to decelerate significantly on a sequential basis as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Twitter (TWTR) stock surged roughly 5% before moderating after the company announced it was testing a new feature called the \u201cShop Module\u201d that would enable businesses to sell their products directly through the Twitter platform. \n* Quarterly revenue for LinkedIn, the professional social network owned by tech giant Microsoft, surpassed $1 billion in the quarter for the first time.\n* Youtube, which is owned by Alphabet, reported revenues of $7 billion for the quarter. To put into context how massive YouTube really is, Netflix (NFLX) had $7.3 billion in revenue this quarter, which has a $230 billion market-cap. It\u2019s funny, in a world where the competition between streaming services for professional content is becoming increasingly more saturated, YouTube is poised to become and doesn\u2019t spend billions to produce and acquire content. \n* Shares of chip-maker AMD gapped up today after the company beat earnings estimates and raised guidance moving forward that suggests the company will continue to take market share away from Intel. As I\u2019ve said before, I think AMD and NVDA are the kings of this space.\n* Chinese stocks gapped up today after a massive, across the board sell-off. \n* Microsoft (MSFT) earnings Yesterday\n   * **Revenue:** $46.15 billion versus $44.25 billion expected\n   * **Earnings per share:** $2.17 versus $1.92 expected\n   * **Productivity and Business Processes:** $14.69 billion versus $13.9 billion expected\n   * **Intelligent Cloud:** $17.38 billion versus $16.4 billion expected\n   * **More Personal Computing:** $14.09 billion versus $13.8 billion expected\n* Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) earnings yesterday\n   * **Earnings per share (EPS):** $27.26 vs $19.34 per share\n   * **Revenue:** $61.88 billion vs $56.16 billion\n   * **YouTube advertising revenue:** $7.00 billion vs $6.37 billion expected\n   * **Google Cloud revenue:** $4.63 billion vs $4.40 billion expected, \n   * **Traffic acquisition costs (TAC):** $10.93 billion vs $9.74 billion expected\n* Apple (AAPL) earnings yesterday\n   * **EPS**: $1.30 vs. $1.01 estimated \n   * **Revenue**: $81.41 billion vs. $73.30 billion estimated, up 36% year-over-year \n   * **iPhone revenue**: $39.57 billion vs. $34.01 billion estimated, up 49.78% year-over-year \n   * **Services revenue**: $17.48 billion vs. $16.33 billion estimated, up 33% year-over-year \n   * **Other Products revenue**: $8.76 billion vs. $7.80 billion estimated, up 40% year-over-year \n   * **Mac revenue**:$8.24 billion vs. $8.07 billion estimated, up 16% year-over-year \n   * **iPad revenue**: $7.37 billion vs. $7.15 billion estimated, up 12% year-over-year \n   * **Gross margin**: 43.3% vs. 41.9% estimated \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) with a host of target raises.

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have all read that \"it is not COVID's effect on people\", it is \"how businesses and governments react with restrictions\" .. that effects stocks. Bored of this, heard it too many times? Not scared any more?\n\nWell the virus and variants didn't get bored.\n\nReviewing the top five economies and their case trends -------------------------\n\nSource : [Worldometers.info](https://Worldometers.info)\n\nUSA:  new cases curving upward, especially in FL\n\nChina:  they lie about their numbers\n\nJapan:  new cases increasing at a roughly linear rate\n\nGermany: new cases growing again, though off of a low base\n\nFrance:  new cases surging and strong in the numbers, curving up\n\nUK:  new cases surged though showing signs of starting to drop\n\nKeeping your elder family members safe from your infecting them is still a cultural truth.\n\nOne political party in a given country wants to make another fail.  One party will weaponize the virus and threaten the other to take action.  This is what leads to restrictions.  Before it was the Democrats shutting down businesses to make the economy worse for Republicans.  Now it is the same, but Repub states will shut down and Dem states will want to keep businesses open.  In another country similar games will play out.\n\nSo all the potential economic shut downs are still there.\n\nWhat is different is that all the technology that was bought to have the kids educate from home, such as tablets and web cams and online meeting subscriptions don't need to be bought a second time so soon.  So the 2nd set of restrictions on the population comes without a sector that gets an economic boost.  The exception is grocery stores and online shopping.\n\nThe extra unemployment benefits end on Sept 6th in numerous states, but investors know that and would sell effected stocks sooner.  The moratorium on evictions ends this fall, and so tenants will stop the games and scramble to pay their landlords, taking away their spending money.  If they don't they will get an eviction on their credit record.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow to valuations\n\n[https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe)\n\nshows that the Schiller PE ratio of stocks is 38.3.  The .com bubble was the highest it ever got, higher than this level for 2.5 years, and getting to the mid 40's.  Other then that, at no time in history was this valuation ratio this high.\n\nNote also that in 1982 at the peak of interest rates 13 to 14%, the average stock had a PE of 7 to 9.\n\nA book by O'Shoughnessy \"What Works on Wall Street\" studied 40 years of stock market data.  Its results shows that a price to sales ratio is 'the king of value factors', since sales can't be manipulated like earnings can.\n\n[https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales)\n\nshows that this valuation is higher now than at any time charted.  The book suggests that a price to sales of 1.5 is considered a good deal.  We are over twice that level on average.\n\nThe market breadth has eroded under the mega techs.  Note the Russel 2000 declined recently.\n\nHere are the price to sales of the mega techs, using data at Reuters.  This can be hard to find in navigation, but a direct link will help, for example\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.N](https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.N)\n\nuse .N and .O at the end of the symbol for NYSE and NASDAQ.\n\nprice to sales:\n\nMSFT = 13.3 ; FB = 10.4 ; AAPL = 7.5 ; AMZN = 4.3 ; GOOG = 8.76 ; NVDA = 25.2 ; AMD = 9.5\n\nThese clearly can fall and still be overvalued.\n\nSome have sighted the growth in the money supply, such as M2, as part of what has pushed the market higher.  However, it is important to note that M2 was recategorized in 2020.  So even though you can go to the Mises Institute's site and see articles of big increases in the M2 money supply, much of that is due to the recategorization and strangely the articles omit this but for a footnote.\n\nInflation ----------------------------------------------\n\nA large part of what we pretend to understand about inflation is the CPI and PCE.\n\nWe think that we know that the last CPI reading was 5.4%.  That is above the target of 2% of course when action by the recipe is needed.  This coupled with Powell not wanting to raise rates and desiring to de-prioritize inflation is \"bad enough\" from a stock perspective.  Jim Cramer described Powell as \"having a heart\" in wanting to prioritize helping people back to work.  Recall that interest rates have to be jacked up in response to inflation eventually.  Acting to late makes it worse.  From business school texts, higher interest rates put downward pressure on the value of future earnings.  Thus the forward looking value of stocks drops.\n\n  But I challenge all of you to take the CPI by its percentage components and REBUILD it yourself with online research.  I did.  While the published number was +1.6% year over year at the time, I found no component less than 2%, and most were a good deal higher.  It is easy to find information showing education expenses rising at a +5% annual rate for many years.  Medical costs I found web sites saying +4% annually consistantly over many years.  At the time, only oil was lower than 2% price growth.  Today, with oil back up above $70 a barrel, that is not to be taken lightly.\n\n  Recently the Fed has emphasized the PCE, the Personal Consumption Expendatures index.  Do you find as I do it strange that they publish the 'this month vs last month' number, making it look like small 0.1 to 0.3% rise, and not the more useful year over year number, which would show a larger % increase?\n\n  The National Debt takes no small part in the government's new desire to have inflation be high and keep interest rates low.  But that combination is impossible over time.  Inflation helps those in debt since the purchasing power of what you pay back is less than the purchasing power of what you borrowed.  Keeping interest rates low helps prevent default.\n\n  I have been at individual stock investing since 1996 and I have sold most of my stock holdings.  I lived through the .com crash which I took on the chin (with small dollars since I was young) and I learned from it such that I was 66% in cash for the crash of 2008.  If you have not been in the habit of thinking about economic impacts, valuations, and questioning what real inflation is, it is certainly time to start.\n\n  The great bull market of the 1980's in the USA was spurred by the acceleration of women entering the work force and the personal computer.  The great bull market of the 1990's was spurred by implementation of the internet, immigration, and foreign economies developing.\n\n  What is the story now?  5G networking is just a faster version of the same thing, but only over shorter distances.  Artificial intelligence is intended to replace humans.  Electric vehicles only reduce pollution after 100k miles compared to ICE cars according to an article in the WSJ.  I think to move on to much higher valuations we need a big economic story that just isn't there right now.",

With the release of Ryzen, AMD began climbing from the depths in 2016 and started it\u2019s steroid cycle in 2019.\n\t- Historically Q3 has been AMD\u2019s best quarter by far, the fact that AMD crushed it in Q420 w/ $2.2 billion in q/q growth and then beat out Q420 by another 2 billion in 2021. \n\t- AMD has achieved these numbers DESPITE fucc boi COVID-19 and significant shortages/ manufacturing challenges.\n\t\n**The Balance Sheet Quick Glance**\n\t\n\t- $3.116 Billion in cash/ cash equivalent, up $826 Million q/q and up $1.731 Billion YoY (LOL GAWT DAMN THAS SUM GROWTH)\n\t- Debt $313 Million, down $17 Million q/q and down $175 Million YoY\n\t- Inventories $1.653 Billion, up $254 Million q/q and up $597 Million YoY\n\t- Accounts receivable $2.178 Billion, up $112 Million q/q and up $487 Million YoY\n\n\tAMD has a very strong balance sheet and continues to grow as a company, further proof that AMD is well on its way to the moon.\n\n**Financial Outlook Quick Glance**\n\n\t- 2021Q2 expected earnings $3.6 Billion, historically they beat their estimates by a small bit\n\t- 2021 expected earnings is 50% YoY Growth ($14.65 Billion) \n\t- Gross margin for YoY is not expected to change\n\t- Operating expenses are expexted 27% for the year\n\n**Q1 and Beyond Thoughts**\n\n\tAMD has been doing tremendous and has done nothing but grow as a company since Lisa Su took over in 2014. AMD\u2019s last 1.5 years are a sign of what\u2019s to come, I believe they will be on this incredible run for the rest of year and possibly into next before they start to slow down.
