My theory is that showing consistent results over this time period is indicative of strong fundamentals and will be a good investment over a period of at least one year. You'll see some common companies in here, as well as some not so common ones.

Let's go. \n\n\\&gt;What the fuck is Me? \n\nNo not me, U?\n\nU?\n\nNo, he is me and I am u. \n\nBut seriously though 23andMe Holding Co. (NASDAQ: ME) is the leading direct-to-consumer genetic testing company operating across two segments, Consumer &amp; Research Services, and more recently Therapeutics. These variations, called SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms), have the potential to tell you about your ancestry, your traits and certain health conditions.\n\n(They are the people who send you or your wife's boyfriend a bag, spit in it and send it back and they tell you where you're from and what health problems you could possibly face in the future.) \n\n\\&gt;**Financials**: \n\n23andMe Holding Co. is in a strong financial position for a still-loss-making company as of March 31, 2021, with $283M in cash and a -$78M TTM cash burn equating to \\~3.5 years of funding. This doesn't account for the SPAC merger and PIPE investment which will net an additional $696M in cash. This bitch got a lot of cash yo!\n\n\\&gt;**Who are their potential customers?** \n\nWell, you and me dummy. They sell kits that tell you your ancestry and potential health condition. \n\nThey also sell a yearly subscription for $27 for access to specific reports. \n\n\\&gt;**Very very valuable data:** \n\nData data data. This is the Goldmine for this company. For some time now, 23andMe has been touting its massive 11.3M genotyped customer database, but it has finally come to fruition. Selling this data to pharmaceutical companies to develop new drugs is big bank. Also, Insurance companies may rob you blind and stiff you for payment, but they take a huge risk when signing new customers. Using data from 23and me. They could decide how risky you are to insure. This means they are willing to cough up some cash to see what health concerns you might have in the future and decide if it\u2019s worth insuring you. To get this data, they will flood $ME with cash. \n\n**Summary** \n\n\u00b7 23andMe Holding Co. is the leading direct-to-consumer genetic testing company entering drug development with data on 11.3M Genotyped Customers and $696M in SPAC funding. \n\n\u00b7 23andMe's core products include a suite of D2C genetic reports covering ancestry, genetic health risks, carrier status, and medication responses and 40+ programs (2 clinical stage) for therapeutic development.\n\n\u00b7 23andMe Holding Co. is in a strong financial position with TTM revenues of $244M and management guidance outlining revenues reaching $400M by 2024 with an expected 18% CAGR.\n\n\u00b7 In summary, 23andMe Holding Co. Is considered a strong \"buy\" at a $14.3/share (+44% upside).\n\nSince 23andMe Holding Co. is new to the public markets, it doesn't have a large analyst following yet. What can be assumed (with well-rounded research) from the one or two analyst's following is that there is a \"bullish\" recommendation with a price target of $14. A steal compared to its current $9 price tag. \n\nTldr: $ME bouta blow outta this bitch.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, August 12, 2021**\n\nStocks largely finished higher, with all three major indexes managing to close out the day in the green. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) once again recorded fresh intraday highs.  The Nasdaq (QQQ) broke two consecutive red days and finished higher today. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed relative to the major indexes, closing the day 0.26% down. It seems a pattern has emerged in the last week or so, in which the market pulls back early in the morning before reversing to the upside. Market participants continue to weigh new economic data and corporate earnings with concerns around the coronavirus Delta variant and potential inflationary pressures. \n\nYesterday, The Labor Department reported Wednesday that its consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.4% in July from a year earlier, in line with June\u2019s figure and matching the largest jump since August 2008. The government said CPI increased 0.5% on a month-over-month basis, matching a consensus forecast from economists surveyed by Dow Jones.\n\nCore CPI which excludes energy and food, rose by 0.3% last month, shy of a forecasted 0.4% increase and well below June\u2019s rise of 0.9%. The core figure is up 4.3% over the last year, a slight deceleration from June\u2019s 4.5%. Economists often consider core CPI to be a more reliable indicator since it\u2019s insulated from the frequent swings in petroleum and food prices. It\u2019s encouraging to see prices slowly moderate as the economic recovery continues to mature and pent-up consumer demand is increasingly released. \n\nThe US Senate gave surprisingly bipartisan approval to a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads and bridges, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation\u2019s broadband infrastrucutre. The vote, 69-30, was uncommonly bipartisan given the seeming contention the Republicans had for the initial drafts of the infrastructure bill. President Biden said, \u201cThis historic investment in infrastructure is what I believe you, the American people, want, what you\u2019ve been asking for for a long, long time.\u201d Mitch McConnell, who earlier in the year publicly declared \u201c100% of my focus is on stopping this new administration\u201d said of the deal, \u201cI was proud to support today\u2019s historic  bipartisan infrastructure and prove that both sides of the political aisle can still come together around common-sense solutions.\u201d The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads and bridges, bolster public transportation, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation\u2019s broadband and 5G infrastrucutre. Here is a full list of what is included: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* A slew of corporate earnings continues, with notable names like ContextLogic (WISH), SoFi Technologies (SOFI), Disney (DIS), Rocket Mortgage (RKT) and Airbnb (ABNB) reporting\n   * WISH and SOFI both plummeted after earnings\n* Shares of Micron Technology (MU) continued its steep pullback, falling more than 7% today after analysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock citing fears of deceleration in DRAM sales.

        "selftext": "Recently, Bright Health Group landed on the New York Stock Exchange and made $924 million in its initial public offering. The IPO pricing values Bright Health at $11.23 billion, according to\u00a0[a report](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/tiger-global-backed-bright-health-raises-924-mln-us-ipo-2021-06-24/)\u00a0from Reuters. The startup insurer initially priced its IPO at $18 per share, and issued 51.3 million shares. At present, Bright Health's stock price is $16.7 and the market value is $10.277 billion.\n\nFounded in 2015, Bright Health is a medical health insurance and technology company. Through cooperation with top suppliers in the medical system, it establishes connections between medical consumers and suppliers, and is committed to providing users with reasonable medical insurance solutions\u00a0and high-quality medical services through advanced technology.\n\nThe company raised $500 million in a late-stage funding round in September last year from investors such as Tiger Global Management, T. Rowe Price Associates and Blackstone Group Inc\u00a0[(BX.N)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/BX.N), bringing total equity raised to over $1.5 billion.\n\nIn 2020, Bright Health generated more than 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in revenue, an increase of more than three times compared with the 280 million U.S. dollars in 2019. The total revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was US$874.6 million. While revenue has increased, the company's losses have been expanding. From 2018 to 2020, the company lost 62.6 million U.S. dollars, 125.3 million U.S. dollars and 248.4 million U.S. dollars, respectively, and its net loss almost doubled.\n\n**Business Model: 2C+2B**\n\nBright Health runs two businesses, NeueHealth(2B)\u00a0and Bright HealthCare(2C). In particular, Bright HealthCare sells Medicare and commercial health insurance to about 623,000 consumers in\u00a014 states of\u00a0the United States. NeueHealth offers virtual and in-person clinical care to patients through affiliated primary care clinics.\n\n**Bright HealthCare: diverse strategies serve different groups of people**\n\nBright HealthCare offers health plans for individuals and families, small businesses and employees, and Medicare Advantage plans for seniors.\u00a0Five years ago, Bright Healthcare only offered a single product in one state, and the number of users was only 10,765. As of now, this department operates in 14 states across the United States, and plans to expand to more states by 2022.\n\nCurrently, Bright HealthCare provides health care benefits to approximately 623,000 consumers. Customers include: 1) Commercial customers. Bright HealthCare provides commercial health plans in 11 states, including personal and family plans and employer plans, serving approximately 515,000 people; 2) Medicare Advantage users. Bright HealthCare provides Medicare Advantage products in 11 states, serving approximately 108,000 people, usually focusing on high-risk groups with special needs.\n\nIn addition, Bright Healthcare operates a small Managed Medicaid business in California. Regarding self-funded employer support, Bright Healthcare is currently establishing ASO business (ASO, administrative services only) for self-paying employers through multiple strategic partners. Administrative services only (ASO) refers to an agreement that companies use when they fund their\u00a0[employee benefit plan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/employer_sponsored_plan.asp)\u00a0but hire an outside vendor to administrate it. Bright Healthcare\u00a0believes that to continue expanding self-insurance market is\u00a0an important part of its diversification strategy. Bright HealthCare also participates in a number of specialized plans and is the nation\u2019s third largest provider of Chronic Condition Special Needs Plans (C-SNPs).\n\nFrom 2018 to 2020, Bright Healthcare\u2019s total premiums were US$127 million, US$272 million, and US$1.18 billion, with growth rates of 114.17% and 333.82%, respectively. The growth rate was tripled.\u00a0Its commercial insurance premium income was 111 million U.S. dollars, 236 million U.S. dollars, and 692 million U.S. dollars, with growth rates of 112.61% and 193.22%, respectively. Commercial premiums accounted for 87.64%, 86.77%, and 58.66% of total premiums, respectively, and their proportions dropped to about half in 2020. Medicare Advantage\u00a0premium income was 15.71 million U.S. dollars, 36.03 million U.S. dollars and 480 million U.S. dollars, with growth rates of 129.34% and 1232.42%, respectively. The growth rate in 2020 is particularly astonishing. MA premiums accounted for 12.36%, 13.23% and 41.34% of total premiums, respectively, and their proportions increased to nearly half in 2020.\n\nIn terms of users, the number of commercial users in 2020 was 145,000, and this number soared to 482,000 in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 232.41%. The number of MA users was\u00a062,000, and reached 67,000\u00a0in the first quarter of 2021. Although Bright Health has achieved amazing growth in both premiums and the number of users, combined with its acquisitions, both the surge in users and the increase in premiums were driven by Bright Healthcare's acquisition of Brand New Day.  \n\n**NeueHealth: Healthcare services empower 2C business**\n\nNeueHealth is a comprehensive medical institution that provides local and personalized care services in a variety of ways. Its services include: \n\nIntegrated Care Delivery \u2014 Operating clinics that provide comprehensive care to all populations.\n\nBright Health Network \u2014Ecosystem of Care Partners.\n\nValue Services Organization \u2014 Empowering high-performing primary care practices and care delivery organizations to succeed in their evolution towards risk-bearing care delivery.\n\nIts income consists of two parts, namely service fees and premium income. Service fees\u00a0mainly refer to NeueHealth affiliated medical group\u2019s pay-for-service\u00a0income and\u00a0the network service income generated by Bright Health Network under NeueHealth; the premium income refers to NeueHealth\u2019s value service organization and its affiliated medical group\u2019s income from taking charge of patients\u2019\u00a0medical care.\n\nIn 2020, NeueHealth's service fee income was 29.35 million U.S. dollars, and premium income was 7.79 million U.S. dollars.\u00a0In the first quarter of 2021, service fee income increased by US$8.1 million year-on-year, reaching US$15.6 million, mainly due to the increase in revenue from the inter-company network contract service of the Bright HealthCare division. Premium income increased by US$26.7 million year-on-year, an increase of 1,330.8% to US$28.7 million. Similarly, the increase in revenue was driven by the acquisition of PMA.\n\nAs of April 2021, NeueHealth works with over 200,000 care provider partners and operates 28 managed and affiliated risk-bearing clinics within its integrated care delivery system. Through those risk-bearing clinics, NeueHealth maintains nearly 75,000 unique patient relationships as of April 2021, approximately\u00a030,000 of which are served through value-based arrangements, across multiple payors. In addition to the\u00a0directly managed and affiliated clinics, NeueHealth manages care for an additional 33 clinics through its Value Services Organization.\n\n**Competitive advantages: technology empowerment + extensive customer base + full chain**\n\nAfter summarizing Bright Health's business model, we found that the company's competitive advantages include: extensive customer base coverage, technological empowerment, and full-chain services.\n\nOn the customer side, Bright Healthcare offers plans covering all groups\u00a0of people. In particular, the currently developing Managed Medicaid business covers children and low-income groups; the personal and family plans in the business plan section cover self-employed and part-time groups; Medicare Advantage covers groups over 65 years old; and Employer ASO covers self-financing employer groups. At the same time, many of Bright Healthcare's professional programs target the chronically ill population.\u00a0In other words, regardless of customers\u2019\u00a0income, age, work or the way to obtain insurance, Bright Health can provide products or services in a direct or indirect manner.\n\nHowever, at present, Bright Healthcare\u2019s two largest customer groups are business plans and MA groups. Both in premium income and customer groups, business plans make up the most part. Products and services for other groups are still in their infancy, and the development of these product lines in the future will still require a lot of effort.\n\nIn technology, Bright Health\u00a0has developed\u00a0\u201cBright Health Intelligent Operating System\u201d or \u201cBiOS\u201d. It \u00a0refers to Bright Health\u2019s end-to-end intelligent technology platform comprised of consumer, care delivery, and administrative solutions, all designed to enable an integrated, aligned, and consumer-focused healthcare ecosystem.  \n\nBiOS uses the powerful data generated by Care Partner model to achieve integration of the healthcare system, including smart data center Consumer360 and the solution DocSquad for consumers and suppliers. \u201cConsumer360\u201d refers to Bright Health\u2019s proprietary intelligent data hub, which aggregates clinical and administrative data, as well as information derived from the consumer experience (i.e., from call center and other consumer interactions) and data relating to Social Determinants of Health. It could create a personalized digital care plan to empower DocSquad.  \n\n\n\u201cDocSquad\u201d refers to Bright Health\u2019s consumer and care provider solution, comprised of a purpose-built set of tools and experiences connecting consumers with the organizations responsible for their care, while giving providers a 360-degree view of a consumer to better manage their healthcare needs. Its services include virtual care, personalized care team, smart warning, and other healthcare services.\n\nAnother advantage of Bright Health is that\u00a0it both provides 2C and 2B services. On the one hand, it provides customers with Bright Healthcare\u00a0products, as well as customized and market-specific nursing services through NeueHealth's network and other healthcare providers. On the other hand, for business clients, NeueHealth helps healthcare providers gather consumers and provide care partners with multiple value propositions, while providing innovative tools and solutions to support population health management and development of value-based care. For payers, NeueHealth allows Bright HealthCare and other third-party payers to participate in value-based payment arrangements, while managing risk-bearing care delivery. It\u00a0provides payers with predictability of medical expenses, allowing them to focus more on benefit design and management.\n\nIn sum, Bright Health integrates financing and delivery of healthcare through the division and collaboration of the two departments, covering both payers\u00a0and suppliers. The payer\u2019s funding not only focuses on preventing losses, but also on creating overall consumer value and increasing access to medical care through effective resource allocation. Suppliers construct value-based arrangements that aim to reward the quality of care provided, rather than the number of services. It could\u00a0reduce the total cost of care and\u00a0improve\u00a0clinical outcomes.\n\n**Future challenges: loss doubles, and medical cost ratio increases**\n\nApart from\u00a0advantages, Bright Health is also facing some challenges. To achieve future development and even profitability, these challenges need to be overcome.\n\nFirst, the problem of customer groups. At present, the company's main customer base is divided into commercial\u00a0users and MA users. Commercial users\u2019,or personal insurance\u2019s\u00a0market share is relatively small, and the number of users in this market has grown rapidly after the enactment of Affordable Care Act. But in the later stage, the user group who cannot receive premium subsidies will have adverse selection.\u00a0The data shows that the total number of monthly registrations in the personal market increased from 10.6 million in 2013 to 17.4 million in 2015, reaching a peak, and then fell to 13.8 million in 2018. One reason is that from 2017 to 2018, insurance premiums rose sharply, and many people were unable to receive premium subsidies, so adverse selection occurred. Consistent with the number of users, operators that provide individual insurance plans have also seen a general trend of growth first and then decline, which also means that this market is very difficult for insurance companies.\n\nIn addition, there are many other participants in the personal insurance market, including Oscar Health, which went public not long ago. Although Bright Health claims to be able to compete with the former in terms of healthcare\u00a0networks, Oscar has 400,000 individual insurance members, just slightly less than that of Bright Health in personal insurance market.\n\nOn the other hand, the MA market is full of giants, and leading insurance companies occupy a large part of the market share, leaving Bright Health only a small part. Whether it is in personal\u00a0insurance or MA, customer acquisition\u00a0is quite\u00a0difficult, which is why Bright Health has adopted mergers and acquisitions to grow its customer base.\n\nAlthough Bright Health said it would expand to other customer groups, including self-funding\u00a0employer market and small business market, the development of these strategies is still in the early stages and has not been reflected in the company's financial data. In the future, much\u00a0resources must be invested, and even mergers and acquisitions and other means\u00a0will be necessary\u00a0to seize market share and customer base.\n\nIn addition, although Bright Health has both an insurance supply department and a medical service department, its medical cost ratio(MCR)\u00a0has been growing. From 2018 to 2020, the company's MCR\u00a0were 75.8%, 82.4% and 88.7%, which did not have any advantages compared with other companies. In other words, the company's efforts to control medical expenses through NeueHealth do not seem to have worked.\n\nThe company's operating costs have also been increasing. From 2018 to 2020, operating costs were US$95.83 million, US$180 million and US$410 million, respectively, with growth rates of 88% and 127%. With high medical expenses, coupled with increasing operating costs, the company still has a long way to go to achieve profitability.\n\nNevertheless, Bright Health is committed to controlling the entire value chain including users, payers and suppliers. This model is still a core competitiveness, which distinguishes it from competitors such as Oscar, and also reminds people\u00a0of United Health.\n\nWhat we can learn from Bright Health is its practice of complementing business through acquisitions. Bright Health turned NeueHealth into an independent department and constantly emphasizes the possibility of its future development. This differentiated department is built through continuous acquisitions. At present, 3% of the revenue contributed by this department is contributed by the acquisition department. Furthermore, the success of UnitedHealth Group is also on the basis of continuous acquisitions.\n\nAnother lesson\u00a0is the construction and integration of technology platforms. The intelligent\u00a0platform built by Bright Health integrates users, payers, and suppliers, and its solutions for suppliers or patients, such as applications, are based on this\u00a0platform. It aggregates\u00a0all user data and claims data to achieve transparent exchange and empowerment of data.\n\nBright Health\u2019s future is worth looking forward to.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, August 12, 2021**\n\nStocks largely finished higher, with all three major indexes managing to close out the day in the green. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) once again recorded fresh intraday highs.  The Nasdaq (QQQ) broke two consecutive red days and finished higher today. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed relative to the major indexes, closing the day 0.26% down. It seems a pattern has emerged in the last week or so, in which the market pulls back early in the morning before reversing to the upside. Market participants continue to weigh new economic data and corporate earnings with concerns around the coronavirus Delta variant and potential inflationary pressures. \n\nYesterday, The Labor Department reported Wednesday that its consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.4% in July from a year earlier, in line with June\u2019s figure and matching the largest jump since August 2008. The government said CPI increased 0.5% on a month-over-month basis, matching a consensus forecast from economists surveyed by Dow Jones.\n\nCore CPI which excludes energy and food, rose by 0.3% last month, shy of a forecasted 0.4% increase and well below June\u2019s rise of 0.9%. The core figure is up 4.3% over the last year, a slight deceleration from June\u2019s 4.5%. Economists often consider core CPI to be a more reliable indicator since it\u2019s insulated from the frequent swings in petroleum and food prices. It\u2019s encouraging to see prices slowly moderate as the economic recovery continues to mature and pent-up consumer demand is increasingly released. \n\nThe US Senate gave surprisingly bipartisan approval to a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads and bridges, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation\u2019s broadband infrastrucutre. The vote, 69-30, was uncommonly bipartisan given the seeming contention the Republicans had for the initial drafts of the infrastructure bill. President Biden said, \u201cThis historic investment in infrastructure is what I believe you, the American people, want, what you\u2019ve been asking for for a long, long time.\u201d Mitch McConnell, who earlier in the year publicly declared \u201c100% of my focus is on stopping this new administration\u201d said of the deal, \u201cI was proud to support today\u2019s historic  bipartisan infrastructure and prove that both sides of the political aisle can still come together around common-sense solutions.\u201d The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads and bridges, bolster public transportation, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation\u2019s broadband and 5G infrastrucutre.

        "selftext": "Most investors have probably never heard of exosomes until Codiak\u2019s (NASDAQ: CDAK) chief exec, Doug Williams, made his pitch about this cool molecules at the JP Morgan conference two weeks ago. So for starters, let's define what is an exosome. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) of endosomal origin that range in size between 30 and 150nm. Exosomes are secreted by a wide range of cells, since virtually all living cells utilize exosome-mediated communication. Exosomes carry cell-specific cargos of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that are selectively taken up by recipient cells.  In essence, these are a critical building block of organic life and have a myriad of unexplored biopharma applications.  \n\nThe cargo contained within exosomes can offer information for a wide range of diseases, therefore exosomes can also act as prognostic indicators and predictors of a patient\u2019s response to a specific course of treatment.  Exosome-based diagnostics are minimally invasive, offering both ease-of-use and speed of detection. Numerous approaches are being researched for creating drug-loaded exosomes and they can exert powerful effects. For example, if a patient has a disease caused by a missing or defective protein or microRNA, the patient\u2019s exosomes can be isolated, modified with the appropriate siRNA or protein, and injected back into the patient for treatment.\n\nFor these reasons, exosomes have gone from being overlooked to rapidly gaining momentum as a novel strategy for accessing the therapeutic effects of cells without the risks and difficulties of administering cells to patients.  Exosome-related technologies have been developing rapidly over the past few years. Substantial growth is expected for the market as they get highly integrated into the elite healthcare fields such as liquid biopsy, precision medicine and regenerative medicine.\n\nWithin the past 5 years, there have been at least 7 major partnership deals within the exosome industry, 8 large venture capital events, and 2 landmark acquisitions.  Today, the exosome industry is witnessing rising numbers of clinicals trials investigating exosome therapeutics and diagnostics. Here are some listed companies taking exosome science to the next level:\n\n**Innocan Pharma (CSE: INNO) (FSE: IP4) (OTCQB: INNPF) Combining Exosomes &amp; CBD**\n\nInnocan Pharma, in collaboration with a Tel Aviv university team, is developing a revolutionary cell therapy - based technology, loaded with CBD (Cannabidiol), designed to target coronavirus infected lung cells and central nervous system diseases. Innocan\u2019s CLX Therapy holds the potential to provide a highly synergistic effect of anti-inflammatory properties and help in the recovery of infected lung cells. This product is planned to act as a \"guided missile\" to the infected lungs, combining the cell healing properties of exosomes and the anti-inflammatory properties of CBD.\n\nInnocan's CBD Loaded Exosome (CLX) Therapy project demonstrates the capability of having reliable large-scale production of exosomes and is an important milestone in the CLX Therapy development process. Innocan managed to produce trillions of exosomes in a short period of time in a 3-dimensional bioreactor, and that may lead to economic large-scale exosome production for the CLX. This achievement is expected to pave the way for larger tests and studies.  Combine its CLX program R&amp; with their established credentials as a cannabis/CBD powerhouse, and in a final evaluation this company holds a lot of long-term promise for making strong and early inroads into the exosome market.\n\n**Sarepta Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SRPT) and Codiak BioSciences (NASDAQ: CDAK)**\n\nOn June 22, 2020, Sarepta Therapeutics and Codiak BioSciences signed a global research and option agreement to design and develop engineered exosome therapeutics to deliver gene therapy, gene editing and RNA technologies for neuromuscular diseases. The engineered exosome approach offers the potential to effectively deliver genetic therapeutics without triggering the adaptive immune response. The two-year agreement includes up to five neuromuscular targets. Codiak is eligible to receive up to $72.5 million in upfront and near-term license payments plus research funding.  That equates to a lot of capital that, if invested wisely, can go back into research for the next generation of exosome studies and clinical trials.\n\n**Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: JAZZ) and Codiak BioSciences (NASDAQ: CDAK)**\n\nOn January 03, 2019, Jazz Pharmaceuticals and Codiak BioSciences signed a strategic collaboration agreement focused on the research, development and commercialization of exosome therapeutics to treat cancer. Codiak granted Jazz an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to develop, manufacture and commercialize therapeutic candidates directed at five targets to be developed using Codiak\u2019s engEx precision engineering platform for exosome therapeutics. The targets focus on oncogenes that have been well validated in hematological malignancies and solid tumors but have been undruggable with current modalities. Codiak received a $56 million upfront payment.\n\nIn sum, the companies explored above are all approaching the budding exosome industry from different angles.  Innocan\u2019s point-of-departure is CBD and its range of applications in the biomed/pharma sectors. Likewise, Codiak, Sarepta, and Jazz are all making powermoves to determine the efficacy of exosome therapies in diverse areas such as immune disorders and hematological malignancies.",
