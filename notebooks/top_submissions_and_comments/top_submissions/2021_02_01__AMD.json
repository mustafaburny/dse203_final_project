        "selftext": "In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of AMD, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term\n\n\\~Very Long Post\\~ \\[Do NOT Read if you don't like comprehensive analysis\\]\n\nHello everyone! Let\u2019s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles &amp; PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.\n\nThe company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.\n\nSo, guys, let\u2019s go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.\n\nThe [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing &amp; Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn\u2019t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can\u2019t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.\n\nBoth of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing &amp; graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn\u2019t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation &amp; amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation.\n\nThey have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest &amp; tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.\n\nThe company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 &amp; Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.\n\nTheir product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel\u2019s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world\u2019s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.\n\nThey have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also working with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings &amp; Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.\n\nAMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future\n\nThe one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with Xilinx , which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. Xilinx has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would create synergies. They are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it\u2019s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.\n\nAMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they expect an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.\n\nI used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA.\n\nFor the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.\n\nSo, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach.\n\nIf we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.\n\nFor my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.\n\nI think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high demand the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage &amp; digital currency mining.\n\nFor their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.\n\nThis means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest &amp; other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax.\n\nI [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.\n\nSo, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.\n\nI like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.\n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets\n\nI think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, these are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40.\n\nSo [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nI think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more &amp; more chips that also keep advancing in technology.\n\nThe company also has very good financials, with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once Intel also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it\u2019s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years &amp; a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all.\n\nAMD hasn\u2019t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it\u2019s a psychological resistance rather.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it\u2019s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.\n\nOne last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their shares held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.\n\nSo, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Lisa SU has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the company has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel\u2019s performance.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "I missed last year's incredible bull run in a lot of tech. I played the options market more and held cash. Now I'm looking for decent value holds. AMD's most recent earnings blowout has me pretty exciting that they're living up to the hype. As far as I can see their P/E was basically cut in half after their report last week. That, plus the fact that their stock has been dropping ever since makes me think this is an excellent dip to buy. \n\nAny thoughts or comments are appreciated.

        "selftext": "AMD was another stock targeted in Robinhood's restricted stock list late last week. This is absurd as AMD is a major player amongst the chip-makers recently seeming to have surpassed Intel in marketshare. It's chips are used in both the PS5 and Xbox Series S/X, showing that it is a major player on both sides of the gaming community.\n\nRobinhood has created artificial selling pressure on AMD, while AMD's short interest has increased to 5.9% Not a ton of short interest, but this number has only recently grown in correlation with the limitations put into place by Robinhood. Coincidence? I think not! Corruption? Maybe a little bit.\n\nThere are also clear indicators that AMD will continue to gain market share in the GPU/Chip industry. As recently they had to diverge some production to Samsung as Taiwan Semiconductors could not produce enough fast enough. (Source:  [https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-might-solve-gpu-stock-woes-by-outsourcing-some-production-to-samsung](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-might-solve-gpu-stock-woes-by-outsourcing-some-production-to-samsung))\n\nAlong with these basic facts reflecting on AMD's product portfolio, something essential to do; one can see they are boasting their strongest product portfolio line in years including their new 7 Ryzen 5000 chip that is for both mobile processors and desktops. Sales of the Ryzen chip grew 18% YoY, this had assisted in amazing earnings growth.\n\nAMD's Earnings Summary 2019 vs. 2020 showed Record revenue of 9.76 Billion up 45% from 2019. Their gross margin of 45% increased for the 5th straight year. Along with this Net Income and EPS doubled from the prior year. Finally operating cash flow was up to 1.07 billion a 117% increase YoY, and they had record free cash flow of $777 Million a 182% increase YoY. All together this makes for an extremely strong balance sheet with 2.29 Billion in cash, cash equivilants and short term investments.\n\nThe one major risk I see in AMD is that Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple all want to begin to create their own in-house chips. Along with this while AMD has surpassed Intel and is competing with Nividia, it could lose market share and fall behind. This company faced bankruptcy twice once in 2000 when the tech bubble popped, and again in 2012. However, I believe that this company will continue there exponential growth and have major gains in it's stock over the course of 2021 and see $100 by the end of February.\n\nHope this is all helpful!  \n\nDisclosure: I own 30 shares of AMD and will continue to hold for the years to come.",

        "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nA lot of you don't know me, as I don't usually post here. I'm usually over at /r/AMD_stock posting DD there. But I'm posting here because the recent activity in the stock led me to realize a huge, glaring problem with the stock's performance and it's latest earnings.\n\nLet me step back a bit first.\n\nLast Friday the stock plummeted 12% after posting the best earnings it possibly could have posted. At AMD_Stock, we usually brush off the post-earnings crush and continue our bull plays (or the smarter ones wait until after earnings to get back in). But this post-earnings crush was different. For this earnings, there was zero fundamental reason why the stock should go down. The earnings were excellent, the margins were excellent, the guidance for 1Q21 was incredible, and the guidance for FY21 was almost double what the street was expecting. Yet the stock still went down. It went down from $94 pre-earnings to almost $84....*on the best possible news*. \n\nWhat more could the street have wanted? Did shareholders want a +60% revenue increase YoY, instead of just +40%? Did they want 3x year-over-year revenue in 1Q20, instead of just 2x? Did the street expect us to beat our FY20 targets by more than they anticipated? Did investors want the fab capacity issues to be completely resolved earlier than 2Q21? Did they want Milan to be released earlier than March '21? Was there any reason to sell off after an earnings as incredible as that? You could even see the [bewilderment](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/27/full-interview-with-amd-ceo-lisa-su-on-q4-results-product-pipeline-demand-and-more.html) on Lisa Su's face as she started an interview with CNBC the morning after.\n\nWhy? [No financial news](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-q4-2020-advanced-micro-devices-earnings/), not even [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/amd-amd-earnings-q4-2020.html), could pin a 'reason' on the drop.\n\nAnd then I realized the problem. It's you.\n\nYou buy the cheapest AMD weeklies you can and hold them through earnings like it can't go tits up. You hope that AMD beats all expectations, and that the stock price skyrockets on your tendie-train choo-choo-ing to the moon. Post-earnings you sell your OTM calls just as they go ITM to some suck-ass broker-dealer, and go do some hookers and blow and make a golden shrine to Mama Su and thank her for your amazing luck. Good thing those stupid broker-dealers were so desperate to buy your calls just before expiry.. you would have bankrupted them if you held on to them any longer!\n\nThe day after earnings comes and you wake up and the price is down 5% and dropping. You sell immediately, because you can't see it recovering by Friday, when your calls expire. This causes MMs to sell the shares they bought as a hedge against selling you your calls. Stock goes down further. Other people sell their calls, and MMs sell more shares to reduce the hedge even more, on and on until Friday expiration rolls around and bag-holders let their calls expire worthless, along with their hopes and dreams.\n\nStop losing at AMD! How? *INVEST PROPERLY*\n\nHow? Buy and hold shares or LEAPS. Stop chasing the mythical overnight gains. AMD is a *long-term success* and it has [room to double](https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l6jijo/rosenblatt_securities_says_amd_could_double_in/). DO IT NOW - Price is recovering from the crush, but are still trading at a [20% discount to analyst consensus](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast), and at a 10% discount from it's recent highs.\n\nConclusion: This is a better buy-and-hold than GME, BB, or anything. AMD has grown continuously in the past 5 years and, if you read the DD on /r/AMD_stock, you'll discover that it also has an incredible growth roadmap the next 5 years.\n\nStop losing. Buy shares and double your money.\n\nPositions: 4800 AMD shares @ $27.96",

        "selftext": "Autist incoming. A lot of retards made their first trade with GME. Awesome and welcome!\n\nWith inexperience come a lot of psychological phallacies that Funds are exploiting:\n\n# BUY LOW SELL HIGH.\n\n*The. Core. Principal. Of. Trading.*\n\nYou never, ever sell when down. You don't. If you sell at loss you're literally **BUYING HIGH AND SELLING LOW!!!** If you don't 100% NEED this money RIGHT FUCKING NOW. Do. Not. Sell. It would be more entertaining literally burning money then selling at artificially low prices. NO ONE IS FORCING YOU TO SELL. If you're getting nervous about LOSSES ----&gt; DONT LOOK AT THE STOCK. DELETE YOUR APP. DO NOT GET STRESSED AND EMOTIONAL. You are not acting rationally when emotions get involved in trading. NEVER SELL EMOTIONALLY. Emotions are your enemy in trading and you WILL LOSE MONEY. If you're emotionally attached to your invested money, try avoiding any further trades until you're set up where you can (emergency fund, tax advantaged accounts etc. can help you feeling more secure).\n\nIt's negative today, it may be negative tomorrow. The DD still stands. GME as a company is in the spotlight of the world. It has a future.\n\nEven if there will be no short squeeze. DO NOT SELL AT LOSS. WAIT. 1 year, 3 years, 10 years. WHATEVER. It can get green again. IT CAN AND IT MAY. If you sell at loss, it wont.\n\nI KNOW THIS IS NO TYPICAL WSB (NON) ADVICE, BUT WITH SO MANY FUCKING RETARDS JUMPING IN WITH NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT THEIR DOING IT NEEDS TO BE SAID.\n\nSome more autistic shit\n\n# Percieved Value:\n\nRemember when you bought your shares. Let's say you bought at $300. You made the decision that this stock, its potential and emotional value, is worth $300 to you and you bought.\n\nNow the Price is artificially driven down. The beginning value hasn't changed. No one says that stock is worth less, unless you do. Unless you yourself decide that you're willing to sell at a lower price.\n\nWhen selling at $100 -&gt; YOU ARE SAYING IT'S WORTH THIS LITTLE. YOU DECIDE AT WHAT PRICE YOU'RE WILLING TO SELL. If you don't WANT to sell at $100 WAIT TILL YOU CAN SELL IT TO FUCKING MELVIN AT $6000.\n\nPlus: Loss Aversion\n\nA loss of 10% is emotionally more powerfull than a gain of 10%. They are preying on this effect to bring you to make an emotional decision to PANIC and sell at loss. WHICH ONLY MAKES SENSE IF YOUR GOAL IS TO LOSE MONEY.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHOLD TODAY\n\nHOLD TOMORROW\n\nHOLD FOREVER\n\nIF YOU NEED THE MONEY, WAIT FOR IT TO FUCKING TURN GREEN YOU IMBECILE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHIS IS JUST A DELUSIONAL AUTISTIC FUCK SPEAKING AND NO FINANCIAL ADVICE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nSince WSB became a fucked up game of finding an imposter -&gt; I was active on WSB a while ago on a different account (MICRON, early AMD) and since moved to subs like /r/financialindependence /r/FIRE etc. and switched to low-cost index funds and mainly stick to this kind of investments and kept an eye on WSB for enterntainment. This account has since been deleted by me because friends of mine (and coworkers) got ahold of that accounts username. I had some history that was too personal for them to know about.\n\nI only moved onto the GME bandwagon out of spite, the moment BUY's got blocked on RH. This is the only and last \"WSB\" move I'm gonna do. \n\nIt doesn't have any meaning as I could write whatever, but my username is my job in the banking sector. I know people that work in HF's, used to work decades in HF's. I didn't quite believe what they told me about the possibilities they have. But now I do.\n\nBuy low, sell high is the foundation of any trade you do. Even GME. \n\nIf you thought this move would be a quick buck over a few days, no. If you bought after the surge, it just doesn't make ANY sense selling. NONE. You cut your potential of any breakeven, ever.\n\nEven if the short squeeze wouldn't happen due to highly illegal tactics by HF, GameStop has way more potential now than before. The company is in international spotlight, has an easy way to raise capital after the trade still, has global logistics... It still has potential as a company, if you sell now, you lose out on any chance of ever covering that loss.",

AMD, yeah remember the company everyone seemingly forgot about despite posting huge growth consistently in 2020? Well they recently had earnings and suffered bigly along with most tech. Some highlights from their earnings:\n\n* Record revenue for the year with $9.76 billion in revenue\n* Q4 Revenue up 53% to $3.244 billion (also record quaterly revenue)\n* Gross profit up 53% to $1.451 billion\n* Net income up to $1.78 billion compared to $170 million a year ago\n* EPS up 867% (yes that is right) to $1.45 per share\n* Cash flow up to $554 million YoY\n* Q1 2021 guidance: 3.2B in revenue (79% YoY) and 46% gross margin\n* FY'2021 guidance: 37% increase in revenue YoY\n* Lets not forget their recent acquisition of Xilinx that will put them in a great position for the future\n\nSu bae has been delivering hard on her promises, and I see no reason for this momentum to not carry forward into 2021. They have gone on sale after earnings, and I can't wait to see what AMD has in store for 2021.",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "On Friday Robinhood went after WSB\u2019s first love Suebae. \nUsers were limited to buy only ONE share of AMD after they announced a record quarter. Why??? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet\u2019s see - AMD is heavily invested in by big funds. AMD announces a record quarter, the stock begins to sell off!? Many people on r/amd_stock theorise this is institutional money trying to liquidate cash and take profits after getting hit by GME. \n\nBut wait, AMD short interest just rose from [52m to 107m.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l7uw06/short_interest_on_amd_has_doubled_from_52_million/ ) Up over 50% in 2 and a half weeks after the company grows 50% and produces record results..\n\n\n\nThen Robinhood adds AMD to the list of stocks you can only buy a limited amount of and limit it to ONE share. Wtf? \n\n\nAMD isn\u2019t part of any of the massive shorting going on in the market and is a pretty stable company. So why would they do this? Oh right, because AMD is one of the most held stocks on RH and many young investors like the company on a consumer level. So while it\u2019s at a discount they want to stop you buying in so their buddies with the short positions can load up and get their money back after getting wrecked by GME, AMC and other heavily shorted stocks. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening:**\n\nFunds with large positions in AMD are shorting the stock before selling off stock they previously held. This drops the price and they collect a nice bonus on the way out. \nThe short interest in the stock has increase drastically by over 50%, and of course between earnings and RH limiting trading we saw a number of hit piece articles with false information about AMD. But weirdly enough no one report on the leaks that [AMD are now powering Tesla\u2019s in car game console/entertainment system.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l749ia/patrick_schur_picture_confirms_tesla_uses_navi_23/) Last time there was even a rumour of AMD supplying Tesla the stock went vertical. \n \n\nI\u2019m sure the OGs here remember the blatant manipulation that happened with this stock back in the days when it was $2-$20. People like Goldman would downgrade the stock, load up on stock and wait for it to rally, sell, and then downgrade again.\nThese guys are back using AMD as their personal money printer because they just got wrecked.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Oh, and you know who happens to own 2.1m shares in AMD? That\u2019s right, [MELVIN CAPITAL.](https://fintel.io/so/us/amd)**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut here\u2019s one thing RH didn\u2019t think about. \nXilinx is about to be acquired by AMD in an all stock deal, this means both stocks move in unison with each other. And more importantly, the daily average trade volume of Xilinx is only 3m compared to AMDs 45.15m\n\nThis means if a number of people decide they like Xilinx stock, AMD will follow far faster than if they decided to simply like AMD stock. And since there\u2019s no limits on Xilinx people can currently like the stock as much as they want.\n\nSide note - If you *really* like Xilinx and hold until the deal is complete, you will be given 1.734 shares in AMD for every Xilinx share you own. If this deal happened right now at current prices, this means you would make around 10% on your investment compared to just holding the same amount in AMD.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Please note:** I am not a financial advisor, just some long term WSB member here to explain that if everyone jumped into Xilinx instead of AMD the shorts would get pretty screwed. They think they found a way to make their money back, it would be pretty nice if they didn\u2019t. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**HOLD GME**\n\n**LIKE XILINX (if you want I\u2019m not a financial advisor)**\n\n**DESTROY THE SHORTS**\n\n**FUCK ROBINHOOD**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlso, shoutout to [Hothardware for being the only news website talking about this](https://hothardware.com/news/amd-robinhood-gamestop-gme-shorts-wallstreetbets\n). \nSomething is very wrong here and we need everyone to know it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTL;DR; - GO READ IT, STOP BEING LAZY.

        "selftext": "So I saw headlines about semiconductor demand far outpacing supply. There\u2019s also news of Intel finally giving up and no longer taking losses trying to make chips. \nCars have created an especially huge demand for semis and virtually every car now needs one. \n\nhttps://www.extremetech.com/extreme/319627-semiconductor-shortage-could-cost-automakers-61b-in-lost-sales\n\nhttps://www.google.ca/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN29T04V\n\nI came across TSM Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturers which had just over 50% market share. Their biggest customer is Apple. \n\nhttps://csimarket.com/stocks/competitionSEG2.php?code=TSM\n\nNow, I couldn\u2019t believe the numbers I saw for TSM. I figured every site was wrong because the following cannot possibly be true: \nMarket Cap- 571 billion\n2020 revenue - 1.4 Trillion (yes trillion). the revenue is up 30% from 2019 (yes during a pandemic). \nEarnings- 530billion.  \n\nThis means that they are trading at 1:1 P/E ratio. \n\nCompare that to AMD (106bil market cap - 2.5billion earnings - 38 P/E and NVDA 321marketcap - 2.8bil earnings - 140 P/E.\nIntel has market cap of $230bil - $20bil earnings - 11 p/E\n\nSo shouldn\u2019t TSM have a market cap of at least 5 trillion?? How is no one talking about the fact that their revenue during a pandemic is 1.4 trillion with profit margin of 40%??? \n\nI think there are some seriously sweet tendies to be made. The IV is pretty low and you can get 2022 calls with a 200 strike for $5. Or a 2023 call with 200strike for $12. \n\nSomeone please explain how this is possible and what I am missing. This is a no brainer. \n\nAlso, for the first time ever, TSM will be building a plant in the USA \n\nhttps://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2020/11/25/intels-ceo-just-asked-joe-biden-to-do-this/\n\nLastly, Biden has a phone call with TSM this Friday.\n\n\nEDIT: thank you for pointing out that my numbers were in TWN not USD.

Also before we get into this, for all the Logitech nerds on my last post, nobody cares that your mom bought you a $10 Logitech keyboard and you like the noises it makes, it doesn't change the fact that Corsair have better quality products for pretty much everything besides mice(my opinion).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk so first things first, we all know that the gaming industry as a whole had boomed due to COVID and has had an increasing TAM for quite some time now and is projected to continue its growth. For that reason alone I'm bullish on a lot of gaming companies other than a few that I believe have way too high of a valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLets start with marketing. If any of you have as poor of a social life as I since COVID started then you'd know that Corsair has been very active in social media marketing/sponsorships on Twitch. It feels like I keep seeing more and more streamers show sponsor slides of Corsair gear. This is amazing because in my personal opinion, I believe Twitch and YouTube sponsorships is easily one of the best ways to promote your products(referring to gaming products only). Just look at recent games that have all blown up, Fortnite, Apex Legends, Warzone, and Rust have all blown up due to their large presence on Twitch. Apex Legends and Rust quite literally paid streamers to play the game and look at how well that worked out for them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext up we'll take a look at financials, don't worry I'm not going to sit here and tell you to do your full in depth fundamental analysis reasoning report but I do think we should at least pay attention to it. Even before COVID and still during COVID Corsair has increased revenues, net income, and cash flow. This just adds extra proof that its not like Corsair was a failing company before they got the boost from COVID. Another major positive would be that Corsair has increased focus around R&amp;D which has only proven to significantly help tech companies move ahead of their competitors and acquire more market share. Just a couple companies that also focused R&amp;D would be Tesla(all praise father Elon) and AMD. There's obviously more to the financial aspect however I'd rather not sit here and type out their entire 10-K in a reddit post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, I think with all DD you must point out the negatives as you go along. As I stated before, Logitech definitely beats Corsair when it comes to mice. However, I typed this entire post without using a mouse so who really cares about mice. Secondly, Corsair's CEO is Andy Paul. How can you put a billion dollar company in the hands of a man with two first names and to be honest, I don't know how they do it. Although that is definitely a big negative, their logo is extremely cool which I think makes up for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time, now lets preheat this oven and start baking some tendies!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: Logitech fanboys please don't attack me in the comments, I don't care about your mice, just leave me alone and go play pong or something with your amazing mouse.",

NOKIA  (I think in \\~5 years 5G tech can help them pivot a little bit,  besides... 20B cap market and \\~5$ shares seems extremely undervalued) .\n2. AMD  - I think it will go up and their tech is solid, although... Apple and  new M1 chips (Apple Silicon) makes me doubt, about if Apple will use AMD  in the future and if not - that might be a nice dip possibility to buy  in.\n3. Rolls-Royce,  which is like 0.9$ a share now. It's really low and I figured... They  are making Jet Engines right? Wouldn't they prosper a little better in  next 3-5 years? But more research is needed in this one for me. I'm  Software Engineer so... Nokia and AMD is something, that I understand  and see potential. As for this - I'm not really sure. More of a guess.\n\nOverall,  I still don't know what is my view point on stock market in 2021.

        "selftext": "I have been a long-term investor of AMD over the past few years and I have been rewarded immensely for it. But a trend I have been noticing for the past half-year is that despite meeting and beating expectations and guidance, high-growth stocks in the semiconductor sector seems to have hit a wall in SP. In particular, I am not just referring to AMD but NVDA as well. On the contrary, stocks with higher earnings but lower growth seem to be regaining momentum, most notably Intel, MU, TSM and others.\n\nThis has led me to exit my AMD position and take a serious look at the stock market as a whole. Over the past half-year, there has been an unjustified exuberance in EV stocks. I don't think it takes much convincing to see that the SP of multiple EV stocks (most notoriously TSLA) seem to be out-of-whack with reality and future expectations.\n\nThis has led me to think that more rational investors are either exiting the market or moving into stocks with lower growth/risk. If the EV bubble is being propped up by inexperienced investors that are not trading in-line with fundamentals, then a market correction could easily accelerate into a crash for these stocks. And investors moving into low-risk stocks prior to a crash has precedence as well (dot-com bubble). \n\nOne more bit that has me thinking: The GME and related meme stocks seem to be crashing and the shorts and more rational investors seem to be regaining the upper hand. This could serve as a momentum for others to re-look their investments in very risky and overvalued assets. Could this be the trigger for the EV bubble popping?",

If he really believes in GME, he's waiting for the new bottom to get more shares. With all the hype dying down, when will he buy? 50? 40? At 40, he could reinvest 8 million and double his position (assuming he eventually exercises his options). \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50",

        "selftext": "Mandatory pledge of allegiance to GME: I was in GME before it was cool. Did both [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4cpbf/calculating_what_the_gme_price_should_be_for/) and [memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ktb2ms/gme_ryan_cohen_short_squeeze/).\n\nNow back to the issue at hand:\n\nA while back while reading the comments on an $NNDM DD in here, I came across a guy who said $NVMI is even better than NNDM but he's not going to write a DD on it or promote it any other way on WSB. Since I like forbidden fruits, I went ahead and did my own research on the company. I'm sharing the results with you:\n\nNova Measuring Instruments is an Israel-based company (with 18 offices worldwide) that provides metrology solutions (devices and software) for advanced process control used in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nMetrology means measuring, and in this context, super precise measuring (nanometer or smaller) required for semiconductor manufacturing. The company's metrology solutions use technologies including Optical Scatterometry, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), x-ray fluorescence (XRF), scatterometry modeling software, and high-performance computing. The company holds 30 patents in this field.\n\nMarket cap: \\~2.2 Billion\n\nP/E ratio: \\~42\n\nHas beaten earning expectations in the past 4 quarters (didn't check further back)\n\nThe stock price has grown almost 100% in the last year, which is good but nothing compared to NNDM, for instance, which has grown 540%.\n\nDaily volume is low (about 150,000)\n\nIn a recent (Jan 28, 2021) [press release](https://www.novami.com/investors/press-releases/nova-receives-multiple-materials-metrology-orders-from-leading-logic-and-foundry-customers/), the company announced that it \"received multiple orders from multiple leading Logic and Foundry customers for its most advanced materials metrology solutions.\"  They don't name the new clients, but could one of them be $TSM?\n\nAnyway, we know that all sorts of trendy technologies such as EVs, AI, Cloud, etc. need processors and memory devices, which brings our attention to companies such as $AMD, $INTC, $ON, and $TSM. But these companies in turn need precise measuring devices for their process control, and NVMI is the leader in that area.\n\nThe company's technology/patents can also be useful in 3D printers that print precise things (again, such as NNDM).\n\nI did a quick search and it seems no one has done a DD on this in WSB. I think it has great growth potential both short term and long term. Once WB is over the BANG stocks, this is something worth a look at. IMO, it will be similar to stocks like MGNI and SE that consistently move up without much buzz around them on WSB.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTechnicals:\n\nI don't know much about technicals but according to tradingview, it's neutral based on oscillators, and strong buy based on moving averages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy positions:Stocks80C 5/21/2021\n\nThe options market for this stock is low volume and there are large gaps between bid/ask prices, so I suggest going with the stocks.",

        "selftext": "This is not a post about whether GME is going to 0 or Pluto. This post is strictly about what one should or shouldn\u2019t do if one wants to buy/sell GME. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Figure out how much you are willing to trade. Treat the money you are willing to trade as lost money. This way you know your max loss and if you are willing to accept that loss, then you can diamond hand any red day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Don\u2019t trade on margin. One of my best friends bought AMD at $2 and still lost it all because he went on margin and was forced to liquidate. Brokerages can and will manually liquidate your positions to cover their asses. Bottom line, don\u2019t do it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Have an exit strategy. Let\u2019s be honest here, the distance to the moon, Pluto, and Andromeda are finite, same goes for GME. You don\u2019t have to admit it to anyone on WSB, but you should always have a number that when reached, you are willing to exit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. Don\u2019t get greedy. The saying that pigs get fat hogs get slaughtered is very true. Ask any \ud83d\udc3b who held on past 4/1/2020 to show you their account and you will see. Again, you don\u2019t have to admit it here, but know it in your heart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. Be fluid. Market condition changes, that goes both ways. Assuming you are following the above rules, there may be days where you will buy the dip. To the contrary, there may be days when you profit take. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6. Don\u2019t be a sheep. Let\u2019s be honest with ourselves for a moment. Not all hedge funds are betting against GME. There are hedge funds betting on GME. Moreover, there are people who are trying to profit from directional movement in either direction and are spreading lies on WSB to enrich themselves. Don\u2019t be a sheep and blindly follow others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7. Be on the look out for the next 10 bagger. I assume that almost no one here wants GME to be their last trade. I\u2019m not saying you should sell your positions, what I\u2019m saying is always be on the lookout for the next big thing while you hold on to your position. It would be the same thing as you getting into GME when it was $5.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8. Don\u2019t let GME break you. Trading takes a toll no matter if you are up or down. Don\u2019t let one trade crush you. Remember, you are trading to get rich so you can better yourself, not trading to become a slave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*I have never purchased or sold short,  nor do I intend to purchase or sell short any GME equities or derivatives. Having said that, I wish my WSB brothers best of luck.",

The number would have definitely been much higher if it wasn't for these key factors:\n\n* Position sizing / trade allocation, where trades were sized properly to contain risk.\n* Trade timing / entry, where trades are entered at specific times of day for best premiums and chance of getting filled. \n* Trade diversification, where not all trades are in the same basket of stocks and carry different direction or +/- deltas.  \n\nYes, there's something about pennies and steamrollers to be said about these trades, where the % return is consistent for a few trades and suddenly a -100% return shows up to take all of the hard earned premium back. \n\nIn fact, that's exactly what happened on one of the 0 DTE SPX trades. That's where allocation, timing, and diversification helps, where we can fully expect to experience a complete loss on a small number of trades, but still come out ahead profitable overall.  \n\nFor those interested, feel free to reach out for more information or to see the full list of trades we executed in January 2021. \n\nWe\u2019re also keen on getting this community\u2019s feedback and thoughts on our trades executed; happy to share our reasoning on executing them. Let us know!\n\nOtherwise, stay safe and vigilant out there! We\u2019ll be back with another post to share our progress and findings next month!",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59), while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

Ever since, the SP has inflated and inflated, to the point that it is now up 90% in three weeks. It is likely that this will continue to inflate as excitement grows.\n\nThe suggestion that the company is to list on NASDAQ is an indication that they are more confident in their technology and it is getting closer to commercialisation, they just need a bit more capital to make it happen.\n\nEnd game?\n\nIf, and its a big if, this company is to have the platform which goes someway to replacing silicon in the future then we all know the value.\n\nPotential risks?\n\nRealistically, there is a chance another company is one step ahead of the curve and their technology will never make it in the future.\n\nSome close links to Chinese companies - future restrictions could hamper some of their JVs.",

        "selftext": "On Friday Robinhood went after WSB\u2019s first love Suebae. \nUsers were limited to buy only ONE share of AMD after they announced a record quarter. Why??? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet\u2019s see - AMD is heavily invested in by big funds. AMD announces a record quarter, the stock begins to sell off!? Many people on r/amd_stock theorise this is institutional money trying to liquidate cash and take profits after getting hit by GME. \n\nBut wait, AMD short interest just rose from [52m to 107m.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l7uw06/short_interest_on_amd_has_doubled_from_52_million/ ) Up over 50% in 2 and a half weeks after the company grows 50% and produces record results..\n\n\n\nThen Robinhood adds AMD to the list of stocks you can only buy a limited amount of and limit it to ONE share. Wtf? \n\n\nAMD isn\u2019t part of any of the massive shorting going on in the market and is a pretty stable company. So why would they do this? Oh right, because AMD is one of the most held stocks on RH and many young investors like the company on a consumer level. So while it\u2019s at a discount they want to stop you buying in so their buddies with the short positions can load up and get their money back after getting wrecked by GME, AMC and other heavily shorted stocks. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening:**\n\nFunds with large positions in AMD are shorting the stock before selling off stock they previously held. This drops the price and they collect a nice bonus on the way out. \nThe short interest in the stock has increase drastically by over 50%, and of course between earnings and RH limiting trading we saw a number of hit piece articles with false information about AMD. But weirdly enough no one report on the leaks that [AMD are now powering Tesla\u2019s in car game console/entertainment system.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l749ia/patrick_schur_picture_confirms_tesla_uses_navi_23/) Last time there was even a rumour of AMD supplying Tesla the stock went vertical. \n \n\nI\u2019m sure the OGs here remember the blatant manipulation that happened with this stock back in the days when it was $2-$20. People like Goldman would downgrade the stock, load up on stock and wait for it to rally, sell, and then downgrade again.\nThese guys are back using AMD as their personal money printer because they just got wrecked.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Oh, and you know who happens to own 2.1m shares in AMD? That\u2019s right, [MELVIN CAPITAL.](https://fintel.io/so/us/amd)**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut here\u2019s one thing RH didn\u2019t think about. \nXilinx is about to be acquired by AMD in an all stock deal, this means both stocks move in unison with each other. And more importantly, the daily average trade volume of Xilinx is only 3m compared to AMDs 45.15m\n\nThis means if a number of people decide they like Xilinx stock, AMD will follow far faster than if they decided to simply like AMD stock. And since there\u2019s no limits on Xilinx people can currently like the stock as much as they want.\n\nSide note - If you *really* like Xilinx and hold until the deal is complete, you will be given 1.734 shares in AMD for every Xilinx share you own. If this deal happened right now at current prices, this means you would make around 10% on your investment compared to just holding the same amount in AMD.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Please note:** I am not a financial advisor, just some long term WSB member here to explain that if everyone jumped into Xilinx instead of AMD the shorts would get pretty screwed. They think they found a way to make their money back, it would be pretty nice if they didn\u2019t. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**HOLD GME**\n\n**LIKE XILINX (if you want I\u2019m not a financial advisor)**\n\n**DESTROY THE SHORTS**\n\n**FUCK ROBINHOOD**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlso, shoutout to [Hothardware for being the only news website talking about this](https://hothardware.com/news/amd-robinhood-gamestop-gme-shorts-wallstreetbets\n). \nSomething is very wrong here and we need everyone to know it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTL;DR; - GO READ IT, STOP BEING LAZY.

We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59), while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "Hello (I am fairly new to investing btw),\nI want to ask what the Xilinx takeover by AMD will look like for me as a Xilinx shareholder. \nAs most people probably know AMD and Xilinx have an all stock transaction deal where current Xilinx shareholders will receive 1.7** shares of AMD in return for their Xilinx shares. \nNow I can\u2019t seem to find any news on this except for the fact that the deal is supposed to be closed in 2021. I am just wondering what it will look like for me; will my Xilinx shares automatically be switched by AMD shares or do I have to do something for it? And when do you expect it to be finalized?\nThanks in advance for the answers",

        "selftext": "This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or \"counterfeit\" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.\n\nMuch of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.\n\nOne thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**Methodology**\n\nI'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that\n\n1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.\n2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.\n3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date\n\nHowever, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.\n\n**The Code**\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    import time\n    import requests\n    POLYGON_API_KEY = '&lt;ADD YOUR API KEY HERE&gt;'\n    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&amp;apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY\n    \n    data\n    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))\n    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n    for line in f:\n        parts = line.split('|');\n        date = parts[0]\n        ticker = parts[2]\n        try:\n            fails = int(parts[3])\n            price = float(parts[5])\n            value_of_fails = price * fails\n            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)\n        except ValueError:\n            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')\n            pass\n    \n    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():\n        day = int(date[-2:])\n        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))\n        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])\n        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] &gt; 10000000, sorted_stocks)\n        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:\n            val_of_fails = data[0]\n            num_fails = data[1]\n            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))\n            res = req.json()\n            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':\n                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))\n                continue\n            else:\n                try:\n                    volume = res['volume']\n                except KeyError:\n                    print(res)\n            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)\n            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100\n            print('{: &lt;6} ${: &lt;5} {: &lt;9} / {: &lt; 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))\n\nHere's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.\n\nIf everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value &gt; 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.\n\n**The Results**\n\n    Data for Jan 4\n    RMO    $10M   455173

Have Fun.\n\nEDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script. Fixed, and added a bit more data\n\nEDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes",
