        "selftext": "Figured I should share some after doing super deep analysis on a lot of these companies. I've written DD on some of these and will continue to write on them in depth.  My view on stocks is that you should pick and play on stocks that \n\nA) Care about reputation\n\nB) Deliver\n\nC) Contain economic consequences and economic challenges\n\nI'm extremely engaged by developing and improving my portfolio and I strongly believe that investors should go big and stay mentally tough through the good times and bad. In other words, the advice that I value most is by Charlie Munger:  \n\n\n&gt;\u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to react with equanimity to a market price decline of 50% two or three times a century you\u2019re not fit to be a common shareholder and you deserve the mediocre result you\u2019re going to get compared to the people who do have the temperament, who can be more philosophical about these market fluctuations.\u201d\n\n I actually hate posting in r/stocks and r/investing because posts l feel that the culture in that forum is the opposite of this advice and seems to value cowardice more than conviction. I find it incredibly annoying and sheepish. \n\nThese are my picks, that I've researched obsessively and believe will result in substantial wealth building over time.\n\n# SUPER HIGH CONVICTION\n\nThese are companies that I believe have unmatched economic consequences and their existence fundamentally challenges their competitors to improve.\n\n1.PINTEREST (Search) **- The Idea Search Engine**\n\n2.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 28, 2021**\n\nStocks gained on Friday, with market participants encouraged by new economic data on consumer spending, income and inflation, and a strong Weekly unemployment report. The market has made a remarkable recovery, particularly in technology, after the market tumbled 4% following the April Consumer Price Index roughly two weeks ago. In my view, as I have said for weeks, the recovery in the market confirms that the initial sell-off driven by inflationary fears forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected was overblown.\n\nNew government data on Friday showed personal income fell less than expected in April, but still pulled back after March's stimulus-fueled surge. Personal income fell by 13.1% in April compared to March, less than the 14.2% drop expected. This follows a 20.9% increase during March which had been buoyed by the distribution of $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans. \n\nIn another report, the Department of Commerce reported core personal consumption expenditures increased 3.1% in April from a year earlier, blowing past the Fed\u2019s traditional 2% target. Federal Reserve members consider the core PCE to be the gauge of inflation. The strong inflation readings reported by the Commerce Department on Friday had been widely anticipated as the pandemic's grip eases, thanks to vaccinations, and will have no impact on monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that higher inflation will be transitory. Supply-chain constraints combined, labor shortages in certain industries, and rising demand as the US economy recovers from the coronavirus-induced recession have all contributed to higher inflationary readings. These are all factors that are widely considered transitory, meaning not permanent. In an April 28 statement, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said, \u201cAn episode of one-time price increases as the economy reopens is not likely to lead to persistent year-over-year inflation into the future. Clogged supply-chains won\u2019t affect Federal Reserve policy because they\u2019re temporary and expected to resolve themselves.\u201d Moreover, he said \u201cFor inflation to move up in a persistent way that moves expectations up, that would take some time, and you would think it would be likely we would be in very strong employment for that to happen.\u201d In other words, Powell is saying he expects issues driving inflation higher to resolve themselves moving forward and doesn\u2019t expect inflationary pressures to materialize until the labor market further improves.\n\nIn remarks this week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be \u201cmostly temporary\u201d and that the Fed was \u201cnot quite there yet\u201d when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be \u201coverly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.\u201d \n\nRichard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Fed, offered a slightly different view but one that is in-line with what the Federal Reserve has already said publicly in the past. Clarida said, \u201cthere will come a time in upcoming meetings\u201d when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that \u201cit is going to depend on the flow of data\u201d. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.\n\nThis reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn\u2019t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, \u201cWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Labor\u2019s Weekly Unemployment Report showed jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week to yet another pandemic-era low, an encouraging sign that the labor market is improving following the extremely disappointing April Jobs report, which showed 266,000 new jobs added in the month, far below estimated of more than 1 million and a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March. \n\n* **Initial jobless claims, week ended May 22:** 406,000 vs. 425,000 expected and 444,000 the week prior\n* **Continuing claims, week ended May 15:** 3.642 million vs. 3.680 million expected and a revised 3.738 the week prior\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* \u201cMeme-stocks\u201d, particularly AMC, were absolutely on fire this week, as the battle between wallstreetbets and hedge funds continues. \n* President Joe Biden unveiled a budget that would hike federal spending to $6 trillion for the coming fiscal year.\n* Boeing (BA) agreed to pay at least $17 million to settle enforcement cases with the Federal Aviation Administration over production issues with its 737 jets. Stock reacted positively to the news. \n* Durable goods orders, or orders for manufactured goods intended to last at least three years, unexpectedly declined in April, ending an 11-month streak of increases, the Commerce Department said Thursday, an encouraging sign. \n* Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are all involved in a bidding process to provide cloud services to Boeing, according to multiple reports. \n* Disney\u2019s (DIS) California-based parks will welcome non-California natives starting June 15.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current price target was written pre-market and does not reflect intraday changes\\*\\***\n* AutoDesk (ADSK) target raised by Barclays from $335 to $340 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "Drone Delivery Canada \u2013 FLT.V (DD)\n\n**tldr;** Drone Delivery Canada isn\u2019t here to replace postal workers in the next 10 years but has many use cases and a lot of revenue potential. It is currently an unprofitable growth stock that seems very promising. At $1.33 (CAD) this is a buy and I have a price target of $6.87 5 years out based on a 10 price to sales ratio.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*All numbers are in Canadian Dollars unless mentioned otherwise*\n\n**Basic Stats: - (as of May 4, 2021)**\n\nPrice: $1.33\n\nMarket Cap: 279.38M\n\nEPS: -0.08\n\nFloat: 209.61M\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Description**\n\nDrone Delivery Canada (DDC) provides a drone delivery platform targeted towards various corporations including retailers, service organizations and government agencies and are capable of transporting up to 180kg over 200kms. They have a patented hardware/software platform. DDC has been developing its drone delivery technology since 2014. They are currently trading on the TSX.V Exchange under the symbol FLT, on the U.S. OTC Q B market with Nasdaq International Designation under the symbol TAKOF. As a venture company that is not profitable it is a risky investment but there are many upsides to investing in this innovative technology.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Financials**\n\nThe company has reported assets worth $29M and $2.27M worth of liabilities so there is currently little worry of insolvency. With $23.4M in cash and yearly operating expenses of $14.5M, assuming no change, the company can operate with no financing for 1.6 years. This isn\u2019t much of a worry due to increasing revenue and ease of financing.\n\n2020 revenue was $265k and their total operating expenditure was $14.5M totaling a loss of $0.08 per share in 2020. Operating expense dropped in 2020, some key differences is an increase in advertising and marketing spend, a reduction in consulting expenditure, and an increase in personnel expenses. Research and development expenditure was almost the same which is good to see as they are still investing heavily in their technology.\n\nAnalyst estimate 2021 revenue of $6.59M which is over 2000% increase. While it is also expected for operating expenses to increase it\u2019s good to see extreme revenue growth to match their high valuation of 271M. The current price/sales ratio is 1,021, assuming the same stock price and sales of $6.59M the price/sales ratio decreases to 41 which is much more reasonable, though realistically share price will increase this year. But even at twice the share price the price/sales ratio is 82 (which is still very high but much more reasonable than current, goes to show markets value future earnings). 2021 estimated EPS is -0.05 and profitability is expected in 2022.\n\nThe last thing to point out in DDC\u2019s financial statements in they continue to invest heavily in patents. $140k in spent on patenting and trademarks in 2020 and $221k in 2019. With patents worth $750k as of December 31, 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ownership and Leadership**\n\n0.2% of shares are held by private companies, 0.48% by individual insiders, 7.08% by institutions and the rest by the general public. The low insider holding is often seen as a bearish factor, but the low institutional holding can hold potential upside as once the stock is up listed, we can see large purchases as companies start adding shares to funds.\n\nLeadership:\n\nThe CEO Michael Zahra has been the President of Staples Business Advantage (B2B supplies), the president of Yahoo, and has been on the board of directors for Oak Ridges Moraine Land Trust and on the board of governors for North York General Hospital. So, while this is a start-up, they have a veteran leader. They have a strong lineup of C-Suite executives with experienced CFO and CTO. On top of this their board of advisors include the VP of Cargo at Air Canada, and a medical director for Sunnybrook Centre for Prehospital Medicine which is an important strategic piece. The downside of their leadership is they have very high salaries for a company not making any profit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Current Factors**\n\nThese are 3 current small factors that are worth mentioning\n\nPartnership with DSV:\n\nDDC entered in an agreement with DSV through its sales agent Air Canada that provides its drone delivery platform back in October 2019. The program became operational in March which was big for DDC as it is their first source of revenue. In which customers pay DDC a monthly fee for each drone route deployed. DSV provides and manages supply chain solutions for thousands of corporations. Which is a perfect partner for DDC. The initial agreement is for 15 months, with additional 1-year terms following the success of the first agreement.\n\nPartnership with Edmonton Airport:\n\nThis partnership creates the world\u2019s first airport drone delivery hub at Edmonton Airport using DDC\u2019s platform. DDC and Edmonton airport will implement promote and market DDC\u2019s delivery services. The agreement is for 5 years initially with the possibility of an extension unless the agreement is terminated\n\nPatents:\n\nDDC currently holds two US patents, one for its \u201cFLYTE management\u201d and one that covers aspects of its drone delivery technology and processes relating to controlled access zones for UAV landing and takeoff\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Future Use Cases and Catalysts**\n\nMedical Response:\n\nIn 2019 researchers tested the speed of drones vs the speed of ambulances to respond to a 911 call. The drone carried an AED to the location which was approx. 8km away. The drone was allowed to fly at speeds of 80km/hr and arrived at the scene an average of three to four minutes before the ambulance. Those few minutes could make a life or death difference in a cardiac arrest patient\u2019s outcome. This is why having the medical director for Sunnybrook Centre for Prehospital Medicine on the board of advisors could be a key to implementing their services to the medical field in the future.\n\nUS Expansion:\n\nDDC has expressed their intention to expand to the United States in the past, which is in line with them filing US patents. Expanding into the US will open tons of new opportunities for them but will also be a large challenge.\n\nPotential to move to TSX:\n\nMoving up from the venture exchange to the TSX can pose many benefits. A big one that we care about is increase in share price. \u201cAn observation of 34 companies that graduated between October 14, 2005 and August 10, 2006, found that almost sixty per cent of the companies had an average share price over the thirty trading days post-graduation that was higher than the thirty trading days preceding graduation. On average, the share price of all 34 issuers went up over three per cent in that time frame, with four companies showing an increase of over 25 per cent\u201d.\n\nSource: [https://www.mondaq.com/canada/charges-mortgages-indemnities/44708/movin-on-up-the-costs-and-benefits-of-graduating-to-the-tsx](https://www.mondaq.com/canada/charges-mortgages-indemnities/44708/movin-on-up-the-costs-and-benefits-of-graduating-to-the-tsx)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Market Size**\n\nIn Ark Invest\u2019s *BIG IDEAS 2021* report they talked about the delivery drone market. They predict that drone delivery platforms will generate nearly USD50 billion in revenues, USD14 billion in hardware sales, and USD3 billion in mapping revenues by 2025. And by 2030 drone delivery platforms will generate nearly USD275 billion in revenues, USD50 billion in hardware sales, and USD12 billion in mapping revenues.\n\nFor a total market cap of $67B USD by 2025 and $337B USD by 2030.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Air Canada Cargo Partnership**\n\nIn Canada, 150K routes have been identified with their partner Air Canada Cargo. DDC\u2019s revenue per route is $10,000/month. They are not even close to operating 150K routes so let\u2019s start with 100 routes and build up.\n\n|**Routes**|**Revenue/month**|**Yearly Revenue**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|100|$1M|$12M|\n|1,000|$12M|$144M|\n|10,000|$120M|$1.44B|\n|25,000|$250M|$3B|\n|150,000|$1.5B|$18B|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation**\n\nNow let\u2019s take that estimated yearly revenue and calculate share price based off price/sales ratio (assuming a 10x p/s which is a lot lower than current p/s).\n\n|**Yearly Revenue**|**Market Cap**|**Share Price**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|$12M| 120M|$0.57|\n|$144M|1.44B|$6.87|\n|$1.44B|$7.2B\\*|$34.35|\n|$3B|$15B\\*|$71.56|\n|$18B|36B\\*\\*|$171.74|\n\n^(\\*reduced P/S ratio to 5)\n\n^(\\*\\*reduced P/S ratio to 2)\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the bottom 3 numbers are highly unrealistic in the next 5-10 years and require perfect execution and market factors to reach that point even past 10 years. A more realistic target would be a share price of $6.87 5 years out (furthest out analyst prediction is $116.8M of revenue 4 years from now). This is assuming a 10x p/s which aligns for an emerging technology company. A 5 year prediction of 120M in revenue is also falls in line with the previously mentioned $67B drone delivery market size by 2025 predicted by Ark Invest.\n\nA $6.87 price estimate 5 years out at present value, assuming an 8% return found in index funds, equals $4.61.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bear Case(s)**\n\nCurrently DDC is fitted for serving remote areas as there is a lot of regulation surrounding flying drones in urban areas. It\u2019s also unrealistic to have dozens of drones flying around a city anywhere in the near future We need to see a shift in regulation for this to really take off. Big players such as Amazon and FedEx have been investing in delivery drone technology for years and most likely have very developed technology and infrastructure too. This does leave potential for a buyout if a company is trying to catch up to its competitors who have been investing in drone delivery. While financing will be relatively simple for this company this poses the risk of share dilution as they continue to spend money on research, patents, and other the expenses the company will need to sell more shares for cash flow.Lastly, their technology currently only allows delivery on predetermined routes that are from point A to point B and require a launch and landing pad so more technological development needs to happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis technology isn\u2019t here to replace postal workers in the next 10 years but has a lot of different use cases now and will have more in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you've read this far let me know what you think of the stock and would love some feedback on my DD (also let me know if the formatting needs changing).

        "selftext": "The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. **That is what happened here.**\n\nThe following research is quite advanced, look for the words **TL;DR** if your smoothness is over 9000.\n\n**TL;DR** Via machine learning analysis and scientific discovery, the formerly-hidden, hyper-subtle messages held within the GameStop online store have been decoded. **Short interest is at a minimum 700%**. The new **floor is $302,400,000**. Kenny is involved in the **UFO stories** we have been seeing on MSM.\n\nYOU ARE (start reading) HERE\n\nGameStop has had this information public for months, right under our noses. It only takes one ape to crack the code, and I have done it. It all started when I was staring at [GameStop.com](https://gamestop.com/) trying to figure out where they kept the crayons. I thought to myself, \"hmm, I wonder what would happen if I typed the half dozen words that I can spell into the search bar up top?\" Behold, my revelations.\n\n**Search bar term: SHORTS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img p1w78utbdv071...*\n\nTwo results of note. The boxers are sold out, which is GameStop giving a nod to Atobitt's Citadel Has No Clothes DD (great read, linked below). Second, GameStop is the best so they are obviously have more copies of the NintendoDS game 'Shorts' but they are *mis-marking* it as sold out. This means that all shorts must cover and shares are behind rehypothecated. The last lead did not pan out, the Artemis Fowl connection led nowhere and just wasted seven hours of my time.\n\n([https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel\\_has\\_no\\_clothes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel_has_no_clothes/))\n\nSearching for shorts did not reveal anything earth shattering, so I decided to take a meta approach. I searched for 'reddit' and began the descent into the rabbit hole that led to my ultimate discovery.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/by1d3t9fdv071.png?width=1713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4757a00863e348d4eb669b913da35b47150278e\n\nAt first glance there does not appear to be anything important going on here, just a dragon ball-z figurine. I had never heard of Radditz before and was thinking he's probably like a knock-off Vegeta or something. I managed to get the imaginary boyfriend of my imaginary wife to type the words 'Radditz power level' into the google. I cannot read, but I liked what I heard from my text-to-speech app; the first result had a lot of numbers in it. **Numbers are closely related to financial markets.** I knew I was on to something. I clicked the link.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pnwu1m4idv071.png?width=1249&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7967b1b0cf5e48dfd9478085cf626e108b692f41\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt took a few hours, but I managed to throw my crayons at the keyboard in such a way that it searched for \"Rad\" on the very long page that would have taken weeks to read. Ok, I thought, I recognize these things from earlier this year: NUMBERS ONCE AGAIN. I am starting to see numbers everywhere, this is big.\n\nAccording to **many** of the top 10 counting songs on youtube: 3,000 is the highest number on this list. These numbers belong to two guys named Scarface and Shorty. Now at this point I thought that the next step in my research was to watch the movie, Scarface. So I did. But after I finished it I started thinking about the other result, Shorty.\n\nIt did not take me long (2 days and three more Al Pacino movies) to figure out that if you subtract the 'y' from 'Shorty' you get the word 'Short.' It was starting to make sense, GameStop planted this website knowing that Apes like numbers. They knew we would click on it, and see the word 'Shorty.'\n\nSo, back to GameStop.com I went, armed with the knowledge that the search term I was looking for was 'Shorty.'\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5slx341kdv071.png?width=1084&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4209d24d897eacc9911c927642b803696cc7382f\n\nThis is going to sound crazy, but it is definitely probably true: GameStop is indicating that the 'Klowns' behind the 'shorty'( - y + ing) are aliens from 'Outer Space' and that is why we have seen so much news about UFOs. At this point, the blatant corruption of MSM and sheer magnitude of this other-world fuckery started to make my head spin so I took a few minutes off from my GME pursuit. But after a quick bowl of banana raman I was ready and more determined than ever to get to the bottom of this mystery.\n\nIt is my understanding that apes are the key to this whole ordeal, so I took one last shot at the wealth of information hidden within GameStop's online store. I searched for patient zero, the alpha whale, the one who has been silently swimming aside GameStop for the past 33 years (plus or minus \\~32.5 years). I searched for 'Apes.'\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4mdooyvndv071.png?width=1497&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55271b59eca12983bffa8488f32e8b5d5df2f965\n\nHOLY SHIT. Confirmation biased confirmed.\n\nJust look at these numbers! Google says Great Ape Vegeta's power level is 180,000. There are two Great Ape Vegeta so we multiply by two and land on 360,000. The second Great Ape Vegeta also has a FiGPiN XL multiplier. This was the most difficult part to figure out, but after several months of deep thought and a machine learning application I was able to deduce that XL is a Roman Numeral and that Roman Numerals are old-timey numbers and that XL means a 40X multiplier. Great, so now we are at the number 14,400,000.\n\nBut it got even crazier.\n\nApe Escape..... 3!! As in another three times multiplier?! Yes, another one! We are at 43200000. But, wait, there is more! Look at the number of search results: 7. GameStop is basically screaming that the stock has been counterfeited at least 7 times over. The short interest is at least 700%. And that obviously means that we get another multiplier of 7x. The new floor is $302,400,000. This is retarded but probably true.\n\nDisclaimers:\n\n\\-I am long as fuck on GME. It is literally my savings account now.\n\n\\-If you think this is financial advice you may need to switch to non-toxic crayons.\n\n\\-This is my Magnum Opus shitpost. If even one person laughs, mission accomplished. Although.... I hope at least two people laugh because this legitimately took around 90 minutes to writeup. **So much respect for actual DD writers.**",

During this crisis, several Asian nations were forced to devalue their currency which sent reverberations around the globe.

Thank you for the comment u/citadelsecuritiesLLC\n\nSo this means that they can **grab a basket** (TRUST BOND) and **filling it up with half \"good solid long positions\"**(lets say aple, tesla, amazon) and **half GME naked made up shares!!, close the basket and sell it!. Thats a 50% Good old TRUST BOND from citadel.**\n\n**HOLY ACTUAL FU%\\^CK!!

The biggest banks are holdings! (READ BELLOW ABOUT IT)**\n\n**Kenny and kids (Melvin, Susquehanna and other baby hedge funds) have been shorting over and over to own companies debt to hold leverage against the banks for daddy Kenny as well!**\n\nSo... **While the company is not yet bankrupt \u2026.** [Shitadel MM makes trust bonds](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2006-12-08-0612080128-story.html)**, pack them with all the fake GME naked shares inside (can be mixed with other company shorts or full GME) and** [sell them as if they were full of valuable real GME](https://www.wiredupreport.com/2021/03/16/viral/citadel-issued-600m-worth-of-bbb-rated-bonds/) **(the system don\u2019t recognize fakes from reals, right?)** Getting tons of money!\n\n**That's a big part of how he gets his Liquidity!!**\n\nHis process is extremely complex, he uses algorithms to move the money constantly and very fast, trenching those bonds inside others and reposition them to hide all the rubbish undetected, also buying T-bonds, mortgages, short more companies and etc.\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\nAlso, like the [SEC document](https://sec.report/Document/0001752724-21-087103/) states, Kenny and other banks are funding other business in many other countries giving them money and taking advantage (we know how).\n\nWhen those business bankrupt too! Archegos style!!, they go and buy the real state overseas dirt cheap!) They love making naked shares because that\u2019s how they get liquidity out of those useless juicy trust bonds.\n\nExplained better in the KENNY SCAMMING AROUND THE WORLD in PART 2\n\n**So the money come from none existent trash and then make a shit ton more moving it?** Holy Balls!\n\n**The ones who buy those Shitadel trust bonds are the bagholders!! They are buying bonds that are full of shit!!**\n\nHe is successfully draining the money from the company, from the retail shareholder and for all the people that bought those trust bonds!! While making a shit ton of money from NON EXISTING SHARES PACKED IN BIG BAGS OF SHIT!\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\n**BIG BANKS ARE \u201cHOLDINGS\u201d???? WHAT IS THAT?**\n\nFirst we need to learn [what is a holding company?](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/using-a-holding-company-operating-company-structure-to-help-mitigate-risk) [Restaurant Brands International (RBI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant_Brands_International) is an example of a holding company for a group of popular Quick Service (Fast Food) restaurants. They own Burger King, Tim Horton's and Popeyes. In this case RBI holding is basically a basket of a few fast food restaurants put together, like a stock ETF. It is the basket of those businesses and the value is according to those companies performance.\n\nSo are banks holding companies? Well...\n\n**As a result of the global financial crisis of 2008, many traditional investment banks and finance corporations such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, American Express, CIT Group and GMAC (now Ally Financial) converted to bank holding companies in order to gain access to the Federal Reserve's credit facilities. (**[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_holding_company))\n\nThese holdings are filled up by pieces of many private institutions they lent money to: businesses, hedge funds, as well as people they lent money to (mortgages, auto loans, student loans, etc., plus money they lent to the government. Obviously as well as the money the people deposit and keep in their bank account (it will be their liquidity if they don't use your money, most of the time they move your money.)\n\n**Keep in mind: The federal reserve is privately owned (not part of the government and instead is sanctioned and backed by it) by the 12 reserve banks and the 0.01% (THE BIG BIG WHALES) (they are the top contributors to the reserve).** [Federal Reserve Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System) WHAAAAAT?\n\nBut lets keep going with the banks...\n\nThink about every company borrowing money from a bank and putting their assets as collateral (putting that stock collateral inside the bank's basket/pool, mainly ETFs).\n\nNow the bank owns part of the company in form of debt collateral. The bigger the company debt the bigger part of the pie the bank owns as collateral, right? Big leverage!\n\nAlso, some ETFs are pretty much a basket/pool full of many many company shares that are supposed to be the collateral for the debts. Some others are filled with as packages of people\u2019s debt (student loans, mortgages, etc). Others full of government debt to the banks.\n\nPut all those shares and pieces of the company (could be turned into liquidity if sold in case of company liquidation or too much risk) and their liquidity backing of cash (people\u2019s bank accounts deposited) together and that\u2019s what the bank is made of. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong on the comments please. The banks own leverage on those companies they lend money too.\n\nTake a break!! I know this is very intense, but with every word I can see your hands getting harder and harder after knowing WTF is going on!\n\n**Ohhh Kenny, how the fuck did a melon discover your fuckery?**\n\n**PLEASE DONT FORGET TO UPVOTE EVERY POST AND COMMENT!! THIS NEEDS TRACTION SO EVERY APE SEES IT!**\n\n**SHARE IT WITH OTHER APES IN OTHER POSTS AND COMMENTS!! ITS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO BE LOUD!**\n\nI RUN OUT OF CHARACTERS!!!

While making a shit ton of money from NON EXISTING SHARES PACKED IN BIG BAGS OF SHIT!\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\n**BIG BANKS ARE \u201cHOLDINGS\u201d???? WHAT IS THAT?**\n\nFirst we need to learn [what is a holding company?](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/using-a-holding-company-operating-company-structure-to-help-mitigate-risk) [Restaurant Brands International (RBI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant_Brands_International) is an example of a holding company for a group of popular Quick Service (Fast Food) restaurants. They own Burger King, Tim Horton's and Popeyes. In this case RBI holding is basically a basket of a few fast food restaurants put together, like a stock ETF. It is the basket of those businesses and the value is according to those companies performance.\n\nSo are banks holding companies? Well...\n\n**As a result of the global financial crisis of 2008, many traditional investment banks and finance corporations such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, American Express, CIT Group and GMAC (now Ally Financial) converted to bank holding companies in order to gain access to the Federal Reserve's credit facilities. (**[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_holding_company))\n\nThese holdings are filled up by pieces of many private institutions they lent money to: businesses, hedge funds, as well as people they lent money to (mortgages, auto loans, student loans, etc., plus money they lent to the government. Obviously as well as the money the people deposit and keep in their bank account (it will be their liquidity if they don't use your money, most of the time they move your money.)\n\n**Keep in mind: The federal reserve is privately owned (not part of the government and instead is sanctioned and backed by it) by the 12 reserve banks and the 0.01% (THE BIG BIG WHALES) (they are the top contributors to the reserve).** [Federal Reserve Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System) WHAAAAAT?\n\nBut lets keep going with the banks...\n\nThink about every company borrowing money from a bank and putting their assets as collateral (putting that stock collateral inside the bank's basket/pool, mainly ETFs).\n\nNow the bank owns part of the company in form of debt collateral. The bigger the company debt the bigger part of the pie the bank owns as collateral, right? Big leverage!\n\nAlso, some ETFs are pretty much a basket/pool full of many many company shares that are supposed to be the collateral for the debts. Some others are filled with as packages of people\u2019s debt (student loans, mortgages, etc). Others full of government debt to the banks.\n\nPut all those shares and pieces of the company (could be turned into liquidity if sold in case of company liquidation or too much risk) and their liquidity backing of cash (people\u2019s bank accounts deposited) together and that\u2019s what the bank is made of. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong on the comments please. The banks own leverage on those companies they lend money too.\n\nTake a break!! I know this is very intense, but with every word I can see your hands getting harder and harder after knowing WTF is going on!\n\n**Ohhh Kenny, how the fuck did a melon discover your fuckery?**\n\n**PLEASE DONT FORGET TO UPVOTE EVERY POST AND COMMENT!! THIS NEEDS TRACTION SO EVERY APE SEES IT!**\n\n**SHARE IT WITH OTHER APES IN OTHER POSTS AND COMMENTS!! ITS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO BE LOUD!**\n\nI RUN OUT OF CHARACTERS!!!

        "selftext": "The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. **That is what happened here.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following research is quite advanced, look for the words **TL;DR** if your smoothness is over 9000. \n\n**TL;DR** Via machine learning analysis and scientific discovery, the formerly-hidden, hyper-subtle messages held within the GameStop online store have been decoded.  **Short interest is at a minimum 700%**.

It only takes one ape to crack the code, and I have done it.  It all started when I was staring at [GameStop.com](https://GameStop.com) trying to figure out where they kept the crayons. I thought to myself, \"hmm, I wonder what would happen if I typed the half dozen words that I can spell into the search bar up top?\" Behold, my revelations.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Search bar term: SHORTS** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yh43rbxr7t071.png?width=1767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2eede91ff30d0ad86864d14f1ab2610c1c78e408\n\nTwo results of note. The boxers are sold out, which is GameStop giving a nod to Atobitt's Citadel Has No Clothes DD (great read, linked below). Second, GameStop is the best so they are obviously have more copies of the NintendoDS game 'Shorts' but they are *mis-marking* it as sold out. This means that all shorts must cover and shares are behind rehypothecated. The last lead did not pan out, the Artemis Fowl connection led nowhere and just wasted seven hours of my time. \n\n([https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel\\_has\\_no\\_clothes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel_has_no_clothes/)) \n\nSearching for shorts did not reveal anything earth shattering, so I decided to take a meta approach. I searched for 'reddit' and began the descent into the rabbit hole that led to my ultimate discovery. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7m1jrga86t071.png?width=1713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab0f60e2db84059cfb4c53ab5eccb80ca6d37520\n\nAt first glance there does not appear to be anything important going on here, just a dragon ball-z figurine. I had never heard of Radditz before and was thinking he's probably like a knock-off Vegeta or something. I managed to get the imaginary boyfriend of my imaginary wife to type the words 'Radditz power level' into the google. I cannot read, but I liked what I heard from my text-to-speech app; the first result had a lot of numbers in it. **Numbers are closely related to financial markets.** I knew I was on to something. I clicked the link.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kwipe7fq9t071.png?width=1249&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf81740aafddc3a64309e18293c947d00448663a\n\nIt took a few hours, but I managed to throw my crayons at the keyboard in such a way that it searched for \"Rad\" on the very long page that would have taken weeks to read. Ok, I thought, I recognize these things from earlier this year: NUMBERS ONCE AGAIN. I am starting to see numbers everywhere, this is big. \n\nAccording to **many** of the top 10 counting songs on youtube: 3,000 is the highest number on this list. These numbers belong to two guys named Scarface and Shorty. Now at this point I thought that the next step in my research was to watch the movie, Scarface. So I did. But after I finished it I started thinking about the other result, Shorty. \n\nIt did not take me long (2 days and three more Al Pacino movies) to figure out that if you subtract the 'y' from 'Shorty' you get the word 'Short.' It was starting to make sense, GameStop planted this website knowing that Apes like numbers. They knew we would click on it, and see the word 'Shorty.'\n\nSo, back to GameStop.com I went, armed with the knowledge that the search term I was looking for was 'Shorty.'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/stid7hqhbt071.png?width=1084&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8652fefcd16037d60e7189f19f561bcb51fcd42e\n\nThis is going to sound crazy, but it is probably true: GameStop is indicating that the 'Klowns' behind the 'shorty'( - y + ing) are aliens from 'Outer Space' and that is why we have seen so much news about UFOs. At this point, the blatant corruption of MSM and sheer magnitude of this other-world fuckery started to make my head spin so I took a few minutes off from my GME pursuit. But after a quick bowl of banana raman I was ready and more determined than ever to get to the bottom of this mystery. \n\nIt is my understanding that apes are the key to this whole ordeal, so I took one last shot at the wealth of information hidden within GameStop's online store. I searched for patient zero, the alpha whale, the one who has been silently swimming aside GameStop for the past 33 years (plus or minus \\~32.5 years). I searched for 'Apes.'\n\n*Processing img trw4rdexet071...*\n\nHOLY SHIT. Confirmation biased confirmed.\n\nJust look at these numbers! Google says Great Ape Vegeta's power level is 180,000. There are two Great Ape Vegeta so we multiply by two and land on 360,000. The second Great Ape Vegeta also has a FiGPiN XL multiplier. This was the most difficult part to figure out, but after several months of deep thought and a machine learning application I was able to deduce that XL is a Roman Numeral and that Roman Numerals are old-timey numbers and that XL means a 40X multiplier. Great, so now we are at the number 14,400,000. \n\nBut it got even crazier. \n\nApe Escape..... 3!! As in another three times multiplier?! Yes, another one! We are at 43200000. But, wait, there is more! Look at the number of search results: 7. GameStop is basically screaming that the stock has been counterfeited at least 7 times over. The short interest is at least 700%. And that obviously means that we get another multiplier of 7x. The new floor is $302,400,000. This is retarded but probably true. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimers:  \n\n\\-I am long as fuck on GME. It is literally my savings account now. \n\n\\-If you think this is financial advice you may need to switch to non-toxic crayons.\n\n\\-This is a joke. If even one person laughs, mission accomplished. Although.... I hope at least two people laugh because this legitimately took around 90 minutes to writeup. **So much respect for actual DD writers.**",

        "selftext": "\nI assure you, this ISN'T going to get political. Because by all accounts South Africa is screwed. My planned position is bottom paragraph.\nUnder the current ANC government there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of South Africa. Due to systemic nepotism, there are math teachers that don't know what square roots are, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never fired a gun. The practice of fictitious employees that take checks but don't work there is widespread enough that the government has drove itself into insolvency already. Estimates are that some 80% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials to simply going missing from accounts. The ANC solved this, against advise of wiser people, with quantitative easing. Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer they're inflating the South African Rand which is why they've had two bouts of inflation near 9% twice in the past 20 years.\nThat is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates (many affiliates of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighter party) will poison guard dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as car keys and groceries. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands, and in many areas utilities are defunct (untreated sewage goes in the river, untreated tap water comes out and it smells as disgusting as it sounds). South Africans are more likely to have their asylum applications accepted than any other nation as there are so many tales of rape and murder and threats of ethnic cleansing. This equates to the most educated citizens leaving SA and most SA based businesses diversifying out of the country as literacy rates have been falling. These disillusioned departures are not new, as they include the most famous Afrikaner in history Elon Musk who is now a naturalized American.\nEdit: The Economic Freedom Fighter's usual acronym isn't used because it's also the ticker for a penny stock.\nI first thought about shorting South Africa over a year ago when I was researching the country (I'm a historian, I read much on the country for fun). I found the only index tracking SA (EZA) wasn't an accurate representation of SA economy and buying puts on it was useless. It tracked only the largest cap firms, which are the aforementioned companies diversifying out of SA (mostly to other parts of Africa). Which is why it's a volatile ETF that overall trades sideways. Buying puts on it wouldn't really capitalize on SA going full Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe having experienced the general breakup of modern institutions and hyperinflation due to similar problems.\nMy new broker, IBKR, allows negative currency positions as long you post 10% as collateral. Now my native currency are US dollars, where inflation in 2020 was 1.4% while the South African Rand's inflation was 4.12% in 2020. That equals a 26.8% return on investment per year from that simple short position. But I'm expecting US Dollar inflation to stay between 1-2% a year while the Rand (ticker ZAR) stays north of 4% with inflation spikes inevitable over the next decade. This position also reduces my market beta, much needed for me as I've got hugely leveraged positions on American ETFs. This isn't a short term swing trade, I'm waiting for SA to implode.",

My wife has left me and has taken my precious son with her. He is a beautiful 1 year old chihuhua.\nTo put this in context, I was left without a job with the beginning of the COVID pandemic, then I got infected and I acquired a large debt with the hospital for the recovery and time that I remained hospitalized.\nwe had a few savings left that we used to survive until a being who called himself my friend told me about cryptocurrencies. I studied a little and I thought that I could earn some money with it. I was wrong. They cheated me and what little was left was taken by him and my wife.\nAfter I left the hospital I adopted my beautiful baby and it was my strength to carry on with all the bad that has been from then until now that she took him away from me.\nHe won't give it back to me until I find a place to live and have space for my baby to grow up happily and feed him. I know it's fair but I can't take it anymore without him.\nThat is why I ask for your help. I know my story sounds unbelievable and for the same reason I apologize if I offend you.\nIf someone wants to help me get some money back and with that pay something to have space and get my son back, I appreciate it to the heavens.\n\nI have created a wallet in metamas because the keys of the one I used with my wife she took.\nif someone wants to help with even a penny I will be happy. I'll be a penny closer to my beautiful prince.\n0x9096Fbc32E532b0b3D3B3A132cfC89A37c115e85\n\nThank you all for reading to the end.",

That\u2019s just my crazy estimation.**\n\n**At the same time while shorting they will (Shitadel)** [creates their own trust bonds](https://www.wiredupreport.com/2021/03/16/viral/citadel-issued-600m-worth-of-bbb-rated-bonds/) **and ties those fake shares to those trust bonds as collateral, sells them (whoever buys this bonds hold the garbage), and gets a shit ton of money (remember, fake shares money).**\n\n**THIS IS HIS INFINITE MONEY GLITCH AND SHITADEL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY FOR EVERYTHING!!**\n\nI will explain more about this later on!!\n\nNow Shitadel has a stupid amount of money, and what he needs to do? **HE NEEDS TO WASH IT TO MAKE IT LEGITIMATE!!!**\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**HOW IS KENNY WASHING THE MONEY?**\n\n**With that money he is most likely doing shady things, in order to wash it and make it \u201cLEGIT\u201d:**\n\nHe might be using more methods but this are the ones **I caught him off guard so far**, I think we all have seen his fuckery!!\n\n**METHOD #1: buy real shares (a bit for themselves and also transactions from the brokers and MM, order flow).**\n\nThey buy real shares to keep creating naked shares from them and recycling them to keep the machine running over and over.\n\nThey make transactions with other brokers and charge fees for that, making money for the books. Also the good old payment for order flow PFOF system RH loves.\n\nMaking money and also using it to wash the empty fake trust bonds (sometimes partially empty), that\u2019s where the money is for him!!\n\nThey're not just shorting GME, they short tons of other companies as well.

While making a shit ton of money from NON EXISTING SHARES PACKED IN BIG BAGS OF SHIT!\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\n**BIG BANKS ARE \u201cHOLDINGS\u201d???? WHAT IS THAT?**\n\nFirst we need to learn [what is a holding company?](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/using-a-holding-company-operating-company-structure-to-help-mitigate-risk) [Restaurant Brands International (RBI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant_Brands_International) is an example of a holding company for a group of popular Quick Service (Fast Food) restaurants. They own Burger King, Tim Horton's and Popeyes. In this case RBI holding is basically a basket of a few fast food restaurants put together, like a stock ETF. It is the basket of those businesses and the value is according to those companies performance.\n\nSo are banks holding companies? Well...\n\n**As a result of the global financial crisis of 2008, many traditional investment banks and finance corporations such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, American Express, CIT Group and GMAC (now Ally Financial) converted to bank holding companies in order to gain access to the Federal Reserve's credit facilities. (**[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_holding_company))\n\nThese holdings are filled up by pieces of many private institutions they lent money to: businesses, hedge funds, as well as people they lent money to (mortgages, auto loans, student loans, etc., plus money they lent to the government. Obviously as well as the money the people deposit and keep in their bank account (it will be their liquidity if they don't use your money, most of the time they move your money.)\n\n**Keep in mind: The federal reserve is privately owned (not part of the government and instead is sanctioned and backed by it) by the 12 reserve banks and the 0.01% (THE BIG BIG WHALES) (they are the top contributors to the reserve).** [Federal Reserve Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System) WHAAAAAT?\n\nBut lets keep going with the banks...\n\nThink about every company borrowing money from a bank and putting their assets as collateral (putting that stock collateral inside the bank's basket/pool, mainly ETFs).\n\nNow the bank owns part of the company in form of debt collateral. The bigger the company debt the bigger part of the pie the bank owns as collateral, right? Big leverage!\n\nAlso, some ETFs are pretty much a basket/pool full of many many company shares that are supposed to be the collateral for the debts. Some others are filled with as packages of people\u2019s debt (student loans, mortgages, etc). Others full of government debt to the banks.\n\nPut all those shares and pieces of the company (could be turned into liquidity if sold in case of company liquidation or too much risk) and their liquidity backing of cash (people\u2019s bank accounts deposited) together and that\u2019s what the bank is made of. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong on the comments please. The banks own leverage on those companies they lend money too.\n\nTake a break!! I know this is very intense, but with every word I can see your hands getting harder and harder after knowing WTF is going on!\n\n**Ohhh Kenny, how the fuck did a melon discover your fuckery?**\n\n**PLEASE DONT FORGET TO UPVOTE EVERY POST AND COMMENT!! THIS NEEDS TRACTION SO EVERY APE SEES IT!**\n\n**SHARE IT WITH OTHER APES IN OTHER POSTS AND COMMENTS!! ITS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO BE LOUD!**\n\nI RUN OUT OF CHARACTERS!!!

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI have been a long time and poster on this subreddit through some other account names, but wanted to make a more official account in order to share my ideas. \n\nI wanted to share with you guys a very basic SPAC trading strategy that I have been working on over the past few months. After developing it a bit further, I will be coming out with another blog post to cover the improvements that I have made to my trading model. \n\n[https://gainsandgrowth.wordpress.com/2021/04/18/spacs-a-trading-strategy/](https://gainsandgrowth.wordpress.com/2021/04/18/spacs-a-trading-strategy/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasics of the strategy:\n\n **1. SPACS offer a unique investment opportunity due to the \u201cprice floor\u201d** \n\n **2. SPACs tend to stay at or around the floor price until news surrounding the potential acquisition of a target is disseminated to the public** \n\n **3. SPACs will inevitably correct to the terms of the merger once they are announced** \n\nSo there are three keys points in this trading strategy\n\n1. **Identifying when investors \u201cnotice\u201d this stock.** If you can get in when investors notice the stock, you can ride the wave with them while avoiding the period of stagnation prior to major price movements.\n2. **Taking your gains and running.** I cannot stress this component of the strategy enough. We are not investing for the long term on this strategy, we don\u2019t even know anything about the company yet! We take our gains when we have them, and we revaluate if there is another point that is suitable for entry later down the road.\n3. **Reducing loses on \u201cFalse Positives\u201d.** If we enter into a position, we want to have clear end points for when we leave that position. Sometimes there will be false positives where we enter in the position, and no price action occurs, or the price of the SPAC falls. We want to get out quickly in these scenarios, since we are focusing on being ready to enter when the stock shoots up.\n\n**VOLUME**\n\nAs mentioned previously, the indicator is abnormal volume. This frees up the investor from monitoring news media and announcements, and focusing solely on the resulting interest in the company. What I have identified as a strong indicator of immediate upward price movements is three days of sustained volume above 200% of the monthly average volume.\n\nThis eliminates random trading days where the trading volume is high for unknown reasons. Maybe a fund is entering the SPAC and has bought a significant number of shares, who knows! We don\u2019t like just one day increases in volume because that can be anomaly. Three days of sustained large volume has appeared by the right indicator, but can of course be refined further. This is what I call the \u201cBuy Counter\u201d.\n\n**TAKING GAINS**\n\nThe second key part of this strategy is taking your gains. I have set an upward limit on price movement for 10%. After 10%, my algorithm will take its gains and exit the position, and will continue to monitor the SPAC and look for indicators to re-enter. The idea behind this being that a 10% return is an amazing return for any investor, especially over a short time frame. If we can string together many of these 10% returns, then I would be more than happy with the performance of my portfolio. This number is obviously arbitrary, and would benefit from more statistical analysis, but for the purposes of my initial tests I deemed it a fine starting point.\n\n**LIMITING FALSE POSITIVES**\n\nThe third key part of this strategy is reducing the times that you enter into a stock when the stock does not behave as expected. I also realized that towards middle/end of a SPACs lifecycle, volume indicators may also be true for major price corrections (refer to the CCIV graph and look at the volume towards the end of February). Therefore I also included a condition that the price increases over that 3 day period to avoid buying in on a fire sale.\n\n**Results:**\n\nI tested this strategy against 73 different SPACs, with $1000 to trade on these names from August 1st 2020 to April 18th 2021, and achieved a 20.5% return across the entire universe in my self built testing environment.\n\nParticularly impressive results were:\n\n1. TPGY: 203%\n2. ACTC 103%\n3. CCIV: 93%\n4. NGA 53%\n5. GHVI: 50%",

        "selftext": "For most people CumRocket seems like a funny memecoin, however for those who see it\u2019s potential it could revolutionise the porn industry. Here are some complied reasons as to why CumRocket is a solid investment right now. Obligatory this is not financial advice.  \n\nThe token unlike most meme coins actually has an real world use and an expanding economy. Right now it\u2019s used to buy nudes (that the models themselves are selling) and tip cam girls on NFT sites. But they are going to actually expand and either take on or combine with the porn industry.  \n\nHere are a few examples of how that might work:  \n\nScenario 1: They combine with the Porn industry and become the standard blockchain of choice for premium porn sites and other NSFW sites like OnlyFans. By having an alternative anonymous way to purchase subscriptions and porn, this allows many more people to engage monetarily with the porn industry. Right now millions of horney men and women are unable to access the content they want due to shared bank accounts and snooping partners. CumRocket offers the solution through anonymous payments.  \n\nScenario 2: they take on the porn industry by creating their own sites. They have already blackboarded this and are willing to offer 5% more than any other platform to creators while also offering complete anonymity for both the creator and buyer. Models would be paid and tipped in $CUMMIES.  \n\nThere is also a NFT marketplace where creators can sell their content. Buyers would have said content stored in their wallet, removing the need to store the content manually on a pc or hard drive. In other words the only way someone could access their porn is if they had their wallet keys.  \n\nFor many people around the world who are either embarrassed for creating porn or persecuted for it, CumRocket is the answer. In Australia where it\u2019s legal to be a sex worker they still struggle with mortgages due to the nature of the job. CumRockets allows them to show profits as an investment instead of sex.  \n\nNo matter which way $CUMMIES goes it cannot lose, they have already a growing list of content creators signing up and it\u2019s only a matter of time until one of the scenarios comes into fruition.  \n\nAudits have been done and passed, exchanges are interested, the token is deflationary with a small starting supply. It might have started as a meme but it won\u2019t end in one.",

As a result, their revenue, growth rate and long-term profitability are also affected by their ability to achieve both objectives. **As of December 31, 2020**, they **offered plans in 34 MA markets across seven states** with **8% market** **share** of the individual, non-special needs plans (\u201cnon-SNP\u201d) MA enrollees in these markets. **They have launched in 74 additional MA markets, expanding their footprint by an additional state, in 2021.**\n\n**Total MA Market Growth 2021 YTD vs 2020:** **From 34 to 108 MA markets - 217% YOY Growth**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j4pxmy4s5kw61.jpg?width=999&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d3a82ea7ee0fdbc4d819bb9f7773b02092273f6\n\n**Total Revenue Per Member (2019):** **$10,853 per member**\n\n**Total Revenue Per Member (2020):**  **$11,590 per member**\n\n**Total Revenue Growth YOY 2019-2020:** **46%**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MACHINE LEARNING IS THE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY**\n\nThey are singularly focused on creating great, sustainable healthcare to improve every life. They have centered Their strategy on building and deploying technology that they believe **will enable them to solve a significant data problem while avoiding the limitations of legacy approaches**. Currently, as a next-generation Medicare Advantage insurer, they leverage their flagship software platform, the Clover Assistant, to provide America\u2019s seniors with PPO and HMO plans that are the obvious choice for Medicare-eligible consumers. \n\nThey call Their plans \u201cObvious\u201d because they believe they are highly affordable\u2014offering most of Their members the lowest average out-of-pocket costs for primary care physician co-pays, specialist co-pays, drug deductibles and drug costs in their markets\u2014and provide wide network access and the same cost-sharing (co-pays and deductibles) for physicians who are in- and out-of-network. **By empowering physicians with data-driven, personalized insights at the point of care through their software platform, they believe they can improve clinical decision-making and viably offer these \u201cObvious\u201d plans at scale, through an asset-light approach. They reach a broad array of consumers, including traditionally underserved populations.**\n\nThey drive adoption and use of the Clover Assistant across their network of primary care physicians (\u201cPCPs\u201d) by focusing on continuously improving its user-centric design, highly actionable and real-time clinical content, enhanced and rapid payment for Clover Assistant visits and simple onboarding. \n\nAs of December 31, 2020, over 2,400 PCPs had contracted to use the Clover Assistant to manage Their members\u2019 care. High PCP engagement with the Clover Assistant enables real-time, data-driven decision-making for Their members at the point of care and drives rapid software iteration**: the more that physicians use the Clover Assistant, the more it learns** and furthers the precision of personalized data-driven recommendations. **They combine their payor data with physician-generated data and use this powerful closed feedback loop to continuously tune their clinical rules and machine learning models**, as well as to select and prioritize future software capabilities. \n\n**The use and continuous improvement of the Clover Assistant has resulted in not only improved clinical decision-making but also strong plan performance.** The platform also facilitates identifying and engaging with their most at-risk members for their clinical programs designed to provide additional targeted care support, which is designed to further drive better plan performance. Taken together, they believe these enhancements will allow them to return a material portion of their savings to members through their \u201cObvious\u201d plans and to continuously lower their members\u2019 out-of-pocket costs and provide them with market-leading benefits.",

        "selftext": "I'm a long term CLOV investor and do not believe the recent price action reflects a squeeze of any kind. More likely that wall street investors woke up to CLOV potential because of [this](https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement) CMS update that announces CLOV participation in 10 US states in PY 2021. (This is my first reddit post so here goes)\n\nBelow is why I (a regular, retail investor) have held on to CLOV shares and warrants in my portfolio and why I believe getting in on this stock under $15 is a no brainer (disclaimer: I\u2019m not a financial advisor and this is NOT investment advice, do your own DD before investing):\n\n1. **Business Model:** Clover Health is a Medicare Advantage insurance company. [Sources of revenue for MA insurers](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-is-medicare-advantage-funded) include premiums and payments via CMS, most of which goes to hospitals and doctors. In MA, specially under plans offered by CLOV, premiums are negligible so for our purpose payments made by CMS (government) are the lifeblood of MA plans such as Clover. You may be wondering so what? Well, let\u2019s put things in perspective. The US federal govt spent $1.2 Trillion on healthcare in 2019, $644 Billion of this went to Medicare of which $270B was spent on MA. All or most of this growing annual budget goes to fund MA plans such as Clover for services they provide members. The problem is, there are too many visits and hospitalizations (than are needed). What if there was an innovative startup that used innovation (pay doctors fixed fees per visit) and technology (Clover Assistant software with telehealth features) such that federal government paid out LESS per member to such a company vs. competition ([target outcome of Direct Contracting](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/direct-contracting)) for HIGHER quality of care. Great ability to capture market share from legacy insurers and help lower government spending (more on this later) \u2013 a WIN-WIN situation for insurer and the govt. This is why Clover\u2019s business model is so fool proof!  \n***TLDR:*** ***Clover operates in a space that is majority funded by government, and its unique business model helps it gain market share***\n2. **Competition:** Now let\u2019s talk competition. Competitors such as Humana, United Health, CVS/Aetna have for years delivered medical insurance but hardly innovated in a way that was positive for federal spending. They continued charging seniors on plan premiums, while trying to receive as much funding as possible from the fed to grow their profits. Why make the process more efficient when all we do to get paid is to broker insurance plans in a highly regulated industry. Clover with its innovation is miles ahead of the competition by getting a nice head start (started in 2014, while other [insurers are just getting started with the innovation)](https://medcitynews.com/2021/02/mercy-humana-partner-to-expand-access-to-virtual-value-based-care/) and the Clover Assistant software will constantly help it become more efficient i.e. achieve better results for its members, at a lower cost to CMS!! CLOV is also MORE HOLISTIC than TDOC in services, while targeting a LOWER TAM i.e. only Seniors right now. Only a matter of time that they expand beyond MA and offer plans for the general population.  \n***TLDR: Clover is disrupting competition through its use of technology.***\n3. **Software:** Now the bit about software. This IS Clover\u2019s secret ingredient. The development is led by an ex-Googler (Andrew Toy, President at Clover Health) to radically transform software used to treat seniors through massive digitization, and interactive UI. This in turn helps doctors improve outcomes for patients. And they are giving it away for free!!! Why would a physician not use software that helped him/her improve the standard of care for their patients while being easy to use and access and FREE. Imagine, Marc Benioff giving away Salesforce for free to sales reps all over. When this software becomes the standard of care because of the years of head start they have in this space, Clover Health could eventually license this to the other insurers and health care providers i.e. additional sources of revenue.  \n***TLDR: The Clover Assistant software is the secret ingredient that helps the company deliver efficient care and achieve better outcomes.***\n4. **Growth:** Ok so we briefly spoke about licensing as an additional mode of revenue, now let\u2019s focus on others. 2) Current projections indicate 14% annual organic growth of MA population, this growth is likely to go bonkers when Biden reduces the Medicare eligible age to 60, as [promised](https://joebiden.com/fact-sheet-how-joe-biden-would-help-you-get-health-insurance-coverage-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/) in his campaign. Evergreen and ever-growing TAM 3) Direct Contracting introduced by CMS is basically a risk sharing model that incentivizes insurers to make treatment of seniors more efficient and cost effective. Insurers that can achieve a lower cost of treatment and fewer hospital visits for the same condition, they are likely to be held in favor by CMS when allotting MA counties every year. Now, if you remember the bit about software, Clover is in the best position to do this\u2026as long as doctors continue to use the Clover Assistant software to treat seniors. This may sound like a risky bet, but it really isn\u2019t\u2026.60%+ of Clover members see a PCP that uses the Clover Assistant software. Clover\u2019s [long-term goal](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213) is to get to a 70%+ rate. 4) End 2020, Clover offered MA plans in 34 counties but this will grow based on participation in more states as per the [CMS Direct Contracting plan for 2021](https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement).  \n***TLDR: Growth in MA membership, direct contracting, geographic expansion, potential to license its software are all lucrative growth avenues.***\n5. **Customers:** Let\u2019s now put some light on the target demographic\u2026seniors. Clover is promising them the lowest cost plans ($0 premiums, low/no co-pays) which are highly flexible (telehealth on Clover Assistant) to their needs. Why not? In addition, Clover is developing partnerships with Walmart and other retailers to market their plans which is likely to result in an ever-growing customer and incentivized partner base.\n6. **Media:** The media has lambasted this company quite vocally including on CNBC despite little of substance\u2026except that there was a short-seller report and questions asked about the CEO. To his credit, Cramer recently invited Clover Health to Mad Money\u2026now, when this interview happens it is likely to introduce the company to a pretty massive list of retail investors (the buy and hold kind) and when they realize how undervalued Clover is, they will likely pick up a good portion of the float, causing fewer and fewer shares to be available.\n7. **Management:** If one reads through the exec incentive structure in [SPAC prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312520316032/d69158d424b3.htm#toc69158_24), they would soon realize that the CEO has most of his interest in the company tied to the stock \u2013 he does not receive a salary. More importantly, both CEO and President performance-based incentive plans do not kick in until CLOV reaches and maintains a volume weighted average price of $30 for a 90-day period. Consider also, **Lee Shapiro who sits on the board of Clover Health is the former CFO of Livongo (now part of TDOC, ARK fav) while Chelsea Clinton adds serious weight and is actively involved as a board member.**\n8. **Valuation:** SPAC merger docs value the company at $3.7B. Currently, because of the short seller report and the massive short-interest in the company, it is valued at \\~$3B, which is \\~4x 2021E sales. With projected revenues for 2021 of $835M (mid-point), and applying a 8x sales multiple, Clover\u2019s valuation needs to be at least $6.7B+ market cap implying a $16+ PT. With expected 24%+ growth in 2021, and premium multiple for high growth companies (note that the float is only 25% of shares outstanding), I believe a $20-25 target is more in line with current valuations. When medicare eligible age limit is lowered to 60 by Biden later this year or perhaps early next, this PT will need to be re-evaluated\u2026upward. Also consider the fact that this company is NOT zero revenue now, promising billions in 2025 and beyond\u2026.it had sales of $670M in sales in 2020 and growing!! Consider also that the industry-leader in the telehealth space \u2013 TDOC \u2013 and a Cathie Wood &amp; ARK fav currently trades at 16x sales. Similar multiple for CLOV implies a $33 PT.  \n***TLDR: Whichever way you cut it, CLOV is very undervalued right now. Near term $25-30 PT and longer term has LMND-like potential in healthcare insurance***\n\nI am long CLOV because I believe that it is trying to solve a very hard and complex problem in healthcare. It deserves a lot more credit and people rooting for it to succeed.",
