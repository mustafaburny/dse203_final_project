This is more of a condensed snapshot to show continued growth and support my reasons as to I\u2019m so bullish on Su Bae\n\nContinuing the solid growth from pt. 1, AMD\u2019s Q1 proved to be their best Q1 ever despite shortages and COVID fallout. Q1 broke records with a 93% YoY and a 6% q/q growth, bring in a cool $3.5 Billion in revenue all while maintaining a flat gross margin of 46% YoY and up 1% q/q(if you\u2019re retarded, this is great news).\n\n**Some other quick glance numbers**\n\n\t- OCF - $898 Million\n\t- FCF - $832 Million (Record)\n\t- Cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments- $3.12 Billion\n\nNow we\u2019re going to look at a lot of numbers (if you\u2019re brain lacks wrinkles please skip to the end)\n\n**Below we\u2019ll see the growth of revenue for each quarter** \n\n2021Q1      2020Q4      2020Q3      2020Q2      2020Q1     2019Q4     2019Q3     2019Q2      2019Q1\n$3.445B     $3.225B     $2.8B         $1.932B      $1.786B    $2.127B    $1.8B         $1.531B     $1.272B\n\n**So what ca we take away from these quarterly comparisons?**\n\n\t- AMD broke revenue records 6 quarters back to back (fuck meek mill)\n\t- I\u2019m too lazy to put all the numbers here, AMD was up on everything q/q except gross margin which remained flat and they reduced debt, GROWTH EVERYWHERE \n\t- AMD hit a rough patch in 2013 - 2015, where its slow but steady growth started. With the release of Ryzen, AMD began climbing from the depths in 2016 and started it\u2019s steroid cycle in 2019.\n\t- Historically Q3 has been AMD\u2019s best quarter by far, the fact that AMD crushed it in Q420 w/ $2.2 billion in q/q growth and then beat out Q420 by another 2 billion in 2021. \n\t- AMD has achieved these numbers DESPITE fucc boi COVID-19 and significant shortages/ manufacturing challenges.\n\t\n**The Balance Sheet Quick Glance**\n\t\n\t- $3.116 Billion in cash/ cash equivalent, up $826 Million q/q and up $1.731 Billion YoY (LOL GAWT DAMN THAS SUM GROWTH)\n\t- Debt $313 Million, down $17 Million q/q and down $175 Million YoY\n\t- Inventories $1.653 Billion, up $254 Million q/q and up $597 Million YoY\n\t- Accounts receivable $2.178 Billion, up $112 Million q/q and up $487 Million YoY\n\n\tAMD has a very strong balance sheet and continues to grow as a company, further proof that AMD is well on its way to the moon.\n\n**Financial Outlook Quick Glance**\n\n\t- 2021Q2 expected earnings $3.6 Billion, historically they beat their estimates by a small bit\n\t- 2021 expected earnings is 50% YoY Growth ($14.65 Billion) \n\t- Gross margin for YoY is not expected to change\n\t- Operating expenses are expexted 27% for the year\n\n**Q1 and Beyond Thoughts**\n\n\tAMD has been doing tremendous and has done nothing but grow as a company since Lisa Su took over in 2014. AMD\u2019s last 1.5 years are a sign of what\u2019s to come, I believe they will be on this incredible run for the rest of year and possibly into next before they start to slow down. I also believe that the next few months will see massive jump in share price with a continued less volatile climb throughout the rest of the year.\n\n**For lazy people**\n\n\tLisa Sue said I could have a sleep over with the bois and she\u2019s making tendies.\n\n$100 15OctC\n$99 06AugC\n\nPart 3 will be all about Xilinx \nPart 1 of 3 can be found here\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o7bb1e/amd_the_dd_that_will_make_you_rethink_why_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",

        "selftext": "# DEAR APES,\n\nAnother weekly update on AMD.\n\nSince my last post, we broke $90 and came up to $95... now we hit Wave 4, as we get ready **RISE**!\n\nIf you know anything about Elliot Wave (I suggest you research it)... Wave 4 is here.\n\nBasically, we will consolidate for a couple of days before the **sky-rocketing WAVE 5** towards $97.97.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**On the Technical Analysis:** \"I heart stock charts\" on youtube does a great job following AMD.\n\nHe anticipated yesterday's drop (Wave 4, with a 4% drop) and even today's continuation to $89.49. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf6LNcUP-L0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf6LNcUP-L0)\n\nBut this drop is expected, as part of a Wave 4... and Before WAVE 5.\n\nThe target remains $97.97.... and even aiming to break the $100 mark (a new all-time high).\n\n[Wave 4 to drop to $89.49 before bouncing back...](https://preview.redd.it/93pnyw1010a71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b4036d9f97d3b8ef5c01759ca50d69cff0913ff)\n\n**On the FUNDAMENTALS:**\n\nObviously, the Elliot WAVE pushes upwards as a result of fundamentals... (that **fuel** the rise).\n\nThere's interesting news since my last post:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# #1- Intel announced a DELAY on its 7nm manufacturing plan.\n\nThis is great news for AMD: [https://www.protocol.com/intel-7nm-chip-delay](https://www.protocol.com/intel-7nm-chip-delay)\n\n[INTEL announced a NEW delay on its 7nm process](https://preview.redd.it/p77kemk630a71.jpg?width=1159&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccb08ed1567ee4f1b6d9b9c77c315da5d9b3c3b4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# #2- AMD consumer sales remain STRONG (Amazon)\n\nHere's today's sales chart, directly from AMAZON... where AMD dominates the TOP 10.\n\n[AMD has 8 positions from the Top 10 sales](https://preview.redd.it/6g6uuy1w30a71.jpg?width=1882&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b36234479fc5dafef09b0d277d4712c11d4b0aa2)\n\nInteresting to note the amount of reviews AMD products receive in contrast to the 2 Intel chips.\n\nI've highlighted in the color boxes the AMD chip review numbers vs Intel.\n\nIn short, Intel has a total 3,222 combined reviews on their #7 and #8 spots.\n\nWhile AMD has 101,795 reviews. Consumers are **VERY HAPPY** with AMD products.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# #3- AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution to GROW (July 16th).\n\nAs reported by Coreteks yesterday, more games will receive AMD FX Super Resolution next week.\n\nIn addition, the Radeon 6600XT is planned for launch next month (August).\n\nAs per his estimates, FSR will let you hit **60 FPS** at **4K** with **Ultra Quality** on the 6600XT.\n\n[Coreteks' report](https://preview.redd.it/q2w48evd50a71.jpg?width=1897&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e91039f1f2749acc5ca92c1e639a61a54821110)\n\n**Coretek's awesome video**: : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msNiyDsDVsA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msNiyDsDVsA)\n\nThis is awesome news for AMD's entry GPU... which will be **SOLD-OUT immediately** on launch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# #4 - AMD grows on SuperComputer Ranking (NEW June list)\n\nAs reported recently, Intel has been dropping in the SuperComputer (Datacenter) market.\n\n[INTEL falls in Datacenter](https://preview.redd.it/twtkltha60a71.jpg?width=1670&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abc32d39542548206263b8f3d879b76db04521be)\n\nArticle: [https://www.networkworld.com/article/3623750/intel-stumbles-in-supercomputer-rankings-delays-next-gen-cpu.html](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3623750/intel-stumbles-in-supercomputer-rankings-delays-next-gen-cpu.html)\n\nIn addition, there's a **really good video** from ServeTheHome ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd1H-I-i-68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd1H-I-i-68)), where he analyzed the latest SuperComputers list.\n\n[AMD Walloped Intel on June's 2021 Top 500 SuperComputer List](https://preview.redd.it/c6mmrga570a71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ff78b30908f538b62063825d9bc9847f89f9d36)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# #5 - Valuation versus NVIDIA: AMD is still CHEAP\n\nToday, AMD's real competitor is NVIDIA.\n\nFrom a market capitalization perspective, NVIDIA trades at roughly $500 billion.\n\nWhile AMD is trading at $108 billion... a fifth of NVIDIA's size.\n\nThis is ridiculously cheap, at AMD's P/E ratio is much lower and the future outlook is great.\n\nWhile NVIDIA's acquisition of ARM is still being questioned by huge players (Google, etc.)... AMD received **green lights from EVERYONE** to acquire XILINX.\n\nThis acquisition will be great for AMD, as the automotive sector goes through a revolution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# To summarize:\n\n**#1- INTEL continues to have delays on 7nm**\n\n**#2- AMD continues to dominate the Consumer CPU market**\n\n**#3- AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution increasing ADOPTION by developers. GPU launch soon!**\n\n**#4- AMD continues to GROW in Datacenter... kicking INTEL's rear.**\n\n**#5 - AMD still CHEAP versus NVIDIA**\n\n# WE ONLY NEED TO RIDE OUT WAVE 4 and pack our bananas...\n\n# WAVE 5...

        "selftext": "XLNX and AMD are almost the same company at this point, but a XLNX share is supposed to be worth 1.7234 times more than an AMD share once the acquisition is done (approved recently by the EU and the UK, awaiting decision from China) and the XLNX shares are replaced with AMD shares. However it's currently only trading at 1.4816 times more than AMD. There might be a massive arbitrage opportunity for XLNX shares (roughly 16.32% realized gains at the end by my math, assuming AMD shares don't tumble randomly) and you only have to wait like 5 months at the most for the acquisition to be done (if approved). This is not professional financial advice, obviously, so do your own research. There is a chance China doesn't approve of it, but based on their past acquisition decisions I think it has a strong chance of being allowed. Then again, it's the Chinese government so who knows.",

This is more of a condensed snapshot to show continued growth and support my reasons as to I\u2019m so bullish on Su Bae\n\nContinuing the solid growth from pt. 1, AMD\u2019s Q1 proved to be their best Q1 ever despite shortages and COVID fallout. Q1 broke records with a 93% YoY and a 6% q/q growth, bring in a cool $3.5 Billion in revenue all while maintaining a flat gross margin of 46% YoY and up 1% q/q(if you\u2019re retarded, this is great news).\n\n**Some other quick glance numbers**\n\n\t- OCF - $898 Million\n\t- FCF - $832 Million (Record)\n\t- Cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments- $3.12 Billion\n\nNow we\u2019re going to look at a lot of numbers (if you\u2019re brain lacks wrinkles please skip to the end)\n\n**Below we\u2019ll see the growth of revenue for each quarter** \n\n2021Q1     2020Q4      2020Q3      2020Q2      2020Q1    2019Q4   2019Q3     2019Q2    2019Q1\n$3.445B   $3.225B     $2.8B         $1.932B      $1.786B    $2.127B    $1.8B         $1.531B     $1.272B\n\n**So what ca we take away from these quarterly comparisons?**\n\n\t- AMD broke revenue records 6 quarters back to back (fuck meek mill)\n\t- I\u2019m too lazy to put all the numbers here, AMD was up on everything q/q except gross margin which remained flat and they reduced debt, GROWTH EVERYWHERE \n\t- AMD hit a rough patch in 2013 - 2015, where its slow but steady growth started. With the release of Ryzen, AMD began climbing from the depths in 2016 and started it\u2019s steroid cycle in 2019.\n\t- Historically Q3 has been AMD\u2019s best quarter by far, the fact that AMD crushed it in Q420 w/ $2.2 billion in q/q growth and then beat out Q420 by another 2 billion in 2021. \n\t- AMD has achieved these numbers DESPITE fucc boi COVID-19 and significant shortages/ manufacturing challenges.\n\t\n**The Balance Sheet Quick Glance**\n\t\n\t- $3.116 Billion in cash/ cash equivalent, up $826 Million q/q and up $1.731 Billion YoY (LOL GAWT DAMN THAS SUM GROWTH)\n\t- Debt $313 Million, down $17 Million q/q and down $175 Million YoY\n\t- Inventories $1.653 Billion, up $254 Million q/q and up $597 Million YoY\n\t- Accounts receivable $2.178 Billion, up $112 Million q/q and up $487 Million YoY\n\n\tAMD has a very strong balance sheet and continues to grow as a company, further proof that AMD is well on its way to the moon.\n\n**Financial Outlook Quick Glance**\n\n\t- 2021Q2 expected earnings $3.6 Billion, historically they beat their estimates by a small bit\n\t- 2021 expected earnings is 50% YoY Growth ($14.65 Billion) \n\t- Gross margin for YoY is not expected to change\n\t- Operating expenses are expexted 27% for the year\n\n**Q1 and Beyond Thoughts**\n\n\tAMD has been doing tremendous and has done nothing but grow as a company since Lisa Su took over in 2014. AMD\u2019s last 1.5 years are a sign of what\u2019s to come, I believe they will be on this incredible run for the rest of year and possibly into next before they start to slow down. I also believe that the next few months will see massive jump in share price with a continued less volatile climb throughout the rest of the year.\n\n**For lazy people**\n\n\tLisa Sue said I could have a sleep over with the bois and she\u2019s making tendies.\n\n$100 15OctC\n$99 06AugC\n\nPart 3 will be all about Xilinx \nPart 1 of 3 can be found here\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o7bb1e/amd_the_dd_that_will_make_you_rethink_why_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",

        "selftext": "\tSo this is a post i made a couple weeks back and posted to WSB, but we all know what\u2019s happening there and I already started on \npt. 2. I hope this is welcome here!\n\n**AMD Overview**\n\n\tAMD is a global semiconductor company offering x86 microprocessors as standalone or integrated (CPU\u2019s, GPU\u2019s, server systems, Etc\u2026) and intellectual property/ services.\n\n**Products**\n\n\tAMD\u2019s primary products consist of CPU\u2019s and GPU\u2019s which are on par or out performing NVIDIA GPU\u2019s and Intel\u2019s CPU\u2019s. While these other two giants have dominated the market for sometime, AMD\u2019s recent move has evolved from a slow creep to a brisk jog.\n\n**Competition** \n\n\tAMD\u2019s largest competitors are Intel (CPU\u2019s) and NVIDIA (GPU\u2019s). With the release of AMD\u2019s Ryzen processors in 2017, AMD has been steadily over taking Intel\u2019s dominance over market share. AMD\u2019s current market share (over all CPU\u2019s) currently sits at 44%, levels it has not seen since 2005. AMD took 20% of the market share in past 2 years with a significant jump in 2019. Since the release of Ryzen, AMD is now on par or out performing Intel chips and has gained a significant amount of sentiment over the soy boys at intel. AMD is on track to overtake the majority of CPU market share within the next year based on current projections.\n\n\tNow NVIDIA is a whole other beast who currently has a significant advantage over the dGPU market. Nvidia at the end of Q4 2020, held roughly 82% of the market share which was a increase of 9% from the previous year. AMD\u2019s high end GPU\u2019s do not come close to Nvidia\u2019s high end models, UNTIL AMD\u2019s Radeon 6000 series, which are now on par with Nvidia\u2019s cards, either outperforming or underperforming in various tests. AMD catching up to Nvidia is the same move that AMD made against Intel in 2017, 4 years later they are on the verge of overtaking market share. While Nvidia is a monster of a company, I believe that AMD will begin taking more market share from Nvidia. AMD has already taken the game console market.\n\n\tAMD has already proved they are able to take back significant market share with there current and future products, Lisa Su is a genius and I believe she\u2019ll lead the company to Valhalla. What does AMD have that Nvidia does not? Aside from many differences, I think the fact that AMD has an ecosystem will play a significant role in catching up. Now that AMD can evenly compete with both of their rivals, AMD plans on leveraging the fact that they produce CPU\u2019s and GPU\u2019s. There are already incentives to using AMD\u2019s CPU with their GPU rather than an AMD CPU with a Nvidia GPU. With AMD taking the CPU market, retail users will be more likely to stick with the ecosystem, and I\u2019m a big fan of companies producing an ecosystem (laughs in apple)\n\n\tA new player enters the battle. Intel has been working on their own dGPU and will surely be releasing in the next few years, but I believe this will be comparable to Sony vs Microsoft with Nintendo enjoying their best life staring at butterfly\u2019s, covered in drool in the corner lol.\n\n**The Merger**\n\n\tNvidia set to acquire ARM, AMD set to acquire Xilinx. What are they and how are they expected to impact the company?\n\n\tARM - Create and dominate the mobile processor market, covering TV\u2019s, phones, tablets, and other similar products as well as some software applications. I will not be covering much more of ARM in this DD.\n\n\tXilinx - Designs and develops programmable logic products. As far as I can tell this is some big brain shit that I\u2019m sure some booger nosed, mother\u2019s basement living, neck beard having, nerd will easily explain in the comments cuz Wikipedia ain\u2019t cutting it.  \n\n\tIf AMD completes the purchase, which is likely and expected to happen by the end of 2021, Xilinx shares will become worth 1.723 shares of AMD. **DATA FROM LAST 2 WEEKS, INPUT CURRENT NUMBERS TO GET ACCURATE EXCHANGE** AMD is currently trading at 86.10$, meaning that shares of Xilinx will be worth 148.35$ if the deal were to go through right now. Xilinx is currently worth 133.71$, I\u2019m betting heavily that AMD will continue to pump prior to this deal as well.\n\n\tARM will be huge for Nvidia, but this is running into some major road blocks and is likely some ways off or will fall through.\n\n**Financials and Projections**\n\n\t\n\tNet Revenue\u2014 2020 - 9.7B, 2019 - 6.7B, 2018 - 6.5B, 2017 - 5.2B, 2016 - 4.3B\n\tNet Income\u2014    2020 - 2.5B, 2019 - 341M, 2018 - 341M, 2017 - 33M, 2016 - 500M\n\t**There was supposed to be a picture here but i dum**\n\n\tI like your growth G. AMD has steadily increased their financials YoY.\n\t\n\tAMD also decreased their debt to 338 million from 568 million.\n\t\n\t$1.6 billion in cash ($9 billion in total assets, I find cash on hand more important)\n\n\tGPU/CPU sales accounted for $6.5 billion while enterprise accounted for $3.3 billion, GPU/CPU sales saw a 37% increase over 2019 while enterprise saw a 65% increase in 2020. 2021 is set to continue this trend of growth.\n\n\tAMD has a high price target of $169.70, median $107.00, and an average of $103.92. I just read 100\u2019s of pages of 8k\u2019s and 10\u2019ks, plus I\u2019m super attracted to the ole doc Su Bae so I\u2019m betting that it will get a target price upgrade, regardless $103 will make me rich. There is a lot more we could dive into on financials but idk what the fuck I\u2019m doing so nah.\n\n**Risks**\n\n\tI like to plan for more than 1 risk occurring at a time so keep that in mind. Ive highlighted the risks that I find most impactful/ probable. Also keep in mind of global shortages, especially with chips. AMD has contingency plans in place for their top risks, i will cover this in pt. 2.\n\n\t- Intel/ Nvidia\u2019s market share dominance (mostly Nvidia)\n\t- Seasonal sales can make for shit earnings in Q1/Q2\n\t- Reliance on third parties for manufacturing/ distributors\n\t- Xilinx deal falls through\n\t- Jim Cramer also likes this stock\n\n\tThat\u2019s enough risks, what am I a gay bear?\n\n**TLDR**\n\nAMD will moon, Lisa Su is my mommy and is cooking up some tendies, AMD GPU\u2019s are now in Teslas,  obligatory rockets (insert rocket emojis here), lots of words just buy it.\n\nPOS\n150 shares @ 78.50\nJan22 $100/$105C\nLooking for entry into Xilinx cuz I dumb\n**Pt. 2 is coming**",
