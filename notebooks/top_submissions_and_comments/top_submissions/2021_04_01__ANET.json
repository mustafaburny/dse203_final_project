        "selftext": "You guys were right - Nokia is the share to look out for on its way to the skies!\n\nI spent 10 years with the company, now off and not under any NDA or limit to trading, so I\u2019m now happy to throw some money at the share.\n\nNokia results this morning show good growth and strong pick up in profitability! Beating the estimates with a comfortable margin. With the house cleaned from bad leadership and product transformation well on its way, I think there are a few benchmarks that support price doubling.\n\nBase business alone supports 50% up: Look at Ericsson: Although Nokia\u2019s business is broader (I come to this why the real gem is there), at the heart is a business similar to Ericsson: 5G Networks. Ericsson trades at double the valuation. This should not be as customers, Operators, want to keep their vendors balanced to avoid paying massively more for their equipment and SW. This valuation gap will close as the roadmap gap has now been closed. Nokia is well ahead on future technologies such as Open RAN and Cloud RAN. \n\nIn addition to Ericsson, Nokia has a better licensing and patenting business being a stronger brand and getting all the patents from Alcatel-Lucent as well. Also in terms of 5G patents, the long term money maker, Nokia is well ahead. This business is basically revenue=profit, thus its key to keep in mind.\n\nThen there is the gem of the business: IP and Optical Networks. This is the crown jewel here, this part is always forgotten by analysts and investors. These guys are brilliant, top engineers and researchers sitting in Mountain View and Belgium, and as shown by the Q1 results, in a growth area. They make incredible products. Go and have a look at the valuation of Cisco (200B company), Juniper. Back? Good, these guys absolutely smoke both companies when it comes to technology alone. Have a look at Arista. Now Network Infrastructure division also provides similar dc networking equipment to the webscale companies like Apple and Microsoft. Arista alone is worth as much as whole Nokia, so there is massive upside here. The worst case is that this part is sold to a Private Equity investor, I know some are after it. This means maybe 10-15B valuation for it. Great, but I think this has potential for so much more. \n\nWhy it has underperformed: Bad management and badly managed merger with Alcatel lucent. Nokia was held back for years by really incompetent management - that management has now been cleaned out. How incompetent? Think hiring senior people based on private life matters\u2026Think throwing half of your R&amp;D budget on a single customers request\u2026 New CEO, new Business Group presidents, transformation well under way (since 2,5 years in 5G), and potential in the share to double when executed right. And way beyond that thanks to that nice IP and Optical business. Think Cisco scale. \n\n\nExcited to see how the market takes to this today. The fundamentals are solid, and engineering competence is there, the results are coming in!!",
