        "selftext": "Full disclosure, I work here. I've got an ESPP set up, so I do have a small percentage of GPN in my portfolio (not enough to hurt now that they're tanking lol). But generally, to my untrained eye, the financials seem at least decent. Q3 earnings report was generally positive, beat EPS and revenue estimates, and beat Q3 2020.   \n  \nQuote from the CEO: \u201cWe are pleased to have delivered the strongest performance in our history in the third quarter despite facing incremental challenges from COVID-19 during the period.\"  \n  \nFrom the CFO: \u201cWe are gratified by the strong financial performance we delivered in the third quarter, which exceeded our expectations despite the incremental impact of the pandemic. We achieved double digit adjusted net revenue growth, strong adjusted operating margin expansion and impressive adjusted earnings per share growth compared to both 2020 and 2019.\u201d  \n  \nWhen I look at the [earnings history by quarter, I see green across the board](https://imgur.com/85hwbX3). So what am I missing here? During the pandemic, the stock price fell $87 from Feb to March (obviously). After that, it rebounded and by December was higher than it was previously. But in 2021, there has been an even greater drop off than what we saw in early 2020! So far this year, the price fell from a high of $217 in April down to about $120 today, a drop of $97 and 44.7% in less than eight months. The Q3 earnings report didn't even cause a blip of good news, it just continued to fall. What am I missing that's causing this?",
