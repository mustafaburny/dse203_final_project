        "selftext": "# INTRO - I have a feeling this week is going to be another good week for the major indices and tech. I do believe most inflation fears are priced in, have been for some time, and for the most part this is an ordinary summer. The 10 year bond has dropped right around 1.35% which will indicate what sectors we should be investing in. It seems like the lower it goes, the better tech and growth do. Traditionally cheaper money benefits these companies that carry a lot of paper. I'm not expecting any major changes on this front. Yet, I am getting ready to take profits on longer term positions and move somethings around in preparation for a bigger dip in September or August that I've been writing about for some time now.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TODAY** \\- Good start to the week as the markets across the board set fresh all time highs! My portfolio is up over $10k. \n\nYear-to-date gains in the S&amp;P and NASDAQ are at 18% and 15% respectively and even though I am expecting a pull back after the summer, there is still more room to run towards the end of the year.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qyshhp5qhva71.png?width=1121&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3083deb40b7fda498d29d0a0210c0fae1727e8f2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI do think that $**AAPL** will pull back, unfortunately for my LEAPS, however if it does getting into another position closer to the 180 MA is beneficial. There is no real guarantee that **AAPL** will recede all the way back down, giving up all the gains from the last couple weeks, however September is usually a horrible month for **AAPL**. In case, I will be prepared.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hueebk7gva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=041dbab8f67ee16ac8a4f70f33077a0da02f66fe\n\nNext on the list of new alerts is $**ROKU**. I am not that bullish on **ROKU** and agree with Morgan Stanley giving it a sell rating. If it does rise up to the resistance trend line, it will be almost all time high. I like puts at this point.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zluyryg9gva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=438bd1a0b0657f12fa519bbfcca854a7037cf609\n\n **MSFT,** like AAPL, has ran up a great bit the last few weeks. Currently most indicators are showing levels of over bought. I don't want to buy puts or short **MSFT**, but if it does pull back toward the support, which it has bounce many times before, I'm a buyer.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eizxl02bgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dafe6828303bbb45e245d62ce41b5e3b96fddebc\n\n \n\n$**X** is an interesting play that I would consider pretty safe. Of course everyone has heard of lumber and the inflation that is kicking up prices. Housing prices are skyrocketing around the country and possible rents will be too. If **X** can pull back to the 180 MA I believe that is a very good level of support to buy at. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8gfx26ocgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1182f1a0fe2cb4c0b178b0c7d12dced37615662\n\n**ArcelorMittal,** together with its subsidiaries, owns and operates steel manufacturing and mining facilities in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Africa. This is another steel and mining play for me. Over the past 10 years August has been the worst month of the year for $**MT**. I'll wait for a dip and hopefully buy mid to long term calls around the strong support, and if that breaks maybe the 180ma.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zj34ylcegva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a5bfcef576a2b806338bcb9c02450be11de0a50\n\n**Vertiv Holdings Co**, together with its subsidiaries, designs, manufactures, and services critical digital infrastructure technologies and life cycle services for data centers, communication networks, and commercial and industrial environments in the Americas, the Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. $**VRT** is essentially a data center and tech infrastructure play that I believe is overbought currently. **VRT** seems to be riding up towards the key resistance that it cant seem to cross, dating back to last year, 2020. I prefer puts here and take profit around the 50ma.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zsypjnrfgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f33a77fe41d1a3e7dbd7dd023eb713799d92c732\n\n $**AI** is a company that, you guessed it, develops AI products. I think the ticker is really, really cool, but that's about it. I believe most of the hype probably comes from that and we can see that it sold off enormously earlier this year. Once it is up to the resistance, let's play puts back down to the big volume shelf that is providing support.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8mcbb9zggva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77e515bbde6d723ae5393c1744951a6cf5198818\n\n $**TNA** is a leveraged 3X ETF that follows the Russell 2000 small cap index. Small caps are more risky that large caps, of course, but usually out perform them as well. I would like to add this to my portfolio, most likely, in September to set up for a run into the holiday months. Shares are fine with me since it is leveraged.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m2yx6z0igva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e335354f9e074313436e30d2ad0e0a28f955aaf\n\n $**BIDU** alert that triggered late Friday. If $**BIDU** continues an upward push, through the support, I'll pick up some calls a couple months out. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lwtjr5njgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bbe7a38958435b63b0b7ceb1e43d8bd514936bd\n\n $**COIN** is my favorite BTC/Crypto stock play. It is the most reliable and regulated crypto exchange in the US. I think all the institutional investors will be using **COIN** for crypto exposure. I also don't think that the stock price should follow that of BTC. Even if BTC is down for the month, there is still selling volume taking place on **Coinbase**, there fore incoming revenue. Overall, I like this stock. If it pulls back to the MA, I think its a good entry and addition to your portfolio if you want crypto exposure.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ymaldxhlgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=289f1e4d9130c1134ea952d51fa06158bd9c0d54\n\n If you are like me and waiting of a bigger pull back/correction before situating your portfolio for a bigger run toward the end of 2021, I'll be taking profits in some of my positions and needing a place to park the money in the interim. I've identified a few that could be good for this. First is **VTV,** Vanguard Value ETF. It is a ETF that is focused on Value stock play and has a Dividend yield of more than 2%. It is usually considered a 'safe' place to park money. Some top holdings include, BERK, JPM, XOM, JNJ, UNH, and PG.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2dcxclpmgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03de8f2f07a832d6042fbbff5c6b5298ad3438b0\n\n Another one is **SCHD**, also has a Dividend yield of over 2%. Some of Schwab Div Yields top holdings are MRK, TXN, HD, PEP, and VZ.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f5o5q8nngva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f597984b4adabd4f6417c313c57576644024f6ee\n\n Another interesting addition to your portfolio could be **XHB**. It is a homebuilders ETF. There has been huge demand for new SF homes in the US, and **XHB** and NAIL have done very well this year with the inflation trade. I don't expect demand to considerably change anytime soon. I always buy on support, so patience is key until **XHB** pulls back a little bit more.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8vck4xogva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9dd3c23232ccdc439a93b7dd9f2d20c7a808955\n\n **DIS** just released Black Widow and did very very well this weekend. Overall I like what the company is doing with **Disney**\\+ and in Shanghai they are raising the ticket prices for the newest Disney theme park. Be careful when buying this for two reasons. One, a lot of good news could already be priced in - and probably is. Two, August through October have been horrible months for **DIS** over the past 10 years. If you are a **DIS** bull, buying on the 180MA is your best bet for now.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6lorao9qgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dc8230c7f288c8d06b14df0d824a8b18bb69346\n\n \n\n**$TASK** provides outsourcing services to Internet companies worldwide. It offers digital customer experience that consists of omni-channel customer care services primarily delivered through digital channels; and other solutions, including customer care services for new product or market launches, trust and safety solutions, and customer acquisition solutions.\n\nAll of the major analysts, except Morgan Stanley have a 'buy' rating for the stock. I personally like their vision and what they are doing. Their IPO wasn't long ago and there isn't much data out so far, however I think there is upside toward $40+. Currently I want to buy commons sub $30 if the opportunity comes, or sell puts if options are enabled on Webull. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8nyyk4gxgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34c0a89f71fe2bc1ecd0fb7aad3ddd8bd81e7574\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Current Weekly Positions\n\n$NAIL \\-6.8% (Ongoing Swing Trade)\n\n$DIDI \\+$550 Sell $10.5p (+45%) (Ongoing)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nDisclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.",

The artificial intelligence controlling the fund believes these stocks will see price declines across the month.\n\nThe standout among the stocks added in July was AMC [**AMC,** **6.37%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AMC?mod=MW_story_quote), the cinema chain that along with GameStop [**GME,** **-4.30%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/GME?mod=MW_story_quote) has epitomized the \u201cmeme stock\u201d trading frenzy in 2021.\n\nA flock of investors, largely organized on social media platform Reddit, helped squeeze hedge funds\u2019 short positions on companies including GameStop and AMC earlier this year. The trading frenzy caused multibillion-dollar losses for hedge funds, unbelievable gains for individuals that timed it right, and ushered in a new era of internet-inspired trading.\n\nAMC\u2019s stock price rose 570% from January 20 to January 27\u2014from nearly $3 a share to almost $20. Shares in the group are now up close to 1,500% so far in 2021, trading around $33.\u00a0\n\nAnd now the AI calling the shots at AMOM thinks the stock will move even higher in July, buying enough shares to make up 1.8% of the fund. Bringing AMC into the fold came as the robot ditched fellow meme stock GameStop, which was added to AMOM in May but booted out after the stock fell more than 14% in June.\n\n\u201cQraft\u2019s AI model is not specifically designed to invest in meme stocks, but rather in stocks with high capital appreciation potential,\u201d Geeseok Oh, a managing director at Qraft and the head of its Asia-Pacific business, told MarketWatch.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAI is not swayed by prejudice or bias and may pick up meme stocks if the momentum seems highly positive,\u201d said Oh. \u201cThis month, our model found AMC more opportunistic than other meme stocks like GameStop.\u201d\n\nThe top five stocks by portfolio weight added to AMOM in July include retailer O\u2019Reilly Auto Parts [**ORLY,** **-0.08%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ORLY?mod=MW_story_quote), software group Cadence Design Systems [**CDNS,** **-0.79%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/CDNS?mod=MW_story_quote), electronics store chain Best Buy [**BBY,** **2.49%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/BBY?mod=MW_story_quote), biotech cancer specialist Seagen [**SGEN,** **-0.03%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/SGEN?mod=MW_story_quote), and enterprise software developer HubSpot [**HUBS,** **0.26%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/HUBS?mod=MW_story_quote).\n\nAfter the fund was rebalanced, AMOM\u2019s five largest holdings by portfolio weight were online dating group Match [**MTCH,** **-0.01%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/MTCH?mod=MW_story_quote), cybersecurity company Fortinet [**FTNT,** **0.88%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/FTNT?mod=MW_story_quote), O\u2019Reilly Auto Parts as well as rival AutoZone [**AZO,** **0.11%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AZO?mod=MW_story_quote), and retailer Kroger [**KR,** **1.11%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/KR?mod=MW_story_quote).\n\n\u201cWith Covid-19 reaching new peaks, the AI made trades related to the pandemic conditions,\u201d Oh said. \u201cMatch Group is one of the beneficiaries of the pandemic with more people trying out online dating. Fortinet stock gained prominence with more and more governments emphasizing the importance of cybersecurity.\u201d\n\nOh also added that it was noteworthy that AMOM has decided to adjust its portfolio away from very big bets\u2014in June, the fund\u2019s top three stocks accounted for 21% of the portfolio, but now the top three stocks account for just 11%.\n\n\u201cGiven the volatile market sentiment, the AI seems to have adjusted portfolio and concentration to hedge against potential risks,\u201d he said.\n\nAMOM has been listed in New York since May 2019, and has delivered total returns of 12% so far in 2021 and 42% in the past year\u2014outpacing its benchmark, the S&amp;P 500 Momentum index, which has climbed a comparable 34% since July 2020.\n\nThe fund is a product of Qraft, a Seoul, South Korea-based fintech group leveraging AI across its investment products, which include three other AI-picked versions of major indexes: a U.S. large cap index [**QRFT,** **-0.52%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/QRFT?mod=MW_story_quote) ; a U.S. large cap dividend index [**HDIV,** **+0.39%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/HDIV?mod=MW_story_quote) ; and a U.S. value index [**NVQ,** **-0.28%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/NVQ?mod=MW_story_quote) NVQ.\n\nAMOM is an actively managed portfolio driven by artificial intelligence, tracking 50 large-cap U.S. stocks and reweighting its holdings each month. It is based on a momentum strategy, with the AI behind its stock picks capitalizing on the movements of existing market trends to inform the decision to add, remove, or reweight holdings. The artificial intelligence scans the market and uses its predictive power to analyze a wide set of patterns that show stock-market momentum.\n\nThe entrance of AI-run funds onto Wall Street promised a new high-tech future for investing, though it hasn\u2019t quite lived up to the hype yet. Theoretically, researchers have shown that AI investing strategies [can beat the market by up to 40% on an annualized basis](https://www.wsj.com/articles/use-ai-for-picking-stocks-not-so-fast-11578279960?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D49189099147164614691798547045511944379%7CMCORGID%3DCB68E4BA55144CAA0A4C98A5%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1621008863&amp;adobe_mc=MCMID%3D25706935534593873851174687596825042056%7CMCORGID%3DCB68E4BA55144CAA0A4C98A5%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1623154286&amp;mod=article_inline), when tested against historical data.\n\nBut Vasant Dhar, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business and the founder of machine-learning-based hedge fund SCT Capital Management, [argued on MarketWatch in June 2020](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/machine-learning-wont-crack-the-stock-market-but-heres-when-investors-should-trust-ai-2020-06-08?mod=article_inline) that AI-run funds won\u2019t \u201ccrack\u201d the code of the stock market.\n\nAdvocating caution, Dhar said that it was difficult for funds underpinned by machine learning to maintain a sustainable edge over markets, which have \u201ca nonstationary and adversarial nature.\u201d He advised investors considering an AI system to ask tough questions, including how likely it is that the AI\u2019s \u201cedge\u201d will persist into the future, and what the inherent uncertainties and range of performance outcomes for the fund are.",

        "selftext": "so micron has a record ER, and guides higher but the market dumps.\n\nAnyone who has held Micron who a couple years knows this story. \n\nFor those who lost their ass on weeklies - this is why I say dont do weeklies on micron. \n\nWhy is it dumping? Partially because of people getting margin called and closing out their weeklies. STOP DOING IT. \n\nSo anyway on to the report:\n\n[https://investors.micron.com/static-files/a62938c1-846b-40e2-b0dc-d5e921c16c7e](https://investors.micron.com/static-files/a62938c1-846b-40e2-b0dc-d5e921c16c7e)\n\n \u25aa Expect CY-21 DRAM industry bit demand growth to be somewhat above 20%, with DRAM industry supply below demand; there is currently unmet demand for DRAM due to end market strength and we expect the DRAM market to remain tight into CY-22 \n\n\u25aa Expect CY-21 NAND industry bit demand growth in the mid 30% range, with NAND supply below demand; we also see the NAND market as tight into CY-22 \n\n\u25aa Long-term DRAM bit demand growth CAGR of mid-to-high teens \n\n\u25aa Long-term NAND bit demand growth CAGR of approximately 30% Micron \n\n\u25aa Targeting to align our long-term bit supply growth CAGR with the industry bit demand growth CAGR across DRAM and NAND \n\n\u25aa CY-21 DRAM and NAND Micron bit supply growth expected to be below industry demand growth \n\n\u25aa Placed orders for multiple EUV tools from ASML as part of long-term agreement \n\n\u25aa FY21 Capex revised to somewhat above $9.5 bn; mostly from areas that don\u2019t impact CY21 and CY22 bit growth such as EUV pre-payments, construction spending and other R&amp;D and corporate items \n\nNow during the call, analysts seemed to really dig in deep into Sanjays comments re purchasers shifting from \"just in time\" models to \"just in case\" models. They think this indicates previous purchases were above actual consumption and intended to raise inventory. As such they expect weakening demand and pricing moving forward. \n\nI disagree with their fears. Sanjay guides in a way so that he can smash at ER. He has done this for Micron and he has done with Sandisk before they got bought out at WDC. Have a look at previous earnings and whether they beat or not. \n\nexpand table to see more dates on links below\n\n[https://www.streetinsider.com/ec\\_earnings.php?q=sndk](https://www.streetinsider.com/ec_earnings.php?q=sndk) (Sanjay for all of it)\n\n[https://www.streetinsider.com/ec\\_earnings.php?sort=earning\\_date&amp;q=mu](https://www.streetinsider.com/ec_earnings.php?sort=earning_date&amp;q=mu) (Sanjay from Q3 2017)\n\nSanjay knows markets dont like surprise, so he guides low. Hes also been in Semi industry forever. Hes not an idiot. So when he says guidance is X, I take guidance to be X + extra for the beat. I dont freaking think I need to discount the guidance because purchasers increasing inventory. Sanjay has priced that shit in. \n\nSo thats inventory and guidance. \n\nWhat about the sale to Texas Instruments? Thats not linked to RAM or NAND really. Kinda but not really. Thats them giving up on (3dx point) Intel Octane. There was no market for it so keeping the plant was costing them 500 mil a year since it was under-utilised. However they kept all the IP from Octane in case it comes back to life later on. Its basically non volatile RAM which can be used as storage - sounds really cool but  I am guessing its expensive AF so people dont want it yet. Again, selling this plant is basically good for micron. We want higher margins to run a slick operation. \n\nI dont really like toms hardware but this article explains the sale the best. Other news stories on it say there was a sale but doesnt really tell you much about about the background.\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/micron-to-sell-3d-xpoint-fab-to-texas-instruments-for-dollar900-million](https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/micron-to-sell-3d-xpoint-fab-to-texas-instruments-for-dollar900-million)\n\nWhat is driving increasing margin? Well Micron is using DUV (deep ultra violet) with computational lithography and multiple masks to achieve smaller resolution on DRAM. Samsung are achieving same resolution with EUV. EUV costs a bunch and ASML are the only supplier. You should probably get into ASML at some point as well WSB but thats a post for another day. As such, Microns margins for latest tech DRAM is way lower than Samsung. SK Hynix is the third player in RAM and they are playing catchup - seem a bit fucked to me personally. Nanya is the 4th player and realllllly small and think they are just screwed. Dont have the money to get into EUV so next few generations, they will be so far behind they just get bought out if any competition regulatory body allows it (at near bankruptcy stage is my guess). \n\nNow Micron is starting to invest in EUV which is good and they have given themselves a lead time for 2 years which feels about right to me. In 2023 we will see if they are still at cutting edge of RAM vs Samsung who will have a 2 year head start into EUV production. This is the only concern to me. In this time, they will gain the benefit of reduced pricing for EUV tech and additional expertise from ASML who will be helping Micron to achieve results. I am hoping they can transplant their specialist know how from DUV to EUV (that everyone else didnt manage to do at this resolution), but at this stage, my science ability is woefully unable to track it meaningfully.\n\nLets look at Microns plan for EUV and the interim releases until then.  \n\n[https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/12/01/micron-dram-node-shrink-roadmap/](https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/12/01/micron-dram-node-shrink-roadmap/)\n\nSo you can see we are currently at 1 alpha node for 10nm in 2021. We have 1 beta and 1 gamma to go planned (still using DUV) before 1 delta which is when EUV should kick in. Thats a new node every year still using DUV. Thats sweet if it works out. In the interim Micron gets to print money like nobodys business (higher margin from DUV) and continue hiring R&amp;D people with EUV knowledge from Korea and Japan. \n\nI have a small long position in micron. I dont really care about short term price movements. I expect this to be higher in 3 to 6 months. Thats what I care about. I expect it to be higher in 12 months. Beyond that I want to see how their 1 beta and 1 gamma nodes are coming along with updates as to 1 delta using EUV. \n\nWe are trading at price levels from Jan/Feb this year. We have had 2 great ERs since then. I dont see TAM in RAM or NAND dropping any time soon or pricing (thesis of tacit collusion as to supply/pricing in oligopolies - we arent cyclical market anymore because 3 market players control like 98% of the DRAM production in the world - its why they are not dumping on capex - its intentional). \n\nthis is good price to buy, but dont expect results in a week or even a month. We might trade sideways for a while. Shake out the paper hands before funds buy back in at discount and ramp up for next ER. You cant time the ramp up, you just have to be in the stock at a decent price (like now) and then wait for it to happen.",

TXN in retrospect looks even worse after AMD and QCOM guided higher and the same is true for PINS in light of SNAP and TWTR's performance.

        "selftext": "#### From Stansberry Research\n\n#### \n\n#### A Three-Pronged Strategy for Accelerated Growth\n\n**inTEST (NYSE American: INTT)** is a global supplier of precision-engineered equipment used to test and manufacture everything from medical devices to cell phones to aircraft.\n\nThe business has two segments: thermal products and electromechanical semiconductor (\"EMS\") products.\n\nThe thermal segment designs and sells equipment used for manufacturing activities, like forming metals with precise heating and or managing extreme temperatures. This equipment is widely used across the automotive, defense, aerospace, energy, industrial, medical, semiconductor, and telecommunications sectors. Now, it's also being used in the fast-growing cannabis industry. (More on that in a minute.)\n\nThe EMS segment designs and sells products used primarily by semiconductor companies to automatically test the chips they manufacture for defects. (Automated test equipment is referred to as \"ATE.\") In addition to selling directly to big, well-known chip manufacturers like Texas Instruments (TXN), inTEST also sells to third-party testing services and ATE original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\") like market leader Teradyne (TER).\n\nIn 2019, inTEST began referring to all the products it sells to semiconductor customers as the \"semi market.\" Everything else \u2013 basically, all non-semi, thermal product sales \u2013 are referred to as \"multimarket.\"\n\nIts largest customers include Analog Devices (ADI), Emerson Electric (EMR), Lockheed Martin (LMT), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Texas Instruments, among others.\n\nLast year, inTEST's board of directors decided it was time for the company to renew its focus on growth. So they hired Richard Grant as CEO. Grant is an outsider who brings many years of executive experience from stints with three global, publicly traded industrial companies: ABB (ABB), former *Extreme Value* winner Ametek (AME), and Emerson Electric.\n\nThe board gave Grant a mandate to drive new and more sustainable long-term growth for inTEST. And last March, he outlined his plan to transform the company, potentially doubling revenue in the process.\n\nUnder Grant's leadership, inTEST will now focus on three strategies to accelerate growth...\n\n**Growth Strategy No. 1: Expand inTEST's Global Footprint**\n\ninTEST provides products and services to customers around the globe, but its manufacturing plants are located entirely in the U.S. Grant says this makes it difficult to succeed in foreign markets, particularly when facing local competitors.\n\nHaving a presence in international markets provides access to lower-cost labor, lower shipping costs, and an improved ability to compete on price. So Grant is determined to expand inTEST's manufacturing footprint. Last month, he announced inTEST's Ambrell business will establish a presence in Mexico for the first time.\n\nAmbrell is part of inTEST's thermal segment. It makes the induction (i.e. precision) heating systems manufacturers rely on to build electric motors. Since a large percentage of electric motors are already manufactured in Mexico, Grant says it makes sense to have a presence there. And General Motors' (GM) recent announcement that it will invest $1 billion to produce electric vehicles (\"EVs\") in the country means the timing couldn't be better.\n\nFirst steps include the addition of a full-time sales representative, an applications engineer dedicated to working with Latin America-based customers, and plans to build an applications lab in Mexico. It's also possible inTEST could acquire another company with a significant footprint in Mexico over the next 12 months to further its presence there.\n\n**Growth Strategy No. 2: Develop New Solutions for New Users**\n\nGrant says inTEST will also grow by developing solutions that are \"new to the company, new to the industry, or new to the world.\" A primary focus of its multimarket segment will be two of the hottest emerging markets in the world right now: EVs and cannabis.\n\nLast month, we recommended [**CTS (NYSE: CTS)**](https://members.stansberryresearch.com/articles/ride-the-ev-wave-with-this-little-known-125-year-old-company) as an excellent way to play the **emerging EV wave**. inTEST gives us good exposure to EVs as well.\n\nCurrently, the EV market is small. Last year, about 2.5 million EVs sold, accounting for just 4% of worldwide auto sales. But consumers are getting more and more comfortable with EVs. And their options are drastically improving, with more than 400 different models expected to launch by 2025. So sales growth is expected to rise rapidly over the next couple decades.\n\nEstimates vary, but a reasonable forecast is that over the next 30 years, the global EV fleet could potentially rise from 10 million units today to 700 million units in 2050. And a lot of them will be manufactured by current EV market leader \u2013 and inTEST customer \u2013 Tesla (TSLA).\n\nTo meet its share of this future demand, Tesla is currently building its fourth EV-manufacturing plant, this one in Berlin. Production is expected to eventually hit 500,000 cars per year. That's more EVs than all other German carmakers *combined* produced in 2020.\n\nBig new Tesla factories are great news for inTEST. The company started working with Tesla early, creating custom thermal solutions for its production of motors, steering columns, and other applications. As Tesla continues to ramp global production (its stated goal is 50% growth per year), it'll need more inTEST equipment.\n\nNow, Grant says inTEST is also leveraging its Tesla expertise to capture opportunities with other EV manufacturers. During the first-quarter 2021 call with analysts in May, he noted that inTEST is receiving \"robust\" orders from other EV makers.\n\nOn the third-quarter 2020 call last November, he highlighted EV orders from a \"large domestic automotive manufacturer\" and the company's first order from an EV truck start-up. Later this year, INTT will also launch a marketing campaign targeted at 300 EV contacts to increase awareness.\n\nThe second emerging market that holds great promise for inTEST is **cannabis**.\n\nTo get a sense for just how promising this market is, here's what cannabis expert Tom Carroll recently told subscribers to his *Cannabis Capitalist* newsletter...\n\n&gt;Overall, the legal cannabis market in the U.S. is still in the early stages... But it has grown immensely in the last five years.  \nThis is a massive, newly legal market \u2013 likely the biggest in a generation.  \nIn 2014, the legal and recreational market totaled about $2 billion. By 2020, total sales grew to $18 billion... a monumental increase. However, by 2025, the market is expected to more than double from 2020, exceeding $40 billion.\n\nKeep in mind, these numbers are just for the U.S. Grandview Research estimates the global cannabis cultivation market was $124 billion in 2019 and will exceed $300 billion by 2027.\n\nThe concentrates segment \u2013 oils extracted from cannabis plants \u2013 is the fastest-growing part of this market. Extracting cannabinoid-containing oil from the rest of the plant requires extreme temperatures that must be precisely controlled throughout the entire process. That just happens to be an area where inTEST shines...\n\ninTEST honed its skills in the thermal-equipment sector by building demanding, customized applications for military, aerospace, and energy customers. Now, it's leveraging that skill set to deliver the highest-quality and fastest extraction times available in the botanical-extraction industry.\n\nFor example, inTEST uses liquid nitrogen chillers that can cool 100 gallons of ethanol (the extraction agent) to an extreme -70\u00b0C in less than 30 minutes. During the third-quarter call, Grant told analysts that chiller bookings and revenues each exceeded $1 million in a quarter for the first time in history.\n\nOn the May call with analysts, Grant said the initiative launched last year to target OEMs in the cannabis space is also bearing fruit. One new OEM has placed a $300,000 order. An existing OEM customer has placed a follow-up order. And inTEST has signed two brand-new OEM customers.\n\ninTEST has also launched a marketing campaign targeted at 800 potential customers across the cannabis industry.\n\n**Growth Strategy No. 3: Grow Through Strategic Acquisitions**\n\ninTEST has only made two acquisitions in the past decade, the last one in 2017. Grant has made it clear that will change on his watch.\n\nDuring the fourth-quarter 2020 call in February, he told analysts that inTEST will aggressively drive merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities moving forward. This includes targeting...\n\n1. \"Bolt on\" deals \u2013 smaller companies in the same line of work as inTEST that expand existing product lines or geographic coverage areas.\n2. Companies that broaden the reach of inTEST's process technology capabilities in areas like medical-device manufacturing or material testing.\n3. Businesses that bring in entirely new customers, such as environmental testing.\n\nEssentially, nothing is off the table here.\n\nAcquisitions for a smaller company like inTEST can dramatically boost investment returns. This was an important attribute of our TFI International recommendation, and it has paid off. As of yesterday's close, we're up 146% on TFII. inTEST has the same kind of potential under Grant's leadership.\n\n#### The Next Cyclical Upturn in Semiconductors Means More Growth for INTT\n\ninTEST's three-pronged growth strategy is largely focused on opportunities in its multimarket segment. But there's a solid growth story underlying the EMS business, too...\n\nThe proliferation of chips in everything from cars to consumer electronics to factories is the driving force behind rising semiconductor demand. This in turn creates demand for the ATE products that inTEST manufactures and sells. Basically, anytime chip manufacturers expand their capacity to meet rising demand, it's good for inTEST's EMS business.\n\nIn its latest annual 10-K filing with the SEC, inTEST says the semiconductor market entered a cyclical downturn in early 2019. But the company now believes the next cyclical upturn has begun\u2026\n\nOn a trailing 12-month basis, inTEST's booking growth rate (semiconductor-related orders placed but not yet executed) confirms this. After turning negative in the first quarter of 2019 (-3%), it didn't return to positive territory until the fourth quarter of 2020 (27%). The booking growth rate for the first quarter of 2021 was even higher (62%).\n\nDue in part to the chip shortage we reported on [last month](https://members.stansberryresearch.com/articles/ride-the-ev-wave-with-this-little-known-125-year-old-company), inTEST customers are in, according to Grant, a \"race to add capacity,\" particularly for the semiconductors used in automobiles and mobile phones.\n\nTexas Instruments is currently building its latest semiconductor foundry (or manufacturing plant) in Texas. Intel (INTC), another inTEST customer, announced a $20 billion investment back in March to expand its chipmaking footprint in Arizona. And Intel's chief rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) \u2013 which accounts for 15% of TER's business and therefore indirectly affects inTEST \u2013 just broke ground on a new Arizona foundry that it says could be the first of six on this site over the next 10 to 15 years.\n\nEarlier this week, the U.S. Senate also passed the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act. If enacted, the legislation commits approximately $50 billion to boosting domestic semiconductor production. The effort to wean America off foreign-made chips has bipartisan support and could become an important new source of growth for inTEST.\n\nThere are other interesting opportunities that could add incremental growth from here, too. For instance, following a long development period, EMS has begun receiving orders from a \"major player in the memory test space.\" And its intelligent test cell system could be a big winner as customers (new and existing) upgrade their older test systems.\n\nNo one, including us, knows how long this new semiconductor cycle upturn, now two quarters long, will last. But with orders on the rise and the recent addition of EMS Vice President and General Manager Joe McManus, inTEST is primed to capitalize on the trend for as long as possible.\n\nGrant hired McManus to run this highly technical business segment largely because of his growth track record. During his seven-year tenure as a sales executive at a small semiconductor business, for instance, McManus reportedly helped grow sales from less than $20 million to more than $65 million.\n\nHis appointment at inTEST appears to be well-timed for the nascent semiconductor cycle upturn.\n\nIn short, inTEST has multiple avenues of growth that are likely to play out over the next few years. Now, let's take a look at the Five Clues...\n\n#### The Five Essential Financial Clues\n\nWe use the [Five Essential Financial Clues](https://members.stansberryresearch.com/articles/financial-clue-video) to help us identify great businesses. A great business doesn't necessarily have all five clues present. But the best ones tend to have more of them than less well-run companies. It would be normal for such a young technology company to not have a single one of the five clues present. But as you'll see, INTT stacks up fairly well, with especially strong performance in free cash flow (\"FCF\") and its balance sheet.\n\n**Gushes Free Cash Flow**\n\nA business's intrinsic value comes from the cash it generates in excess of all taxes, expenses, and reinvesting enough to maintain and grow. That's called FCF. The best businesses tend to generate more cash than they know what to do with.\n\nLike many technology-based businesses today, INTT has a history of generating consistent FCF. (The big drop in 2019 is due to an \"earnout\" payment related to the 2017 acquisition of Ambrell.) Increased capital spending to facilitate new growth \u2013 including investments in newly acquired businesses \u2013 could reduce FCF in the next few years... but we'd consider this simply laying the foundation for larger FCF over the long term.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**Consistent Margins**\n\nIn a capitalist economy, it's normal for competition to winnow profit margins, sometimes down to zero, as companies compete more and more aggressively for market share. A consistent margin is an economic anomaly, sometimes indicating that a business provides goods and service its customers can't get elsewhere.\n\nINTT has a history of consistent (and relatively high) gross margins, a reflection of the fact that its solutions are often highly configured to match unique customer needs and command premium pricing.\n\nHowever, operating, pretax, and net margins are much more susceptible to the boom-and-bust nature of the semiconductor cycle. That's because many of the high fixed costs associated with manufacturing chip equipment (like operating and maintaining the plants) don't go away when sales decline.\n\nAs we noted earlier, the chip cycle turned down in 2019, causing these margins to decline. The good news is the decline is over, and the cycle is turning up. This is when you want to buy cyclical companies.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nWe expect margins to rebound as the post-pandemic recovery gains steam and key markets like cannabis and EVs continue to grow rapidly.\n\n**Strong Balance Sheet**\n\nThere are two kinds of good balance sheets. The first is when a company has more cash than debt. The second is when a company has more debt than cash on hand but earns enough income to cover its debt service obligations.\n\nINTT is the first kind. It has $10.2 million in cash and no debt. This is an ideal setup for financing new acquisitions, allowing plenty of room to borrow for those acquisitions. That is important because it won't need to fundraise by issuing new shares (a move that dilutes current shareholders).\n\nA cash-gushing business with a pristine, debt-free balance sheet is a rare find these days. We believe INTT is ready to make good use of it.\n\n**Shareholder Rewards**\n\nINTT doesn't pay a dividend and management says it doesn't expect to do so \"in the foreseeable future.\" That's not unusual for a small, young company. It simply reflects the fact that INTT is instead plowing its excess cash flows back into the business... for acquisitions or to buy back stock.\n\nMost companies are mediocre share repurchasers, and we haven't seen anything that tells us INTT will do any better. The best we can expect is for this activity to do no harm.\n\nOver time, we've learned one of the benefits of shareholder rewards is that they impose discipline on the management team by limiting the amount of capital available. No company can reinvest unlimited amounts of capital, and capital allocators are only human. A large amount of excess cash on the balance sheet tends to burn a hole in management's pockets. Share repurchases help to prevent the company from spending wastefully.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**Consistent Return on Equity**\n\nIf a business were a bank account, return on equity (\"ROE\") would be the interest rate you'd earn on all the money you left in it.\n\nCyclical companies like inTEST normally experience fluctuating ROE over a full cycle.\n\nAs you can see in the following chart, the strong bounce out of the 2009 chip-cycle low resulted in extraordinary ROE in 2010 and 2011 (higher than 40%). As the cycle matured, ROE fluctuated between 5% and 10% before dipping into negative territory during the latest cycle downturn.\n\nWith the semiconductor cycle once again turning up, inTEST's ROE is also on the rise. As of the first-quarter 2021, it was 5.4% and already above the five-year average of 4.3%. We expect it to move even higher in the quarters ahead.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n#### What's It Worth?\n\nNow let's put our Price Implied Expectations model to work in order to get a handle on INTT's upside potential at its recent share price. We'll start as we typically do with a review of our model's three most important inputs: revenue growth, operating margins, and FCF margins.\n\n**Revenue Growth Expectations**\n\nDespite the strong bounce in INTT's stock over the past year, the current share price implies just 3% average growth beyond 2021. That's too low.\n\nRemember, the semiconductor cycle has just turned up. That means inTEST's EMS revenue will likely ramp higher as chipmakers expand capacity to satisfy growing demand. And these upturns can last years.\n\nThe company's thermal business is also poised to grow sharply as the markets for EVs and cannabis expand.\n\nFactSet reports that the consensus of analysts who cover inTEST is that revenue over the next 12 months (Year 1 of our analysis) will be $80 million. The company doesn't provide a next-12-months revenue forecast. But for the current quarter, it expects to generate between $20 million and $21 million. On an annualized basis, the low end of that range lines up with FactSet's estimate ($20 million x 4 quarters = $80 million). That's a good starting point for Year 1 revenue.\n\nThe FactSet consensus for Year 2 of our analysis translates to 10% revenue growth. That's consistent with the 10% average growth rate inTEST experienced between the last two major chip cycle lows in 2009 and 2019.\n\nBut there are two big differences between the inTEST of today and the inTEST of a few years ago...\n\nIn 2021, the multimarket segment (the one targeting cannabis and EVs) accounted for 46% of total new company orders. In 2015, it accounted for just 28%. This provides much-needed revenue stability compared with the cyclical semiconductor business.\n\nWhen the chip cycle turned down in 2019, inTEST's semiconductor orders declined as much as 45% YOY (on a TTM basis) during the fourth quarter. But multimarket revenue only fell 15% in the same period. Ultimately, this factor alone will help INTT post better-than-10% average revenue growth in the years ahead.\n\nThe second big difference between the inTEST of today and the inTEST of a few years ago relates to acquisitions. Acquisitions only made a limited contribution to the 10% average revenue growth between 2009 and 2019. But as we mentioned earlier, Grant intends to increase M&amp;A activity. We think an incremental average growth of 1% to 2% from acquisitions is reasonable.\n\nIn the final analysis, we expect inTEST's revenue to grow 13% on average over the next five years.\n\n**Operating Margins**\n\nOver the last complete semiconductor cycle (from the low in 2009 to the low in 2019), inTEST's operating margins averaged 8.9%.\n\nLooking ahead, we expect inTEST's average, full-cycle operating margin \u2013 the average margin earned from one cycle low to the next \u2013 to move considerably higher for four reasons...\n\nFirst, diversification away from the chip cycle will reduce the depth of the operating margin decline. During the latest 2019 to 2020 downturn, the operating margin bottomed at -0.3%. That's far better than what happened in 2009 (-18.7%). The difference is primarily related to growth of the multimarket business and greater diversification away from the deeply cyclical semiconductor sector.\n\nSecond, shortly after taking the helm, Grant took steps to consolidate EMS' manufacturing facilities. CFO Hugh T. Regan, Jr. estimates this will result in annual cost savings of $600,000.\n\nAt the same time, EMS sales are rising. Grant says shipments of certain EMS products over the first half of this year are likely to exceed totals for 2019 and 2020 combined. Remember, margins can move sharply higher when sales are strongly rising and fixed costs are declining.\n\nThird, inTEST already has the manufacturing capacity needed to respond to big organic growth opportunities like EVs and cannabis. This means we'll likely see a significant lift to the consolidated operating margin as sales grow faster than fixed costs company-wide.\n\nFourth, Grant is determined to standardize as much of inTEST's manufacturing as possible and considers this a key to expanding margins. The basic idea here is to increase the use of common components across multiple products, which can be bought in larger quantities at lower prices.\n\nIn summary, we expect INTT's operating margin to average 15% in the current cycle \u2013 widely beating the 8.9% from the previous full cycle. Our Year 1 margin forecast is 13.5%, rising gradually to 15% by Year 3.\n\n**Free Cash Flow Margins**\n\ninTEST's full-cycle average FCF margin was 6.1% (2009 to 2019). The factors expected to boost future operating margins should do the same for FCF margins. But the overall impact will likely be somewhat less, given the capital intensity of the business. (As a manufacturer, inTEST must continuously replace and upgrade its stock of capital equipment.)\n\nOver the past 12 months, the FCF margin was 5.4%. We expect it to rise to 7% over the next 12 months (Year 1) and reach a new full-cycle average of 9% by Year 3.\n\n#### Putting It All Together\n\nRunning the numbers just detailed through our valuation model generates an intrinsic value estimate of $26.50 per share. Think of this as the highest price a knowledgeable buyer would pay for the entire business today.\n\nTo test its reasonableness, we look to recent transactions involving similar businesses.\n\nWe usually make comparisons among companies with stabilized or normal levels of EBITDA. But because inTEST's TTM EBITDA ($7 million) is depressed, it's more appropriate to focus on forward estimates of EBITDA.\n\nThe FactSet consensus for the next 12 months of EBITDA is $12 million, which we consider reasonable. This produces an intrinsic value multiple of 23.5 times.\n\nThe best direct comparable is Wise Road Capital's recent deal to acquire Magnachip Semiconductor (MX) for $29 per share. Like INTT, MX is a highly cyclical small-cap company operating in the chip sector. Its TTM EBITDA ($42.5 million) is also coming off a deep cyclical low and is expected to move sharply higher over the next 12 months to $64.5 million. Using the latter figure produces an enterprise value (\"EV\") to EBITDA multiple of 17.3 times.\n\nIt makes sense that INTT commands a higher multiple than MX. Due to the custom nature of its business, inTEST's products command premium pricing, which translates into much higher gross margins, which then translates into higher operating and FCF margins. Historically, inTEST has likewise experienced faster top-line growth across the full cycle.\n\nOver a five-year period, we estimate inTEST's average EBITDA to be $19.4 million. Using this as a proxy for stabilized next-12-months EBITDA produces a multiple of 14.5 times.\n\nNow, let's compare this with Analog Devices' pending purchase of Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), another semiconductor deal which just received full approval from EU regulators and should close soon. The deal's multiple based on the next 12 months of EBITDA is 24 times.\n\nIt makes sense that MXIM commands a higher multiple than inTEST. While MXIM has historically grown revenue at a slower rate, it earns much higher gross, operating, and FCF margins.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nOur intrinsic value estimate of $26.50 is well supported by the available market data.",

Amon has helped spearhead Qualcomm's 5G strategy and global markets. Before working at Qualcomm, Amon was the CTO of V\u00e9sper (wireless operator in Brazil). He also worked for NEC and Velocom. Amon has a good track record. He's been in the industry for a long time while holding multiple leadership roles. Qualcomm might be his biggest leadership role yet. I have no doubt that Cristiano Amon will use his prior knowledge to help guide QCOM into a bright future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\tWe've seen tremendous growth across the semiconductor industry over the past two years. The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Disclaimer:*\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice\\*\\**\n\n*\\*\\*Do your own research\\*\\**",

Wei said the company expects semiconductor supply to\u00a0remain tight into 2022, though it will ramp up production of microcontrollers by close to 60%, which will at least help reduce the chip shortage for its automobile clients, which include the likes of Ford\u00a0 ([**F**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/f)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=F), Tesla\u00a0 ([**TSLA**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/tsla)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=TSLA)\u00a0and others.\n\nRevenue in the current quarter is expected to rise to between $14.6 billion and $14.9 billion, in line with the $14.7 billion average of analyst estimates. TSMC\u2019s 2021 sales outlook is expected to surpass earlier estimates of\u00a020% growth in full-year sales. \n\n That, in turn, is expected to benefit the likes of Apple\u00a0 ([**AAPL**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/aapl)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=AAPL), one of Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s biggest partners, as well as the likes of Nvidia, Applied Materials and AMD, [which could ride the coattails of continued strong semi demand and higher prices](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/chipmakers-taiwan-semiconductor-production-micron-nvidia-amd). \n\n \u201cYou know what is tiresome? The temporary decline of semis for no real reason just causes such angst as opposed to buying,\u201d TheStreet\u2019s Jim Cramer [noted in a recent Real Money column](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/jim-cramer-there-s-no-real-reason-why-the-semi-s-have-declined-15707510?puc=tst_sfi). This fabulous group is a ball of confusion until you look where they come from.\u201d \n\n Indeed, main chip and graphics cards makers as well as other semiconductor producers will continue to benefit from demand, particularly in computers and electronics, which Cramer noted make both semi makers and other peripheral computing equipment makers like Texas Instruments\u00a0 ([**TXN**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/txn)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=TXN), Analog Devices\u00a0 ([**ADI**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/adi)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=ADI), Broadcom\u00a0 ([**AVGO**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/avgo)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=AVGO)\u00a0and Marvell Tech\u00a0 ([**MRVL**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/mrvl)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=MRVL)\u00a0strong potential growth candidates.\n\nAnd not just lack of supply: Nvidia, which has been pegged a cryptocurrency play due its graphics cards being the equipment of choice for mining Ethereum, longer-term demand for advanced gaming, graphics and \"gamification\" of real-life applications used by consumers and businesses [make Nvidia an undervalued play](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/jim-cramer-what-q2-s-strongest-stocks-tell-us-about-this-bull-market-15702829), Cramer said.\u00a0\n\n\"Only one stock could possibly be called a perennial and that's the first and most obvious one, Nvidia, the artificial intelligence gaming platform company, two of the multiple ways I could have chosen to describe it.\"\n\nSeparately, Mizuho Securities on Thursday raised its one-year price target on Nvidia to $900 from $710.
