        "selftext": "Dell has earnings on the morning of Tuesday November 24th. Dell is a computer manufacturer along with other technology such as projectors, notebooks, printers, and headphones. You know what this means, at home working. Along with this part of business, it has a CLOUD portion. Yes this boomer stonk has a cloud business by the name of VMW. This allows them not only to sell computers but have a steady cloud business. VMW ware has shown consistent growth, with an average of 12ish % yoy. Cloud has obvious boomed during Covid-19, so you can assume VMW will have great returns this earnings. In addition for VMW, it has partnered with NVDA to make AI chips better.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vmware-nvidia-partner-ai-chips-120728435.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vmware-nvidia-partner-ai-chips-120728435.html)\n\nNow the PC  sales will be fantastic as shown CSCO, LOGI, and Target. If you did not know all of these companies massively beat earnings. All of them sell computers, headphones, etc. Target is a massive provider for Dell's computers. \n\nNow I know some people will say Dell = Apple! It will miss!\n\nBut, Dell does not sell Iphones and laptops just for money. In addition, Dell is cheaper than Apple. Why would you spend 2k for a new laptop when you have a old one? With Dell, laptops can be under 1000 dollars, and people would want to upgrade for better ones/\n\nThey have a 3 sections.\n\nVMW and computer which I covered but they have storage portion too.\n\nI believe that because school came back, many people brought Dell computers and products for stay-at-home. In addition to VMW and storage revenue. Dell's earnings estimates have barely moved since Q2 and it provides for a great beat.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pc-sales-continue-benefiting-covid-102110153.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pc-sales-continue-benefiting-covid-102110153.html)\n\nAlso NVDA and AMD's new CPU's and GPU's are in Dell's products. If you wanted a new rtx 3070 or rtx 3080, or rtx 3090, you can buy it in a Dell PC. If you just look at AMD's and NVDA's sales you can tell there is great demand for their chips.\n\nNow onto technicals, Dell broke their march uptrend line but has bounced off the lows and created a new uptrend. It is just below ATH which it failed to break 3 months ago. If earnings beats, it could fucking moon 10% or more. Keep in mind that Dell has gone up on past 3-4 earnings.\n\nNow Dell's IV is low , with just 47%. So you will not get IV crushed that badly. Also, it is not a volatile stock, and max moves down are rarely greater than 4%\n\nAlso there has been lots of buying for Dell calls, on Friday 1750 12/18c were traded\n\nYou want links? here you go\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508481/alienware-rtx-3080-3090-aurora-r11-r10-area-51-monitor-360hz](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508481/alienware-rtx-3080-3090-aurora-r11-r10-area-51-monitor-360hz)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2020/07/10/pc-sales-surge-during-coronavirus-crisisand-hps-the-big-winner/?sh=654c20455227](https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2020/07/10/pc-sales-surge-during-coronavirus-crisisand-hps-the-big-winner/?sh=654c20455227)\n\n[https://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/news/pc-sales-climb-as-covid-19-pandemic-keeps-consumers-at-home-idc-gartner-2261022](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/news/pc-sales-climb-as-covid-19-pandemic-keeps-consumers-at-home-idc-gartner-2261022)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/target-earnings-beat-expectations-11605699139#:\\~:text=Target%20reported%20TKTK&amp;text=Revenue%20of%20%2422.63%20billion%20was,FactSet%20consensus%20of%20%2420.77%20billion.&amp;text=Comparable%20sales%20jumped%2020.7%25%20with,sales%20were%20filled%20by%20stores](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/target-earnings-beat-expectations-11605699139#:~:text=Target%20reported%20TKTK&amp;text=Revenue%20of%20%2422.63%20billion%20was,FactSet%20consensus%20of%20%2420.77%20billion.&amp;text=Comparable%20sales%20jumped%2020.7%25%20with,sales%20were%20filled%20by%20stores).\n\nTLDR: Buy Dell because it's fucking mooning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n12/18 68c and 12/18 70c",

        "selftext": "TLDR: TSLA 12/18 1000C (as soon they become available\\*)\n\nHow many of you retards know that Cisco was once the ***world's most valuable company***? I was reading about the .com bubble, and couldn't believe it. 500 billion market cap back in ancient 2000. The only time I even think of Cisco is when their shit don't work and I'm trying to fix the fucking wifi. \n\nThis got me all excited and hard. If boring old boomers back then pumped fucking Cisco up to the moon when: \n\n* interest rates were fucking 6%\n* you had to pay $20 to call your broker on a landline to place an order for some Coca-Cola stock.\n* no one knew what options were and even if you did they cost $100 each\n* the Fed was stuck using medieval printing presses and actually cared about the value of the dollar\n* autists and retards had to met up at the mental hospital instead of WSB\n\nIf grandpa could do that, just fucking imagine what we can do today with TSLA. This SPY inclusion is the perfect catalyst. \n\nNow, S&amp;P announced on 11/16 that they were gonna buy $50 billion of TSLA, for a 1% weight. BUT the price has gone up 50% since then. The index is market cap weighted, so now they need 1.5% of their index to be TSLA. Which means that they need to buy *even more shares* TSLA, at *even higher prices* on inclusion day. This is a viscous cycle. \n\n* The higher the price of TSLA goes, the greater index weight TSLA needs to have.\n* The greater the index weight, the more shares S&amp;P needs to buy.\n* The more shares S&amp;P needs to buy, the more more the prices goes up. \n* The more the price goes up, the greater index weight TSLA needs to have.\n\nI'm no math major, **but this seems like one of those limit problems I did back in pre-cal. The limit as TSLA approaches infinity is S&amp;P selling everything and being a 100% TSLA index.** Of course, I feel the NYSE code monkeys haven't considered integer overflow errors when dealing with stock prices greater than 2\\^32, so there may be some volatility due to computer glitches and whatnot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What are the risks?**\n\nOnly one risk: \n\n**S&amp;P realizes they're dealing with retards and changes the name of their index to S&amp;P499**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: what happens after singularity?\n\nOnce we get to inclusion day, it's time to sell. The price isn't going any higher because the numbers on the NYSE can't go any higher, and the index funds are all broke from buying TSLA. As TSLA prices fall, they're gonna sell TSLA too since the index weight dropped. Viola, we now have another viscous cycle post-inclusion. All these 100% TSLA index funds will start offloading their shares, so basically you need to dump TSLA faster than you dump a whore after post-nut clarity. \n\nTLDR: TSLA 12/18 1000C (as soon they become available\\*). Sell and switch to puts after TSLA causes integer overflow errors.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 9th, 2020.\n\n# **After sharp bounce, market may take a \u2018breather\u2019 on lingering election uncertainty, virus outbreak  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/06/after-sharp-bounce-market-may-take-a-breather-on-lingering-election-uncertainty-virus-outbreak.html)**\n*****\n&gt; After an initially exuberant election reaction, stocks may trade more cautiously in the week ahead, as investors watch election developments unfold and track the course of the coronavirus. \n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up more than 7.3% in the past week, at 3,509, and the Nasdaq rose 9%, the best weekly performance since April. Stocks slid Friday, but technology, communications services, health care and discretionary stocks had the biggest gains for the week, after it appeared Democrat Joe Biden could be the next president but with a split Congress.\n*****\n&gt; The election was still unresolved heading into the weekend, but even if Biden is declared winner, close votes and lawsuits are likely to result in recounts. The Senate appeared to be in Republican hands, but the margin of control is likely to be tight, and runoff elections are required for two Senate seats in Georgia in early January.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the uncertainty is going to catch up the market on a short-term basis,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, BNY Mellon\u2019s Wealth Management chief investment officer. \u201cPerhaps next week could be a drifting lower kind of week.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ahead of the election, the market had been betting on a \u201cblue wave,\u201d where Biden would take the White House and Democrats would get control of the Senate, giving them total control of Congress. But when it appeared the Senate would stay in Republican hands, stocks surged on the idea of gridlock, which would keep Biden from implementing tax increases and lots of new regulations.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, there has been a surge in daily new coronavirus cases to more than 122,000. Economists are concerned that the economic recovery could suffer as some states could restrict activities and consumers may pull back heading into the important holiday season.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed, in its post-meeting statement Thursday, repeated that the course of the virus could help determine the path of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; There are a few economic reports in the week ahead, including consumer price index inflation data Thursday and the producer price index Friday. More than a dozen Fed officials are on the speaking circuit, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who speaks Thursday on central banking at a European Central Bank forum.\n*****\n&gt; The earnings season is beginning to slow down, but there are still dozens of reports, including from McDonald\u2019s on Monday and Walt Disney, Applied Materials and Cisco on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is just setting up to be a breather. There\u2019s still a lot to figure out here,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cThe equity market\u2019s reaction has been I think understandable and probably better than many might have expected.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said there may be uncertainty for awhile. \u201cWhat I\u2019m thinking about is the Senate races. Part of the market reaction has been relying on this divided government.\u201d After the votes are all in or recounted, \u201ca sweep is unlikely but possible.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the longer this stays uncertain and messy, the more the post-election bounce comes into question,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Different than 2000\n&gt; It would not be unusual for the stock market to sell off before rallying into year end, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall does not expect the type of turbulence there was in 2000, when former Vice President Al Gore lost to George W. Bush in a tight race that ultimately went to the Supreme Court.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn 2000, they were not expecting hanging chads. But they do expect a contested election this time. I think in many ways the market anticipated this,\u201d said Stovall.\n*****\n&gt; But the market, after its election week surge, could pull back. \u201cHistorically, the market goes down in the month of November, after a Democratic victory,\u201d said Stovall. Since World War II, Democrats won the White House nine times, and the market fell an average of 0.5% in November in those years, compared to the average gain for all Novembers of 1.4%, he said.\n*****\n&gt; After those Democratic victories, stocks then rose 1.9% in December on average, more than the normal 1.5% gain for all Decembers.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said they currently do not expect the kind of lockdowns that states ordered when the pandemic started to spread in March. But there could still be some impact that could be negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said he sees some signs of optimism for the market. Strong data, like third quarter GDP, October\u2019s drop in unemployment to 6.9%, and the better-than-expected earnings are all positives for the market. Another is that investors are so skeptical.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat does still exist is a great deal of dry powder. There\u2019s $4.3 trillion in money markets alone,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you, being in touch with investors of all shapes and sizes this week, there\u2019s still a lot of skepticism. From a contrarian view, high cash and a lot of skepticism is a contrarian indicator.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/WUlRQfd.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/FWN82Hs.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ZnTzBNz.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/g52vqsv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OiPuXi8.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lA86Kou.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xmtVSEB.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RRxlWej.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/W80POso.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eGUQXgr.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yoHWfIC.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hQyweyw.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Presidential Election Anticipation Is Keeping Us Waiting\n\n&gt; While we all anxiously await the final count and outcome of the U.S. Presidential Election, here are some possible scenarios for 2021. Our analysis here is based on historical market performance during the most likely political alignments for next year. We ran these likely scenarios through the Almanac database software to create this graph.\n\n&gt; We are either going to have the fifth year of a two-term republican president or a first year of a new democratic presidency. It appears the democrats will hold the house and the republicans will hold the senate, but that is not a forgone conclusion either. So we also examined both presidential outcomes with a democratic, republican and split congress.\n\n&gt; Our study uses the S&amp;P 500 from 1949 to 2017. We start in 1949 because it is the first full 4-Year Presidential Stock Market Cycle since the end of WWII. The Twenty-Second Amendment that implemented presidential term limits for a max of two terms or eight years was ratified on February 27, 1951. Truman in 1949 was excluded as there was a no change of party in the White House. We gave Bush 41 the same treatment.\n\n&gt; Admittedly, there are limited data points; four each of fifth year republicans and first year democrats. Here\u2019s what we found. A change in party with a new, first year democratic president came with democratic control of Congress and significantly higher performance for the S&amp;P 500, averaging 10.6% with a median gain of 15.1% versus 7.0% for the average post-election year since 1949.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a89421df75f426e1b1ff90cb2c29cb90/b63e1cf962f89fdb-a3/s400x600/f9bde99a9e4ba83b0df266a8d3cc04cd732cc58f.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Fifth year republican presidents in 1957 (Eisenhower) and 1973 (Nixon) had to work with democratically controlled Congresses and the market suffered significant losses. The market did well in Reagan\u2019s fifth year with a split Congress \u2013 a testament to how \u201cThe Great Communicator\u201d was able to work across the aisle with then Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill. Even with republican control of Congress under Bush 43\u2019s fifth year, the market had a tough year with ongoing issues in Iraq, North Korea declaring it\u2019s a nuclear power and the most active and second costliest hurricane season on record.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Job Growth Continues as COVID-19 Cases Rise\n\n&gt; The US labor market shrugged off election uncertainty and continued to add jobs in October. Despite the waning effects of fiscal stimulus and rising COVID-19 cases, per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added 638,000 jobs, ahead of Bloomberg survey estimates calling for 580,000. The headline number was depressed by a 268,000 drop in government employment, including 147,000 temporary census workers. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell from 7.9% to 6.9% despite a rise in the labor force participation rate, a reversal of the dynamic we saw in September when unemployment fell while the labor force participation also declined.\n\n&gt; However, a troubling trend remains beneath the surface. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the number of long-term unemployed\u2014those out of work for 27 weeks or longer\u2014continues to rise as a share of the total unemployed:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11.6.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWhile the labor market has continued to show improvement, there are still many people out there who are having a hard time getting back to work,\u201d noted LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWith total jobs in the US around 10 million below pre-pandemic levels and rising COVID-19 cases, there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement despite the declining unemployment rate.\u201d\n\n&gt; COVID-19 cases in the United States have reached record highs with a weekly trend growth rate above 20%, according to the COVID Tracking Project. As the weather cools and more activity shifts indoors, additional restrictions to limit the spread of the virus could slow the fragile labor market recovery.\n\n&gt; In particular, much of the private sector gains in this month\u2019s jobs report were in the services sector, where previous jobs reports had shown strength in goods-oriented industries. Many countries in Europe have reinstated restrictions or even gone as far as implementing new lockdowns. While we don\u2019t expect lockdowns in the United States like we saw in March, restrictions on activity could limit future job gains.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One Sentiment Survey Soars While Another Sinks\n\n&gt; In an earlier post, we discussed how bullish sentiment in the AAII survey has been on the rise, but looking at another weekly sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence, the opposite is true. The percentage of respondents reporting as bullish fell sharply this week, 7 percentage points, down to 53.6%. While a majority are still optimistic and that reading is in the middle of its range, that was the largest weekly decline since a 7.4 percentage point decline to 41.7% in the first week of March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, the percentage of newsletter writers that are \"looking for a correction\" rose sharply to 25.8% this week following last week's over 5% decline for the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Correction.png))**\n\n&gt; The Investors Intelligence survey has a long history dating back to 1963, and in all weeks in that time, only 5% (174 weeks) have seen bullish sentiment fall 5 percentage points or more while the percentage of respondents looking for a correction has risen at least 5 percentage points in the same week. In the chart below, we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 following these past occurrences when there has not been another in the prior 3 months. The S&amp;P 500 has frequently been higher over the following weeks and months, but there is a slight underperformance relative to all periods since 1963 when the survey begins.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Performance.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2 Post-Election Charts You Need to See\n\n&gt; The election is over, but the questions are mounting. We don\u2019t know who will be the next president as of Wednesday morning, but we do know that stocks tend to do well the final two months of an election year. \u201cOnce the uncertainty is over, stocks tend to rally in November and December, with November the best month of the year during an election year,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOf course, 2020 isn\u2019t like any other year, and we still could be a ways away from who the winner will be.\u201d\n\n&gt; The LPL Chart of the Day shows that the S&amp;P 500 Index tends to do very well the final two months of the year, especially during election years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The modern design of the S&amp;P 500 stock index was first launched in 1957. Performance back to 1928 incorporates the performance of predecessor index, the S&amp;P 90\n\n&gt; One of the big takeaways so far from Tuesday night is that the Senate likely will stay Republican, meaning we may have a divided Congress. The chances of higher taxes and more regulation likely took a hit under this scenario. This could be a nice tailwind for stocks, as the S&amp;P 500 historically has done quite well under a divided Congress, up more than 17% on average. Additionally, in years with a divided Congress, stocks have been higher the past 10 times, with 2020 potentially being the 11th in a row.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-2-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; This election is far from over, so stay tuned to LPL Research as we continue to monitor things!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Emerging Markets Cheering a Potential Biden Win\n\n&gt; The US equity market has seen a massive rally in reaction to what is looking like a Biden victory over President Trump coupled with the Republican party maintianing its majority in the US Senate. None of these results are official at this point, so they are subject to change, but these are the most likely scenarios as of now. Outside of the US, emerging markets have also rallied. In just the last two days, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF (EEM) has rallied 5% and broken above resistance to new 52-week highs. If for no other reason then Biden's campaign slogan isn't America First, the rationale behind the rally makes some sense.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-Now.png))**\n\n&gt; The reaction of EEM in the aftermath of this election is very much different from what happened in 2016. Heading into the 2016 election, EEM had been trending higher, but pulled back in the days leading up to the election and broke its uptrend that had been in place since earlier in the year. Again, Trump's America First approach was understandably viewed as a headwind to emerging market equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-labels.png))**\n\n&gt; While the initial reaction of EEM to Trump's election was negative, that weakness didn't last long. The chart below shows the performance of EEM in the two months before and one year after the 2016 election. The gray box represents the same period shown in the chart above. Within days after breaking its uptrend after the 2016 election, EEM bounced back, rallied to its 50-DMA, tested its November low, and then in the early days of 2017 it was off to the races as EEM. In fact, even accounting for the post-Election Day declines, one year after the 2016 election, EEM was up 25% which was actually more than the 21% return for the S&amp;P 500! The moral of the story here is that first reactions aren't always the right reactions, and as an investor it's not just imperative to know the environment you are operating in, but also when the tides are turning.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-2017.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Winners and Losers During Trump's Presidency\n\n&gt; With Election Day upon us, below we take a look at the biggest winners and losers across financial markets during the Trump Presidency from Election Day 2016 through today. First off, below is a chart of the market cap of the Russell 3,000 since Election Day 2000 which George W. Bush eventually won. The Russell 3,000 makes up more than 98% of the total US equity market cap, so it's a good gauge to use for measuring the overall change in market cap levels. The current market cap of the Russell 1000 is just north of $35 trillion, which is up $11.5 trillion since Election Day 2016. President Obama oversaw US market cap growth of $12.3 trillion over his two terms, while President Bush actually saw market cap decline by $4.1 trillion after his two terms.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/mktcap.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a look at the total return of various asset classes since Election Day 2016 using key ETFs listed on US exchanges. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is up 70.6% since Trump was elected, while the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) more than doubled that at +144.3%. Of the broad index ETFs in the matrix, the Smallcap Value ETF (IJS) is up the least since Election Day 2016 at just +17.2%.\n\n&gt; Looking at US sector ETFs, the Energy sector (XLE) is a huge outlier with a decline of 48.3% since Trump was elected. Technology (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) are up the most with gains of 154% and 97%, respectively.\n\n&gt; Along with Energy stocks, the oil (USO) and natural gas (UNG) ETFs have been more than cut in half since 11/8/16, while gold (GLD) is up 47% and silver is up 29.5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/assetclass1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Not every country has seen stock market gains since Trump was elected. As shown below, Mexico (EWW) is down 28.5%, Brazil (EWZ) is down 19.4%, Spain (EWP) is down 6.8%, and the UK (EWU) is just slightly in the red.\n\n&gt; The US (SPY) is up more than any other country with a gain of 70.6%, while China (ASHR) is up the second most at +51%. Whatever happened with the trade war certainly didn't hurt the US and China versus the rest of the world on a relative basis.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/countryreturns1103.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/sectors1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Within the Russell 1,000 in its current form, there are nine stocks that are up 1,000% or more since Election Day 2016, with Enphase Energy (ENPH) at the top with a gain of 8,590%. Trade Desk (TTD) is up the second most at +2,448%, followed by Novocure (NVCR), SolarEdge Tech (SEDG), and Quidel (QDEL). Square (SQ) ranks sixth with a gain of 1,203%. Other notables on the list of big winners since Trump was elected include Etsy (ETSY), Teladoc (TDOC), Tesla (TSLA), NVIDIA (NVDA), Atlassian (TEAM), Boston Beer (SAM), and Lululemon (LULU).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-since-2016.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of market cap gains for individual stocks, the numbers below are quite eye-popping. Apple (AAPL) has gained the most in market cap since Trump was elected with an increase of $1.257 trillion! Amazingly, both Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have added more than $1 trillion in market cap as well. Prior to the last few years, no company was even close to having a $1 trillion market cap, but at this point, AAPL, AMZN, and MSFT have gained that much in the last four years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/capuse.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 6th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ5sT7SXYTk))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.8.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/gziesWx.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Yme9cXS.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/a6Kp4iF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XOR4bP6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TfDOPZJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/OsrCLIc.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/N7Ibl9s.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/y4tBaZw.png))\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wVnvQZH.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9PnmIUs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uoiA0Bw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",

        "selftext": "**US equities mostly lower: Dow (0.45%), S&amp;P 500 (0.34%), Nasdaq +0.07%, Russell 2000 (0.45%)**\n\n* US equities mostly lower in Thursday midday trading after putting in a mixed performance in prior session. Value underperforming growth for a second straight session following big pro-cyclical rotation early in the week. Financials, energy, materials among the worst performers. Comm services, tech, healthcare outperforming. Treasuries stronger with the curve bull flattening. Dollar weaker vs yen and euro but firmer vs sterling. Gold up 0.9%. WTI up 0.7%.\n* **No big directional drives in play thus far today**. Path of least resistance has recently been higher on vaccine optimism, removal of election overhang, continued monetary policy tailwind and earnings resilience. Key areas of concern revolve around worsening coronavirus trends and the potential for a scaled-down stimulus package. Much of the focus over the last few days has been on what is going on below the surface in terms of a rotation from growth and momentum to value and cyclicals. A number of strategists have said rotation has more room to run but some have questioned sustainability, highlighting lack of traction behind prior moves.\n* **Resurgent coronavirus cases, an increase in hospitalizations and new restrictions continue to dominate the headlines**. However, new wave may be cresting in European hot spots. Vaccine optimism still elevated with MRNA-US completing case accrual for interim analysis. **Politics the other big story** **though market implications limited for now**. Trump campaign trying to block certification of Biden victory in key states but reports noted the futility of these legal challenges. Biden named longtime advisor Ron Klain as chief of staff, as widely expected. Also reassured allies on regional security in calls with leaders of Japan, South Korea and Australia. On the economic front, **weekly initial and continuing jobless claims lower** than consensus and **October CPI lighter** on both headline and core readings.\n* Not much corporate news though tonight brings first batch of higher-profile Oct Q reporters with **CSCO-US** and **NTAP-US** . **DIS-US** also reports after the close. Focus next week will be on the retailers, which should provide more insight into the consumer resilience theme. **VRM-US** , **ENR-US** , **SBH-US** , **GOCO-US** and **GDRX-US** the notable post-earnings decliners today. **FOSL-US** , **IGT-US** , **HI-US** , **TTEK-US** and **SDGR-US** the standouts. **LUV-US** said it has seen a deceleration in improving trends that could be partly related to resurgent coronavirus cases. **UTZ-US** to acquire On The Border tortilla chips for $480M.\n\n**Notable Gainers:**\n\n* \\+27.7% **FOSL-US** (Fossil): Q3 EPS positive though revenue lower y/y; cash position better, debt lower than previously announced levels in July; management said while it expects COVID to impact Q4 sales, highlighted ecomm strength.\n* \\+7.5% **SDGR-US** (Schr\u00f6dinger): Q3 earnings and revenue beat; highlighted strength in Software in both life sciences and materials segments (though some y/y weakness in drug discovery revenue); said do not expect a long-term impact from pandemic.\n* \\+4.4% **MRNA-US** (Moderna, Inc.): Completed case accrual for the first interim analysis of phase three trial of coronavirus vaccine candidate and with increased case identification over the past week it will include well more than the minimum case number; Dr Fauci, director of NIAID, has recently speculated the Moderna vaccine could be as effective as the candidate from PFE-US and BNTX-US .\n* \\+4.1% **IGT-US** (International Game Technology Plc): Q3 earnings and revenue beat; highlighted strongest Lottery comps in seven quarters (NA a bright spot); noted some positive sequential trends in Global Gaming as casinos reopen and installed base gradually reactivated.\n* \\+3.4% **TTEK-US** (Tetra Tech): FQ4 earnings beat with revenue and guidance mostly in line to stronger; analysts noted record order backlog, strong EBIT margins across segments on upmarket demand and strong execution, continued strength in government business.\n* \\+2.9% **HI-US** (Hillenbrand): FQ4 earnings and revenue missed; highlighted boost from Milacron acquisition and said Batesville remaining unseasonably strong; engineered plastics a bright spot, driving y/y backlog improvement; next-Q EPS guide above the Street.\n* \\+2.2% **NOW-US** (ServiceNow): Upgraded to overweight from equal weight at Morgan Stanley; sees Workflow Automation platform as a beneficiary of Covid-related work from home trends, expects strong growth and better margins; raised price target.\n* \\+1.7% **SMG-US** (Scotts Miracle-Gro): Upgraded to buy from hold at Berenberg; cited record growth across both segments on strong consumer and professional demand; also noted upside from recent election results that could lead to more cannabis legislation in the near-term.\n\n**Notable Decliners:**\n\n* \\-17.4% **GOCO-US** (GoHealth, Inc.): Q3 earnings beat but revenue missed, guidance in line on revenue and ahead for earnings; analysts noted large mix shift away from commission revenue has created confusion, competitors have raised FY guidance on strong start to AEP while GoHealth did not; management said focus shift towards enterprise revenue is a sustainable driver of earnings.\n* \\-11.1% **ENR-US** (Energizer Holdings): FQ4 earnings and revenue beat though GM light; Covid costs higher than expected; midpoint of FY21 EPS guide a bit below the Street; withdrew pre-pandemic 2022 targets; announced COO LaVigne to replace retiring CEO Hoskins on 1-Jan.\n* \\-9.3% **VRM-US** (Vroom): Q3 revenue, EBITDA, EPS beat;

comps light across both segments; flagged slower recovery from elements of full-service business and loss of professional sales amid CA salon shutdowns.\n* \\-5.3% **FOXA-US** (Fox Corporation): Axios reported Donald Trump looking to start a digital media offering to compete with Fox News; could be available on a monthly subscription basis; Trump tweeted today that Fox forgot in 2020 what made them successful in 2016.\n* \\-4.9% **GDRX-US** (GoodRx): Q3 EPS and revenue beat; noted higher cost of revenue driven by customer-support expenses and more online provider visits; Q4 and FY guidance a bit better than the Street; analysts flagged Covid impacts on core business.\n* \\-3.3% **MTOR-US** (Meritor): FQ4 earnings and revenue beat; noted lower y/y volumes and decreased demand in Commercial Truck; Aftermarket and Industrial sales weaker than consensus; FY guidance below the Street; approved plant closures as part of restructuring plan.\n* \\-1.1% **LUV-US** (Southwest Air): Company said revenue trends decelerated for November and December, though unclear whether softness directly due to rise in COVID-19 cases; currently estimates Jan-21 capacity to decrease by 35-40% y/y, little changed from Q4 levels.\n\n10:35:17 AM CST on 12 Nov '20",

The best performing sector was Energy(+3.64%) while Information Technology(+0.85%)was the worst performer.\n* Unlike yesterday, investors were more sanguine about the record number of U.S. coronavirus cases despite the lack of progress towards a stimulus deal and renewed restrictions from cities and states. Presumably, they remained assured that the rough road ahead will smooth itself out in 2021 because of a widespread vaccine and eventual stimulus. \n* This economic optimism was mainly manifested in equities since oil prices ($40.12/bbl, -0.96, -2.3%) settled lower by 2%, gold futures ($1886.80/ozt, +11.30, +0.7%) settled higher, and U.S. Treasuries traded relatively unchanged all session. \n* Looking ahead, investors will receive the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for November on Monday.\n*  \n## Index Summary\n **S&amp;P 500 :** (+1.38%); **NasDaq :** (+0.89%); \\\n**Russell 2000 :** (+2.07%); **Dow :** (+1.41%); \\\n**Vix :** 25.35 (-8.88%); [-7.08%]; {-37.79%} \n## Sectors Summary \n_Three highest sectors for today were -_ \n **Energy:** (+3.64%); **Real Estate:** (+2.29%); **Industrials:** (+2.22%)\n _Three lowest sectors for today were -_\n **Information Technology:** (+0.85%); **Utilities:** (+0.99%); **Health Care:** (+1.26%)\n ## Commodities/Futures \\\n_**Top 5 Highest Commodity % Changes \u2013 -**_ \\\n\n1\\.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 9th, 2020.\n\n# **After sharp bounce, market may take a \u2018breather\u2019 on lingering election uncertainty, virus outbreak  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/06/after-sharp-bounce-market-may-take-a-breather-on-lingering-election-uncertainty-virus-outbreak.html)**\n*****\n&gt; After an initially exuberant election reaction, stocks may trade more cautiously in the week ahead, as investors watch election developments unfold and track the course of the coronavirus. \n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up more than 7.3% in the past week, at 3,509, and the Nasdaq rose 9%, the best weekly performance since April. Stocks slid Friday, but technology, communications services, health care and discretionary stocks had the biggest gains for the week, after it appeared Democrat Joe Biden could be the next president but with a split Congress.\n*****\n&gt; The election was still unresolved heading into the weekend, but even if Biden is declared winner, close votes and lawsuits are likely to result in recounts. The Senate appeared to be in Republican hands, but the margin of control is likely to be tight, and runoff elections are required for two Senate seats in Georgia in early January.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the uncertainty is going to catch up the market on a short-term basis,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, BNY Mellon\u2019s Wealth Management chief investment officer. \u201cPerhaps next week could be a drifting lower kind of week.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ahead of the election, the market had been betting on a \u201cblue wave,\u201d where Biden would take the White House and Democrats would get control of the Senate, giving them total control of Congress. But when it appeared the Senate would stay in Republican hands, stocks surged on the idea of gridlock, which would keep Biden from implementing tax increases and lots of new regulations.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, there has been a surge in daily new coronavirus cases to more than 122,000. Economists are concerned that the economic recovery could suffer as some states could restrict activities and consumers may pull back heading into the important holiday season.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed, in its post-meeting statement Thursday, repeated that the course of the virus could help determine the path of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; There are a few economic reports in the week ahead, including consumer price index inflation data Thursday and the producer price index Friday. More than a dozen Fed officials are on the speaking circuit, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who speaks Thursday on central banking at a European Central Bank forum.\n*****\n&gt; The earnings season is beginning to slow down, but there are still dozens of reports, including from McDonald\u2019s on Monday and Walt Disney, Applied Materials and Cisco on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is just setting up to be a breather. There\u2019s still a lot to figure out here,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cThe equity market\u2019s reaction has been I think understandable and probably better than many might have expected.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said there may be uncertainty for awhile. \u201cWhat I\u2019m thinking about is the Senate races. Part of the market reaction has been relying on this divided government.\u201d After the votes are all in or recounted, \u201ca sweep is unlikely but possible.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the longer this stays uncertain and messy, the more the post-election bounce comes into question,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Different than 2000\n&gt; It would not be unusual for the stock market to sell off before rallying into year end, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall does not expect the type of turbulence there was in 2000, when former Vice President Al Gore lost to George W. Bush in a tight race that ultimately went to the Supreme Court.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn 2000, they were not expecting hanging chads. But they do expect a contested election this time. I think in many ways the market anticipated this,\u201d said Stovall.\n*****\n&gt; But the market, after its election week surge, could pull back. \u201cHistorically, the market goes down in the month of November, after a Democratic victory,\u201d said Stovall. Since World War II, Democrats won the White House nine times, and the market fell an average of 0.5% in November in those years, compared to the average gain for all Novembers of 1.4%, he said.\n*****\n&gt; After those Democratic victories, stocks then rose 1.9% in December on average, more than the normal 1.5% gain for all Decembers.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said they currently do not expect the kind of lockdowns that states ordered when the pandemic started to spread in March. But there could still be some impact that could be negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said he sees some signs of optimism for the market. Strong data, like third quarter GDP, October\u2019s drop in unemployment to 6.9%, and the better-than-expected earnings are all positives for the market. Another is that investors are so skeptical.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat does still exist is a great deal of dry powder. There\u2019s $4.3 trillion in money markets alone,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you, being in touch with investors of all shapes and sizes this week, there\u2019s still a lot of skepticism. From a contrarian view, high cash and a lot of skepticism is a contrarian indicator.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/WUlRQfd.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/FWN82Hs.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ZnTzBNz.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/g52vqsv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OiPuXi8.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lA86Kou.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xmtVSEB.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RRxlWej.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Piu5auo.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/W80POso.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eGUQXgr.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yoHWfIC.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hQyweyw.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Presidential Election Anticipation Is Keeping Us Waiting\n\n&gt; While we all anxiously await the final count and outcome of the U.S. Presidential Election, here are some possible scenarios for 2021. Our analysis here is based on historical market performance during the most likely political alignments for next year. We ran these likely scenarios through the Almanac database software to create this graph.\n\n&gt; We are either going to have the fifth year of a two-term republican president or a first year of a new democratic presidency. It appears the democrats will hold the house and the republicans will hold the senate, but that is not a forgone conclusion either. So we also examined both presidential outcomes with a democratic, republican and split congress.\n\n&gt; Our study uses the S&amp;P 500 from 1949 to 2017. We start in 1949 because it is the first full 4-Year Presidential Stock Market Cycle since the end of WWII. The Twenty-Second Amendment that implemented presidential term limits for a max of two terms or eight years was ratified on February 27, 1951. Truman in 1949 was excluded as there was a no change of party in the White House. We gave Bush 41 the same treatment.\n\n&gt; Admittedly, there are limited data points; four each of fifth year republicans and first year democrats. Here\u2019s what we found. A change in party with a new, first year democratic president came with democratic control of Congress and significantly higher performance for the S&amp;P 500, averaging 10.6% with a median gain of 15.1% versus 7.0% for the average post-election year since 1949.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a89421df75f426e1b1ff90cb2c29cb90/b63e1cf962f89fdb-a3/s400x600/f9bde99a9e4ba83b0df266a8d3cc04cd732cc58f.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Fifth year republican presidents in 1957 (Eisenhower) and 1973 (Nixon) had to work with democratically controlled Congresses and the market suffered significant losses. The market did well in Reagan\u2019s fifth year with a split Congress \u2013 a testament to how \u201cThe Great Communicator\u201d was able to work across the aisle with then Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill. Even with republican control of Congress under Bush 43\u2019s fifth year, the market had a tough year with ongoing issues in Iraq, North Korea declaring it\u2019s a nuclear power and the most active and second costliest hurricane season on record.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Job Growth Continues as COVID-19 Cases Rise\n\n&gt; The US labor market shrugged off election uncertainty and continued to add jobs in October. Despite the waning effects of fiscal stimulus and rising COVID-19 cases, per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added 638,000 jobs, ahead of Bloomberg survey estimates calling for 580,000. The headline number was depressed by a 268,000 drop in government employment, including 147,000 temporary census workers. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell from 7.9% to 6.9% despite a rise in the labor force participation rate, a reversal of the dynamic we saw in September when unemployment fell while the labor force participation also declined.\n\n&gt; However, a troubling trend remains beneath the surface. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the number of long-term unemployed\u2014those out of work for 27 weeks or longer\u2014continues to rise as a share of the total unemployed:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11.6.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWhile the labor market has continued to show improvement, there are still many people out there who are having a hard time getting back to work,\u201d noted LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWith total jobs in the US around 10 million below pre-pandemic levels and rising COVID-19 cases, there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement despite the declining unemployment rate.\u201d\n\n&gt; COVID-19 cases in the United States have reached record highs with a weekly trend growth rate above 20%, according to the COVID Tracking Project. As the weather cools and more activity shifts indoors, additional restrictions to limit the spread of the virus could slow the fragile labor market recovery.\n\n&gt; In particular, much of the private sector gains in this month\u2019s jobs report were in the services sector, where previous jobs reports had shown strength in goods-oriented industries. Many countries in Europe have reinstated restrictions or even gone as far as implementing new lockdowns. While we don\u2019t expect lockdowns in the United States like we saw in March, restrictions on activity could limit future job gains.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One Sentiment Survey Soars While Another Sinks\n\n&gt; In an earlier post, we discussed how bullish sentiment in the AAII survey has been on the rise, but looking at another weekly sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence, the opposite is true. The percentage of respondents reporting as bullish fell sharply this week, 7 percentage points, down to 53.6%. While a majority are still optimistic and that reading is in the middle of its range, that was the largest weekly decline since a 7.4 percentage point decline to 41.7% in the first week of March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, the percentage of newsletter writers that are \"looking for a correction\" rose sharply to 25.8% this week following last week's over 5% decline for the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Correction.png))**\n\n&gt; The Investors Intelligence survey has a long history dating back to 1963, and in all weeks in that time, only 5% (174 weeks) have seen bullish sentiment fall 5 percentage points or more while the percentage of respondents looking for a correction has risen at least 5 percentage points in the same week. In the chart below, we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 following these past occurrences when there has not been another in the prior 3 months. The S&amp;P 500 has frequently been higher over the following weeks and months, but there is a slight underperformance relative to all periods since 1963 when the survey begins.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Performance.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2 Post-Election Charts You Need to See\n\n&gt; The election is over, but the questions are mounting. We don\u2019t know who will be the next president as of Wednesday morning, but we do know that stocks tend to do well the final two months of an election year. \u201cOnce the uncertainty is over, stocks tend to rally in November and December, with November the best month of the year during an election year,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOf course, 2020 isn\u2019t like any other year, and we still could be a ways away from who the winner will be.\u201d\n\n&gt; The LPL Chart of the Day shows that the S&amp;P 500 Index tends to do very well the final two months of the year, especially during election years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The modern design of the S&amp;P 500 stock index was first launched in 1957. Performance back to 1928 incorporates the performance of predecessor index, the S&amp;P 90\n\n&gt; One of the big takeaways so far from Tuesday night is that the Senate likely will stay Republican, meaning we may have a divided Congress. The chances of higher taxes and more regulation likely took a hit under this scenario. This could be a nice tailwind for stocks, as the S&amp;P 500 historically has done quite well under a divided Congress, up more than 17% on average. Additionally, in years with a divided Congress, stocks have been higher the past 10 times, with 2020 potentially being the 11th in a row.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-2-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; This election is far from over, so stay tuned to LPL Research as we continue to monitor things!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Emerging Markets Cheering a Potential Biden Win\n\n&gt; The US equity market has seen a massive rally in reaction to what is looking like a Biden victory over President Trump coupled with the Republican party maintianing its majority in the US Senate. None of these results are official at this point, so they are subject to change, but these are the most likely scenarios as of now. Outside of the US, emerging markets have also rallied. In just the last two days, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF (EEM) has rallied 5% and broken above resistance to new 52-week highs. If for no other reason then Biden's campaign slogan isn't America First, the rationale behind the rally makes some sense.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-Now.png))**\n\n&gt; The reaction of EEM in the aftermath of this election is very much different from what happened in 2016. Heading into the 2016 election, EEM had been trending higher, but pulled back in the days leading up to the election and broke its uptrend that had been in place since earlier in the year. Again, Trump's America First approach was understandably viewed as a headwind to emerging market equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-labels.png))**\n\n&gt; While the initial reaction of EEM to Trump's election was negative, that weakness didn't last long. The chart below shows the performance of EEM in the two months before and one year after the 2016 election. The gray box represents the same period shown in the chart above. Within days after breaking its uptrend after the 2016 election, EEM bounced back, rallied to its 50-DMA, tested its November low, and then in the early days of 2017 it was off to the races as EEM. In fact, even accounting for the post-Election Day declines, one year after the 2016 election, EEM was up 25% which was actually more than the 21% return for the S&amp;P 500! The moral of the story here is that first reactions aren't always the right reactions, and as an investor it's not just imperative to know the environment you are operating in, but also when the tides are turning.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-2017.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Winners and Losers During Trump's Presidency\n\n&gt; With Election Day upon us, below we take a look at the biggest winners and losers across financial markets during the Trump Presidency from Election Day 2016 through today. First off, below is a chart of the market cap of the Russell 3,000 since Election Day 2000 which George W. Bush eventually won. The Russell 3,000 makes up more than 98% of the total US equity market cap, so it's a good gauge to use for measuring the overall change in market cap levels. The current market cap of the Russell 1000 is just north of $35 trillion, which is up $11.5 trillion since Election Day 2016. President Obama oversaw US market cap growth of $12.3 trillion over his two terms, while President Bush actually saw market cap decline by $4.1 trillion after his two terms.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/mktcap.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a look at the total return of various asset classes since Election Day 2016 using key ETFs listed on US exchanges. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is up 70.6% since Trump was elected, while the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) more than doubled that at +144.3%. Of the broad index ETFs in the matrix, the Smallcap Value ETF (IJS) is up the least since Election Day 2016 at just +17.2%.\n\n&gt; Looking at US sector ETFs, the Energy sector (XLE) is a huge outlier with a decline of 48.3% since Trump was elected. Technology (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) are up the most with gains of 154% and 97%, respectively.\n\n&gt; Along with Energy stocks, the oil (USO) and natural gas (UNG) ETFs have been more than cut in half since 11/8/16, while gold (GLD) is up 47% and silver is up 29.5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/assetclass1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Not every country has seen stock market gains since Trump was elected. As shown below, Mexico (EWW) is down 28.5%, Brazil (EWZ) is down 19.4%, Spain (EWP) is down 6.8%, and the UK (EWU) is just slightly in the red.\n\n&gt; The US (SPY) is up more than any other country with a gain of 70.6%, while China (ASHR) is up the second most at +51%. Whatever happened with the trade war certainly didn't hurt the US and China versus the rest of the world on a relative basis.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/countryreturns1103.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/sectors1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Within the Russell 1,000 in its current form, there are nine stocks that are up 1,000% or more since Election Day 2016, with Enphase Energy (ENPH) at the top with a gain of 8,590%. Trade Desk (TTD) is up the second most at +2,448%, followed by Novocure (NVCR), SolarEdge Tech (SEDG), and Quidel (QDEL). Square (SQ) ranks sixth with a gain of 1,203%. Other notables on the list of big winners since Trump was elected include Etsy (ETSY), Teladoc (TDOC), Tesla (TSLA), NVIDIA (NVDA), Atlassian (TEAM), Boston Beer (SAM), and Lululemon (LULU).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-since-2016.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of market cap gains for individual stocks, the numbers below are quite eye-popping. Apple (AAPL) has gained the most in market cap since Trump was elected with an increase of $1.257 trillion! Amazingly, both Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have added more than $1 trillion in market cap as well. Prior to the last few years, no company was even close to having a $1 trillion market cap, but at this point, AAPL, AMZN, and MSFT have gained that much in the last four years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/capuse.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 6th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ5sT7SXYTk))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.8.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$PLUG** \n&gt; * **$WKHS** \n&gt; * **$CGC** \n&gt; * **$DKNG** \n&gt; * **$BYND** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$ACB** \n&gt; * **$RKT** \n&gt; * **$SPG** \n&gt; * **$JMIA** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$TLRY** \n&gt; * **$NKLA** \n&gt; * **$DDOG** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$DHI** \n&gt; * **$WIX** \n&gt; * **$CARS** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$DIS** \n&gt; * **$INO** \n&gt; * **$GRWG** \n&gt; * **$NLS** \n&gt; * **$AAP** \n&gt; * **$DOYU** \n&gt; * **$RNG** \n&gt; * **$PRTS** \n&gt; * **$NBEV** \n&gt; * **$LMND** \n&gt; * **$TGNA** \n&gt; * **$WVE** \n&gt; * **$EXPI** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$ICPT** \n&gt; * **$HUYA** \n&gt; * **$GOGO** \n&gt; * **$NCLH** \n&gt; * **$OXY** \n&gt; * **$PEIX** \n&gt; * **$CYBR**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Piu5auo.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MDVAWXO.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Yme9cXS.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/a6Kp4iF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XOR4bP6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TfDOPZJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/OsrCLIc.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/N7Ibl9s.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/y4tBaZw.png))\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wVnvQZH.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9PnmIUs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uoiA0Bw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Plug Power, Inc. $18.86\n**Plug Power, Inc.

The Dow ended in negative territory at (-0.14%)\n* The best performing sector was Information Technology(+2.37%) while Materials(-1.49%)was the worst performer.\n* Specifically, the information technology (+2.4%) and consumer discretionary (+1.5%) sectors meaningfully outperformed the broader market, followed by respectable gains in the consumer staples (+0.9%) and real estate (+0.8%) sectors.  \n* The S&amp;P 500 had a good shot at closing at a new high today, briefly surpassing its Sept. 2 closing high (3580.84), but the inability to stay above the prior closing high was a technical factor that worked against trading sentiment. \n* Separately, Goldman Sachs remained bullish on equities, forecasting the S&amp;P 500 to hit 4300 by the end of 2021. The call was based on expectations that a COVID-19 vaccine would reopen the economy and a divided government would provide stability and no increase in taxes. \n* The U.S. Treasury market was closed for Veterans Day, leaving the 10-yr yield at 0.98% following yesterday's settlement price.

        "selftext": "## Daily Synopsis \n* The S&amp;P 500 increased +1.25% today while the NASDaq weakened by (-2.13%). The Russell 2000 outperformed by (+3.57%). The Dow ended in positive territory at (+2.92%)\n* The best performing sector was Energy(+14.29%) while Communication Services(-0.88%)was the worst performer.\n* The energy (+14.2%) and financials (+8.2%) sectors finished comfortably atop the leaderboard, aided by noticeably higher oil prices ($40.31, +3.17, +8.5%) and curve-steepening activity caused by selling in longer-dated Treasuries. The consumer discretionary (-1.6%), information technology (-0.7%), consumer staples (-0.5%), and communication services (-0.3%) sectors closed lower. \n* The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.18%, while the 10-yr yield increased 11 basis points to 0.96%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.6% to 92.82. \n* In other important news, Joe Biden was projected the winner of the U.S. presidential election, although President Trump did not concede and said he would file legal challenges. Note, media reports indicated that Mr. Trump would unlikely succeed in overturning the election results. \n* It's worth mentioning that at one point today, the S&amp;P 500 was up as much as 11.5% over the prior six sessions. Presumably, that left it primed for profit taking amid an understanding that the market still has to get through the new wave of coronavirus and uncertainty surrounding another stimulus package.  \n## Index Summary\n **S&amp;P 500 :** (+1.25%); **NasDaq :** (-2.13%); \\\n**Russell 2000 :** (+3.57%); **Dow :** (+2.92%); \\\n**Vix :** 24.86 (+3.26%); [-30.86%]; {-23.03%} \n## Sectors Summary \n_Three highest sectors for today were -_ \n **Energy:** (+14.29%); **Financials:** (+8.15%); **Industrials:** (+3.37%)\n _Three lowest sectors for today were -_\n **Communication Services:** (-0.88%); **Information Technology:** (-0.75%); **Consumer Discretionary:** (-0.45%)\n ## Commodities/Futures \\\n_**Top 5 Highest Commodity % Changes \u2013 -**_ \\\n\n1\\.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 2, 2020**\n\nStocks opened today\u2019s session higher before paring some gains ahead of an extremely busy week, with market participants closely monitoring the results of the US presidential election, a meeting of the Federal Reserve, and the October jobs report, and rising coronavirus numbers in the US and Europe.\n\nAfter an extremely choppy day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.22% up, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 1.11% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing 1.56% up.\n\nOn Tuesday is the US presidential election between incumbent Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Needless to say, given the political divide, the coronavirus pandemic, and social unrest that exists in the United States right now, the outcome of this election will be extremely significant. According to a study done by Edward Jones, since 1932, the stock market has dipped 64% percent of the time the day after a presidential election. This likely reflects anxiety about the future if a large cohort of the population is unhappy with the election result. Regardless of the election result,  it's likely a large section of the population will be unhappy. Moreover, given the surge of early and mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, the possibility exists that the outcome may not be clear after Tuesday. This scenario would certainly cause a massive spike in volatility and uncertainty in the markets. According to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, as of Friday of last week, around 85 million individuals have cast their ballots, over half of the total turnout in 2016. If this pace picks up, this election could have the highest voter participation rate in over 100 years.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the election will have a number of consequences for Corporate America. For example, a change in the political control in either the Senate or the White House (which are Republican-controlled right now) could potentially alter corporate tax rates, increase or decrease regulation in some industries, affect trade relations with other countries, and changes in capital gains tax, which is important for market participants. Moreover, the outcome of the election will likely influence the timing and size of much-needed additional fiscal stimulus \n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to hold the first of its two-day rate-setting meeting the day after Election Day, with the twelve FOMC meeting Wednesday and monetary policy statement and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday. Going off previous meetings, the Fed is virtually guaranteed to keep interest rates, near zero. After their last meeting in September, the Fed signaled that it would maintain interest rates are current levels until \u201cat least 2023\u201d. Throughout these meetings, FOMC members, including Powell, have increasingly escalated their calls for further fiscal stimulus to complement the Fed\u2019s monetary support. In early October, Powell said, \u201ctoo little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardships for households and businesses.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the Department of Labor is set to release the October job report, a crucial piece of data to understand the state of the labor market and gauge the pace of recovery. According to Bloomberg consensus data, non-farm payrolls are expected to increase by around 600,000. While this estimate would the sixth month of net payroll gains, it would also be the four, straight month of deceleration, indicating the pace of recovery is slowing. The unemployment rate is also predicted to tick lower, from 7.9% to 7.6%. However, worryingly, there appears to be a trend towards long-term unemployment for many Americans. The number of individuals filing continuing claims, people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, has continued to increase the past several weeks. This means that people who lost their job due to the pandemic are having an increasing harder time finding new employment quickly.\n\nThe US just set a new record for the highest seven-day average of daily new cases: 81,336 as of Sunday. That's the first time the number has ever topped 80,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. new cases are far exceeding new testing. Over the past week, new cases have increased 18%, according to Johns Hopkins. But the number of new tests performed has increased only 4.29%, according to the Covid Tracking Project. \n\nLast week, Europe recorded around 1.5 million new cases of coronavirus, a new record, according to data from Johns Hopkins. Trends are worrying across the continent now, including in countries such as Greece and the Czech Republic, where infection rates had been low until recently. Measures are tightening up everywhere. England, in response to the surge, announced a nationwide lockdown for at least the next four weeks.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Apple (AAPL) announced on Monday an event for Nov. 10 where it\u2019s expected to announce new Macs that are powered by their own chips powered by ARM processors, instead of the Intel chips it had been using. Could impact Nvidia (NVDA) stock, which owns ARM chips, and Intel, who has not been doing very well lately, judging from last earnings report and stock price action (INTC).\n* Images for the updated Tesla Cybertruck could come next Musk, according to CEO Elon Musk.\n* Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO announced its October deliveries, and the number has shares on the move, again. NIO delivered 5,055 vehicles in October, doubling from a year ago. The result is doubly impressive because NIO very recently raised its manufacturing capacity to 5,000 vehicles a month. The company is selling all the cars it can make. This stock is an absolute monster and is one we love at PsychoTrader!\n* Alibaba (BABA), is doubling its Singles\u2019 Day offerings this year, running the massive online sales event across two periods rather than one. Alibaba says it expanded the shopping window for Singles\u2019 Day to provide more relief for merchants that have been hit hard by the pandemic. Single\u2019s day is a counter to Valentine\u2019s Day that celebrates being single. Normally it\u2019s held on Nov 11. This is the world\u2019s largest shopping festival. According to Fortune Magazine, BABA shipped $38.4 billion in gross merchandise value on Singles\u2019 Day last year. Amazon\u2019s Prime Day, by comparison, sold around $6 billion in goods last year.\n* Asian shares were mostly higher on Monday buoyed by further signs of recovery in China's manufacturing sector. The Caixin manufacturing PMI, a major indicator for China's manufacturing sector, rose in October, showing that domestic demand is holding up, reports said over the weekend.\n* Allegiant Travel (ALGT) upgraded by Morgan Stanley (MS) to $175 OVERWEIGHT.
