        "selftext": "INTEL VS AMD\n\n\\############\n\nI'm a fan of both companies and will probably hedge all companies. \n\nIntel, QUALCOMM, AMD and APPLIED MATERIALS.\n\nI see growth in all companies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut if you want to compare Intel with AMD and knock Intel because they lost 15% on their stocks.\n\nHere is something for you!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPOINT 1\n\n\\#############\n\nAMD REVENUE = 6.73 billion USD\n\nINTEL REVENUE = 71.9 billion USD\n\nINTEL could buy AMD  10 times if they wanted to. \n\nBut AMD doesn't offer anything intel anything they want except for 6 months advantage on \n\n5nm and 7nm chips \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPOINT 2\n\n\\#########################\n\nEarnings per share.\n\nIf you hold AMD you will get $0.30\n\nbut with Intel you will get $4.10\n\n  \nYou will need 13 x more shares to get the same value.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPOINT 3\n\n\\############################\n\nINTEL is an American company, with headquarters in California. \n\nAMD is a join venture with \n\nTianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co. Ltd. (THATIC)\n\n2 further joint-ventures have been set-up: (1) Haiguang Microelectronics Co. Ltd. (HMC), and (2) Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit Design Co., Ltd (Hygon)\n\nBut in a Trade War, this can be a problem, especially if there is a trade embargo in place, this can affect production. We also saw AMD price crumble during this time. As CHINA and the US intesifies AMD will be a dangerous stock to hold unless it cuts ties with its Chinese partners.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPOINT 4\n\n\\##############\n\nIntel Desktop market share\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-vs-intel-cpu-market-share-q4-2019-epyc-and-ryzen-growth-decelerate-mobile-ryzen-up](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-vs-intel-cpu-market-share-q4-2019-epyc-and-ryzen-growth-decelerate-mobile-ryzen-up)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAMD desktop market share is 18.3%\n\nIntel desktop market share is said to be greater than 66%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAMD Server Unit Market Share is said to be 5%\n\nIntel Desktop market share is said to be 80%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis market is worth around 23billion\n\nQuote: [https://marketrealist.com/2019/08/why-is-intel-optimistic-about-its-data-centric-businesses/#adnrb=900000](https://marketrealist.com/2019/08/why-is-intel-optimistic-about-its-data-centric-businesses/#adnrb=900000)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPOINT 5\n\n\\#################\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe future\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nINTEL IS AHEAD OF AMD IN 5G, which is the future.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/01/intel-future-in-5g-networks-after-apple-buys-modem-business.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/01/intel-future-in-5g-networks-after-apple-buys-modem-business.html)\n\n[https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/5g-network-portfolio-launch/#gs.b6cjry](https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/5g-network-portfolio-launch/#gs.b6cjry)\n\n  AMD is well behind here;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIntel is optimized for AI building their chips for machine learning.\n\nEveryone knows that is the future and is getting bigger.\n\n[https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai.html](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey are also working on 7nm, 5nm, and smaller size cpus\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPOINT 6\n\n\\#################\n\nintel is more than just cpu's\n\nThey produce Network cards and have one of the biggest shares.\n\n[https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/products/network-io/ethernet.html](https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/products/network-io/ethernet.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIntel have storage solutions in place\n\n[https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/products/docs/storage/storage-products.html](https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/products/docs/storage/storage-products.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey provide chips for motherboards and gpu's\n\nAMD just produce cpu's and graphics cards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPOINT 7\n\n\\###########\n\nEveryone knows that employees are the most important thing in companies.\n\nCompanies with bigger budgets can hire the best of the best.\n\nintel = 110,200\n\namd = 11,400\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPOINT 8\n\n\\###########\n\nINTEL is a trusted brand, most companies are providing laptops and desktops in corporate offices with intel inside.\n\nThey have hardware contracts in place for decades.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWHAT DOES AMD HAVE ON INTEL\n\n\\#################\n\n6 MONTHS DEVELOPMENT advantage on 7nm and 5nm chips.\n\nMost likely because that is all amd do and even with that competitive advantage, Intel still has greater market\n\nshare and makes more money",
