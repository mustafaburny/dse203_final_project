Mexico and the US have a tightly coupled trading relationship. The USMCA stands to invigorate that relationship and emphasize successes in energy production, manufacturing price parity, and tech-invoked trade access. The exercising of law will result in institutional confidence, resulting in reasonable profits from July-September.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Mexico is Buy American as a nation. It has a tightly coupled relationship with American output.](https://preview.redd.it/jcz0alawji751.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a85687aafa11d3bf4e600e380f08fdea89eea52)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- NAFTA ends June 30th and the USMCA goes into effect July 1st. The US is the last nation ready to prepare the changes.\n\n\\- Trump will soon be under pressure for some form of economic stimulus. This may be in the form of an infrastructure bill by the time September or the election rolls around.\n\n\\- The USMCA modernizes up cross border digital trade and seeks to modernize some structural changes that have transformed in the energy industries invoking industrial surplus. This will increase the rate of exchange\n\n\\- These changes from Facebook (WhatsApp), Walmart, Amazon, Costco, Shopify, Cloudflare, Paypal, and other important supply chain players like **SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS** to supercharge trade between the two nations.\n\n\\- These changes also encourage energy production between US &amp; Mexico, where Mexico has fallen behind and Texas has exceeded.\n\n\\- **NO** this DD is not about the obvious auto-manufacturing benefit. It is an important factor but there is plenty of evidence that only focuses on that element of the USMCA.\n\n\\- Kansas City Southern is one of the ten Class-I Railroads of the US. It is the **ONLY** Class-I Railroad that connects the US &amp; Mexico and runs along the Gulf of Mexico.  This results in streamlined cross-border energy and product trades. This also means that **KSU** **stands to agnostically benefit from economic improvements in energy output and nation building from both the US &amp; Mexico.**\n\n\\- Mexico is an important bulwark nation for the US to bolster as a partner against Chinese economic threat. Its relationship with US is far different than international partners like Germany, India, and Japan. There is a far greater efficiency potential between the two nations across many industries related to logistics, mining, energy, manufacturing, telecom, and agriculture.\n\n\\- Mexico's higher education and English learners have rapidly increased as Mexico radically approaches middle incomes and its narcotics problem. By most accounts, the US is least behind in terms of social policy regarding The Drug War. The US stands to adapt and benefit most rapidly from the economic bottleneck the Drug War has produced.\n\n\\- Migration is complex between the two nations. It is arguably a symbiotic relationship regarding wages, education, crime, and currency parity with respects to US &amp; Mexico.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[1994, the signing of NAFTA was a consequential inflection point in economic history.](https://preview.redd.it/73u5e39bki751.png?width=3045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a8296fa4d5fb1797d141f936c4809c683b022e4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Mexico serves as important trading vector and access point to increase global price efficiencies in auto markets, energy, materials, agriculture, and labor.](https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # The Product\n\nKansas City Southern is a relatively small railroad compared to other systems like Union Pacific. You can argue that this is beneficial as is allows the railroad to execute and iterate more rapidly to changes and optimize for efficiencies that larger railroads cannot.\n\nKSU does this with **Precision Railroad Scheduling** along with other Class-I railroads but to great effect. In simple terms, this means that railroads prioritize the scheduling of arrival and departures over the weight and output of each train run. This has resulted in\n\n* Greater speed\n* Greater flexibility to economic changes (Amazon, energy, etc)\n* Greater competition to trucking\n* Increased fuel efficiency\n* Greater economic output\n* Reduced costs for rail trade\n\n*This is an excellent primary for economic growth.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[List of traded goods managed by KSU](https://preview.redd.it/jwed8v3hoi751.png?width=1169&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a1cb82b7dcfa7ab59a727bc50991c9d303e3ef7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Diversified to benefit &amp; reflect Mexican-American progress](https://preview.redd.it/6qvks6g0oi751.png?width=2386&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=422e6aa0728e13e9fab0a76893522317a015a9cb)\n\n# \n\n[Institutional restructuring](https://preview.redd.it/bd6h7tpzoi751.png?width=543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3958e442f2cce7001739fbc333689ba5c7a56379)\n\n# \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Market ineffeciencies will rebalance with USMCA changes.](https://preview.redd.it/kjlml0x5pi751.png?width=540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a4a562b56d075fd1b6c6229f823aa8e5718c3f3)\n\n# \n\n# # The Macroeconomic view of Texas &amp; Nuevo Leon's economic zones\n\nThe reality is that there are logistical positions in Texas and Monterrey trade vectors that is strategically advantageous. Monterrey is a trading city located near the southern border that operates as an important global industrial zone for products and services delivered from Samsung, MSCI Financial, Toyota, Siemens, and the like because the region's geography permits it.\n\nThe story is quite simple. Mexico needs more energy output. Texas has it. Mexican can grow it. The USMCA is designed to directly benefit the economies of Mexico &amp; Texas.\n\nMonterrey, of course, is not the only important vector in Mexico that KSU falls under.

There has been an acceleration toward this reality but it's still early in the overall development cycle.\n\nPhysical and monetary assets being virtualized has recently been accelerated in importance and this will have positive effects, across time, on businesses that focus on securing those assets in its time spent delivering on multiple ultra-high-speed networks across the world. Computing is getting cheaper and easier to distribute in rather extreme ways and the execution of these ideas is happening right now.\n\nThe need for secure video, transactions, VR, and user experiences will be dramatically shot up and this is evident across many exciting technologies like Apple VR, Google Gaming, Square Banking, Facebook Shops with VR shopping, Microsoft software automations, and government developments.\n\nInfrastructure that support these interactive ecosystems will be growing at incredible rates. NET is one of the best positioned companies to pioneer this market.\n\n[The networking market](https://mordorintelligence.com/images_db/RD_Images/1556091324027_Picture2.png)\n\n# # My motivation\n\nCloudFlare is releasing and bolstering support for streaming, video, and communications as a security-first cloud provider in the following week.

A content delivery network.\n\nCDNs are distributed datacenters. This technology has been rapidly improving in the past 5 years and has drastically reduced the cost of business for small businesses and enterprises alike.\n\nThinking trucking logistics. You need to load up and send heavy duty materials, safely, quickly, and across multiple checkpoints along a highway.\n\nAn easy way to think about CDNs is to imagine it as the E in 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution). Through the power of CDNs, you're able to render images, videos, streams, content, data, transactions, privacy, and much more through the network.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Securing digital assets on a reliable infrastructure for the most intensive computing cases.](https://preview.redd.it/dnpn9c3t4m251.png?width=2210&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2be51c709a803d5dbac47c4bb471d9ca77bc047c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# Why does this market matter? Competitive advantages\n\nThe reason Snapchat did not gain any traction did not gain any traction outside of the US was because Facebook provided a fundamentally faster service across WhatsApp and Instagram. Facebook's investment in networking infrastructure allowed them to create a product that was fast , cheap and would work in various rural or economic conditions. Snapchat never stood a chance in the global social media landscape as a result.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # What's special about CloudFlare as a network?\n\nWhat CloudFlare specifically offers against its competitors is its privacy-first approach.

Around this time you also began to see new products in ESports like` [`Twitch.tv`](https://twitch.tv/) `which would \"stream\" video.`\n\n`What had happened was that tech companies discovered a more cost effective way of delivering video and it was through controlling the actual pipeline. You would receive atomized content as needed rather than waiting for blocks of video to be received on your end (this was problematic in early Youtube days with broadband and DSL)`\n\n`The paradigm began to shift. Cloud computing and asynchronous models began to gain steam in the developer profession. We began a defining chapter of web optimizations that still continue today with serverless computing, real-time data, and growing user-experiences. At this time you began to notice that you no longer had to refresh your web page to receive new data. Remember when Facebook started to notify you rather than you checking your notifications? Do you remember when you had to check your email?`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951531-e1c01500-a7e6-11ea-87c0-f7bcdf9e6ffd.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951531-e1c01500-a7e6-11ea-87c0-f7bcdf9e6ffd.png)`)`\n\n`Today, developers are able to create or distribute product and services using networking and data center functions. This is largely what is recognized as cloud and serverless computing. This is has many consequences but primarily allows for unbelievably fast responses and avenues for user experiences.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951289-5003d800-a7e5-11ea-9aaf-c5b44063a66e.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951289-5003d800-a7e5-11ea-9aaf-c5b44063a66e.png)`)`\n\n`# What is serverless computing?`\n\n`Serverless computing allows a 25 year old developer like me run 5 different businesses on my dinky little Macintosh while I let Google and Cloudflare run my servers under an extremely cheap pricing model. That is a revolutionary change for software. It is one of the bread and butter of SaaS, IaaS, and other cloud style businesses where many business problems come out of the box for you.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83955922-1941b800-a80d-11ea-8675-28c216be50eb.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83955922-1941b800-a80d-11ea-8675-28c216be50eb.png)`)`\n\n`# Other competitive advantages of network and cloud computing`\n\n`The reason Snapchat did not gain any traction outside of the US was because Facebook provided a fundamentally faster service across WhatsApp and Instagram. Facebook's investment in Akamai and its personal networking infrastructure allowed them to create a product that was fast, cheap and would work in various rural or economic conditions. Snapchat never stood a chance in the global social media landscape as a result.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951349-b7218c80-a7e5-11ea-9901-abd22b1f776e.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951349-b7218c80-a7e5-11ea-9901-abd22b1f776e.png)`)`\n\n`# What's special about CloudFlare as a network?`\n\n`What CloudFlare specifically offers against its competitors is its **privacy-first approach** and its quality of engineering. CloudFlare is essentially a distributed private content delivery network (pCDN) with a massive infrastructure effort to send data around the world safely and cheaply.`\n\n`This is fundamentally consequential as we are seeing massive nations tackle issues with how data can be utilized or privatized.`\n\n`Privacy and speed sells.

This, on top of its rapidly growing developer platform, is consequential for many reasons as a market-mover in the industry.\n\n\\# In Short\n\nCloudFlare so far has been shredding forward across multiple technical markets competing against by:\n\n\\- Competing marketshare against CISCO, Palo Alto Networks, and other hardware customers\n\n\\- Offering a way to not lock your organization into a big tech vendor\n\n\\- Promoting security and challenging Big Tech's direction with web development\n\n\\- Forming positive relationships with Shopify, Facebook, JD, Twitter, Baidu, TOR, and Microsoft\n\n\\- Pioneering the ease-of-use privacy movement with [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1/) and distributing VPNs.\n\n\\- Growing a rapid, robust, cost-effective, and secure network across the world\n\n\\- \\_Providing a development platform that promotes the use extremely powerful and 'cutting edge' web computing.\\_ \\*\\*-&gt; YOU ARE HERE\\*\\*\n\n\\- Creating a better internet.\n\n\\_\\*\\*Cofounder of NPM - a primary pioneer in the cloud market\\*\\*\\_\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951310-7164c400-a7e5-11ea-8675-e265e7c15336.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951310-7164c400-a7e5-11ea-8675-e265e7c15336.png))\n\n\\# The Thesis\n\nThe economic value and convergence between e-commerce, global networking speeds, and video advancements is not anywhere close to realized. There has been an acceleration toward this reality but it's still early in the overall economic development cycle. This timeframe has been accelerated greatly due to global market lockdowns and further risk of lockdown.\n\nPhysical and monetary assets being virtualized has recently been accelerated in importance and this will have positive effects, across time, on businesses that focus on securing those assets in its time spent delivering on multiple ultra-high-speed networks across the world. Computing is getting cheaper and easier to distribute in rather extreme ways and the execution of these ideas is happening right now.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950869-9c99e400-a7e2-11ea-8373-3e6f2b42b4bc.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950869-9c99e400-a7e2-11ea-8373-3e6f2b42b4bc.png))\n\nInfrastructure that support these interactive ecosystems will be growing at incredible rates.

There has been an acceleration toward this reality but it's still early in the overall development cycle. \n\nPhysical and monetary assets being virtualized has recently been accelerated in importance and this will have positive effects, across time, on businesses that focus on securing those assets in its time spent delivering on multiple ultra-high-speed networks across the world.  Computing is getting cheaper and easier to distribute in rather extreme ways and the execution of these ideas is happening right now.\n\nThe need for secure video, transactions, VR, and user experiences will be dramatically shot up and this is evident across many exciting technologies like Apple VR, Google Gaming, Square Banking, Facebook Shops with VR shopping, Microsoft software automations, and government developments.\n\nInfrastructure that support these interactive ecosystems will be growing at incredible rates. NET is one of the best positioned companies to pioneer this market.\n\n[This graph has been crunched where 2019 skips straight to 2021-2023 levels.](https://preview.redd.it/2u6ede9bul251.png?width=1392&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95bf6696f2deaec72d5b3cce869d0aef5d2e59f9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# My motivation\n\nCloudFlare is releasing and bolstering support for streaming, video, and communications as a security-first cloud provider in the following week. This, on top of its rapidly growing developer platform, is consequential for many reasons as a market-mover in the industry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# In Short\n\nCloudFlare so far has been shredding forward across multiple technical markets competing against by:\n\n\\- Competing marketshare against CISCO, Palo Alto Networks, and other hardware customers \n\n\\- Offering a way to not lock your organization into a big tech vendor\n\n\\- Promoting security and challenging Big Tech's direction with web development\n\n\\- Forming positive relationships with Shopify, Facebook, JD, Twitter, Baidu, TOR, and Microsoft\n\n\\- Pioneering the ease-of-use privacy movement with [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) and distributing VPNs.\n\n\\- Growing a rapid, robust, cost-effective, and secure network across the world \n\n\\- \\*\\*Providing a development platform that promotes the use extremely powerful and 'cutting edge'  computing. -&gt; YOU ARE HERE\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Co-founder of NPM, a system developers used to send software modules.

A content delivery network.\n\nCDNs are distributed datacenters. This technology has been rapidly improving in the past 5 years and has drastically reduced the cost of business for small businesses and enterprises alike.\n\nThinking trucking logistics. You need to load up and send heavy duty materials, safely, quickly, and across multiple checkpoints along a highway.\n\nAn easy way to think about CDNs is to imagine it as the E in 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution). Through the power of CDNs, you're able to render images, videos, streams, content, data, transactions, privacy, and much more through the network.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[As a pioneer in the e-commerce space](https://preview.redd.it/dnpn9c3t4m251.png?width=2210&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2be51c709a803d5dbac47c4bb471d9ca77bc047c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# Why does this market matter? Competitive advantages\n\nThe reason Snapchat did not gain any traction did not gain any traction outside of the US was because Facebook provided a fundamentally faster service across WhatsApp and Instagram. Facebook's investment in networking infrastructure allowed them to create a product that was fast , cheap and would work in various rural or economic conditions. Snapchat never stood a chance in the global social media landscape as a result.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# What's special about CloudFlare as a network?\n\nWhat CloudFlare specifically offers against its competitors is its privacy-first approach. CloudFlare is essentially a distributed private network (VPN) with a massive infrastructure effort to send data around the world safely and cheaply.  Privacy and speed sells.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Facebook: \\\\\"The future is private\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/gn6ibx4p4m251.png?width=1306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a88aa1e694ab0e62af8856bdeae914f62cd7182)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/me09oa3pem251.png?width=2332&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=658486274c4b3c61fa689c5166b14f8c5775a953\n\n\\# What is serverless computing?\n\nServerless computing allows a 25 year old developer like me run 5 different businesses on my dinky little Macintosh while I let Google and Cloudflare run my servers under an extremely cheap pricing model.

But mods delete if not allowed\n\nDisclaimer 2: Usual \u201cthis is not financial advice\u201d disclaimer. I also have a long position in this security.\n\n*All numbers are in Canadian Dollars*\n\nDrone Delivery Canada (DDC) provides a drone delivery platform targeted towards various corporations including retailers, service organizations and government agencies. They have a patented hardware/software platform. DDC has been developing its drone delivery technology since 2014.\n\nThey are currently trading on the TSX.V Exchange under the symbol FLT, on the U.S. OTC Q B market with Nasdaq International Designation under the symbol TAKOF.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasic Stats:\n\nPrice (as of creating post): 0.84\n\nMarket Cap: 148.79M\n\nEPS: -0.09\n\nNet Income: -15.6M\n\nShares Outstanding: 177.34M\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously, this company is not making money, in 2019 they had a cash burn rate of $16M but they have extremely low debt and cash worth $14M, giving them a cash runway of approx. 10 months from September 2019. Analysts predict DDC will reach cashflow breakeven in 2 years.\n\n0.3% is held by private companies, 7.1% by individual insiders, 15.4% by institutions and 77.2% the general public.\n\nSource: [https://simplywall.st/news/is-drone-delivery-canada-cveflt-in-a-good-position-to-deliver-on-growth-plans/](https://simplywall.st/news/is-drone-delivery-canada-cveflt-in-a-good-position-to-deliver-on-growth-plans/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeadership:\n\nThe CEO Michael Zahra has been the President of Staples Business Advantage (B2B supplies), the president of Yahoo, and has been on the board of directors for Oak Ridges Moraine Land Trust and on the board of governors for North York General Hospital. So, while this is a start-up they have a veteran leader. They have a strong lineup of C-Suite executives with experienced CFO and CTO.  On top of this their board of advisors include the VP of Cargo at Air Canada, and a medical director for Sunnybrook Centre for Prehospital Medicine which is an important strategic piece. The downside of their leadership is they have very high salaries for a company not making any profit. But when looking at insider transactions they have been buying more shares than they have sold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a venture company that is not profitable it is a risky investment but there are many upsides to investing in this new technology.\n\nI\u2019m currently looking at 5 factors that have swayed me to open a bullish position\n\n1. Its current partnership with DSV\n2. Its partnership with Edmonton Airport\n3. Its 2 U.S. Patents\n4. Potential for medical response\n5. Move to TSX\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPartnership with DSV:\n\nDDC entered in an agreement with DSV through its sales agent Air Canada that provides its drone delivery platform back in October 2019. The program became operational in March which was big for DDC as it is their first source of revenue. In which customers pay DDC a monthly fee for each drone route deployed. DSV provides and manages supply chain solutions for thousands of corporations. Which is a perfect partner for DDC. The initial agreement is for 15 months, with additional 1-year terms following the success of the first agreement. There is also a potential for over 20 routes to be implemented throughout 2020.\n\nSource: [http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/March2020/04/c8118.html](http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/March2020/04/c8118.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPartnership with Edmonton Airport:\n\nThis partnership creates the world\u2019s first airport drone delivery hub at Edmonton Airport using DDC\u2019s platform. DDC and Edmonton airport will implement promote and market DDC\u2019s delivery services. The agreement is for 5 years initially with the possibility of an extension unless the agreement is terminated\n\nSource: [https://edmontonjournal.com/business/commercial-real-estate/edmonton-airport-becomes-canadas-first-drone-delivery-site](https://edmontonjournal.com/business/commercial-real-estate/edmonton-airport-becomes-canadas-first-drone-delivery-site)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatents:\n\nDDC currently holds two US patents, one for its \u201cFLYTE management\u201d and one that covers aspects of its drone delivery technology and processes relating to controlled access zones for UAV landing and takeoff\n\nSource 1: [https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/drone-delivery-canada-awarded-first-114500552.html](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/drone-delivery-canada-awarded-first-114500552.html)\n\nSource 2: [https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/drone-delivery-canada-awarded-second-200500715.html](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/drone-delivery-canada-awarded-second-200500715.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMedical Response:\n\nIn 2019 researchers tested the speed of drones vs the speed of ambulances to respond to a 911 call. The drone carried an AED to the location which was approx. 8km away. The drone was allowed to fly at speeds of 80km/hr and arrived at the scene an average of three to four minutes before the ambulance. Those few minutes could make a life or death difference in a cardiac arrest patient\u2019s outcome. This is why having the medical director for Sunnybrook Centre for Prehospital Medicine on the board of advisors could be a key to implementing their services to the medical field in the future. DDC has also reached out to the healthcare industry and governments for use case applications for drone delivery relating to COVID-19.\n\nSource 1: [https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/drone-defibrillator-delivery-researchers-say-it-may-be-faster-than-ambulances-1.4462022](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/drone-defibrillator-delivery-researchers-say-it-may-be-faster-than-ambulances-1.4462022)\n\nSource 2: [https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/drone-delivery-canada-reaches-healthcare-190200559.html](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/drone-delivery-canada-reaches-healthcare-190200559.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPotential to move to TSX:\n\nMoving up from the venture exchange to the TSX can pose many benefits. A big one that we care about is increase in share price. \u201cAn observation of 34 companies that graduated between October 14, 2005 and August 10, 2006, found that almost sixty per cent of the companies had an average share price over the thirty trading days post-graduation that was higher than the thirty trading days preceding graduation. On average, the share price of all 34 issuers went up over three per cent in that time frame, with four companies showing an increase of over 25 per cent\u201d.\n\nSource: [https://www.mondaq.com/canada/charges-mortgages-indemnities/44708/movin-on-up-the-costs-and-benefits-of-graduating-to-the-tsx](https://www.mondaq.com/canada/charges-mortgages-indemnities/44708/movin-on-up-the-costs-and-benefits-of-graduating-to-the-tsx)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is my first DD on reddit so I would love any feedback and would love to discuss your thoughts on this company. (Also still trying to learn formatting on reddit)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tldr; Investing in DDC is an extremely risky bet but as they are innovating the delivery industry, we can see potential for very high growth in the future. Some of the points leading me to believe in DDC\u2019s potential is their partnership with DSV, their partnership with Edmonton Airport, and their experienced leadership.**",
