        "selftext": "Today was a strange day to say the least. The red start really drew down everything that I was tracking as an opening play, and even TWLO couldn't bail me out today - went in and out pretty damn quickly this morning. So I sat and waited for a good play - and nothing really seemed like a good deal - almost went in on MT and X but decided against it.\n\nAnd then the financials started to run up! Jumped in for a quick buck on BAC, JPM, and WFC - made some quick money there! Which was great. Tried to do the same thing with MS - but by then the financials were skipping town - so I scalped a quick $10 and closed out the position. Missed the TWLO morning moon because of this... sad day :(\n\nSpent the rest of the day looking for a good play - and thought I'd found one EOD with LRCX - but I got in just a TAD too late on its runup, and I got screwed on the spread when she started to flatten out EOD. Ended up hitting my stop pretty quickly and dumped for a loss. While she ended up going up further EOD - gotta remind myself that its just as likely that she would have fallen further. Glad I got out only lost $77.\n\nThe jump in overall value today is because another $500 was available for me to trade today! The final $500 is coming in hopefully tomorrow? Maybe on Monday - gotta wait for it too clear.\n\n* I learned the patience lesson initially today! But I've gotta work on that one since another company I was watching for EOD - WIX - decided to moon instead of LRCX. Best to take that one to the bank.\n* Trailing stops worked pretty well today! Definitely contained my losses on a couple things.\n* Even though I already know this - I've gotta be better about watching the spread on the options I buy, part of the reason I got fucked on LRCX was that the spread was over $0.50 - so fuck me.\n\n**The Plan:**\n\n1. Get a TDA cash account and fund with $2000\n2. Play intra-day swing and momentum trades\n3. Cut losses early and often - wins will accumulate over losses.\n4. Take profits Regularly\n   1. Account Balance $4000 - take $2000 to cover initial investment\n   2. Account Balance $14328 - take $12328 to cover cash losses\n   3. Account balance of $6057.37 - take $4057.37 to cover equity losses\n\n**Position History:**\n\nDay 4: 5/14 +9.96% ($1968.86 - $2165.08)\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|TWLO 5/22 200c|\\-$26|1|$425|$399|\n|BAC 5/15 21C|\\+$63|3|$41|$62|\n|GS 5/15 172.5C|\\+$46|2|$183|$206|\n|JPM 5/15 87C|\\+$135|5|$68|$95|\n|LCRX 5/15 270C|\\-$77|1|$342|$265|\n|MS 5/15 37.5C|\\+$10|5|$44|$46|\n|WFC 5/15 24C|\\+$67|3|$41|$63.5|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 3: 5/13 +8.35% - $1356.57 - $1469.84\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CODX 6/19 20C|\\-$22|1|$277|$255|\n|TWLO 5/22 200C|\\+$174|1|$469|$643|\n|DDOG 5/15 70C|\\+$45|1|$200|$245|\n|NVDA 5/15 335C|\\-$39|1|$213|$174|\n|ZM 5/15 180C|\\-$39|1|$180|$141|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 2: 5/12 +29.53% - $1046.34 - $1356.57\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CRM 6/19 200C|\\+2|1|$263|$265|\n|EGHT 6/19 20C|\\+59|1|$191|$250|\n|TWLO 5/29 205C|\\+30|1|$370|$400|\n|VTIQ 5/15 30C|\\+224|2|$103|$215|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 1: 5/11 +5% - $1000.89 - $1046.34\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|DDOG 5/15 55c|\\+54|1|$380|$434|\n|CSCO 5/15 44.5c|\\-16|2|$214|$198|\n|CHWY 5/15 39.5c|\\+12|1|$134|$146|\n\n  \nFAQ:\n\n* Why do I have so many day trades with such a small account?\n   * Cash accounts aren't subject to PDT restrictions - instead what happens is that you can only spend up to the amount of cash you have in a day.  \nFor Example - at open today I have $1050 in cash - meaning I could buy up to $1050 in option positions for the day. As long as I sell whatever positions I have by market close - that $1050 plus whatever gains I made during the day are available as cash in my account by market open tomorrow. It does end up limiting the number of positions I can take in a day because I only have so much cash - but it allows me to easily prevent losses by having a tight stop loss - and it allows me to take gains when my positions do well.\n   * Technical Side:  \nIt does take time for the cash to \"settle\", ie. have the transaction be processed. For stocks that is T+2 - meaning your cash is available two days after you close the position. However for options that is only T+1 - meaning the cash is available back in your account the day after you sell the position.\n* What Broker am I using?\n   * TD Ameritrade and their ThinkOrSwim platform. You pay $1.10 for every round-trip contract, but it is definitely worth it - if only to be able to set a proper trailing stop. \n   * TD Ameritrade cash accounts also let you purchase options - which is not something thats possible with RH.

        "selftext": "Well it's official, working my day job provides better returns than me day trading. I will admit that I was kind of hoping to put that to rest and be able to double my income, but the unfortunate reality is that I cannot.\n\nToday was by far the worst day of me day trading so far, and a myriad of issues came up that really prevented me from not only getting out of bad decisions, but making bad ones worse. At this point I have completely lost all of the gains that I made in my first 3 days, which while is disappointing, there's also strangely freeing? I definitely feel bad about it but I feel less bad about this than I did yesterday when I lost \\~$100.\n\nToday I got off to a bad start, not going in on my trading plan with DDOG and TWLO at the entry point that I wanted, completely ignored DDOG to my misfortune and focused on TWLO, which is where I made my biggest error day trading so far. I was trying to set up a limit order that would go into effect if TWLO went up to a certain price point. Unfortunately I set it up incorrectly, and ended up purchasing a contract well above its current mark price. I ended up taking a $100 loss on that one, because TWLO proceeded to go in the opposite direction. I then tried a little later on TWLO, but ended up losing that as well. And that was really the day, everything else was that mistake compounded again and again and again.\n\nTomorrow I am going to do my best to execute my morning trading plan - which is to look at DDOG, TWLO, AMZN, FB, and MAYBE Netflix, all of which I think have upside potential within the first 30 minutes or so. We shall see which I end up entering\n\nI think coming out of today I have learned two lessons.\n\n1. I need to stick to my strategy, it actively inhibits my worst instincts, and keeps me out of trouble. Today I was really tired of watching my stops hit and then seeing something go up afterwards, so I tried to let things run instead of stopping out. This ended up costing me big time in several plays.\n2. My recent losses have made me gun-shy to hop onto things that I think are going to go well, and it's actively making me avoid hopping on trends when I see them. The reason this is an issue is because I keep watching the stock, wait for it to come to a plateau, buy in then - and watch my profits get eaten away as the IV goes down and it reverses direction I'm basically putting myself in the worst position of catching the falling knife - literally catching it after its gone through my hands and into my toe.\n3. I need to get more sleep and wake up earlier. I spent this morning making mistakes that cost me because I was tired and not able to focus. I need to get to sleep sooner and wake up better in the morning. \n\nDay 7: 5/19 -19.40% ($2364.82 - $1904.13)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mf32an52htz41.png?width=1258&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a2927492a316018818b97fa94faf4039c80f5fa\n\nDay 6: 5/18 -4.98% ($2489.82 - $2364.82)\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|BA 5/22 140c|\\+ $7|2|$183|$188|\n|DDOG 6/19 75c|$0|2|$285|$285|\n|DIS 5/22 122c|\\-$14|1|$66|$52|\n|JD 5/22 55c|\\-$3|1|$129|$126|\n|LRCX 5/22 280c|\\+$12|2|$100|$106|\n|LUV 5/29 27c|\\+$2|1|$98|$100|\n|NVDA 5/22 400c|\\-$26|1|$266|$240|\n|PDD 5/22 75c|\\+$15|1|$140|$155|\n|VTIQ 6/19 25c|\\-$44|1|$309|$265|\n|W 5/22 125p|\\-$27|1|$135|$108|\n|ZS 5/22 77.5c|\\-$30|1|$165|$135|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 5: 5/15 -6.57% ($2665.08 - $2489.82)\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|BYND 5/22 120P|\\-$18|1|$186|$168|\n|JD 5/22 50C|\\-$14|1|$134|$120|\n|JD 5/22 51C|\\+$1|1|$120|$121|\n|NEM 5/22 68.5C|\\-$23|1|$179|$159|\n|TWLO 5/22 205C|\\-$49|1|$400|$351|\n|TWTR 5/22 30C|\\+$30|3|$73|$78|\n|UBER 5/22 33C|\\-$12|2|$109|$103|\n|VTIQ 6/19 30C|\\-$4|1|$285|$281|\n|WIX 6/19 240C|\\-$55|1|$419|$364|\n|WORK 5/22 32C|\\-$13|1|$129|$116|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 4: 5/14 +9.96% ($1968.86 - $2165.08)\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|TWLO 5/22 200c|\\-$26|1|$425|$399|\n|BAC 5/15 21C|\\+$63|3|$41|$62|\n|GS 5/15 172.5C|\\+$46|2|$183|$206|\n|JPM 5/15 87C|\\+$135|5|$68|$95|\n|LCRX 5/15 270C|\\-$77|1|$342|$265|\n|MS 5/15 37.5C|\\+$10|5|$44|$46|\n|WFC 5/15 24C|\\+$67|3|$41|$63.5|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 3: 5/13 +8.35% - $1356.57 - $1469.84\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CODX 6/19 20C|\\-$22|1|$277|$255|\n|TWLO 5/22 200C|\\+$174|1|$469|$643|\n|DDOG 5/15 70C|\\+$45|1|$200|$245|\n|NVDA 5/15 335C|\\-$39|1|$213|$174|\n|ZM 5/15 180C|\\-$39|1|$180|$141|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 2: 5/12 +29.53% - $1046.34 - $1356.57\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CRM 6/19 200C|\\+2|1|$263|$265|\n|EGHT 6/19 20C|\\+59|1|$191|$250|\n|TWLO 5/29 205C|\\+30|1|$370|$400|\n|VTIQ 5/15 30C|\\+224|2|$103|$215|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 1: 5/11 +5% - $1000.89 - $1046.34\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|DDOG 5/15 55c|\\+54|1|$380|$434|\n|CSCO 5/15 44.5c|\\-16|2|$214|$198|\n|CHWY 5/15 39.5c|\\+12|1|$134|$146|",

        "selftext": "I follow big &amp; unusual options activity in the market &amp; make trades when I see big money hit a name combined with a nice technical setup. When big money hits the options market it is often the smart money that knows something we tards dont, so I try to follow those moves. There was a number of stonks on Friday (and last week) that were seeing high unusual options activity - see https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders/stocks?page=1 for end of day data.\n\nOf many options that stood out to me (many of which I got into as well), $DIS call buying really stood out to me for a couple reasons. \n\n1. Technical setup is beautiful. DIS held $100 after poor ER &amp; is now pushing higher on positive reopening news. There is a gap that will lead us to $120 if we can break out past $113. \n2. On Friday alone the May15 $110s &amp; $112s were traded in high volume. The $110s traded 16k to oi of 20k and the $112s traded nearly 20k compared to an oi of just over 1k. When volume exceed oi like this it is a clear sign big traders are moving in. The $112s represent a trade of over $1M on OTM &lt;30delta that expires in a week.\n3. While the two prior points are really what I look for to execute a trade it is worth mentioning that laggards are beginning to come up, and leisure related stocks are rallying big time, DIS included. If this money flow/trade continues next week these calls will do nicely. \n\nI have 40 $112s @ .8 &amp; looking to add more Monday if it doesn't open up - not a huge trade right now but looking to double or triple up if I get the entry. If you can't control your tism &amp; want more unusual activity trades check out these (all calls).\n\nJD May15 $45, June19 $41, $45, $47, July $47\n\nTWTR May15 $30, May29 $33 &amp; $35\n\nLVS (similar momentum trade as DIS) May15 $53, June $50 $55 $60\n\nCCL May22 $15 &amp; $17\n\nDDOG May15 $60\n\nATVI May15 $74\n\nSDC May15 $7 $8.50 $9, June19 $10 &amp; $13\n\nMU May15 $48.50 &amp; $50\n\nON May15 $17\n\nWORK May15 $32\n\nTLRY May15 $8\n\nSNAP May15 $18.50\n\nTldr: A couple million dollars has gone into OTM DIS calls expiry Friday &amp; I am following the big money.
