        "selftext": "**Hello everyone! This isn\u2019t my usual kind of post, but man, I can\u2019t stand to see how people just follow every freaking YouTuber out there blindly!** In this post, we are going to talk about why I believe Tom Nash may be a **fraud**, so please do have some patience and read the full post, as I will go through an in-depth research of his past and his claims.\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nLet\u2019s start by talking about who Tom Nash is &amp; says he is. He is a new &amp; trendy \u201cfinance &amp; stock market\u201d YouTuber which has recently passed 150K subscribers after exploding during this retail investor boom, but here is a short [video](https://imgur.com/yuNMUlv) from his YouTube describing himself.\n\nIn the video he is claiming he is a former \u201csenior financial analyst\u201d which is very hard to believe in my opinion after doing a lot of research about him.\n\nSo let\u2019s go through the **5 reasons** I believe he is lying about his past &amp; why you should never take anything any YouTuber out there says for granted and you should do your own research as well:\n\n**1)  Let\u2019s start with the biggest one, his valuation methods are flawed**\n\nEven though he has posted some videos that have panned out, it\u2019s very hard to differentiate good analysis from pure luck in this recent bull market, even monkeys could throw darts at stocks in the past 11 months and be right after the March sell-off.\n\nI was pretty curious of his valuation methods so I joined his channel membership and asked him a direct question, about his DCF valuation, to which he [responded](https://imgur.com/Zdtm2dI) bluntly that I am doing things wrong. I also sent him a direct link to a well-known financial institute, where we can see that the most common cash flow used for financial [modeling](https://imgur.com/MSJgiSk), which is the unlevered free cash flow, implies that you subtract any capital expenditures of the company, which contradicts the way he sees it and is plain wrong, it\u2019s like he uses 2nd grade math, if you subtract a negative number then your cash flow actually increases, which doesn\u2019t even make sense. How can something that costs you money be a positive on the free cash flow?\n\nI\u2019ll let you digest this as I will next show you some of his DCF valuations &amp; how he uses absurd numbers and changes the formulas as he pleases just to reach some insane valuations for companies just to be catchy.\n\nHere are a couple of short extracts from his Salesforce DCF calculations,\n\n[**Exibit A**](https://streamable.com/vu2agx) \\- everything seems legit until here, now he starts with the biggest mistake in this DCF\n\n[**Exibit B**](https://imgur.com/BWeAZw8) \\- I\u2019ll be blunt you can never, ever add the Capex number to a DCF valuation, that literally throws the hole calculations off, but let\u2019s continue\u2026\n\n[**Exibit C**](https://imgur.com/LgHKupD) \\- So, using a discount rate of 6% is also insane, even with the current low interest rates, you should at least discount the average [SP500](https://imgur.com/YTxt90T) return, or use the WACC or any other type of metric, which is much safer than picking out a single company, as the SP500 has proven over long-stretches to be a great performer.\n\nBut yeah guys, this isn\u2019t the first time he has done these kind of errors, you can see he is using most of these methods in many stock picks which are then spread out to thousands of new investors, who don\u2019t really have the knowledge to test what he is saying. I\u2019m just showing you here a couple of stocks like [Dynatrace](https://imgur.com/hAO37u8), [Opendoor](https://imgur.com/66rMYZe), [Alibaba](https://imgur.com/ikLetLL), [Peloton](https://imgur.com/WRoLdIL), [Salesforce](https://imgur.com/D9Ky3gl) as I showed in the previous video and even [Apple](https://imgur.com/g8k7ZxA) that have been analyzed and spread to the public this way.\n\nThe other big issue with his valuations is that he is using insane long-term growth rates, as he used a 5% growth rate for [Peloton](https://imgur.com/EV2WB9Y) to reach a higher valuation, so can you imagine? If Peloton grows at a 5% rate in perpetuity it means they should more than double the inflation [rate](https://imgur.com/xaN3Dxw) every year and is way higher than any GDP [growth](https://imgur.com/Jkk01c9) the US has seen since 1984.\n\nHe is also [implying](https://imgur.com/Wkd2AV8) that Peloton has no debt on it\u2019s balance sheet, which is 100% false, as you can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/rsB0fJg), he used the cash, cash equivalents &amp; marketable securities to calculate the short term assets while completely ignoring the over $700M in accounts payable no to mention the other current liabilities which would add up to almost exactly the $1.4B in assets he added to his calculations.\n\nBut who knows guys? Maybe he is the real deal, as he has made some [correct](https://imgur.com/v3ZYhSU) DCF implications for some stocks like [Fortinet](https://imgur.com/kCTo7jC) and [FuboTV](https://imgur.com/vojljFt), by actually subtracting the Capex finally, though he doesn\u2019t do this in every analysis, not even in the most recent ones while also keeping that big long-term growth rate at 5%, when I myself never use a bigger one than 4%.\n\nJust for an [example](https://imgur.com/tnWSWVa) I took his CRM numbers and popped them up in my spreadsheets, and even given his methods I couldn\u2019t quite get to the same results without manually editing numbers, as those implications resulted in a 7% undervaluation for the stock, while only adjusting the Capex to be a negative on the cashflows and not touching anything else that might be wrong in this DCF, [resulted](https://imgur.com/5vxgKqI) in a 10% overvaluation for the stock.\n\nSo, I think if he really was a 10+ years wall street analyst I don\u2019t think he could have made these obvious mistakes.\n\n**2) So, Is Tom Nash whom he says he is or is he lying about his past?**\n\n[HERE](https://imgur.com/wbJ8Csh) is the channel intro for his YouTube (Which I can't even see anymore, but i was lucky to download it a couple of days ago)\n\nAs you Can see, I don\u2019t doubt that he actually went to Michigan or that he got and MBA, but I do doubt that all of his Successful \u201cSenior\u201d Financial analyst &amp; consulting Career can be described with only a couple of weak-ass photos of him at an NBA game, or him casually at some kind of a course program as that is exactly what it looks like with the other guys in the back-left of the photo.\n\nAlso, are we to believe all of this great financial career ended with him just taking out his fake plant from his office, while also smiling as he threw away at least a decent salary for a gamble on YouTube, which is very hard to do, especially when you are starting, as YouTube doesn\u2019t really help the small guys.\n\nHis YouTube journey seemed to have [started](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) on the path of exposing guru\u2019s and not financial advice, as he also says in the video, so how did he turn to do financial analysis on YouTube? Seems pretty convenient that he just became an expert in stock analysis as YouTube videos on such things were booming.\n\nYou can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/Vq4ov7x), he didn\u2019t make a single stock analysis for the most part of 2020, which seems pretty off, as now most of his videos are on stock analysis, and while his channel was created in 2017, he conveniently deleted all the previous videos, which is another weird move to do.\n\nI also went on a deep internet dive and did a lot of searching about him and I found this video [podcast](https://imgur.com/09mBKRU) of him.\n\nHis main intro in this podcast is that he works as a consultant indeed, from Israel, and also the consultancy job isn\u2019t for a financial company, it\u2019s rather to help people on YouTube grow, so let's look at some extracts from the video:\n\n[**Exibit I**](https://streamable.com/xrbv3o) \\- We can see the main part of the talk is nothing about anything related to his financial past, let\u2019s continue\n\n[**Exibit II**](https://imgur.com/Ziftnpi) \\- It seems he started with a gaming channel, not even a fake guru channel, and I also found something about that FB [GROUP](https://imgur.com/Xdt4H1i) which isn\u2019t active anymore and all of the videos he made for that have also been deleted as you can see in this [post](https://imgur.com/FyKSrIq) from way back in 2018 as he was [teaching](https://imgur.com/T5lbbH2) how to make money on YouTube well through 2019, and was even giving out free workshop [experiences](https://imgur.com/K89Yk3S)  as he was pumping out creator [content](https://imgur.com/z196rMB) which is miles apart from financial analysis (BTW, he is using the same freaking photo in his old banner &amp; logo as his current one, just changing the green screen background), just look at [his](https://imgur.com/JUnuYDE) old YouTube banner (YouTube tips &amp; tutorials)\n\n[**Exibit III**](https://imgur.com/kZddAl3) \\- Yeah, it seems he also did some video on how to promote on Reddit, and what comes next guys is literally mind blowing, how much more can this dude lie &amp; hide?\n\n[**Exibit IV**](https://streamable.com/ji6ne2) \\-  Well\u2026 Nothing to hide then\u2026 He even had a Fiverr account which was called tomernash you can see clearly [HERE](https://imgur.com/topDW52), that is his username, and when I went out to check it out right now, he is [using](https://imgur.com/HVqNkwv) a fake picture &amp; and still might live in Israel, not the US, and on top of this he might not actually even be from Russia, which he has been saying over &amp; over again on his channel. You can [SEE](https://imgur.com/18Yiimf) he reiterates he is a certified YouTube consultant with no mention of his financial skills or certifications.\n\nAnd even more, you see what picture he uses as a logo yeah? Well, I did a reverse google search and found the other guy also has a YouTube [channel](https://imgur.com/DWpofDb) about kinetic cycling.\n\nMaybe he was one of his clients that he reached a deal to use his picture, wtf, the more I dig in the more I am amazed of the lengths this man has gone to reach fame on YouTube.\n\n[**Exibit V**](https://streamable.com/sdtd7d) \\- So\u2026 A financial analyst with no sheets, no paper, no nothing, great stuff for a senior financial analyst, I literally can\u2019t take more of this so let\u2019s move to the next reasons\n\n**3) Getting in front of the lie?**\n\nI believe that\u2019s what he was trying to do to, by making a [VIDEO](https://imgur.com/CeH7ePh) on this very subject in mid-2020 and popping up higher in the search rankings before his channel boomed.\n\nIn the video he clarifies that Tom Nash isn\u2019t his real name, but he also restated that he was working for a big consultancy firm as recent as this summer, and that he does shit tons of stuff which is very hard to believe, as usually this big consultancy firms have different departments for different things that he mentioned in the video. You can still find that video on his channel if you are interested\n\nBut, by the way, how was he working on that job while also doing hundreds of Fiverr jobs as a YouTube consultant?\n\nHe also claims to not offering any courses, e-books or other stuff like this, which is false as i showed in the previous reasons with his past YouTube courses &amp; other stuff, and as you will see in the next reasons, something smells really bad out here.\n\n**4) Claims about his past**\n\nI also took a deeper dive into more of his past, as you can see in [his](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) previous channel cover and info, he had only about 4K subscribers as he was doing guru video reviews on YouTube, but all of a sudden, he [became](https://imgur.com/r6X2yHg) a senior financial analyst from wall street that was living in Israel &amp; doing Fiverr gigs, I don\u2019t know what to say but it seems pretty fishy to me.\n\nI also checked his LinkedIn [page](https://imgur.com/Xpbq7Im), and all of his skills &amp; endorsements seem to be related to his YouTube skills and nothing about finance or the stock market.\n\nBut I also found his [profile](https://imgur.com/9FxHnCb) on Quora, where he wasn\u2019t that active but still, well back in [2017](https://imgur.com/EUPer8h) he was posting things about gaming &amp; YouTube while supposedly still working on Wall Street as a financial analyst, and it\u2019s interesting that there is no [mention](https://imgur.com/kcpxh2X) of him following anything related to stocks, finance, economy, accounting, statistics or anything other related to the stock market.\n\nSo yeah guys, I guess when you make a new type of video and it boosts your channel from just [10K](https://imgur.com/GEvQ7yB) subscribers all the way up to [150K](https://imgur.com/3F0D4rI) subscribers, you are willing to push the limits and lie about your past just to keep everything going, as YouTube is a really good way to make money right now.\n\n**5) The Transformation**\n\nHe has had even more channels in the past not only this one, which he has transformed overnight from a YouTube Channel [Reviewer](https://imgur.com/JUnuYDE) to a Guru [Reviewer](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) and finally to a financial [analyst](https://imgur.com/oCIBljZ) , as He created a second &amp; third YouTube account called [GearlyReviews](https://imgur.com/9vAPlu3) where he reviews electronics and [EuroBall](https://imgur.com/G130Wgr) where he only posted 2 videos.\n\nI also searched him through his Reddit [posts](https://imgur.com/zmsRhbB) and only could find things related to marketing &amp; social media, nothing about finance yet again.\n\n# So, my personal opinion which I doubt to be wrong guys, if there is a case of a dubious &amp; fishy person out there, he is one of them.\n\nI believe that he has never worked as a senior financial analyst and especially not a stock market, asset or any other type of equity analyst.\n\nMost of his stock [picks](https://imgur.com/uOgFNkQ) are small-caps that are highly volatile or a couple of recent high flyers which are very catchy to any YouTube audience.\n\nThere are many things wrong about the picture he has painted about himself even though he has gone through a lot to try and erase his past. The fact that there are no mentions of things from the wall street or consulting firm, bad stock analysis and methods, fishy and dubious moves of his YouTube channels and especially fishy things about him being a consultant &amp; analyst in early 2020 while he was already doing YouTube and other stuff back in 2017-2018 really makes me not want to buy his story.\n\nFolks, be careful out there, you can find a lot of YouTubers out there who make more money from their advice giving on YouTube, Patreon or other kind of subscriptions and courses, compared to the actual money they are making or have ever made in the stock market.\n\nSo yeah guys, I don\u2019t want to make a final judgment on this guy, but you should consider everything I have showed about him and all the problems with his past &amp; his financial methods &amp; just remember as always **in a bull market everyone is an expert &amp; genius**, while in a bear market you can\u2019t find any of these people as they all flee.\n\nThank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

Maybe he is the real deal, as he has made some [correct](https://imgur.com/v3ZYhSU) DCF implications for some stocks like [Fortinet](https://imgur.com/kCTo7jC) and [FuboTV](https://imgur.com/vojljFt), by actually subtracting the Capex finally, though he doesn\u2019t do this in every analysis, not even in the most recent ones while also keeping that big long-term growth rate at 5%, when I myself never use a bigger one than 4%.\n\nJust for an [example](https://imgur.com/tnWSWVa) I took his CRM numbers and popped them up in my spreadsheets, and even given his methods I couldn\u2019t quite get to the same results without manually editing numbers, as those implications resulted in a 7% undervaluation for the stock, while only adjusting the Capex to be a negative on the cashflows and not touching anything else that might be wrong in this DCF, [resulted](https://imgur.com/5vxgKqI) in a 10% overvaluation for the stock.\n\nSo, I think if he really was a 10+ years wall street analyst I don\u2019t think he could have made these obvious mistakes.\n\n**2) So, Is Tom Nash whom he says he is or is he lying about his past? \u274c**\n\n[HERE](https://imgur.com/wbJ8Csh) is the channel intro for his YouTube (Which I can't even see anymore, but i was lucky to download it a couple of days ago)\n\nAs you Can see, I don\u2019t doubt that he actually went to Michigan or that he got and MBA, but I do doubt that all of his Successful \u201cSenior\u201d Financial analyst &amp; consulting Career can be described with only a couple of weak-ass photos of him at an NBA game, or him casually at some kind of a course program as that is exactly what it looks like with the other guys in the back-left of the photo.\n\nAlso, are we to believe all of this great financial career ended with him just taking out his fake plant from his office, while also smiling as he threw away at least a decent salary for a gamble on YouTube, which is very hard to do, especially when you are starting, as YouTube doesn\u2019t really help the small guys.\n\nHis YouTube journey seemed to have [started](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) on the path of exposing guru\u2019s and not financial advice, as he also says in the video, so how did he turn to do financial analysis on YouTube? Seems pretty convenient that he just became an expert in stock analysis as YouTube videos on such things were booming.\n\nYou can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/Vq4ov7x), he didn\u2019t make a single stock analysis for the most part of 2020, which seems pretty off, as now most of his videos are on stock analysis, and while his channel was created in 2017, he conveniently deleted all the previous videos, which is another weird move to do.\n\nI also went on a deep internet dive and did a lot of searching about him and I found this video [podcast](https://imgur.com/09mBKRU) of him.\n\nHis main intro in this podcast is that he works as a consultant indeed, from Israel, and also the consultancy job isn\u2019t for a financial company, it\u2019s rather to help people on YouTube grow, so let's look at some extracts from the video:\n\n[**Exibit I**](https://streamable.com/xrbv3o) \\- We can see the main part of the talk is nothing about anything related to his financial past, let\u2019s continue\n\n[**Exibit II**](https://imgur.com/Ziftnpi) \\- It seems he started with a gaming channel, not even a fake guru channel, and I also found something about that FB [GROUP](https://imgur.com/Xdt4H1i) which isn\u2019t active anymore and all of the videos he made for that have also been deleted as you can see in this [post](https://imgur.com/FyKSrIq) from way back in 2018 as he was [teaching](https://imgur.com/T5lbbH2) how to make money on YouTube well through 2019, and was even giving out free workshop [experiences](https://imgur.com/K89Yk3S)  as he was pumping out creator [content](https://imgur.com/z196rMB) which is miles apart from financial analysis (BTW, he is using the same freaking photo in his old banner &amp; logo as his current one, just changing the green screen background), just look at [his](https://imgur.com/JUnuYDE) old YouTube banner (YouTube tips &amp; tutorials)\n\n[**Exibit III**](https://imgur.com/kZddAl3) \\- Yeah, it seems he also did some video on how to promote on Reddit, and what comes next guys is literally mind blowing, how much more can this dude lie &amp; hide?\n\n[**Exibit IV**](https://streamable.com/ji6ne2) \\-  Well\u2026 Nothing to hide then\u2026 He even had a Fiverr account which was called tomernash you can see clearly [HERE](https://imgur.com/topDW52), that is his username, and when I went out to check it out right now, he is [using](https://imgur.com/HVqNkwv) a fake picture &amp; and still might live in Israel, not the US, and on top of this he might not actually even be from Russia, which he has been saying over &amp; over again on his channel. You can [SEE](https://imgur.com/18Yiimf) he reiterates he is a certified YouTube consultant with no mention of his financial skills or certifications.\n\nAnd even more, you see what picture he uses as a logo yeah? Well, I did a reverse google search and found the other guy also has a YouTube [channel](https://imgur.com/DWpofDb) about kinetic cycling.\n\nMaybe he was one of his clients that he reached a deal to use his picture, wtf, the more I dig in the more I am amazed of the lengths this man has gone to reach fame on YouTube.\n\n[**Exibit V**](https://streamable.com/sdtd7d) \\- So\u2026 A financial analyst with no sheets, no paper, no nothing, great stuff for a senior financial analyst, I literally can\u2019t take more of this so let\u2019s move to the next reasons\n\n**3) Getting in front of the lie? \u274c**\n\nI believe that\u2019s what he was trying to do to, by making a [VIDEO](https://imgur.com/CeH7ePh) on this very subject in mid-2020 and popping up higher in the search rankings before his channel boomed.\n\nIn the video he clarifies that Tom Nash isn\u2019t his real name, but he also restated that he was working for a big consultancy firm as recent as this summer, and that he does shit tons of stuff which is very hard to believe, as usually this big consultancy firms have different departments for different things that he mentioned in the video. You can still find that video on his channel if you are interested\n\nBut, by the way, how was he working on that job while also doing hundreds of Fiverr jobs as a YouTube consultant?\n\nHe also claims to not offering any courses, e-books or other stuff like this, which is false as i showed in the previous reasons with his past YouTube courses &amp; other stuff, and as you will see in the next reasons, something smells really bad out here.\n\n**4) Claims about his past \u274c**\n\nI also took a deeper dive into more of his past, as you can see in [his](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) previous channel cover and info, he had only about 4K subscribers as he was doing guru video reviews on YouTube, but all of a sudden, he [became](https://imgur.com/r6X2yHg) a senior financial analyst from wall street that was living in Israel &amp; doing Fiverr gigs, I don\u2019t know what to say but it seems pretty fishy to me.\n\nI also checked his LinkedIn [page](https://imgur.com/Xpbq7Im), and all of his skills &amp; endorsements seem to be related to his YouTube skills and nothing about finance or the stock market.\n\nBut I also found his [profile](https://imgur.com/9FxHnCb) on Quora, where he wasn\u2019t that active but still, well back in [2017](https://imgur.com/EUPer8h) he was posting things about gaming &amp; YouTube while supposedly still working on Wall Street as a financial analyst, and it\u2019s interesting that there is no [mention](https://imgur.com/kcpxh2X) of him following anything related to stocks, finance, economy, accounting, statistics or anything other related to the stock market.\n\nSo yeah guys, I guess when you make a new type of video and it boosts your channel from just [10K](https://imgur.com/GEvQ7yB) subscribers all the way up to [150K](https://imgur.com/3F0D4rI) subscribers, you are willing to push the limits and lie about your past just to keep everything going, as YouTube is a really good way to make money right now.\n\n**5) The Transformation \u274c**\n\nHe has had even more channels in the past not only this one, which he has transformed overnight from a YouTube Channel [Reviewer](https://imgur.com/JUnuYDE) to a Guru [Reviewer](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) and finally to a financial [analyst](https://imgur.com/oCIBljZ) , as He created a second &amp; third YouTube account called [GearlyReviews](https://imgur.com/9vAPlu3) where he reviews electronics and [EuroBall](https://imgur.com/G130Wgr) where he only posted 2 videos.\n\nI also searched him through his Reddit [posts](https://imgur.com/zmsRhbB) and only could find things related to marketing &amp; social media, nothing about finance yet again.\n\n# So, my personal opinion which I doubt to be wrong guys, if there is a case of a dubious &amp; fishy person out there, he is one of them!\n\nI believe that he has never worked as a senior financial analyst and especially not a stock market, asset or any other type of equity analyst.\n\nMost of his stock [picks](https://imgur.com/uOgFNkQ) are small-caps that are highly volatile or a couple of recent high flyers which are very catchy to any YouTube audience.\n\nThere are many things wrong about the picture he has painted about himself even though he has gone through a lot to try and erase his past. The fact that there are no mentions of things from the wall street or consulting firm, bad stock analysis and methods, fishy and dubious moves of his YouTube channels and especially fishy things about him being a consultant &amp; analyst in early 2020 while he was already doing YouTube and other stuff back in 2017-2018 really makes me not want to buy his story.\n\nFolks, be careful out there, you can find a lot of YouTubers out there who make more money from their advice giving on YouTube, Patreon or other kind of subscriptions and courses, compared to the actual money they are making or have ever made in the stock market.\n\nSo yeah guys, I don\u2019t want to make a final judgment on this guy, but you should consider everything I have showed about him and all the problems with his past &amp; his financial methods &amp; just remember as always **in a bull market everyone is an expert &amp; genius**, while in a bear market you can\u2019t find any of these people as they all flee.\n\nThank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "I think that cybersecurity will be this years winner (yes, maybe even more than semi-conductors). I want to pick 3 stocks to hold for the next 5+ years. I have a brief description (from yahoo finance I know...) what they do, my suggestions are: \n\n  \n**CRWD - Crowdstrike Holdings.** provides a broad spectrum of solutions with their main aim being intrusion and breach prevention, such as some of the breaches they helped investigate \u2013 high-profile cases such as Sony Pictures and the DNC.\n\n**FTNT** \\- **Fortinet**  is one of the dominant players in the Unified Threat Management (UTM) space, which is one of the fastest-evolving segments in the network security space.\n\nThe company\u2019s ability to meld next-generation, cloud-based firewalls with SD-WAN allows it to grab an early lead in the SASE market. Its Opaq Networks buyout in July will act like a catalyst. Also, this company has been gaining from heightening cyber-attack risks that are propelling demand for its FortiMail platform.\n\n**PANW - Palo Alto Networks** is a giant when it comes to providing firewalls and various cloud-based services to extend the functionalities of these firewalls. They have a multinational market, outperforming even Cisco in this year\u2019s second quarter.\n\nEqually, when it comes to trading, the number of bullish hedge fund positions moved up by 8 in recent months. The company was in 59 hedge funds\u2019 portfolios at the end of the third quarter of 2020. The all time high for this statistics is 52. This means the bullish number of hedge fund positions in this stock **currently sits at its all time high**.\n\n**OKTA: Okta** provides identity authentication services. This means building a way to verify and enforce who accesses what at any given time, from your run-of-the-mill passwords to biometrics. Okta has been a strong up-and-comer since last year it almost doubled its revenue and beat analysts\u2019 predictions by some $11 million.\n\nStarting with a mainly SMB-oriented client pool, Okta has since leveled up to serving **over 1400 enterprises** with **revenue over $100 000** out of 8000 reported clients. This number continues to grow rapidly.\n\n**NET** \\- **Cloudflare**: is a leader in edge computing. It handles a good part of the traffic the average consumer goes through online today. With services such as DDoS mitigation and internet security, it acts like a reverse proxy between you and the websites you visit.\n\nAside from establishing itself as an internet power, Cloudflare had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange just last year. This year it has been one of the best-performing US stocks, currently **being found on 44 hedge fund portfolios**, way above its all time high of 33.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwhich 3 should I choose? Or any other suggestions? All of them had insane growth in the last year, some with very high p/e ratios.",

        "selftext": "Who are they and what do they do?\n\nQMC Quantum Minerals Corp., is an exploration stage company, engages in the acquisition, exploration, development, and evaluation of resource properties in Canada. The company explores for lithium, copper, nickel, gold, silver, palladium, platinum, and zinc deposits. Its flagship project is the Irgon Lithium Mine, which consists of 22 mining claims totaling 11,325 acres located in Manitoba, Canada. QMC Quantum Minerals Corp. was incorporated in 2003 and is based in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nTowards the end of 2020 there was an announcement that $3.3B CDN in funding would be allocated to build Electric Vehicles (\"EV\") and batteries within Canada. That being said, QMC is ideally positioned to source the required metals.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\n1. $1.8 Billion Federal and Provincial Funding for Oakville EV plant\n\n2. $1.5 Billion Fiat Chrysler investment in Windsor EV plant\n\n3. Critical elements: lithium, copper, zinc, nickel\n\n4. Historical resource of 1.2M tons of 1.51% lithium oxide\n\n5. Extensive potential of copper, nickel, gold, and zinc with 41 deposit potential targets\n\nOverall, QMC is in an extremely favourable position to gain significantly through the announcement on October 8th by the Federal Government of Canada and the Province of Ontario that they would provide a total investment commitment of $590 million CDN into the $1.8-billion CDN retooling of Ford Motor's Oakville Ontario assembly plant making it the hub of EV production in Canada. This investment and retooling will make Ford Motor's Canadian production facility the largest electric vehicle assembly plant in North America. This project will build five new electric vehicle models and the batteries that will power these vehicles.\n\nFiat Chrysler followed up a week later announcing a $1.5-billion investment in their Windsor assembly plant. The investment would outfit the factory with the state-of-the-art equipment that will enable the assembly of plug-in hybrids and battery-powered vehicles with at least one new model in 2025. The plant will add up to 2,000 jobs to the Windsor plant.\n\nTo produce these vehicles specialized raw materials will be required. In addition to typical commodities required to manufacture vehicles, EVs require four additional critical elements: lithium, copper, zinc, and nickel which QMC is moving towards becoming a producer of ALL of these commodities (plus potentially gaining platinum, palladium, silver and gold credits) through the ongoing development of its Irgon Lithium (Spodumene) Mine Project and Namew Lake District (Volcanic Massive Sulphide (\"VMS\") Projects.\n\nNamew Lake District Project\n\nSituated in the renowned Flin Flon and Snow Lake districts of Manitoba known for its world-class VMS deposits, the company land package covers 55,000 acres. The project is contiguous to the western side of Hudbay Minerals' (HBM-TSX) Namew Lake Mine which has produced 2.57 million tons of nickel, copper, palladium, and platinum. The Namew Lake Project is also in the vicinity of the currently producing 777 and Lalor mines, in addition to being proximal to the past-producing Reed Lake Mine. In addition to being in close proximity to these other deposits, the company's district sized Namew Lake Project displays similar underlying geology to the aforementioned mines. The project hosts 41 deposit sized targets outlined in a versatile time domain electromagnetic (VTEM) system survey.\n\nThe Irgon Lithium Mine Project\n\nBetween 1953-1954, the Lithium Corporation of Canada Limited drilled 25 holes into the Irgon Dike and subsequently reported a historical resource estimate of 1.2 million tons grading 1.51% Li20 over a strike length of 365 meters and to a depth of 213 meters (Northern Miner, Vol. 41, no.19, Aug. 4, 1955, p.3). This historical resource is documented in a 1956 Assessment Report by B. B. Bannatyne for the Lithium Corporation of Canada Ltd. (Manitoba Assessment Report No. 94932). This historical estimate is believed to be based on reasonable assumptions, and neither the company nor the QP has any reason to contest the document's relevance and reliability. The detailed channel sampling and a subsequent drill program will be required to update this historical resource to current NI 43-101 standards. Historic metallurgical tests reported an 87% recovery from which a concentrate averaging 5.9% Li2O was obtained.\n\nDuring this historical 1950-era work program, a complete mining plant was installed onsite, designed to process 500 tons of ore per day, and a three-compartment shaft was sunk to a depth of 74 meters. On the 61-metre level, lateral development was extended off the shaft for a total of 366 meters of drifting, from which seven crosscuts transected the dike.\n\nThe Company has had recent discussions with Sinomine Group, Co., Ltd. (\"Sinomine\") to process spodumene material from the Irgon Lithium Mine Property at their TANCO plant. The TANCO plant is easily accessible, located approximately 20km directly south of the Irgon Lithium Mine Property via Highway 314. The TANCO management have provided the Company with an estimate to prepare samples (crushing and grinding), floatation testing, assaying and analysis for preliminary metallurgical evaluation. The testing will provide the Company with a lithium concentrate, in the past the TANCO circuitry was able to achieve lithium concentrate levels up 7.25% Li2O to Dow Corning. The Company expects to achieve at least 6% Li2O in this round of testing.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone. Have a general questions about some of my paper trades.\n\nThis is my second week paper trading. I have a system in place for selling credit spreads with a defined exit, R:R and probability of success. After being a long time lurking student for \\~3 years I'm dipping my toes in with some confidence. The majority of my trades have gone to plan, but there has been one trade last week and one trade this week that have abnormally high profits and I'm curious what is going on to make that happen. My usual trade is risk 800 to win 200, but on $GLW this week I show a (paper) profit of 1870 for the day. Last week it was UAA for a very similar situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Open Position](https://preview.redd.it/i30iixeqzqg61.png?width=1019&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1dec66a40f6cd839d0c2fe034351a0576d191699)\n\nObviously since my max profit from the contracts at expiration is $200 I would love to take the $1870 profit but when i try and sell it I get an invalid price error and the combined mark price of the two legs (i hope i referred to this correctly) is negative (my understanding is this i where my error is derived from).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Attempted Closing Order](https://preview.redd.it/iqkrex531rg61.png?width=1120&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acb6edd41373cdf4a161842d0c9e19fbfed182ea)\n\nIf I take the combined mark price of my two legs and place it at .00 it will be have a profit of $200 (my expected max profit). Is this because my legs are hedged against each other? Is there a way to get more than $200 before expiration?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fym9s97i2rg61.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c11a898a7d2c27e309cadc9d6835619ceddcb3ca\n\nIs the expected play here to try and grab the $200 profit with a closing order asap or else just wait until expiration to collect my premiums?  I let UAA expire last week and my paper trading account accounted for the \\~2k worth of profit which just doesn't seem remotely possible given my max P/L. I would gladly take the profit, but it seems like I'm missing something here and I'd like to know what is going on so I can bail myself out as much as possible when it inevitably happens the other way on a 2k loss.\n\nI'll gladly take any pointers or *constructive* criticism, thank you for reading.",

        "selftext": "HPQ-Silicon Resources Inc: tickers (hpq.v - tsx and uragf - otc) has developed technology that reduces the cost of producing silicon-based spherical nanopowders &amp; nanowires, making this company an essential leader of the renewable energy revolution moving into the future.\n\nHPQ is currently being shorted by cynical wall street investors trying to leech off of the company\u2019s value. These predatory tactics are limited, however, as HPQ has a growing legion of loyal supporters that will soon send shorters into oblivion.\n\nWhy is HPQ being targeted by shorters? HPQ has the backing of the Quebec government and is partnered with Pyrogenesis, an equally promising green-solutions company that has attracted the attention of the ARK investment portfolio. HPQ\u2019s nano silicon powder will be instrumental in making silicon batteries, hydrogen fuel cells and solar panels to deliver on a promise for a greener future. HPQ has recently surpassed industry expectations by producing silicon nanopowder smaller than 100 nanometers, which is critical for these applications.\n\nThe HPQ/PYR dream team has the ability to produce economically viable Si-NPs (nano size of is totally customizable) using a process that is SCALABLE. This breakthrough is exclusive to HPQ Silicon and holds the key to renewable energy profits in the aforementioned sectors. As a result of this potential, HPQ has already secured NDA\u2019s and orders for their product from electric vehicle manufacturers.\n\nHPQ\u2019s ability to produce high-quality silicon powder at far cheaper rates than its competitors (with little to no environmental footprint) makes this company a highly strategic acquisition by TESLA and other EV companies. You owe it to yourself to do some due diligence in this company if you consider yourself a renewable/green investor, or wanting to join the movement of sending cynical shorts crying home to their mothers.\n\nThis is the year that HPQ reveals its partnerships that will bring the renewable energy revolution to reality; a disruptive innovation in silicon production using low-cost, green technology, creating a paradigm shift in energy storage &amp; generation.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR: We're being defrauded! Register your certificates! Hold Wall St. accountable! There are links at the bottom on how to register your certificates in your name using DRS. There is also a SEC link that explains different forms of stock ownership and how brokers will commonly use \"street ownership\" where they just use a spreadsheet to track stocks internally, they're the only one who knows who owns what. They're making shares up out of thin air, depriving you of your voting and dividend rights and keeping it secret.\n\nI also recommend screenshotting how many shares you have in case they start deleting them like the did in Canada with CMKM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRead this paper: [https://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2020/03/how-phantom-shares-on-wall-street-threaten-u-s-companies-and-investors/](https://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2020/03/how-phantom-shares-on-wall-street-threaten-u-s-companies-and-investors/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo, seriously, retard, read it. It's an article covering the research of a PhD in economics who has witnessed first hand what I'm about to tell you and is a big deal herself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur shares in $GME most likely don't exist. Wall St. has been perpetuating the biggest and most widespread fraud in human history. They were almost caught in 2008, but (to their relief) it only affected one sector of the economy and they were bailed out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is a fail to deliver? A fail to deliver is a concept used on Wall St. to denote when a lent share (for shorting or any other reason) isn't paid back. You would think that these companies would be mad that they're getting shafted for a share, but no, they're paid some hush money called an \"entitlement\" and they keep quiet. They keep quiet because it was never their money to begin with -- they tell the trader that they have the share and the broker pockets the entitlement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Why naked short? When one broker can sell shares to your broker and simply fail to deliver at settlement, the broker does not have to bear the expense of stock borrowing. And the system lets them. Or they could avoid the expense of borrowing by short selling shares and marking them long. Sometimes, when the sellers really own the shares, their brokers may not transfer them to buyers. That and naked shorting both yield fails to deliver.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If the shares ever arrive, the broker sends the money to the seller\u2018s broker. But once the trader knows that the broker agrees to fail to deliver his sell orders, he or she knows that all fails will persist and is free to naked short millions of shares for years to wait for the desired price drop.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;People who buy the undelivered shares get an \u201centitlement,\u201d and the money they paid stays with their broker, who can use it, interest free. The dollar value of shares purchased but not received is a free loan from the investor to the broker. The investors don\u2018t know. The broker is not required to tell the client that he took the payment and did not receive any shares.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've been thinking that the big thing going on here is a naked short, but it's **so** much larger than that. My guess is that retail $GME holders on WSB alone hold over 100% of the available-to-trade shares and the brokers are losing their minds. Doesn't it seem odd that they're lying all over the news and putting articles out about \"losing interest\" and \"moving to silver\" and yelling and crying every day over the overleveraged short position of **ONE** hedge fund? It seemed odd to me, too. They're worried because they're on the verge of being found out as a system and causing a crash just like what happened in '29\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;But in a system wracked with fraud, traders engage in naked short selling, when they sell stock they don\u2018t own and never buy to deliver. So now there are two shares, the real one that was never delivered and a phantom \u201centitlement\u201d given the unsuspecting buyer which is recorded as such by his broker. And which the buyer can now sell! Because the brokers pretend there are real shares there.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Making two shares out of one is among the swindles that crashed the market in 1929. It was called \u201cwatering the stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has happened before, too. In Canada.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;CMKM was a Canadian company with an interest in diamonds. The shareholders didn\u2018t know that mineral rights they were told about were owned by the founders, not the company. Criminal and civil complaints ensued. A reform management changed the company name to New Horizons Holdings, Inc with a plan to raise capital for the purchase of oil or gas assets. If successful, they would be able to return the shares to trading status with the hope of restoring value to shareholders.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;NHH directed all shareholders to obtain their stock certificates and exchange them for new shares. That\u2018s when the masses of phantom shares and corruption of some big brokers came into stark view. Many investors discovered that their brokers had taken their money and never bought or received CMKM shares.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trimbath, who worked investigating the scam, calls theses victims \u201cUnShareholders,\u201d investors who reported that their share positions were deleted by their brokers and/or where brokers refused to provide them with share certificates registered in the investors\u2018 names so they could meet the exchange requirements of a \u201cbona fide shareholder.\u201d She said, \u201cDocuments I saw suggested three brokerage firms probably took payments from investors for shares that were never received from the selling broker\u2026 Charles Schwab, Chase Bank and RBC Dain.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The investors had \u201cphantom shares.\u201d They were allocated a fail to receive on the broker\u2018s own books, but payment money was taken from their cash accounts, and they continued to receive statements showing share positions for CMKM.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She said, \u201cInvestors submitted documentation showing that each of these brokers deleted their CMKM share positions at a time when we can demonstrate that the firms had no shares either in the depository or on the books of the issuer.\u201d They deleted the evidence of the phantom shares.\\\\\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey're not obligated to tell us that they don't actually own the underlying stock certificate and they're paying \"unqualified\" dividends to us to make us think that we do -- oh, by the way, these dividends are taxed as income and aren't eligible for dividend tax rates. Another way they're ramming our ass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;When settlement failures happen, the shares you buy may not be in your brokerage account regardless of what your broker statement says.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Let\u2018s say that your broker gets one of these fails to receive. First of all, they don\u2018t tell you that they got a fail to receive. If you were an institutional buyer or a high-value client, they will tell you that they failed to receive and they will give you some monetary compensation for the delay and inconvenience. They don\u2018t tell individual retail investors. If they did, they would have to share the revenue they earn on investors\u2018 money already paid them for the shares, since brokers don\u2018t have to transfer money for shares they fail to receive.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The question then becomes, \u201cWell, how did I get dividends?\u201d You didn\u2018t really get dividends, you got \u201cdividends in lieu.\u201d That means the broker sent money (maybe part of *your* money) as dividends. You will know this if your 1099 from the broker says \u201cunqualified dividends.\u201d They are generally considered ordinary income and not eligible for dividend\u00a0tax rates.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sometimes, a large broker with many clients seeking the same stock will receive only part of a particular share order. Some clients get real shares, others phantom entitlements. Trimbath said an investor might ask, \u201cHow did I get picked out for that?\u201d She said, \u201cThe problem is, we don\u2018t know. And they won\u2018t tell us. If you were assigned the fail to receive, then the broker has many options, none of which they have to tell you.\u201d\n\nOh, and they're fucking our voting rights! They're letting us vote and then throwing out the votes they don't like. Legally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Before the 2008 crash, at an annual proxy meeting, Bank of America counted 130% of its shares voted, that is, they received 30% more votes than they had shares outstanding. That\u2018s just the number of people who actually voted their shares! Imagine how many shares were sold beyond what they actually authorized and issued. This violates the voting rights of shareholders and reduces effective corporate governance.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trimbath pointed out, Let\u2018s say it\u2018s the merger of Compaq and Hewlett Packard. Let\u2018s say that there are a lot of these extra shares around and they have more votes than shares coming in. And let\u2018s say that your broker/dealer is JP Morgan, who was actually one of the advisors on that merger deal. They stood to gain more in fees if the merger went through than if it was voted down. Do you think that they would be so careful about your vote that if you voted against something they were in favor of that they would not be tempted to only turn in the votes that they thought should be counted, those that were most favorable to their position, as opposed to trying to make sure that everything was done according to the rules. But, there are no rules! They just make them up as they go along.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She said, They can, in fact, throw out your vote and just not count it. They can randomly assign your vote to some real proxy that wasn\u2018t voted. They can vote what shares they actually do have proportionally based on how many phantom votes come in. It\u2018s all done in secrecy. They don\u2018t have to tell you, they don\u2018t have to tell the NYSE, they don\u2018t have to tell anyone. They don\u2018t have to tell the company whose shares they voted.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And the SEC isn\u2018t interested. To deal with over-voting, the SEC didn\u2018t say, Stop telling clients they have voting shares when they don\u2018t. It said, Don\u2018t submit more votes than shares you are holding. And brokers could choose which votes they wanted to submit!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey even have cutsy little names for their fuckery and fraud.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Even a university economist who spent 2004 at the SEC studying fails acknowledged in so many words that the broker-dealers do it on purpose. Leslie Boni (now with a hedge fund in Southern California) attributed the extraordinary increase in settlement failures to investment decisions known as \u201c**strategic failures**.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trimbath noted that in 2007, \u201cThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2018s Treasury Markets Practices Group (TMPG) describes several intentionally abusive practices such as **\u201cslamming the wire**\u201d (holding back deliveries until immediately before the close with the intention of causing settlement fails) and requests from traders for settlement operations to \u201c**hold the box**\u201d (a demand to delay settlement of an executed trade). The fact that these practices are colloquially named and described in such detail indicates that they are common causes of settlement failures.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh! Everyone saying it's illegal to naked short? Only sort of. Only for the stock of certain financial companies. That's right, they only made it illegal to drive down the valuation of their buddies. *(Edit: they did extend this rule to all companies later in the year after pressure from businesses)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The SEC continued to declare that fails to deliver were not an indication of naked short selling. That changed when Goldman Sachs and other financial firms needed to be protected. Trimbath pointed out that not till the banks/broker-dealers began to see massive numbers of fails to deliver in their own shares did the SEC put a short-selling ban in place \u2013 but only for the shares of banks, insurance companies and securities firms, including the very culprits responsible for the dirty system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, it's a big problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission: In the first two weeks of July 2019, 914,261,864 shares valued at over $17 billion failed to deliver in settlement from the clearing house, an average of about $1.9 billion every settlement day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's with all of the shady shit they can do to hide the numbers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Trimbath blames the massive fails on the DTCC and its subsidiaries, DTC (Depository Trust Company), the vault that holds the shares, and NSCC (National Securities Clearing Corp), which clears and settles trades, that is, handles the exchange of money and shares which are registered in the accounts of its members, the big banks/broker-dealers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Securities and Exchange Act of 1933 specifically gave the clearing house the right to require that shares and securities be delivered for settlement. It allows them to punish those who don\u2018t deliver by refusing to have them in the system.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trimbath said, \u201cThe DTCC has for years ignored that.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She said, \u201cThe 2007 Reg SHO amendment says you cannot short again without borrowing: but only DTCC and SEC know who failed to deliver, so how is that functional?\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Till 2013, in fact, the NSCC had a program to automatically borrow shares from DTC members to cover fails before settlement. DTC members can still lend shares from their accounts.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She said the DTCC creates a mirage that there aren\u2018t any fails, or are many fewer than appears. Wall Street benefits from a service that automatically resubmits settlement failures, what the DTCC calls \u201cfail transactions.\u201d Many trades that fail to settle are required to be re-submitted, where they receive new settlement dates, in essence, erasing the fail to deliver by creating a new record. When this happens, the records show that the fail transactions are no longer outstanding; the next day begins with zero fails.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome estimates put the number at 50,000% larger or **$400 billion in phantom trading per WEEK**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe DTCC, who is supposed to make sure that you actually have a physical stock certificate underneath what the broker tells you that you have is enabling this. They're a private corporation and they're in league with the brokers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The answer is that the banks and brokers who use DTCC\u2018s services, who process trades there, who fail to deliver there, are insiders who sit on the DTCC Board of Directors. And the feeble SEC, dominated by the industry it is supposed to regulate, fails to require the DTCC to impose sanctions on errant members.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe DTCC, the brokers, and fucking **CONGRESS** are blocking any efforts to fix this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Harmer said in the film that the DTCC sabotaged their efforts. And that SEC chair William Donaldson also opposed them. Harmer said, To him, the whole business of trading securities belongs to the major brokers, they are the ones who are running this, and you folks down in Washington should not meddle in this or you\u2018re going to upset the apple cart.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;According to Harmer, They also got to Chairman Shelby.\u00a0 And so, Shelby said to Bennett \u2014 I think we oughta wait and give the SEC a chance to come in and explain their position. And so, we were simply the victims of a very effectively executed strategy to make sure that there were no hearings on this, and even to make sure that Senator Bennett did not introduce the bill.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A story in *The Washington Post* in 2012 helped explain the lack of enthusiasm in Congress for reforming the processes that lead to phantom shares. \u201cIn 2008, for instance, 17 lawmakers reported investing hundreds of thousands of dollars in short-selling funds,\u201d including bets against U.S. Treasury bonds, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The SEC\u2018s \u201creforms\u201d had little effect. Compared to $6 billion in daily fails in 2003, the number was $7.4 billion for February 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe can uncover their fuckery! Demand that your broker register your certificates in your name! Show the world that we own more than 100% of $GME's float!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can use DRS to register your stocks in your name.

        "selftext": "TOday I did research to calm myself down after pounding a redbull and getting triggered by all the misinformation and greedy nitwits that have flooded this site looking for a quick flip.\n\nImagine you\u2019re John Chen. Sauntering down the hallway, with your 50 pound dick grazing the velveteen carpet with each step. You hear the guttural screams coming out of sales. You walk by the engineers, and gaze upon the latest widget as they kowtow before your bespecled grandeur. You hear about the customers who sing your praises, and the (much fewer) ones who tell you your product sucks donkey balls... But we (the retards @ WSB or frankly the dubmasses @ seeking alpha and even JP Morgan equity coverage) don\u2019t know the details any of this, only dry ass reports that come out every quarter.\n\nSo, other than hacking into John\u2019s brain (not recommended), what can we do? We can suckle at the teat of Twitter announcements, and sometimes that\u2019s fun but usually it\u2019s PR driven (unless it comes from Papa Chen\u2019s account in which case suckle away).\n\nBut boy oh boy wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could know the things P. Chiddy does. What new things are in development. Big new sales in the pipeline. Whether the company is hiring (or shrinking), and in what areas\u2026.Wait. For the last thing we actually can!\n\nthanks to the grotesquely fat (and very rich, no offense Gabe) founder of a soul-crushing professional network called LinkedIn. Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So let\u2019s see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?\n\nTo start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If you\u2019re a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If you\u2019re growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they don\u2019t think they need, and last time I checked $BB\u2019s CFO wasn\u2019t completely retarded. Now, it\u2019s important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c they\u2019re growing, duh) and vice versa.\n\nFANG isn\u2019t a perfect comp (I\u2019ll get to the others in a sec), but **serves as a good proxy of a \u201cbaseline growthy\u201d tech.** No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking. See below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1g1ubpfxize61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58d58b12644e9688e15e35e907386b910b9d938d\n\n# IMPLICATION NUMBER #1 - $$BB COMPARES FAVORABLY TO FANG IN TERMS OF HEADCOUNT-IMPLIED GROWTH. IF YOU SAID \u201c$BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG\u201d, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOU\u2019D BE RIGHT!!\n\n\u201cBut wait,\u201d you say. \u201cgrowthinvestor123 you fucking idiot, [didn\u2019t you just compare $BB to CRWD, ZS, SAIL, and PANW](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/) to justify a **$60 / share** price target for $BB? I want to see the ratios for those.\u201d Ok you, got me. See below, headcount-implied growth is higher for endpoint security comparables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eaz3begzize61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d01221903b3c50a6838710f32daa173035eb9e92\n\n\u201cHah,\u201d you say smugly. \u201cThose other endpoint security businesses blow $BB out of the water, $BB sucks\u201d.\n\nNo, you fucking idiot. If a simple headcount ratio without context was all it took I\u2019d be rich instead of handsome like mommy tells me.\n\n$BB went through [**round**](https://channeldailynews.com/news/layoffs-hit-blackberry-in-waterloo/28015) after [**round**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=blackberry+layoffs&amp;atb=v224-1&amp;ia=web&amp;iai=r1-3&amp;page=1&amp;sexp=%7B%22cdrexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22artexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prodexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prdsdexp%22%3A%22c%22%2C%22biaexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22msvrtexp%22%3A%22b%22%7D) of painful layoffs as it shifted from being a handset business to what it is today. Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a **history**, and that is a blessing and a curse.\n\n**Remember**, Daddy chen\u2019s primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other??? And these smart monkes who were retained \u2013 Well, no need to make a job posting for that role anymore, right?\n\n# IMPLICATION #2 \u2013 BLACKBERRY HAD &gt; 20K EMPLOYEES. UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS. HAVING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES QUICKLY LIKE CERTAIN COMPETITORS\n\nThis brings me to the final part of our headcount analysis. Let\u2019s look at those endpoint security comparables again. Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Let\u2019s look at two two non-retard quotes \u2013\n\n***\"I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company.\" Steve Jobs***\n\n***\u201cIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it\u2019s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.\u201d Peter Thiel***\n\nI was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BB\u2019s Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales. See below\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6nog6m62jze61.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb26266cbef428abb3152f1b9077c1a0daee07b0\n\nEven as a $BB bull, I didn\u2019t expect the discrepancy to be so large.\n\n# IMPLICATION #3 \u2013 BLACKBERRY ACTUALLY IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING / IT FOCUSED COMPANY RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS. IN MANY WAYS IT IS MORE OF A \u201cSTART-UP\u201d. EVEN WITH FINANCIAL PRESSURE, JOHNNY CHEN RETAINED TECHNICAL TALENT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE, AND VALUATION ???\n\n**TLDR: BB IS NOT A ROCKET SHIP. IT IS A LONG RANGE SHUTTLE, CAPABLE OF BURSTS OF SPEED, PACKED TO THE GILLS WITH RETARDS AND TERRAFORMING EQUIPMENT AND HEADING TO MARS.**\n\n Add'l edit for those who can't read good - \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 ",

        "selftext": "This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or \"counterfeit\" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.\n\nMuch of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.\n\nOne thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**Methodology**\n\nI'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that\n\n1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.\n2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.\n3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date\n\nHowever, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.\n\n**The Code**\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    import time\n    import requests\n    POLYGON_API_KEY = '&lt;ADD YOUR API KEY HERE&gt;'\n    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&amp;apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY\n    \n    data\n    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))\n    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n    for line in f:\n        parts = line.split('|');\n        date = parts[0]\n        ticker = parts[2]\n        try:\n            fails = int(parts[3])\n            price = float(parts[5])\n            value_of_fails = price * fails\n            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)\n        except ValueError:\n            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')\n            pass\n    \n    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():\n        day = int(date[-2:])\n        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))\n        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])\n        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] &gt; 10000000, sorted_stocks)\n        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:\n            val_of_fails = data[0]\n            num_fails = data[1]\n            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))\n            res = req.json()\n            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':\n                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))\n                continue\n            else:\n                try:\n                    volume = res['volume']\n                except KeyError:\n                    print(res)\n            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)\n            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100\n            print('{: &lt;6} ${: &lt;5} {: &lt;9} / {: &lt; 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))\n\nHere's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.\n\nIf everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value &gt; 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.\n\n**The Results**\n\n    Data for Jan 4\n    RMO    $10M   455173

        "selftext": "Bullish on FEYE over next few quarters. To me it\u2019s unclear how the recent SolarWinds hack will impact Q4 earnings due to the timing of the hack. On a recent conf call Mandia mentioned that Incident Response hours aren\u2019t billed until after the incident response engagement is over. The SolarWinds news broke on Sunday Dec 13th.  Response engagements of this scale typically take weeks if not months. So we might be looking at meeting Q4 estimates but raising Q1 guidance.  Even without a beat, I\u2019ll take this as a bullish sign. \n\nI\u2019ve been watching job openings at FireEye for the last month.  They\u2019ve been recruiting non-stop and a large portion of these at Incident Response or other services consultants. There are currently 192 open roles.  \n\nBack of the napkin calculations are... many of the senior roles will be sent immediately into the field at a billing rate between $250-$450. At a 80% utilization that is between $400k-$720k per head per year. If they have hired between 50-100 people into these roles since the Solarwinds hack that is could lead to $20M-$36M revenue increase on the low end to $40M-$72M on the high end. With current annual revenues at $928M we could see an annual revenue increase of 7% on these services alone which is above their current 6.9% revenue growth rate. If we see acceleration in any of their newish businesses like Managed Defense and Mandiant Advantage Cyber Threat Intelligence services we could have a great growth story on our hands. Incident Response services are (hopefully) a one time thing for breached companies but Managed Defense and Intel services are a recurring revenue stream, so growth in these areas would be a very good thing indeed. \n\nAny upticks in the hardware business would be positive news, but I believe they are facing upgrade cycle challenges and I\u2019m not expecting much on this front. \n\nFinally, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we saw FEYE acquired by a larger player in the next few months. There have been multiple rounds of rumors over the last few years that indicate FEYE has hired an investment bank to assist with the process. While Mandia hasn\u2019t confirmed these rumors, he hasn\u2019t denied them either. Cisco allegedly passed. I think good candidates are Microsoft, IBM or even someone like CrowdStrike using their astronomically high share price to swing a deal and create a cyber powerhouse to rival Pali Alto.  \n\nI\u2019m long with shares, considering NTM/OTM LEAPS, might by some June calls.  FD weeklies might payout but are risky IMO.",

        "selftext": "**Intro**\n\nKE is a leading integrated online and offline platform for housing transactions and services in China. They are a pioneer in building the industry infrastructure and standards in China to reinvent how service providers and housing customers efficiently navigate and consummate housing transactions, ranging from existing and new home sales, home rentals, to home renovation, real estate financial solutions and other solutions.\n\nMore general info about KE:\n\n[https://investors.ke.com/about-us/default.aspx](https://investors.ke.com/about-us/default.aspx)\n\n**The business**\n\nThe industry KE is operating in is Real Estate. The company was founded in 2001 in China. They have more then 85k employees. \n\nSome highlights about KE:\n\n\u00b7  Massive housing market in China with low efficiency in housing transactions and services.\n\n\u00b7  The operating system, Agent Cooperation Network (CAN), has been transforming the housing transactions and services industry in China. \n\n\u00b7  They utilize new technologies, such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, big data and Internet-of-Things to create and develop real-life use cases and applications to enhance customer experience and service efficiency.\n\n\u00b7  Visionary management team with proven track record of innovations and execution.\n\nThe vision and mission statement:\n\nWe founded our company with the belief that we can transform the housing transactions and services industry in China by improving the quality, efficiency of service providers and enhancing customer experience.\n\nWe aspire to provide comprehensive and trusted housing services through our online and offline platform, to 300 million families.\n\nWow\u2026 300 million families.\n\n**Management**\n\nThe CEO of the company is Peng Yongdong. He is one of the co-founders of the company. Before he was a senior consultant of strategy and revolution at IBM.\n\nFor the other members of the executive team: [https://investors.ke.com/governance/executive-management/default.aspx](https://investors.ke.com/governance/executive-management/default.aspx)\n\n**Business highlights Q3 (non audited)**\n\n* Gross transaction value (GTV)\u00a0was US$154.6 billion, an increase of 87.2% year-over-year.\u00a0GTV of existing home transactions\u00a0was US$84.8 billion, an increase of 71.8% year-over-year.\u00a0GTV of new home transactions\u00a0was US$62.0 billion, an increase of 105.7% year-over-year.\u00a0GTV of emerging and other services\u00a0was US$7.8 billion, an increase of 151.5% year-over-year.\n* Net revenues were US$3.0 billion, an increase of 70.9% year-over-year.\n* Net income\u00a0was US$11 million.\u00a0Adjusted net income was US$274 million, an increase of 210.6% year-over-year.\n* Number of stores\u00a0was 44,883 as of September 30, 2020, a 41.7% increase year-over-year.\n* Number of agents\u00a0was 477,810 as of September 30, 2020, a 50.7% increase year-over-year.\n* Mobile monthly active users (MAU)\u00a0averaged47.9 million, an increase of 82.1% year-over-year.\n\nNotice the increase\u2026 Incredible. They expect for Q4 an increase of app. 33,5% to 40,5% compared to the same quarter in 2019.\n\n**Shareholders**\n\nThe main shareholder is Hui Zuo with 46,8% of the shares. He is the founder and the Chairman of the Board. Second greatest shareholder is Tencent Holdings Limited. Tencent provides services to KE in connection to various aspects of the operations. We all know that Tencent is doing great. The CEO Peng Yongdong also has 3,6% of the shares.\n\nIn August 2020 KE went public on the NYSE. Current market price is approx. $63.\n\n**Market opportunities**\n\nAccording to the CIC Report, China has the largest housing market in the world in terms of GTV and number of transactions of existing and new home sales and home rentals in 2019. After a period of significant growth, the market is expected to enter an era of steady growth. It is expected that the existing home transactions market will gain more importance and grow with a CAGR of 12.4%.\n\n**Risk factors (highlights)**\n\n\u00b7  The business is susceptible to fluctuations in China's residential real estate market and is subject to government regulations.\n\n\u00b7  If they fail to maintain relationships with real estate developers or attract them to engage them, or otherwise fail to procure new real estate property listings at favorable terms, the business and growth prospects may suffer.\n\n\u00b7  If they fail to obtain or keep licenses, permits or approvals applicable to the various services provided by them, they may incur significant financial penalties and other government sanctions.\n\n\u00b7  Competition from other industry players. They may lose market share and customers if they fail to compete effectively. Their greatest competitor is E-House. Alibaba has a large stake (&gt;10%) in E-House.\n\nSEC Filing F-1: [https://investors.ke.com/financials/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=14285443](https://investors.ke.com/financials/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=14285443)\n\n**Own opinion**\n\nKE is a long-term investment for me. They have a great growth potential. I really like the real estate sector, especially in such a large company like China, Also,  I started this DD some days ago. Today I read that ARK Invest also has invested in KE. And let\u2019s be honest; everything Cathie touches turns into gold.",

        "selftext": "*Disclaimer - I am just a retard w/ a keyboard and you should do your own $DD. Also the karma whores @ WSB keep deleting my shit so one of you go post over there if you like $BB and what you read*\n\nTOday I did research to calm myself down after pounding a redbull and getting triggered by all the misinformation and greedy nitwits that have flooded this site looking for a quick flip.\n\nImagine you\u2019re John Chen. Sauntering down the hallway, with your 50 pound dick grazing the velveteen carpet with each step. You hear the guttural screams coming out of sales. You walk by the engineers, and gaze upon the latest widget as they kowtow before your bespecled grandeur. You hear about the customers who sing your praises, and the (much fewer) ones who tell you your product sucks donkey balls... But we (the retards @ WSB or frankly the dubmasses @ seeking alpha and even JP Morgan equity coverage) don\u2019t know the details any of this, only dry ass reports that come out every quarter.\n\nSo, other than hacking into John\u2019s brain (not recommended), what can we do? We can suckle at the teat of Twitter announcements, and sometimes that\u2019s fun but usually it\u2019s PR driven (unless it comes from Papa Chen\u2019s account in which case suckle away).\n\nBut boy oh boy wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could know the things P. Chiddy does. What new things are in development. Big new sales in the pipeline. Whether the company is hiring (or shrinking), and in what areas\u2026.Wait. For the last thing we actually can!\n\nthanks to the grotesquely fat (and very rich, no offense Gabe) founder of a soul-crushing professional network called LinkedIn. Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So let\u2019s see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?\n\nTo start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If you\u2019re a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If you\u2019re growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they don\u2019t think they need, and last time I checked $BB\u2019s CFO wasn\u2019t completely retarded. Now, it\u2019s important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c they\u2019re growing, duh) and vice versa.\n\nFANG isn\u2019t a perfect comp (I\u2019ll get to the others in a sec), but **serves as a good proxy of a \u201cbaseline growthy\u201d tech.** No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking. See below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8x0sjsj4wxe61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc0b996f191f3f47d37bb6b2888f537c6789ae0e\n\n# IMPLICATION NUMBER #1 - $$BB COMPARES FAVORABLY TO FANG IN TERMS OF HEADCOUNT-IMPLIED GROWTH. IF YOU SAID \u201c$BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG\u201d, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOU\u2019D BE RIGHT!!\n\n\u201cBut wait,\u201d you say. \u201cgrowthinvestor123 you fucking idiot, didn\u2019t you just compare $BB to CRWD, ZS, SAIL, and PANW yesterday to justify a **$60 / share** price target for $BB? I want to see the ratios for those.\u201d Ok you, got me. See below, headcount-implied growth is higher for endpoint security comparables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q7cepei5wxe61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7308c115e3d45a072dac92b20ac029eb132b348\n\n\u201cHah,\u201d you say smugly. \u201cThose other endpoint security businesses blow $BB out of the water, $BB sucks\u201d.\n\nNo, you fucking idiot. If a simple headcount ratio without context was all it took I\u2019d be rich instead of handsome like mommy tells me.\n\n$BB went through [**round**](https://channeldailynews.com/news/layoffs-hit-blackberry-in-waterloo/28015) after [**round**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=blackberry+layoffs&amp;atb=v224-1&amp;ia=web&amp;iai=r1-3&amp;page=1&amp;sexp=%7B%22cdrexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22artexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prodexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prdsdexp%22%3A%22c%22%2C%22biaexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22msvrtexp%22%3A%22b%22%7D) of painful layoffs as it shifted from being a handset business to what it is today. Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a **history**, and that is a blessing and a curse.\n\n**Remember**, Daddy chen\u2019s primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other??? And these smart monkes who were retained \u2013 Well, no need to make a job posting for that role anymore, right?\n\n# IMPLICATION #2 \u2013 BLACKBERRY HAD &gt; 20K EMPLOYEES. UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS. HAVING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES QUICKLY LIKE CERTAIN COMPETITORS\n\nThis brings me to the final part of our headcount analysis. Let\u2019s look at those endpoint security comparables again. Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Let\u2019s look at two two non-retard quotes \u2013\n\n***\"I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company.\" Steve Jobs***\n\n***\u201cIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it\u2019s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.\u201d Peter Thiel***\n\nI was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BB\u2019s Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales. See below\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9s89num7wxe61.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5361754f68b831f3ad044aba2fed88c6f93c7849\n\nEven as a $BB bull, I didn\u2019t expect the discrepancy to be so large.\n\n# IMPLICATION #3 \u2013 BLACKBERRY ACTUALLY IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING / IT FOCUSED COMPANY RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS. IN MANY WAYS IT IS MORE OF A \u201cSTART-UP\u201d. EVEN WITH FINANCIAL PRESSURE, JOHNNY CHEN RETAINED TECHNICAL TALENT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE, AND VALUATION ???\n\n**TLDR: BB IS NOT A ROCKET SHIP. IT IS A LONG RANGE SHUTTLE, CAPABLE OF BURSTS OF SPEED, PACKED TO THE GILLS WITH RETARDS AND TERRAFORMING EQUIPMENT AND HEADING TO MARS.**",
