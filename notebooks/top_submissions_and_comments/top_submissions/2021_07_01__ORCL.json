        "selftext": "**Valuation: Undervalued**\n\n***$PLTR \u2013 Palantir Technologies Inc Investment Summary:***\n\n\u00b7 Recently, there has been a lot of excitement around Palantir, however, very few people actually understand what they do and how they operate. As a result of this I have decided to take on the task of trying explain exactly what Palantir does and why they could be the best undervalued stock to buy now.\n\no I am no data engineer, so this article contains my interpretations of what Palantir does, some of my interpretations may be off, so I would appreciate any helpful comments to clear some things up that I may have got wrong.\n\n\u00b7 Based on the comparable analyses that I underwent, Palantir is currently an undervalued stock and represents a great opportunity for a long-term hold.\n\no The length of time that I plan on holding is subject to change due to their future financial reports, and any news that may come out.\n\n\u00b7 It is very hard to say what the upside potential of an investment into Palantir is, which is why my investment plan (found in the \u201cplan\u201d section) is different than usual.\n\no There are various risks to this investment (like there are to every investment), these risks are highlighted near the end of this report under the \u201crisks\u201d section.\n\no Additionally, there are also multiple different catalysts that can help Palantir\u2019s share price, both in the short and long term(s). These catalysts are listed at the end of this report.\n\n***Overview of Palantir as a Company:***\n\n[$PLTR - Palantir Technologies Inc.](https://utradea.com/stocks/PLTR) was founded in 2003 (after their fear/anger after the events observed through 9/11) and started building their software primarily for government institutions and intelligence to assist in counterterrorism by any means possible. At this point in time, Palantir\u2019s only source of revenue was through secretive government contracts.\n\nHowever, since that point in time, Palantir has expanded their operations into commercial enterprises, as they noticed a lot of similarities and overlaps with their applications. Now, Palantir\u2019s revenue comes from both Government Contracts and Commercial Enterprise Contracts.\n\n*Palantir has 2 main software platforms, Palantir \u201cGotham\u201d, and Palantir \u201cFoundry\u201d.*\n\n[**Palantir Gotham**](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/) was their first software platform and was designed for defense/intelligence use cases. Palantir has stated that this kind of platform helps agencies find \u201cneedles in thousands of haystacks\u201d. They also noted that [Gotham helped soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan](https://www.palantir.com/wp-assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Impact-Study-Palantir-Defense-During-Drawdown.pdf) to map networks of bomb makers and insurgents through deep/hidden patterns and datasets, helping the army save time and lives. Since this mission, Gotham has expanded into defense operations and mission planning. During this time, Palantir found that Gotham could also be applied in Airbus\u2019 business, as their planes require millions of parts, assembled in multiple factories in different countries. However, Palantir decided to make another software platform that is better tailored to commercial enterprises, this platform was labelled \u201cPalantir Foundry\u201d.\n\n[**Palantir Foundry**](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/) transforms the way in which organizations interact with their information by creating a central operating system for their data. Palantir enables their customers to construct their own models quickly and easily from countless sets of data points.\n\nPalantir software is used by their 139 Government and Commercial Institutions/enterprises, in over 40 industries, ranging over 150 countries. Palantir works with the US Government and their several allies abroad, as well as the worlds most important/reliable companies.\n\nLastly, Palantir has stated \u201cWe are not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. We build the software that enable our customers to integrate their own data that they already have.\u201d\n\n***Everything you need to know about Palantir and $PLTR:***\n\n*Palantir Foundry:*\n\nFoundry is essentially a [data warehouse](https://panoply.io/data-warehouse-guide/the-difference-between-a-database-and-a-data-warehouse/) that helps their commercial customers to collect and analyze their data. Foundry\u2019s platform includes a [graphical data interface](https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/graphical-user-interface) that is extremely user friendly allowing their customers to get the most out of their data. Furthermore, Foundry provides statistical analyses through the use of their [AI machine learning](https://www.palantir.com/solutions/ai-ml/) networks that are able to consistently deliver efficient and accurate results.\n\nFoundry helps to enables all of their users, regardless of their technical abilities, to work meaningfully and act with the data that they collect. Foundry provides a suite of applications that help combine data analytics and business logic, helping them to deliver superior data integration.\n\nFoundry\u2019s front-end (what the user sees) enables their users to take advantage of all of the data collected by their organization to make informed decisions. Foundry also has a fantastic application for inter-organizational collaboration, this helps a team to build on each others work.\n\n*Foundry brings all of an enterprises data together onto their platform, however there are access controls in place to define what individuals get control over which dataset(s). From there, Foundry is able to deliver advanced analytics through their machine learning and AI systems to get the most value out of a company\u2019s data, make quality insights, so that their clients can gain a competitive advantage.*\n\n**Foundries potential use cases are almost infinite.**\n\n*Palantir Gotham:*\n\nDubbed \u201cThe Operating System for Government Decision Making\u201d, Gotham helps to improve and accelerate decisions across all levels of Government operations.\n\nGotham is primarily used by the defense and intelligence sections of the Government, to help them find what they are looking for. Gotham collects data from millions of different sources and combines it all into one platform to identify hidden patterns and bring all of this data to life. This allows their users to access this data and manage their operations to execute real-world responses to threats that Gotham identifies. Gotham is becoming a main data solution across various different government agencies.\n\nThere is not too much information that is publicly known about the actual uses of Gotham, which makes sense due to the secretive nature of the organizations that they are in business with. However, what we do know is that these organizations have re-signed contracts with Palantir, which helps us to be confident that this platform is truly \u201cthe real deal\u201d.\n\nLastly, Gotham is also offered to select commercial customers, primarily the companies that are investigating fraud in financial service industries. Furthermore, [Palantir has been credited](https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/news/2015/01/12/leaked-documents-bernie-madoff-convicted-thanks-to.html) with assisting in finding the largest Ponzi scheme ever (Bernie Madoff\u2019s Ponzi Scheme).\n\n*Gotham helps the Defense and Intelligence sectors of the Government to pool their incomprehensible amounts of data into one place. Palantir uses machine learning to quickly locate hidden pieces of data, and key patterns, so that these institutions can take swift action to the threats/problems they face in real-time.*\n\n*Palantir\u2019s Approach:*\n\nPalantir believes that every large institution in the world has a problem in their approach to mass data analysis, and Palantir believes that their platforms are best suited to help companies address this problem and make the most out of their data.\n\nPalantir recognises that other companies sell features, tools, applications, and/or dashboards, however these products are not built to maintain optimal performance in the long run (if at all). Palantir prides themselves on having the best all around software/platform to have sustainable, reliable, and safe data solutions.\n\nPalantir also groups their Foundry data from all of their companies into one large system of several large \u201cfarms\u201d of data provided by each of their client companies. By doing this, Palantir is able to feed more data/information into their machine learning, AI, and algorithms so that they can continue to be more reliable and efficient. This also enables [cross-industry data pools](https://youtu.be/7zqE8J4WKOU), that can be used by their companies when they look to expand or for opportunities in other verticals.\n\n*Palantir Success Stories:*\n\n**BP:**\n\nPerhaps the most notable success story that has come from Palantir is their partnership with [$BP \u2013 British Petroleum](https://utradea.com/stocks/BP)\n\nBP and Palantir have been partners since 2014, and recently (February 2021) [BP and Palantir have extended their partnership](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/05/palantir-deepens-ties-with-bp-with-new-5-year-deal/) for 5 more years. Palantir has helped BP to transform their business into a more digital one, and this extension of their partnership will ensure a further acceleration of their strategic digitization of their business.\n\nPalantir\u2019s Foundry has already helped BP by streamlining and enhancing their hydrocarbon-based workflows. Palantir helped BP to analyze their drilling data and has helped them to [increase their oil production in the North Sea by over 10%.](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/palantir-the-tech-spooks-who-found-bin-laden-are-helping-bp-find-oil-9qddfpv2r)\n\nThis increase in production helps us to visualize just how useful Palantir\u2019s software can be. This is why their Foundry has been credited as a \u201ccompetitive advantage\u201d. Other oil producing companies most likely would not have been able to uncover the data, patterns, and relationships that were uncovered by Palantir, thus the companies that are not using Palantir may be losing out.\n\nThis type of publicity is fantastic for Palantir, as companies may see this, and contact Palantir because they too want a competitive advantage. Palantir\u2019s best chance at becoming the next \u201ctech giant\u201d comes through the commercial applications/contracts. This is because there are infinite uses for Palantir, so theoretically, they can get it in the hands of every business (which would help revenues to soar).\n\n**National Institute of Health (NIH) and Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS):**\n\nPalantir has historically been a rather controversial company through their help in government agencies like ICE. However, recently Palantir has been getting good press, which has helped their company image. Since the start of the pandemic some institutions like the NIH and NHS have signed contracts with Palantir, for Palantir\u2019s assistance with their fights against COVID-19, and their vaccine distributions. This is good for Palantir as it shows them in a good light and shows that they can help provide the world with help and safety during a crisis like COVID-19.\n\nThe NIH agreed to a [$36M contract](https://www.palantir.com/pt_media/nih-palantir-contract/) to gain a partnership with Palantir. Their (NIH\u2019s), mission is to build the largest centralized COVID-19 patient database in the world, and Palantir has helped them to do this with massive success.\n\nPalantir was able to assist the NIH in building their [N3C data platform](https://covid.cd2h.org/). This platform has come a long way since they teamed up with Palantir, and now has over 7.1B rows of data from 6.5M patients, from 57 different databases. Without the assistance of Palantir, analyzing this amount of data would have been no easy feat, however Palantir has provided the NIH with advanced analytics in the matter of minutes thank to their machine learning capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, in December of 2020, Palantir signed a [2-year $31.5M deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201223005018/en/Palantir-Continues-Vital-NHS-Work-With-31.5M-Contract) with the Brittan\u2019s NHS. This partnership requires Foundry to provide a secure, reliable, and timely platform to process data, while protecting patient privacy, to ultimately improve patient care.\n\nBoth of these partnerships highlight the need for Palantir during a crisis and having these large Government Health Institutes choosing Palantir as their first options is a great deal, and shows their confidence in Palantir\u2019s software.\n\n*Sources:*\n\n[The power of data in a pandemic - Technology in the NHS (blog.gov.uk)](https://healthtech.blog.gov.uk/2020/03/28/the-power-of-data-in-a-pandemic/)\n\n*Strengths:*\n\n**Built-in Privacy Controls:**\n\nBy having [privacy controls](https://youtu.be/7zqE8J4WKOU) in place, Palantir is able to operate in places that other data companies cannot go. This is especially true for Foundry, where companies/individuals can request cross-industry data from other Palantir clients to help them in a variety of ways. This request for external data needs to be accepted by a representative of the other company to be allowed. This helps Palantir leverage all of the data that they have on their \u201cOperating System\u201d, which essentially makes their platform a cross-company/cross-country collaborative workspace for all. As Palantir attains more clients, the more attractive/extensive their database is for potential clients. This should help Palantir to expand quickly once they get the ball rolling.\n\nPalantir truly values this privacy and has integrated data legibility, audit logs, access controls, quality checks and requirements to attain external data.\n\n**Government Grade Security:**\n\nAs we know, Palantir started out in just the defense and intelligence spaces. This required Palantir to have elite-level security from the get-go. Their software had to be secure enough to handle national secrets and transparent enough to ensure that the data could be monitored and traced. This is no easy feat, however Palantir managed to achieve this, which is why they have been renewing their contracts with several government agencies.\n\nThis is important when trying to sell their products to their commercial clients, because they need something safe and reliable to protect themselves and their data. Furthermore, Palantir currently has [IL-5 clearance](https://simplemoneylyfe.com/palantir-stock-analysis/) with the Department of Defense (DoD), which makes them 1 of 4 software companies with this level of clearance (alongside Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP). However, it has also been rumoured that Palantir may achieve IL-6 clearance, which has never been done before as it is the storage/processing of **classified information.**\n\nThis level of clearance should speak volumes to how safe and secure Palantir\u2019s technology truly is and should provide ease of mind to companies that they are in business with.\n\n**Expansion into the Commercial Sector:**\n\nPalantir currently has a huge opportunity ahead of them as they continue to increase their presence in the commercial sector, partnering with some of the largest enterprises in the world. Palantir plans to provide these businesses with the software that they need to do their jobs as efficient as possible and sees large growth potential in this industry.\n\nPalantir has said that they are focusing on building partnerships with enterprises that are willing to undergo structural changes within the organization/operations. Palantir has a huge market ahead of themselves in the commercial sector, and their stock should do well on the news breaking of new partnerships between Palantir and commercial enterprises.\n\n*Government Contracts:*\n\nDo you remember what I said earlier about what happens once Palantir gets the ball rolling? If so, you will know where I am headed with this section.\n\nBetween 2008-2018 (10 years), Palantir was able to generate $51.9M in revenue from government contracts. However, in the 2 years following this they earned $179.9M in Government contracts (this can be found under the \u201cUS Government\u201d section of their [SEC 10-K report](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1)). Once Palantir was able to get the ball rolling with these agencies, Palantir was able to both expand and renew existing contracts to earn more revenue. I believe that the same thing will happen with Palantir\u2019s commercial operations. Once they start to get a large number of big enterprises renewing their contracts for \u201cbigger bucks\u201d, I believe that Palantir will start to grow their revenues extremely quick and attract new clients \u201cleft, right, and center\u201d.\n\nThese contract renewals are so important because essentially, they mean that Palantir met and/or exceeded expectations, and these companies now believe that Palantir is vital to their business/operations, so look out for news around renewals.\n\n*Business Model:*\n\nPalantir has developed a business model that focuses on acquiring contracts and expanding their services and has 3 main phases.\n\n1. **Acquire Customers:** Palantir has expanded their sales force largely over the past couple of years, and actively purse negotiations with companies that they can provide long-term value to. To acquire these companies, Palantir gives them a short demo to see how effective and user friendly their software is, Palantir provides this service for a loss. However, they are willing to incur these (proportionately) small losses to potentially acquire large contracts with these companies. This phase runs at a loss but helps Palantir set up clients for the next phase.\n2. **Expand:** Once Palantir has a potential customer on the hook, they move them along to the expand phase. Palantir installs their software in these enterprises and teaches them the ropes, of course this requires a large investment from Palantir to incorporate it. These customers often sign a short contract with Palantir for a cheap cost (Palantir takes a loss on this phase as well), however clients are able to truly unlock Palantir\u2019s software during this phase and see what it has to offer. If they like their software, they will be moved along to the next phase (scale) which is Palantir\u2019s bread and butter.\n3. **Scale:** These clients tend to sign longer-term deals with Palantir for their software after they have got a \u201cgood feel\u201d for their software. The companies in this stage are also generally \u201chands-off\u201d meaning that they can operate the software without much help. Companies tend to find the most value in this stage, and Palantir makes the best margins on this stage. In 2020, Palantir made $613.4M in this stage with a margin of 70%\n\n*Financial information:*\n\nAll of this information can be found in their [SEC 10-K filing.](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1)\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, Palantir increased their gross profit by 47.97% and increased their gross margin to 81% (from 71%), Palantir reported their first net income (excluding stock-based compensation) ever and increase their net revenues by 47.15%.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, Palantir\u2019s loss from operations increased by 103.61%, their stock-based compensation increased by 425.15%, their General and Admin expenses increased by 108.59%, and their net loss increased by 101.22%. Their biggest problem in 2020 was their large stock-based compensation, which will be addressed later.\n\n\u00b7 **Convertible Preferred Stock:** In 2020, Palantir issued a total of 797,771,675 shares of common stock through conversion of their previous \u201cconvertible referred shares\u201d. This one factor of dilution caused an estimated dilutionary effect of Palantir\u2019s stock of 137.19%. This is a huge form of dilution, and I have never seen anything like this before, however I have an explanation for this so stay tuned for that.\n\n\u00b7 **Repurchase of Common Stock:** In 2020, Palantir repurchased 808,201 shares back. This is a measly amount compared to the amount of dilution from preferred stock, however any buyback is good to see as an investor. This buyback caused an inflationary effect on existing shares of 0.14%, which is not much, but we will still take it.\n\n\u00b7 **Stock Warrants:** In 2020, Palantir experienced an additional 7,631,329 shares on the market through the exercising of warrants. The exercising of these warrant had a dilutionary effect on Palantir\u2019s stock of 1.31%.\n\n\u00b7 **Common Stock (Net of Issuance Costs):** In 2020, Palantir unloaded 206,500,523 common shares onto the market from issuance of common stock net of issuance costs. I believe that this means that, Palantir had to fork out additional shares to cover the investment needed to take their shares public. I could very well be wrong on that, and if anyone can pitch in and explain this to me that would be great! Anyways, this caused a dilutionary effect of Palantir\u2019s common stock of roughly 35.51%. This is a large portion of dilution, however it does not even factor in other factors of dilution which is worrying.\n\n\u00b7 **Stock Options:** In 2020, Palantir added 120,617,527 common shares to their shares outstanding through the exercise of options. These options were exercised and thus converted into these common shares and had a dilutionary effect of 20.72%. Once again, this is a large amount of dilution and should be considered by investors.\n\n\u00b7 **RSU\u2019s:** In 2020, Palantir issued 82,429,575 shares through their vesting of \u201cRestricted Stock Units\u201d (RSU\u2019s). This had a dilutionary effect on their stock of 14.18% (which is a lot of dilution).\n\n\u00b7 **Modification to Stock Options:** In 2020, Palantir technically bought back 3,500,0000 shares through modifications to stock options (for the settlement of employee loans accounted for as modifications to stock options). Confusing, right? This technical buyback resulted in a share inflation of 0.6%.\n\n\u00b7 **Total Share Dilution in 2020:** In 2020, Palantir experience an overall share dilution of 208.19%. This is the most dilution I have ever seen in a stock that I have analyzed, however there are some potential answers as to why there was so much dilution in 2020.\n\n*Explanation of Share Dilution:*\n\nOnce again, all of the below information can be found in Palantir\u2019s [SEC 10-K filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1).\n\nOn September 30th, 2020, Palantir completed their Direct Listing of their Class A common shares on the public markets on the NYSE. Part of this listing involved the redemption of all of Palantir\u2019s convertible share into common shares. This was the largest single source of dilution in Palantir (137%). Additionally, this Direct Listing involved the exercise of al outstanding warrants, which resulted in dilution of 1.31%. Another part of their Direct Listing was the common stocks issued, net of issuance price to complete the direct listing, which had a dilutionary effect of 35.51%. Lastly, Palantir was forced to create new common shares that would hold the place of the unvested RSU\u2019s, which cause a dilutionary effect of 14.18%.\n\nWithout these factors of dilution, Palantir would have only experienced an overall dilution of 20%. This means that due to the Direct listing, Palantir had to increase their shares outstanding by 188.19% to meet the requirements to be eligible for the listing.\n\n*Overall Thoughts on Dilution:*\n\nPalantir is a very weird stock in terms of their dilution, and I have not seen anything quite like this before. Their overall level of dilution is unprecedented and very worrying for investors. However, we know that these levels of dilution were inflated due to the requirements of undergoing a Direct Listing. However, how does Palantir dilution (excluding the effects caused by their Direct Listing compared to their dilution in previous years?\n\nFor starters, Palantir exhibited a 20% share dilution in 2020 when eluding the dilution caused by the Direct Listing. However, historically Palantir has experienced an average share dilution of 5.18% between 2017-2019. So even excluding the effects caused through the Direct Listing, Palantir still experienced a comparably high level of share dilution. However, 20% of dilution is significantly different than the 208.19% of dilution (which would be crazily high). This 20% is relatively normal for an undervalued growth stock, such as Palantir, so currently I would not be too worried. However, investors should keep up with their financial reports and look for their dilution in 2021, because ultimately that will tell us more about Palantir\u2019s dilution after going public, than their past share dilution as a private company.\n\n*Competition:*\n\nIn order to undergo my comparable analyses (which will be discussed later on) I needed to select 4 companies, that I can compare to Palantir.\n\n[**$ZS \u2013 Zscaler Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/ZS)**:** ZScaler is a security as a service company that helps company adapt to cloud technologies and provides their cybersecurity services through the cloud. ZScaler provides their services to both commercial enterprises and governments, similar to that of Palantir. Furthermore, ZScaler offers their service primarily in the USA, but also has smaller international operations (again like Palantir).\n\n[**$SNOW \u2013 Snowflake Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/SNOW)**:** Snowflake (like Palantir) is a software and technology company that primarily focuses on data. Snowflake provides data cloud services such as data engineering, data science, data applications, data sharing, and data warehouse. This is very similar to the applications and functions available on Palantir, however Palantir offers other functions that differentiate themselves. Snowflake also provides services for both commercial enterprises and government organizations, similar to that of Palantir.\n\n[**$SPLK \u2013 Splunk Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/SPLK)**:** Splunk provide software platforms that deliver insights derived from their clients\u2019 data in the USA and internationally. Splunk offers their Ecosystem solutions that consist of data inputs, workflows, reports, dashboards, data visualizations, actions, and methods, and help their clients/customers to make the best out of their data. All of this sounds eerily familiar to the description of Palantir, making it one of the closer competitors. Splunk also offers their services to the public sector as well as the government, making their business model resemble that of Palantir so much more.\n\n[**$TYL \u2013 Tyler technologies Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/TYL)**:** Tyler technologies is probably the company in this list that least resembles that of Palantir, this is because they provide management solutions, accounting systems, billing systems and other solutions geared toward the public sector. Tyler technologies works primarily with governments of all types (Federal, State, and Municipal), and education institutions. However, the one thing that Tyler has that makes them comparable to Palantir is their data and insight solutions. Their data insights software enables collaboration, displays data visualizations/measurements, and generates insights for their human operators to act on.\n\n*Q1 2021 Updates:*\n\nAll of the below information can be found in [Palantir\u2019s Q1 Investor Presentation](https://investors.palantir.com/files/Palantir%20Q1%202021%20Business%20Update.pdf).\n\nRecently, on May 11th, 2021, Palantir released their Q1 earnings report. When looking at Palantir\u2019s financial performance I did not take this into account, which means that this section will be packed with new information that will help us to understand Palantir\u2019s trajectory even more.\n\nFirst and foremost, this quarter was the first quarter in which Palantir has reported positive earnings. This is a big milestone for Palantir as a public company, and it helps to gets investors excited about the potentially profitable future of Palantir. In Q1, Palantir reported a free cash flow of $151M (was -$290M in Q1 2020) with a 44% adjusted FCF margin, they grew revenues by 49% YoY ($341M), and they grew billings by 248% YoY ($362M) which means that Palantir is acquiring new customers and negotiating higher contracts. These financials are great and show a promising future ahead for Palantir, which should excite their investors.\n\nFurthermore, during this quarter they also disclosed their investment in a SPAC. This SPAC is [$QELL \u2013 Qell Acquisition Corp.](https://utradea.com/stocks/QELL) which merging with Lilium. Lilium is an eVTOL transportation company, with this investment they also came to a deal with Lilium to use Foundry for design, engineering, testing, production, quality, logistics, and operations. A while back I looked at another eVTOL SPAC Archer ([$ACIC \u2013 Atlas Crest Investment Corp.](https://utradea.com/stocks/ACIC)), which has great upside and has a similar business model to Lilium, so if you want to read that to be more informed about Liliums potential performance, [click here.](https://utradea.com/positions/Take_a_SHOT_at_Archers_SPAC_ACIC)\n\nIn Q1, Palantir was also awarded with a [5-year $90M contract](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210405005238/en/Palantir-Selected-by-the-National-Nuclear-Security-Administration-for-5-year-89.9M-Contract-for-SAFER-Project) from the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), in which Palantir will provide the operational platform for their SAFER (Safety Analytics, Forecasting, and Evaluation Reporting) project. This is big news as this is one of Palantir\u2019s bigger contracts, and it shows the level of confidence of the NNSA in Palantir\u2019s software and their cross-enterprise data integration capabilities. On the topic of Palantir and Government Organizations, the DoD used Palantir\u2019s software in all 11 of their Combatant Commands for globally integrated intelligence. This high level of usage from the DoD definitely means that Palantir is doing something right, and if the DoD likes it so much, then it should be more than enough for commercial enterprises.\n\nLastly, in Q1, Palantir won 15 contracts worth over $5M, and 6 contracts worth over $10M with an average duration of 3.7 years (4.6 for commercial customers). This is fantastic for the company as they gained an additional 11 new commercial customers from this, and I will be keeping up to date with these contracts and others as they come up for renewal/negotiations. Additionally, Palantir was able to grow their gross margin to 83% (from 75% Q1 2020), and their contribution margin to 60% (from 41% in Q1 2020). This shows that Palantir business partners are maturing into their 3rd phase, the scale phase, which enables Palantir to grow their margins.\n\n***$PLTR \u2013 Palantir Investment Valuation:***\n\n*Comparable Analyses:*\n\nI decided to undergo 2 different comparable analyses in order to get a variety of valuations (or opinions if you will). Preferably, I would like both of these results to be consistent in terms of their fair value estimate, however, if they are not consistent, I will take the average result. I was only able to find 2 multiples/ratios that I could actually analyze due to the nature of these businesses and their lack of positive financial ratios/multiples.\n\n*EV/Revenue:*\n\nThis is a very common multiple among companies that are not profitable in their operations yet, like Palantir and some of these other comparable companies. By comparing Palantir\u2019s EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors (listed above on the \u201ccompetitors\u201d section of this report), I found that Palantir has a fair value of $32.85/share, which implies an upside to this investment of 23.31%. This implies that given Palantir\u2019s current price, they are undervalued, and the upside is very reasonable, however, I decided to undergo the next comparable to see if this result maintains.\n\n*P/B:*\n\nBy comparing Palantir\u2019s P/B ratio to that of their competitors, I found that Palantir has a fair value of $24.87/share, which implies that there is a downside risk of 6.64% to such an investment. As you have probably noticed, these results are not consistent, therefore I have decided to take the average result to get one, final price target.\n\n*Average Comparable:*\n\nBy taking the average result from the 2 comparable analyses underwent, I found that Palantir has a fair value of $28.86/share, which implies an overall upside of 8.36% to this investment. This also implies that Palantir, is in fact an undervalued growth stock, that has the potential to be one of the best undervalued stocks on the market.\n\n***My Plan for Investing into Palantir:***\n\nMy plan for this investment is a little different from usual.\n\nI see anything between $24.87/share (Fair Value of P/B ratio) and $28.86/share (average comparable) as a good chance to buy Palantir at (or below) its fair value. This helps to limit our downside risk of this investment.\n\nHowever, I think the best way to play an investment in Palantir is over the long-run 3+ years. I would attempt to buy in at the above prices and hold for these 3+ years. During this time, I would re-evaluate my investment with every new financial report and piece of news to decide if it is still worth holding.\n\n***Potential Risks to Palantir\u2019s Stock - $PLTR:***\n\n\u00b7 **Dilution:** Over the past year Palantir has experienced a lot of dilution, however, we have already attributed a great deal of this dilution to their Direct Listing. However, the 20% of dilution that was not derived from the direct listing is still quite high. As investors, we should keep an eye on their future levels of dilution to recognize any patterns/increases that we should be weary of. If these levels of dilution persist, potential investors may be scares off and current investor might sell their positions, which will hurt the share price.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance:** This year\u2019s financial performance was not one to be overly happy about. Although they were able to increase some pretty important aspects of their balance sheet, Palantir was still yet to make a profit, and increased their net losses by over 100%. If this poor financial performance continues, and they keep digging themselves into a bigger and bigger hole, investors will run away from this stock and never look back. However, the Q1 financial performance gives investors hope for a more profitable future, which will be discussed later.\n\n\u00b7 **Bad Press:** Historically, Palantir has not been looked at through a positive lens by many people investors and non-investors alike. Their first public backlash came through their involvement in deporting immigrants through [Palantir\u2019s partnership with ICE](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54348456). Palantir quicky spoke out against this backlash by saying ICE took advantage of their software without proper oversight, and that they are looking into the issues, furthermore they have since declined some potential partnerships with other border agencies to avoid further backlash. There have also been numerous smaller controversies and protests that have damaged Palantir\u2019s reputation, and if there are more large controversies Palantir\u2019s stock could get hurt as a result of it.\n\n***Potential Catalysts that can Help Palantir\u2019s Stock Price:***\n\n\u00b7 **Share Buybacks:** Over the past year, Palantir has bought back (both directly and indirectly, in a sense) over 4,300,000 of their common shares. This is good to see as an investor, especially this early in the company (and not too long after their Direct Listing). This gives me hope that Palantir will continue to repurchase more shares in the future. This will be good for the share price as it will increase the value of existing shares, and it will be especially good for the stock price if they continue to buyback more shares each year.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance:** Palantir\u2019s 2020 financial report was not favourable (as discussed previously), however there were definitely some good to take out of it. Palantir increased their revenue, gross profit, and margins by a hefty amount, which is good to see as an investor, however, there was bad aspects of this report as well that made the report unfavourable. However, their newly released Q1 2021 financial report has so much more to offer in terms of good aspects of a financial report.\n\n\u00b7 **Positive Press:** As previously mentioned, Palantir has had their fair share of bad press that has had a small effect on their share price. However, recently Palantir has been getting better press through helping organizations like the NIH and NHS in their fight against COVID-19, and their vaccine distribution efforts. Partnerships like this help to display the positive impacts that can be derived from Palantir\u2019s technology. Future events where Palantir can use their software for a good cause can help to combat the negative stigma around Palantir and attract more people to invest in their company. This should help their share price in the short term after these articles are released.\n\n\u00b7 **Success Stories:** Since Palantir have gone public, they have had a few success stories come out, I mentioned some of these stories throughout the article. These success stories show how impactful Palantir\u2019s software can be and can show companies that they can increase revenues, production etc. just by using Palantir\u2019s software. Any future stories like this that come out, highlighting the benefits of Palantir can help the stock soar, and potential clients to reach out and start business/inquiries with Palantir.\n\n\u00b7 **Renewing Contracts:** I have mentioned that the renewal of contracts can help Palantir\u2019s share price a couple times throughout this article but why is this the case? This is because these companies that are renewing have already been through Palantir\u2019s 3 stage business model and have experienced their software firsthand for numerous years. After their time with Palantir\u2019s software expires they decide to renew the contract. This is good because it shows that Palantir\u2019s software was effective enough to their business in the time they had it that it is worth these $5-15M+ contract renewals. Furthermore, these companies that are renewing already have underwent Palantir\u2019s installation, and these clients will provide Palantir with the highest margins, which will reflect well on Palantir\u2019s future financial reports.\n\n\u00b7 **New Partnerships/Contracts (and the expansion of commercial enterprise segment):** Every time that Palantir, or its partners release news that they have entered into a contract/agreement, this will help Palantir\u2019s stock. This is because Palantir needs to keep expanding their software into new companies in order to meet their expected growth projections. Furthermore, as more commercial enterprises try Palantir\u2019s software (and hopefully enjoy it), the more willing other companies might be to give Palantir a shot. I see their biggest potential for growth and to become a large company in their expansion of their commercial enterprise segment through Foundry. Every time Palantir gets more new clients on board it is fantastic and shows the feasibility of this segment, and as more contracts role in, more enterprises will take an interest. Furthermore, when Palantir signs these enterprises to a contract, it will help to increase their revenues, which will show up on their financial reports and hopefully help the, to beat estimates.\n\n*This analysis took a long time, and is one of the most comprehensive that I have seen, so I would greatly appreciate if you followed me* [*here*](https://utradea.com/member-portfolio/BeatingTheVTI?utm_source=R&amp;utm_medium=B&amp;utm_campaign=PLTR)*, and commented on my original post!*",

        "selftext": "So what does that mean, the market has turned upside down? What does that mean when the Nasdaq is hitting new highs everyday but many of the stocks I watch are down? What is this divergence? Is the Nasdaq index accurate? What stocks are actually up?\n\nSo yesterday 7/6/2021, I was surfing on Reddit and I did come across some Warren Buffet videos. The oracle of Omaha and well deserved. I have read a couple of his books maybe 10-12 years ago, read much about him but actually didn't see these videos until yesterday. In a nut shell he stated that you can not time the markets, no one can time the market, the best time to buy, is when you first see value and if anything but it in increments. The 2nd thing he stated was that he does not buy anything where he does not see value..... if it does not make money now..... because you can not predict the future, \"a bird in the hand right now, is worth 2 more in the bush.\" That means if you have a solid company making money now, do not jump ship and buy/speculate on something that is losing money/growing or for the short term perceives to be doing alot better. This paragraph will become important as I answer these questions. I hope to help calm everyones' nerves with the answers to these questions.\n\nI have wrote in many posts, as far back as a few weeks that the market is upside down, ever since the Nasdaq was at 13,800-14,000 and fed Powell was about to speak. The market upside down is when stocks that make money, have cash, give dividends, have the ability to buyback shares, raise dividends are falling like knives. Something like AFIN dipped under 8! NYCB under 11! (Again today, thanx for the trade), NYMT under 4.50 (Here we go again).. These are stocks that I constantly trade, and tell the elite team to trade when we are forced to pivot and seek safety. Why? Because they can do all of those things....... A company that does not make money, can not buy shares, can not raise dividends, and even as the stock drops they want to print more shares..\n\nMany followers and the elite team are asking me what do I think is going on, why is the Nasdaq making new highs but I see a sea of red? So, I did alot of digging this week. The Nasdaq is indeed a cap weighted Index.. So is the SP and Nasdaq 100 are all cap weighted. That means as the market cap of a company grows (That is the overall value of a company) the meaning and weight it carries on the index grows as well....Why does this matter? The big 5, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, FB... account for 40% of the nasdaq!!!! Look it up! I just did, because I am supposed to be all knowing! You guys do keep me sharp! AAPL alone accounts for 12% of the nasdaq index and nearly 20% of QQQ (Nasdaq 100). The Nasdaq has almost 5,000 tickers. So the fact that 5 company's can shift 40% or more! of the market means that 4,000 can call and 150 can be up and the NASDAQ can be up! Is that possible? Yesterday there were 4 decliners for every advancer.. (4,000 down, 1,000 up) that is 7/6/2021. Today 7/7/2021 there were about 1.5 decliners for every advancer. (3,000 down and 2,000 up)..... In fact the US equity market is about 50 trillion and covers about 12-13,000 tickers amongst the NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX and OTC... These 5 make up about 10 trillion!! So, just these 5 are 20% of the entire US market!! Yes! Now, I knew they were important and cap weighted I just didnt know how so..... because these stocks are making record all time highs, the Nasdaq is at 14,600-14,700 and its a sea of red. I started to see what was up and saw these mighty titans and some speculative stocks.. So that is your answer....... it is happening, why the Nasdaq is making new highs and I see a sea of red. So the Nasdaq is accurate, their is no mistake. Some stocks like SE, BILL are going sky high, LMND bouncing back but these are strictly speculative, snow.......\n\nWhat is the danger in this? Why does it matter? Because I was even telling my elite team to me, we are already near a correction. If you take out 25 of the largest cap company's their is no doubt the Nasdaq is already down 5-10% but we cant see it! They have asked me other ways to track what is going on...... The only other way is to track other nasdaq important stocks to know, because if you track these 5 that mean the most, they are making highs. The danger in this is if they fall, it may cause a panic and speculative stocks will really crash! Because if the Nasdaq is at record highs and most people do not know its a few company's bringing up the market if the Nasdaq as a whole falls to 14,000 it may cause panic!\n\nWhat do we do? I am going back defensive after I sell of some of my offensive stocks....Or I will buy an offensive stock after its down at least 5% on the day.....\n\nRecall earlier the paragraph about Warren Buffet and buy value, cash cows, and buy more when fear is instilled elsewhere........ When the market started to turn upside down, an amazing value stock I had was TX, it dipped to 31, I did buy more, albeit in fear and traded it. It has bounced back to near 52 week highs as of today near 42. So that is a 30+ percent move in 2 weeks on a safe stock that makes cash! AFIN, BRMK, NYCB, they all recovered and made for great trades.... Today I am given another trading opportunity in NYCB and NYMT.......Now an offensive play, give it, these are Chinese are getting crushed and they are offensive. TIGR and VIPS. TIGR rose to 30!! It is now under 21...... VIPS dipped to 15 and change went back to 20.66 and has dropped this week because of DIDI (Chinese).. Same with TIGR.. I do own VIPS at 21.... I have been trading TIGR.... I just wanted you all to see what the difference is of a defensive play making tons of cash \\[1 in the hand, 2 in the bush\\]..... Now I do believe VIPS and TIGR are 2 offensive plays that should rise but we do have to be careful....\n\nSo in short, the market is upside down, being held by a few stocks. I refer to the Nasdaq as most of us trade tech/growth. I hope this explains much, and calms nerves for people with stocks that make cash!!!",

        "selftext": "Prepare to ask yourself: \"Is that scrap steel in my pocket, or am I just happy to meet SCHN?\" as I kick off an epic three part series on Schnitzer Steel with a balls-of-steel short term bet. These junkyard bums used to barely scrape a living by buying your junk car, removing the upholstery stained with your trisomy sperm, stripping the car down more than your mom did on stage while pregnant with you, then finally harvesting the steel for cash.\n\nNowadays, Schnitzer is rolling in tendies, and not just the ones they find underneath the car seats. Due to several industry tailwinds set to continue for years, scrap prices are at decade long highs. As Cleveland Cliffs CEO and steel oracle Lourenco Goncalves stated just last week: **\"Prime scrap is the new precious metal.\"** Schnitzer are industry experts at collecting, sorting, processing, and selling and exporting the stuff.\n\nI'm balls deep long on SCHN because I agree that the demand for scrap will reach record highs in the coming years, and because SCHN is perfectly situated to take advantage. However, **currently there's a short term play that worked out for me last time, and this time around the set-up is even better.** It'll make for a good introduction to this ticker.\n\nIn this part 1 of 3, I go over that idiotic bet for you to get all apish over and blame me if it doesn't work out. Parts 2 and 3 will be much more in depth and long-term focused.\n\n**tldr:**\n\n* The previous three quarters, SCHN went down after beating earnings, only to quickly recover and hit new 52w highs. SCHN just posted an earnings beat last week and, surprise surprise, it went down. I think it will pop back up, because:\n* SCHN trends with the price of HRC (steel futures), since this drives demand for scrap. HRC has been going up up up.\n* The SCHN/HRC spread is at a low right now; recently it has always bounced back up within about a month, and always before next earnings.\n* SCHN's IV is low since they just reported earnings, making the upside to this quite significant.\n* Other steel companies post Q2 earnings this month... look at HRC prices and tell me they won't blow the lid off earnings, taking SCHN up with them.\n* In my estimation, there are several significant upside risks, and few downside risks.\n* PTs: $55 by end of July, $60 by end of August.\n* Bonus: **I did this play last earnings and flipped $3k into $10k.** With 4-month out options.\n\nPositions:\n\n* Jul Calls ($50, $55): 15%\n* Aug Calls ($50, $55): 15%\n* Commons: 70%\n\n\\---\n\n# I. SCHN's earnings cycles summarized\n\n===============\n\nNote: **I created an Appendix for actual wrinkle-generation at the bottom. Go take a look now if you care.** You don't really *need* to know that stuff to smash the \"buy-FDs-at-market-price\" button with your closed fist while grunting \"fuck hedgies\" or whatever, but knowing this stuff will certainly help you explain to your step-dad why his credit limit was reached.\n\n===============\n\nThis short-term play is mostly based on the last three post-earning periods that all show the same pattern: **SCHN gets dumped after beating earnings, then roars back to 52w highs and closes the spread with steel prices.** I believe this post-earnings price action is driven by two factors: A rise in steel prices, and positive earnings from steel companies. **The set-up this time around looks even better, and further catalysts are listed in another section.**\n\nWhy am I only looking at the three last earning periods? This is when the steel boom really began (HRC going from $475 to $1800). Prior to that, steel prices were dirt cheap and steel related stocks were in a glut. If you don't know about the whole steel resurgence thing, read some CLF/TX DDs or wait for Part II. Long story short: demand is increasing (infrastructure, autos, etc), supply is decreasing (limited capacity, China not exporting as much).\n\nAnyway, **this dump after earnings is not a surprise for those of us that follow the stock.** We SCHN traders call this the \"back up the truck\" period: After earnings, we load up on more shares. Now you can be like us! (Except you probably won't buy shares.)\n\nI did this same strategy last earnings and flipped $3k to $10k. This time around has some advantages: SCHN/HRC spread is better, 52w is already established at \\~$60, HRC has gone up the roughly same, and Q2 steel earnings will be randy-at-computer.jpg. There are also some possible catalysts (but I wouldn't bet on those alone).\n\n\\---\n\n# II. The Chart\n\nHere's a pretty picture for you:\n\n[Crayons make me want to buy.](https://preview.redd.it/ap7xzhs0en971.png?width=1819&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2033e9b07541842b8b6fae7285948da3b2cf3dc)\n\nI'll describe the chart in more detail, as surely the bright colors are causing some sort of primitive fight-or-flight response. It's ok, guys, daddy is right here.\n\n## The Pattern\n\n1. Steel prices (the gray line) rise a ton during the quarter.\n2. The market expects SHCN to have a huge earnings beat.\n3. SCHN gets pumped up in the week prior to earnings.\n4. SCHN reports, and it's only a really big earnings beat, but not an OJ-Simpson-beating-murder charges type of beat.\n5. Market over-sells SCHN.\n6. HRC inevitably rises more, after the sideways leading-into-the-month period.\n7. Within a month, steel stocks report record earnings.\n8. Market realizes: Oh, shit HRC prices are still climbing and SCHN actually *did* crush earnings pretty bigly, and everything steel is raking in cash!\n9. SCHN races upwards and obliterates the SCHN/HRC spread.\n10. Multibagger, depending on how retarded you play it.\n\n## The SCHN/HRC Spread\n\nThis is the graph at the bottom. It's the price of HRC (steel) divided by the SCHN share price.\n\nIf you want a better understanding of this, head to the appendix. Otherwise, just read this sentence: **When HRC goes up, SCHN makes more money**. So, the two should track relatively well, and for the most part, they do (+/- 15%).\n\nThe pattern I notice is that when this spread gets low, it doesn't stay low for long. It inevitably goes back up as the market takes into account that SCHN will be selling their scrap for beaucoup dollars. In fact, it seems to run up at least once before the next earnings period, often times within just a month. **I'm betting on run up occurring again soon.**\n\nThe yellow circles are good buy points (if red) and good sell points (if green). Follow the yellow lines up...\n\n## The Wieners\n\nThe yellow lines are the \"bump\" periods we want to capture. I highlighted the price action between the \"buy\" and \"sell\" periods to create some of my patented beautiful [green dildos](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nzszyd/bgs_green_giant_dildos_and_cream_of_wsb/).\n\n**I actually played this strategy after the earnings in April:**\n\n[$3k to $10k after last earnings.](https://preview.redd.it/55d2sfu1en971.png?width=968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e995942051ba727486c1ffe8737b85091412888)\n\nBeing the conservative little bitch that I was back then, I bought a full four months out to *August*, paper handed some calls, and still managed to 2.5x my initial investment. I don't have historical data, but if I followed the yellow dots and bought March or April calls instead, I'm sure that's at least a 10-bagger.\n\n\\---\n\n# III. HRC Prices / Other Steel Stocks\n\nCritical to this short-term thesis:\n\n1. HRC prices continue to rise (or, at least not fall), and within a month or two.\n2. Steel companies blow out earnings.\n\n## HRC Prices\n\nLet's take a closer look at HRC prices:\n\nPrices of HRC contracts over time. They go up.\n\n[$3k to $10k after last earnings.](https://preview.redd.it/q9tb01o2en971.png?width=1095&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c291cc469d7a6e8eac3d64f3c3d4a44b852a3df)\n\nThis charts the price of each HRC contract through time. You won't find this chart anywhere else because I had to scrape websites and do a ton of tedious bullshit to make this chart.\n\nThe whole reason I track this is because bought a ton of HRC contracts (\\~300 tons worth of future-steel) right before that big dip in May, got margin called four days in a row, didn't fold like a paper handed bitch, and just finally made it out alive with a bit of profit. The reason the chart is rainbow colored, however, is because I'm super gay, and not because it's the default colors of google charts.\n\nAnyway, here's what I learned trading futures and what you should notice: **HRC prices move sideways into the new month, then start to climb a week or so later.** Go ahead, look at each new month. I even marked it with scribbles.\n\nI believe this is due to low volumes during the front of the month as hedges against steel orders for future months are just starting to get worked out. It just occurred to me I could plot the total volume of all contracts... (30 minutes later)...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Volumes and prices often pick up after the beginning of each month.](https://preview.redd.it/8wmklz44en971.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6882045d216f7560755f77f1f26cb42d52cfc7b7)\n\nIt looks like there are two patterns:\n\n1. Volume (of all contracts) does tend to settle during the month change.\n2. The more volume there is, the more the price changes (roughly).\n\nIt's not iron clad, but it looks more often than not HRC prices like to run-up mid month as volume picks up. I just checked my calendar. It's almost mid month.\n\nNow, here's the kicker: **SCHN reports near the new month, when HRC prices trade sideways.** That's to our advantage, because what happens when HRC prices start to climb again? That's right retards, SCHN goes up with it.\n\n## Steel Earnings\n\nBesides HRC prices themselves, the other part of this short-term thesis is that steel stocks will post incredible earnings (yet again), causing share prices to rise and pulling SCHN up with them.  Steelmaking stocks have been covered to death in other DDs, so I won't go into too much detail.\n\nHowever, I will say that steelmakers are absolutely rolling in cash right now. Their profit margins are so high that each dollar increase in HRC prices are effectively a dollar of profit (times the millions of tons of steel they produce).\n\n**This quarter will be even better, due to the lag between steel prices and the revenues steelmakers actually get, as well as HRC outpacing everybody's expectations.** Steelmakers, such as CLF, have different types of contracts -- some yearly, some quarterly, some monthly, some at spot. A significant amount of their contracts, with auto manufacturers for example, are yearly and quarterly. As the old contracts expire and the new ones are negotiated, steelmakers rake in the profits from high steel prices.\n\nI expect steelmakers' earnings to be quite solid, as they have been all year. There's zero reason to believe otherwise.\n\n## The takeaway\n\nDrill this into your brain:\n\n* HRC trades sideways into the new month, then starts to rip. This is good, because you can buy SCHN cheap before HRC takes off again.\n* HRC has been ripping non-stop all year. These insane prices will show up even more in steelmakers' Q2 earnings due to contracts being renegotiated.\n* What's good for steelmakers is good for SCHN.\n\n\\---\n\n# IV. Downside Risks\n\nNow before you get all giddy over this, it's time to go over the bad news: Your mom hates you, and you could lose money on this bet.\n\n## Past results may not be indicative of future results\n\nThis is obvious, which means it definitely needs to be stated. The past three earnings have shown SCHN to bounce back (relative to HRC) before the next earnings period.. but this doesn't make it a guarantee. Ok?\n\nAlso, HRC could *fall* to close the SCHN/HRC gap. As unlikely as I see this, anything is possible. The reason I don't think HRC will fall is because demand is so solid, and supply is not increasing. If anything, worldwide supply is decreasing as China is increasingly showing signs of cutting production and disincentivizing the exporting of their steel. Remember, they export 15-20% of the world's steel, so what they do is *very* significant.\n\nOh, right, downside risks. Ok, here we go:\n\n## China\n\nHRC took a big tumble in May because [China fucked with their commodities market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/china-exchanges-move-to-cool-iron-ore-steel-price-rally-2021-05-10) in an attempt to suppress runaway commodity prices. They basically jacked up margin requirements overnight, so that in the morning traders got slammed with margin calls and either had to liquidate or deposit more capital to hold their now-shitty positions in contracts that were getting liquidated by everyone else.\n\nFrom the article:\n\n&gt;BEIJING, May 10 (Reuters) - China's commodity exchanges on Monday moved to raise trading limits and margin requirements for some iron ore contracts and reinstated fees on steel futures as a blistering rally in the ferrous metals complex showed no signs of abating.\n\nThis dip in commodities spread overseas, and I got fucking slammed by it, so I am fully aware of how effective China can be when it comes to manipulation.\n\n**China still has an incentive to manipulate HRC prices downward.** They want to keep their steel within their borders, and keep that steel cheap, to feed their 6% yearly growth target. As such they can do crazy shit like fuck with their futures market (which will have contagion around the world), make crazy announcements, and who knows what the fuck else.\n\nHowever, I find an export tax to \"seal the borders of steel\" to be much more likely and beneficial approach. See upside risks.\n\n## The Fire in May\n\nOn May 22, 2021, SCHN experienced a fire at its Cascade Steel Rolling Mill in McMinnville, Oregon. They stated in earnings that they very confident insurance will fully cover the repair costs as well as missed revenues. However, that's not settled yet, and they are waiting for confirmation.\n\nIt's possible they are found at fault and/or that the insurance payment is much less than expected. This could ding the stock a bit.\n\nOn the flipside, the confirmation of coverage could come sooner and be higher than expected. (It's in the upsides as well.)\n\n## The usual, contagions, etc\n\nSCHN is not immune to any of the following:\n\n* Unforeseen bad news for SCHN. I don't know, maybe their [hottie CEO](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tamara+Lundgren+bikini&amp;tbm=isch) dies or something.\n* Unforeseen bad news for US Steelmakers (SCHN correlates highly).\n* Unforeseen bad news for market. Burry, JPow, just stfu for a few weeks. Biden, stfu about taxes.\n* A continued dumping of value stocks for shiny growth stocks.\n\n\\---\n\n# V. Upside Risks\n\n**The largest catalysts have already been mentioned in depth:**\n\n1. SCHN/HRC gap closing short term and/or by next earnings. This has been a consistent pattern.\n2. HRC bumping up mid-month, after the into-the-month sideways pattern.\n3. Q2 steelmakers' pulling up SCHN with them.\n\nI'll move on to other catalysts now. To be clear, I would not be making the bet based on any of these catalysts occurring, they're just possible \"bonuses\".\n\n## China\n\nChina produces, consumes, and exports the most steel of any country. To a large degree, they dictate the global price of steel. Any decrease in the amount of steel they export will lead to higher HRC prices globally. **Higher HRC prices means higher scrap prices, means more profits for SCHN.**\n\nFurthermore, any drop in production increases the likelihood they will export less. Why? China needs the steel for themselves to fuel their 6% GDP growth.\n\nSo, count 'em, two possible catalysts from China that may increase steel prices:\n\n1. An export tax. [This has been rumored for awhile](https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3990727/FOCUS-What-Chinas-possible-new-steel-export-taxes-mean-for-global-ferrous-industry.html), but could become a reality at any time.\n2. A drop in production. [A decrease in 30% production in the main steel town in China](https://finance.sina.cn/2021-07-06/detail-ikqciyzk3735769.d.html?sinawapsharesource=newsapp&amp;wm=3200_0024) was actually reported yesterday, July 5.\n\n## Positive News on Chip Shortage / Autos\n\nI don't follow semis or chip shortage news much, so perhaps this is already priced in. However, anything good for autos is good for steelmakers, which is good for SCHN.\n\nIf the market digests news that auto manufacturers are running at full speed again, they may begin to value US steelmaker stocks more highly. This would likely pull up SCHN.\n\n## Other Macro Stuff\n\nNot long ago we had a shift from growth-to-value. That seems to have reversed, but it's always possible it starts back up again. This play is so short term that I wouldn't bet on it, unless you are going out until to November or buying shares.\n\n## Little Schnitzer Things\n\n## Possible Dividend Increase?\n\nI'm not sure where or when dividends are declared, so feel free to call me a complete dumbass about this. I searched their last earnings report and could not find the declaration of their next dividend (the one after this upcoming July 9th one).\n\nSo, there's a possibility they announce their next dividend soon, and it's higher than expected. I do not expect there to be much impact from this, but just throwing it out there as a possibility.\n\n## Insurance Settlement\n\nAs noted in the downside risks, in May Schnitzer experienced a fire in their steel mill in Oregon. In their earnings report they mentioned they are still waiting for the exact settlement number:\n\n&gt;We have insurance that we believe is fully applicable to the losses and are currently working with our insurers on claims for property loss and damage and business interruption losses. We anticipate that insured recoveries made of policy deductibles and various conditions, exclusions and limits will cover most of the cost to repair and replace lost and damaged assets and also a significant amount of lost income as a result of the fire. The accounting recognition of such recoveries is expected to occur over several quarters.\n\nIt's possible this number is announced soon. Though it's not likely to be impactful, I thought it was worth a mention.\n\n\\---\n\n# VI. Appendix (Optional): Steel, Scrap, and SCHN.\n\n**You can skip this if you are manically scrolling to the bottom to see positions and shit.**\n\n## Scrap\n\nSteel is one of the most recyclable materials in the world. It is also environmentally taxing (and increasingly expensive) to create from scratch. As such, steelmakers prefer to buy scrap and melt it down to make new steel.\n\nScrap metal in the US is plentiful, as we enjoyed much of the 20th century being the steel center of the world. We have a lot of if laying around. Think: those junkyards with car skeletons and washing machines stacked high. (You should have a drive-by and see for yourself if those piles are getting higher or lower.)\n\nBeing responsible soy cucks that care about the environment, the US has also spent the last 100 years building out businesses to collect, sort, process, and reuse scrap metal. One such leading business that is publicly traded is SCHN.\n\n## EAFs\n\nAn elecrical arc furnace (EAF) is a new-ish type of steel furnace that uses electricity to smelt steel. [They are loud as fuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j2jESz7Zl8#t=1m32s) and if I could choose my own death, it would death by EAF.\n\nAnyway, EAFs are great because they *drastically* reduce CO2 emissions as well as PM2.5 emissions (small 2.5um particles that make humans sick when they breath them). They can take scrap metal as input, allowing for cheap and easy recycling of steel. **EAFs are the future of steelmaking, and is why \"scrap will become the next precious metal.\"**\n\n## Steel Prices\n\nThe price of steel (eg, HRC prices) is a rough proxy for how valuable scrap is. Steelmakers can buy scrap, smelt it, and then sell the new steel. If they can sell steel for more, they can afford to buy scrap for more.\n\nSCHN collects scrap and sells it. As steel prices climb, SCHN can sell the scrap they collect for more. While it may become more costly for them to collect the scrap, their margins have actually increased. Their margins have steadily increased: 13% (Q4 - quarter ending Aug '20), 14.63% (Q1), 18.84% (Q2), 17.35% (Q3 - ending May '21, reported last week).\n\n## China\n\nChina makes 55% of the world's steel (and exports 15-20% of the world's steel), and until now they have not been responsible soy cucks. As noted in [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tangshan-steel/china-environment-minister-urges-crackdown-on-steel-mills-illegal-production-idUSKBN2B407Q) (March '21):\n\n&gt;China has pledged to cut its crude steel output in 2021 from a record 1.06 billion tons it churned out last year to reduce carbon emissions. The steel sector accounts for 15% of China\u2019s total emissions, topping all other manufacturing categories. \u201cSteel companies are the main body responsible for air pollution...(they) should not just focus on performance and leave pollution to local people,\u201d said Huang (the \"Minister of Ecology and Environment\" in charge of cracking down on steelmakers)\n\nTheir air quality sucks, it's killing people, and they have the Olympics coming up:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Apparently some regions are like smoking 40 cigarettes a day.](https://preview.redd.it/ev6pr9f5en971.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5add313e6aa51a7a8e606788daacb2a98d1b6d3f)\n\nTo cut pollution from steel, China is doing the following:\n\n1. Cutting down on production\n2. Cutting down on exporting (they recently removed an incentive to export steel, and a tax is rumored to be in the works)\n3. Switching to EAFs. (BTW: China doesn't have 100 years of junk cars laying around.)\n\n**All three of these drive a higher price of steel and a higher demand for scrap.**\n\n## tldr long-term basics:\n\n* Steelmakers love scrap\n* High steel prices (HRC) means SCHN makes more money\n* China makes, consumes, and exports the most steel (by far) of anyone in the world\n* China essentially dictates the price of steel around the world\n* China is exporting less = HRC prices go up\n* China is switching to EAFs = China will want scrap\n\n\\---\n\n# VII. The Bets\n\nThe risk/reward metrics for various calls are for you to determine, but I'll share my notes.\n\nThe \"moderately retarded\" bet would be Aug $50's. They're \\~$2.50 and I think they'll be above $10.00 at some point. That's about the same risk/reward as Aug $55's ($1.25, could end at $5.00), but the $50s, being closer to ITM, are much safer.\n\nSome more notes/advice for you to ignore:\n\n* My PT for this bet is $55 for July and $60 by August.\n* Both IV and share price on SCHN are looking juicy on the drop after earnings, and especially given today's price action in steel. (It's interesting to see SCHN recovering faster than the pack.)\n* SCHN IV, at time of writing (3:30pm Tuesday) is at 48% -- 14th %'ile over 26w period. Looks good to me.\n* The volume on SCHN is rather low... based on past experience posting about WWE and BGS, that could mean the stock and/or IV pops. If it does, then sit it out and wait for better entry. You have time.\n* Don't YOLO, determine what you are willing to pay right now before looking at the prices, and if the market is pricing it otherwise, then wait.\n\nAs noted in the DD, I expect steelmakers' earnings will be good and will lift SCHN, though it may take a week or two for them to actually move. Here's a list of upcoming earnings:\n\n* STLD: Jul 19-ish\n* NUE: Jul 21-ish\n* CLF: Jul 22\n* X: Jul 28-ish\n\n## Aug 20 Calls\n\nThe real taster's choice shit. This give exposure to steelmakers' earnings, plus some time for the market to digest them. They cover August 1st, which could be a possible China export tax announcement date. They also give plenty of time for SCHN/HRC to close. Based on the past three post-earnings periods, SCHN has gone up significantly within 45 days.\n\nThe prices are nice -- $55 calls are around $1.10 a pop, so that's a 4-bagger if my $60 PT is hit, and more if the IV and/or share price rally before expiration. Given that the $50's are similar ($2.50 each), they're a safer bet.\n\n## Nov Calls\n\nIn my opinion, these are pointlessly far out for this bet. The main catalysts will have already happened by Aug 20, so why pay for time you won't use? There might be a play here to go OTM and hope for a volatility spike into steelmakers' earnings -- but I think liquidity will be shit. I'm passing on these.",

        "selftext": "So what does that mean, the market has turned upside down? What does that mean when the Nasdaq is hitting new highs everyday but many of the stocks I watch are down? What is this divergence? Is the Nasdaq index accurate? What stocks are actually up?\n\nSo yesterday 7/6/2021, I was surfing on Reddit and I did come across some Warren Buffet videos. The oracle of Omaha and well deserved. I have read a couple of his books maybe 10-12 years ago, read much about him but actually didn't see these videos until yesterday. In a nut shell he stated that you can not time the markets, no one can time the market, the best time to buy, is when you first see value and if anything but it in increments. The 2nd thing he stated was that he does not buy anything where he does not see value..... if it does not make money now..... because you can not predict the future, \"a bird in the hand right now, is worth 2 more in the bush.\" That means if you have a solid company making money now, do not jump ship and buy/speculate on something that is losing money/growing or for the short term perceives to be doing alot better. This paragraph will become important as I answer these questions. I hope to help calm everyones' nerves with the answers to these questions.\n\nI have wrote in many posts, as far back as a few weeks that the market is upside down, ever since the Nasdaq was at 13,800-14,000 and fed Powell was about to speak. The market upside down is when stocks that make money, have cash, give dividends, have the ability to buyback shares, raise dividends are falling like knives. Something like AFIN dipped under 8! NYCB under 11! (Again today, thanx for the trade), NYMT under 4.50 (Here we go again).. These are stocks that I constantly trade, and tell the elite team to trade when we are forced to pivot and seek safety. Why? Because they can do all of those things....... A company that does not make money, can not buy shares, can not raise dividends, and even as the stock drops they want to print more shares..\n\nMany followers and the elite team are asking me what do I think is going on, why is the Nasdaq making new highs but I see a sea of red? So, I did alot of digging this week. The Nasdaq is indeed a cap weighted Index.. So is the SP and Nasdaq 100 are all cap weighted. That means as the market cap of a company grows (That is the overall value of a company) the meaning and weight it carries on the index grows as well....Why does this matter? The big 5, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, FB... account for 40% of the nasdaq!!!! Look it up! I just did, because I am supposed to be all knowing! You guys do keep me sharp! AAPL alone accounts for 12% of the nasdaq index and nearly 20% of QQQ (Nasdaq 100). The Nasdaq has almost 5,000 tickers. So the fact that 5 company's can shift 40% or more! of the market means that 4,000 can call and 150 can be up and the NASDAQ can be up! Is that possible? Yesterday there were 4 decliners for every advancer.. (4,000 down, 1,000 up) that is 7/6/2021. Today 7/7/2021 there were about 1.5 decliners for every advancer. (3,000 down and 2,000 up)..... In fact the US equity market is about 50 trillion and covers about 12-13,000 tickers amongst the NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX and OTC... These 5 make up about 10 trillion!! So, just these 5 are 20% of the entire US market!! Yes! Now, I knew they were important and cap weighted I just didnt know how so..... because these stocks are making record all time highs, the Nasdaq is at 14,600-14,700 and its a sea of red. I started to see what was up and saw these mighty titans and some speculative stocks.. So that is your answer....... it is happening, why the Nasdaq is making new highs and I see a sea of red. So the Nasdaq is accurate, their is no mistake. Some stocks like SE, BILL are going sky high, LMND bouncing back but these are strictly speculative, snow.......\n\nWhat is the danger in this? Why does it matter? Because I was even telling my elite team to me, we are already near a correction. If you take out 25 of the largest cap company's their is no doubt the Nasdaq is already down 5-10% but we cant see it! They have asked me other ways to track what is going on...... The only other way is to track other nasdaq important stocks to know, because if you track these 5 that mean the most, they are making highs. The danger in this is if they fall, it may cause a panic and speculative stocks will really crash! Because if the Nasdaq is at record highs and most people do not know its a few company's bringing up the market if the Nasdaq as a whole falls to 14,000 it may cause panic!\n\nWhat do we do? I am going back defensive after I sell of some of my offensive stocks....Or I will buy an offensive stock after its down at least 5% on the day.....\n\nRecall earlier the paragraph about Warren Buffet and buy value, cash cows, and buy more when fear is instilled elsewhere........ When the market started to turn upside down, an amazing value stock I had was TX, it dipped to 31, I did buy more, albeit in fear and traded it. It has bounced back to near 52 week highs as of today near 42. So that is a 30+ percent move in 2 weeks on a safe stock that makes cash! AFIN, BRMK, NYCB, they all recovered and made for great trades.... Today I am given another trading opportunity in NYCB and NYMT.......Now an offensive play, give it, these are Chinese are getting crushed and they are offensive. TIGR and VIPS. TIGR rose to 30!! It is now under 21...... VIPS dipped to 15 and change went back to 20.66 and has dropped this week because of DIDI (Chinese).. Same with TIGR.. I do own VIPS at 21.... I have been trading TIGR.... I just wanted you all to see what the difference is of a defensive play making tons of cash \\[1 in the hand, 2 in the bush\\]..... Now I do believe VIPS and TIGR are 2 offensive plays that should rise but we do have to be careful....\n\nSo in short, the market is upside down, being held by a few stocks.

        "selftext": "Oracle is currently at all time highs and is breaking out with 3% moves for the past few days. Here's a few reasons why I think this will keep going and if you do not want to miss another MSFT or AMZN, you should buy Oracle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Oracle is extremely undervalued with a P/E of 19.19 as a Cloud/Software company.  Usually Cloud/Software companies like Microsoft or Goog have P/es in the high 30s/40s. \n\n2.  Oracle does massive stockbuybacks with them announcing a 20 billion stock repurchase plan this year as well as having a dividend yield of 1.46% which is way higher than AAPL or MSFT.\n\n3. Oracle is growing massively with 8% YoY growth from last year yet they are being priced as a boomer company \n\n4. With the recent JEDI news being cancelled now Oracle has a shot of receiving this contract which should also boost stock price.  [https://www.barrons.com/articles/oracle-stock-defense-cloud-contract-51625863023](https://www.barrons.com/articles/oracle-stock-defense-cloud-contract-51625863023) love round numbers. When was the last time you saw a stock at 80 or 90 and eventually never hit 100? Almost never. Stocks love to hit round numbers.\n\n6. Options are extremely cheap on oracle with them sometimes being less than 10 cents even though the stock is at 80$ currently. This means there is alot of gamma squeeze potential with Oracle as it is extremely cheap to buy OTM options for Oracle and thus force MM's to buy shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Tl;dr: Oracle is an extremely undervalued Cloud/ Software company that is currently breaking out right now with an extremely high chance of hitting 100 very soon. I would recommend buying calls on Oracle as they are currently very cheap with them being a few cents each for OTM calls.",

        "selftext": "So what does that mean, the market has turned upside down? What does that mean when the Nasdaq is hitting new highs everyday but many of the stocks I watch are down? What is this divergence? Is the Nasdaq index accurate? What stocks are actually up?\n\nSo yesterday 7/6/2021, I was surfing on Reddit and I did come across some Warren Buffet videos. The oracle of Omaha and well deserved. I have read a couple of his books maybe 10-12 years ago, read much about him but actually didn't see these videos until yesterday. In a nut shell he stated that you can not time the markets, no one can time the market, the best time to buy, is when you first see value and if anything but it in increments. The 2nd thing he stated was that he does not buy anything where he does not see value..... if it does not make money now..... because you can not predict the future, \"a bird in the hand right now, is worth 2 more in the bush.\" That means if you have a solid company making money now, do not jump ship and buy/speculate on something that is losing money/growing or for the short term perceives to be doing alot better. This paragraph will become important as I answer these questions. I hope to help calm everyones' nerves with the answers to these questions.\n\nI have wrote in many posts, as far back as a few weeks that the market is upside down, ever since the Nasdaq was at 13,800-14,000 and fed Powell was about to speak. The market upside down is when stocks that make money, have cash, give dividends, have the ability to buyback shares, raise dividends are falling like knives. Something like AFIN dipped under 8! NYCB under 11! (Again today, thanx for the trade), NYMT under 4.50 (Here we go again).. These are stocks that I constantly trade, and tell the elite team to trade when we are forced to pivot and seek safety. Why? Because they can do all of those things....... A company that does not make money, can not buy shares, can not raise dividends, and even as the stock drops they want to print more shares..\n\nMany followers and the elite team are asking me what do I think is going on, why is the Nasdaq making new highs but I see a sea of red? So, I did alot of digging this week. The Nasdaq is indeed a cap weighted Index.. So is the SP and Nasdaq 100 are all cap weighted. That means as the market cap of a company grows (That is the overall value of a company) the meaning and weight it carries on the index grows as well....Why does this matter? The big 5, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, FB... account for 40% of the nasdaq!!!! Look it up! I just did, because I am supposed to be all knowing! You guys do keep me sharp! AAPL alone accounts for 12% of the nasdaq index and nearly 20% of QQQ (Nasdaq 100). The Nasdaq has almost 5,000 tickers. So the fact that 5 company's can shift 40% or more! of the market means that 4,000 can call and 150 can be up and the NASDAQ can be up! Is that possible? Yesterday there were 4 decliners for every advancer.. (4,000 down, 1,000 up) that is 7/6/2021. Today 7/7/2021 there were about 1.5 decliners for every advancer. (3,000 down and 2,000 up)..... In fact the US equity market is about 50 trillion and covers about 12-13,000 tickers amongst the NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX and OTC... These 5 make up about 10 trillion!! So, just these 5 are 20% of the entire US market!! Yes! Now, I knew they were important and cap weighted I just didnt know how so..... because these stocks are making record all time highs, the Nasdaq is at 14,600-14,700 and its a sea of red. I started to see what was up and saw these mighty titans and some speculative stocks.. So that is your answer....... it is happening, why the Nasdaq is making new highs and I see a sea of red. So the Nasdaq is accurate, their is no mistake. Some stocks like SE, BILL are going sky high, LMND bouncing back but these are strictly speculative, snow.......\n\nWhat is the danger in this? Why does it matter? Because I was even telling my elite team to me, we are already near a correction. If you take out 25 of the largest cap company's their is no doubt the Nasdaq is already down 5-10% but we cant see it! They have asked me other ways to track what is going on...... The only other way is to track other nasdaq important stocks to know, because if you track these 5 that mean the most, they are making highs. The danger in this is if they fall, it may cause a panic and speculative stocks will really crash! Because if the Nasdaq is at record highs and most people do not know its a few company's bringing up the market if the Nasdaq as a whole falls to 14,000 it may cause panic!\n\nWhat do we do? I am going back defensive after I sell of some of my offensive stocks....Or I will buy an offensive stock after its down at least 5% on the day.....\n\nRecall earlier the paragraph about Warren Buffet and buy value, cash cows, and buy more when fear is instilled elsewhere........ When the market started to turn upside down, an amazing value stock I had was TX, it dipped to 31, I did buy more, albeit in fear and traded it. It has bounced back to near 52 week highs as of today near 42. So that is a 30+ percent move in 2 weeks on a safe stock that makes cash! AFIN, BRMK, NYCB, they all recovered and made for great trades.... Today I am given another trading opportunity in NYCB and NYMT.......Now an offensive play, give it, these are Chinese are getting crushed and they are offensive. TIGR and VIPS. TIGR rose to 30!! It is now under 21...... VIPS dipped to 15 and change went back to 20.66 and has dropped this week because of DIDI (Chinese).. Same with TIGR.. I do own VIPS at 21.... I have been trading TIGR.... I just wanted you all to see what the difference is of a defensive play making tons of cash \\[1 in the hand, 2 in the bush\\]..... Now I do believe VIPS and TIGR are 2 offensive plays that should rise but we do have to be careful....\n\nSo in short, the market is upside down, being held by a few stocks. I refer to the Nasdaq as most of us trade tech/growth. I hope this explains much, and calms nerves for people with stocks that make cash!!!",

THE MCAP DISPLAYED IS THE SPACS MCAP WHICH IS NO LONGER RELEVANT AND INCORRECT. *****\n\nRead first, thank me later. **AvePoint (ticker: AVPT), the Largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider was just listed publicly on Nasdaq last week.**\n\n**// About AvePoint**\n\nAvePoint is the largest data management solutions provider for the Microsoft cloud, with over 1,300 employees in 29 global offices. Key takeaway:\n\n* AvePoint was founded in 2001 as a company to help ease the complexity of SharePoint installations, which at the time were all on-premise. Today, it has adapted to the shift to the cloud as a SaaS tool and primarily acts as a policy layer enabling companies to make sure employees are using these tools in a compliant way\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/51f1k5snis971.png?width=2336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5a21e74013bb932021191f36d7d167184d39454\n\nCompany's Footprint\n\n* Huge diversified blue-chip client base, \\~7 million members (as of Sep 30, 2020) with 16k accounts and 25% of Fortune 500 using the company\u2019s services. 7M users represent 3% or 250M Microsoft 365 client base with an estimated addressable market of $33 billion by 2022 (according to IDC). The Company sells directly to large and mid-market enterprises, and its solutions are also available to managed services providers on more than 100 cloud marketplaces globally.

Expected 2020 revenues @ USD 148M, a + 26% YoY increase (78% recurring revenues). There are 212 public software companies and AvePoint is one of 5 that is growing at a rate of more than 25% revenue while maintaining a 14% EBIT margin and 30% ARR growth. The company is projecting significant growth for the next two years with revenue estimates of $257 million and ARR of $220 million by the end of 2022\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fvpgk90qis971.png?width=2676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b6b1c748ffd873fdb964aa7277554f1fee3ab9c\n\nStrong Financials\n\n* Great market trends.

The company has raised a total of $294 million in capital before the reverse merger announcement\n\nAbout Apex Tech that merged with Avepoint:\n\n* Outstanding management: led by Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein (\\*cough\\* didn\u2019t kill himself \\*cough\\*) and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig. Their combined experience includes more than 100 technology IPOs, Served on 20 boards and advisory boards and saw mergers involving companies such as Microsoft, Oracle, Ebay,, Dell, Yahoo! and Twilio\n* Apex\u2019s balance of $352 million plus a $140 million additional private investment will be handed over to AvePoint. Once transaction fees and other considerations are paid for, AvePoint is expected to have $252 million on its balance sheet. Existing AvePoint shareholders will own approximately 72% of the combined entity, with the balance held by the Apex SPAC and the private investment owners.

As a result of this I have decided to take on the task of trying explain exactlywhat Palantir does and why they could be the best undervalued stock to buy now.\n\no I am no data engineer, so this article contains my interpretations of what Palantir does, some of my interpretations may be off, so I would appreciate any helpful comments to clear some things up that I may have got wrong.\n\n\u00b7 Based on the comparable analyses that I underwent, Palantir is currently an undervalued stock and represents a great opportunity for a long-term hold.\n\no The length of time that I plan on holding is subject to change due to their future financial reports, and any news that may come out.\n\n\u00b7 It is very hard to say what the upside potential of an investment into Palantir is, which is why my investment plan (found in the \u201cplan\u201d section) is different than usual.\n\no There are various risks to this investment (like there are to every investment), these risks are highlighted near the end of this report under the \u201crisks\u201d section.\n\no Additionally, there are also multiple different catalysts that can help Palantir\u2019s share price, both in the short and long term(s). These catalysts are listed at the end of this report.\n\n***Overview of Palantir as a Company:***\n\n[$PLTR - Palantir Technologies Inc.](https://utradea.com/stocks/PLTR) was founded in 2003 (after their fear/anger after the events observed through 9/11) and started building their software primarily for government institutions and intelligence to assist in counterterrorism by any means possible. At this point in time, Palantir\u2019s only source of revenue was through secretive government contracts.\n\nHowever, since that point in time, Palantir has expanded their operations into commercial enterprises, as they noticed a lot of similarities and overlaps with their applications. Now, Palantir\u2019s revenue comes from both Government Contracts and Commercial Enterprise Contracts.\n\n*Palantir has 2 main software platforms, Palantir \u201cGotham\u201d, and Palantir \u201cFoundry\u201d.*\n\n[**Palantir Gotham**](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/) was their first software platform and was designed for defense/intelligence use cases. Palantir has stated that this kind of platform helps agencies find \u201cneedles in thousands of haystacks\u201d. They also noted that [Gotham helped soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan](https://www.palantir.com/wp-assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Impact-Study-Palantir-Defense-During-Drawdown.pdf) to map networks of bomb makers and insurgents through deep/hidden patterns and datasets, helping the army save time and lives. Since this mission, Gotham has expanded into defense operations and mission planning. During this time, Palantir found that Gotham could also be applied in Airbus\u2019 business, as their planes require millions of parts, assembled in multiple factories in different countries. However, Palantir decided to make another software platform that is better tailored to commercial enterprises, this platform was labelled \u201cPalantir Foundry\u201d.\n\n[**Palantir Foundry**](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/) transforms the way in which organizations interact with their information by creating a central operating system for their data. Palantir enables their customers to construct their own models quickly and easily from countless sets of data points.\n\nPalantir software is used by their 139 Government and Commercial Institutions/enterprises, in over 40 industries, ranging over 150 countries. Palantir works with the US Government and their several allies abroad, as well as the worlds most important/reliable companies.\n\nLastly, Palantir has stated \u201cWe are not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. We build the software that enable our customers to integrate their own data that they already have.\u201d\n\n***Everything you need to know about Palantir and $PLTR:***\n\n*Palantir Foundry:*\n\nFoundry is essentially a [data warehouse](https://panoply.io/data-warehouse-guide/the-difference-between-a-database-and-a-data-warehouse/) that helps their commercial customers to collect and analyze their data. Foundry\u2019s platform includes a [graphical data interface](https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/graphical-user-interface) that is extremely user friendly allowing their customers to get the most out of their data. Furthermore, Foundry provides statistical analyses through the use of their [AI machine learning](https://www.palantir.com/solutions/ai-ml/) networks that are able to consistently deliver efficient and accurate results.\n\nFoundry helps to enables all of their users, regardless of their technical abilities, to work meaningfully and act with the data that they collect. Foundry provides a suite of applications that help combine data analytics and business logic, helping them to deliver superior data integration.\n\nFoundry\u2019s front-end (what the user sees) enables their users to take advantage of all of the data collected by their organization to make informed decisions. Foundry also has a fantastic application for inter-organizational collaboration, this helps a team to build on each others work.\n\n*Foundry brings all of an enterprises data together onto their platform, however there are access controls in place to define what individuals get control over which dataset(s). From there, Foundry is able to deliver advanced analytics through their machine learning and AI systems to get the most value out of a company\u2019s data, make quality insights, so that their clients can gain a competitive advantage.*\n\n**Foundries potential use cases are almost infinite.**\n\n*Palantir Gotham:*\n\nDubbed \u201cThe Operating System for Government Decision Making\u201d, Gotham helps to improve and accelerate decisions across all levels of Government operations.\n\nGotham is primarily used by the defense and intelligence sections of the Government, to help them find what they are looking for. Gotham collects data from millions of different sources and combines it all into one platform to identify hidden patterns and bring all of this data to life. This allows their users to access this data and manage their operations to execute real-world responses to threats that Gotham identifies. Gotham is becoming a main data solution across various different government agencies.\n\nThere is not too much information that is publicly known about the actual uses of Gotham, which makes sense due to the secretive nature of the organizations that they are in business with. However, what we do know is that these organizations have re-signed contracts with Palantir, which helps us to be confident that this platform is truly \u201cthe real deal\u201d.\n\nLastly, Gotham is also offered to select commercial customers, primarily the companies that are investigating fraud in financial service industries. Furthermore, [Palantir has been credited](https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/news/2015/01/12/leaked-documents-bernie-madoff-convicted-thanks-to.html) with assisting in finding the largest Ponzi scheme ever (Bernie Madoff\u2019s Ponzi Scheme).\n\n*Gotham helps the Defense and Intelligence sectors of the Government to pool their incomprehensible amounts of data into one place. Palantir uses machine learning to quickly locate hidden pieces of data, and key patterns, so that these institutions can take swift action to the threats/problems they face in real-time.*\n\n*Palantir\u2019s Approach:*\n\nPalantir believes that every large institution in the world has a problem in their approach to mass data analysis, and Palantir believes that their platforms are best suited to help companies address this problem and make the most out of their data.\n\nPalantir recognises that other companies sell features, tools, applications, and/or dashboards, however these products are not built to maintain optimal performance in the long run (if at all). Palantir prides themselves on having the best all around software/platform to have sustainable, reliable, and safe data solutions.\n\nPalantir also groups their Foundry data from all of their companies into one large system of several large \u201cfarms\u201d of data provided by each of their client companies. By doing this, Palantir is able to feed more data/information into their machine learning, AI, and algorithms so that they can continue to be more reliable and efficient. This also enables [cross-industry data pools](https://youtu.be/7zqE8J4WKOU), that can be used by their companies when they look to expand or for opportunities in other verticals.\n\n*Palantir Success Stories:*\n\n**BP:**\n\nPerhaps the most notable success story that has come from Palantir is their partnership with [$BP \u2013 British Petroleum](https://utradea.com/stocks/BP)\n\nBP and Palantir have been partners since 2014, and recently (February 2021) [BP and Palantir have extended their partnership](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/05/palantir-deepens-ties-with-bp-with-new-5-year-deal/) for 5 more years. Palantir has helped BP to transform their business into a more digital one, and this extension of their partnership will ensure a further acceleration of their strategic digitization of their business.\n\nPalantir\u2019s Foundry has already helped BP by streamlining and enhancing their hydrocarbon-based workflows. Palantir helped BP to analyze their drilling data and has helped them to [increase their oil production in the North Sea by over 10%.](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/palantir-the-tech-spooks-who-found-bin-laden-are-helping-bp-find-oil-9qddfpv2r)\n\nThis increase in production helps us to visualize just how useful Palantir\u2019s software can be. This is why their Foundry has been credited as a \u201ccompetitive advantage\u201d. Other oil producing companies most likely would not have been able to uncover the data, patterns, and relationships that were uncovered by Palantir, thus the companies that are not using Palantir may be losing out.\n\nThis type of publicity is fantastic for Palantir, as companies may see this, and contact Palantir because they too want a competitive advantage. Palantir\u2019s best chance at becoming the next \u201ctech giant\u201d comes through the commercial applications/contracts. This is because there are infinite uses for Palantir, so theoretically, they can get it in the hands of every business (which would help revenues to soar).\n\n**National Institute of Health (NIH) and Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS):**\n\nPalantir has historically been a rather controversial company through their help in government agencies like ICE. However, recently Palantir has been getting good press, which has helped their company image. Since the start of the pandemic some institutions like the NIH and NHS have signed contracts with Palantir, for Palantir\u2019s assistance with their fights against COVID-19, and their vaccine distributions. This is good for Palantir as it shows them in a good light and shows that they can help provide the world with help and safety during a crisis like COVID-19.\n\nThe NIH agreed to a [$36M contract](https://www.palantir.com/pt_media/nih-palantir-contract/) to gain a partnership with Palantir. Their (NIH\u2019s), mission is to build the largest centralized COVID-19 patient database in the world, and Palantir has helped them to do this with massive success.\n\nPalantir was able to assist the NIH in building their [N3C data platform](https://covid.cd2h.org/). This platform has come a long way since they teamed up with Palantir, and now has over 7.1B rows of data from 6.5M patients, from 57 different databases. Without the assistance of Palantir, analyzing this amount of data would have been no easy feat, however Palantir has provided the NIH with advanced analytics in the matter of minutes thank to their machine learning capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, in December of 2020, Palantir signed a [2-year $31.5M deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201223005018/en/Palantir-Continues-Vital-NHS-Work-With-31.5M-Contract) with the Brittan\u2019s NHS. This partnership requires Foundry to provide a secure, reliable, and timely platform to process data, while protecting patient privacy, to ultimately improve patient care.\n\nBoth of these partnerships highlight the need for Palantir during a crisis and having these large Government Health Institutes choosing Palantir as their first options is a great deal, and shows their confidence in Palantir\u2019s software.\n\n*Sources:*\n\n[The power of data in a pandemic - Technology in the NHS (blog.gov.uk)](https://healthtech.blog.gov.uk/2020/03/28/the-power-of-data-in-a-pandemic/)\n\n*Strengths:*\n\n**Built-in Privacy Controls:**\n\nBy having [privacy controls](https://youtu.be/7zqE8J4WKOU) in place, Palantir is able to operate in places that other data companies cannot go. This is especially true for Foundry, where companies/individuals can request cross-industry data from other Palantir clients to help them in a variety of ways. This request for external data needs to be accepted by a representative of the other company to be allowed. This helps Palantir leverage all of the data that they have on their \u201cOperating System\u201d, which essentially makes their platform a cross-company/cross-country collaborative workspace for all. As Palantir attains more clients, the more attractive/extensive their database is for potential clients. This should help Palantir to expand quickly once they get the ball rolling.\n\nPalantir truly values this privacy and has integrated data legibility, audit logs, access controls, quality checks and requirements to attain external data.\n\n**Government Grade Security:**\n\nAs we know, Palantir started out in just the defense and intelligence spaces. This required Palantir to have elite-level security from the get-go. Their software had to be secure enough to handle national secrets and transparent enough to ensure that the data could be monitored and traced. This is no easy feat, however Palantir managed to achieve this, which is why they have been renewing their contracts with several government agencies.\n\nThis is important when trying to sell their products to their commercial clients, because they need something safe and reliable to protect themselves and their data. Furthermore, Palantir currently has [IL-5 clearance](https://simplemoneylyfe.com/palantir-stock-analysis/) with the Department of Defense (DoD), which makes them 1 of 4 software companies with this level of clearance (alongside Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP). However, it has also been rumoured that Palantir may achieve IL-6 clearance, which has never been done before as it is the storage/processing of **classified information.**\n\nThis level of clearance should speak volumes to how safe and secure Palantir\u2019s technology truly is and should provide ease of mind to companies that they are in business with.\n\n**Expansion into the Commercial Sector:**\n\nPalantir currently has a huge opportunity ahead of them as they continue to increase their presence in the commercial sector, partnering with some of the largest enterprises in the world. Palantir plans to provide these businesses with the software that they need to do their jobs as efficient as possible and sees large growth potential in this industry.\n\nPalantir has said that they are focusing on building partnerships with enterprises that are willing to undergo structural changes within the organization/operations. Palantir has a huge market ahead of themselves in the commercial sector, and their stock should do well on the news breaking of new partnerships between Palantir and commercial enterprises.\n\n*Government Contracts:*\n\nDo you remember what I said earlier about what happens once Palantir gets the ball rolling? If so, you will know where I am headed with this section.\n\nBetween 2008-2018 (10 years), Palantir was able to generate $51.9M in revenue from government contracts. However, in the 2 years following this they earned $179.9M in Government contracts (this can be found under the \u201cUS Government\u201d section of their [SEC 10-K report](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1)). Once Palantir was able to get the ball rolling with these agencies, Palantir was able to both expand and renew existing contracts to earn more revenue. I believe that the same thing will happen with Palantir\u2019s commercial operations. Once they start to get a large number of big enterprises renewing their contracts for \u201cbigger bucks\u201d, I believe that Palantir will start to grow their revenues extremely quick and attract new clients \u201cleft, right, and center\u201d.\n\nThese contract renewals are so important because essentially, they mean that Palantir met and/or exceeded expectations, and these companies now believe that Palantir is vital to their business/operations, so look out for news around renewals.\n\n*Business Model:*\n\nPalantir has developed a business model that focuses on acquiring contracts and expanding their services and has 3 main phases.\n\n1. **Acquire Customers:** Palantir has expanded their sales force largely over the past couple of years, and actively purse negotiations with companies that they can provide long-term value to. To acquire these companies, Palantir gives them a short demo to see how effective and user friendly their software is, Palantir provides this service for a loss. However, they are willing to incur these (proportionately) small losses to potentially acquire large contracts with these companies. This phase runs at a loss but helps Palantir set up clients for the next phase.\n2. **Expand:** Once Palantir has a potential customer on the hook, they move them along to the expand phase. Palantir installs their software in these enterprises and teaches them the ropes, of course this requires a large investment from Palantir to incorporate it. These customers often sign a short contract with Palantir for a cheap cost (Palantir takes a loss on this phase as well), however clients are able to truly unlock Palantir\u2019s software during this phase and see what it has to offer. If they like their software, they will be moved along to the next phase (scale) which is Palantir\u2019s bread and butter.\n3. **Scale:** These clients tend to sign longer-term deals with Palantir for their software after they have got a \u201cgood feel\u201d for their software. The companies in this stage are also generally \u201chands-off\u201d meaning that they can operate the software without much help. Companies tend to find the most value in this stage, and Palantir makes the best margins on this stage. In 2020, Palantir made $613.4M in this stage with a margin of 70%\n\n*Financial information:*\n\nAll of this information can be found in their [SEC 10-K filing.](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1)\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, Palantir increased their gross profit by 47.97% and increased their gross margin to 81% (from 71%), Palantir reported their first net income (excluding stock-based compensation) ever and increase their net revenues by 47.15%.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, Palantir\u2019s loss from operations increased by 103.61%, their stock-based compensation increased by 425.15%, their General and Admin expenses increased by 108.59%, and their net loss increased by 101.22%. Their biggest problem in 2020 was their large stock-based compensation, which will be addressed later.\n\n\u00b7 **Convertible Preferred Stock:** In 2020, Palantir issued a total of 797,771,675 shares of common stock through conversion of their previous \u201cconvertible referred shares\u201d. This one factor of dilution caused an estimated dilutionary effect of Palantir\u2019s stock of 137.19%. This is a huge form of dilution, and I have never seen anything like this before, however I have an explanation for this so stay tuned for that.\n\n\u00b7 **Repurchase of Common Stock:** In 2020, Palantir repurchased 808,201 shares back. This is a measly amount compared to the amount of dilution from preferred stock, however any buyback is good to see as an investor. This buyback caused an inflationary effect on existing shares of 0.14%, which is not much, but we will still take it.\n\n\u00b7 **Stock Warrants:** In 2020, Palantir experienced an additional 7,631,329 shares on the market through the exercising of warrants. The exercising of these warrant had a dilutionary effect on Palantir\u2019s stock of 1.31%.\n\n\u00b7 **Common Stock (Net of Issuance Costs):** In 2020, Palantir unloaded 206,500,523 common shares onto the market from issuance of common stock net of issuance costs. I believe that this means that, Palantir had to fork out additional shares to cover the investment needed to take their shares public. I could very well be wrong on that, and if anyone can pitch in and explain this to me that would be great! Anyways, this caused a dilutionary effect of Palantir\u2019s common stock of roughly 35.51%. This is a large portion of dilution, however it does not even factor in other factors of dilution which is worrying.\n\n\u00b7 **Stock Options:** In 2020, Palantir added 120,617,527 common shares to their shares outstanding through the exercise of options. These options were exercised and thus converted into these common shares and had a dilutionary effect of 20.72%. Once again, this is a large amount of dilution and should be considered by investors.\n\n\u00b7 **RSU\u2019s:** In 2020, Palantir issued 82,429,575 shares through their vesting of \u201cRestricted Stock Units\u201d (RSU\u2019s). This had a dilutionary effect on their stock of 14.18% (which is a lot of dilution).\n\n\u00b7 **Modification to Stock Options:** In 2020, Palantir technically bought back 3,500,0000 shares through modifications to stock options (for the settlement of employee loans accounted for as modifications to stock options). Confusing, right? This technical buyback resulted in a share inflation of 0.6%.\n\n\u00b7 **Total Share Dilution in 2020:** In 2020, Palantir experience an overall share dilution of 208.19%. This is the most dilution I have ever seen in a stock that I have analyzed, however there are some potential answers as to why there was so much dilution in 2020.\n\n*Explanation of Share Dilution:*\n\nOnce again, all of the below information can be found in Palantir\u2019s [SEC 10-K filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1).\n\nOn September 30th, 2020, Palantir completed their Direct Listing of their Class A common shares on the public markets on the NYSE. Part of this listing involved the redemption of all of Palantir\u2019s convertible share into common shares. This was the largest single source of dilution in Palantir (137%). Additionally, this Direct Listing involved the exercise of al outstanding warrants, which resulted in dilution of 1.31%. Another part of their Direct Listing was the common stocks issued, net of issuance price to complete the direct listing, which had a dilutionary effect of 35.51%. Lastly, Palantir was forced to create new common shares that would hold the place of the unvested RSU\u2019s, which cause a dilutionary effect of 14.18%.\n\nWithout these factors of dilution, Palantir would have only experienced an overall dilution of 20%. This means that due to the Direct listing, Palantir had to increase their shares outstanding by 188.19% to meet the requirements to be eligible for the listing.\n\n*Overall Thoughts on Dilution:*\n\nPalantir is a very weird stock in terms of their dilution, and I have not seen anything quite like this before. Their overall level of dilution is unprecedented and very worrying for investors. However, we know that these levels of dilution were inflated due to the requirements of undergoing a Direct Listing. However, how does Palantir dilution (excluding the effects caused by their Direct Listing compared to their dilution in previous years?\n\nFor starters, Palantir exhibited a 20% share dilution in 2020 when eluding the dilution caused by the Direct Listing. However, historically Palantir has experienced an average share dilution of 5.18% between 2017-2019. So even excluding the effects caused through the Direct Listing, Palantir still experienced a comparably high level of share dilution. However, 20% of dilution is significantly different than the 208.19% of dilution (which would be crazily high). This 20% is relatively normal for an undervalued growth stock, such as Palantir, so currently I would not be too worried. However, investors should keep up with their financial reports and look for their dilution in 2021, because ultimately that will tell us more about Palantir\u2019s dilution after going public, than their past share dilution as a private company.\n\n*Competition:*\n\nIn order to undergo my comparable analyses (which will be discussed later on) I needed to select 4 companies, that I can compare to Palantir.\n\n[**$ZS \u2013 Zscaler Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/ZS)**:** ZScaler is a security as a service company that helps company adapt to cloud technologies and provides their cybersecurity services through the cloud. ZScaler provides their services to both commercial enterprises and governments, similar to that of Palantir. Furthermore, ZScaler offers their service primarily in the USA, but also has smaller international operations (again like Palantir).\n\n[**$SNOW \u2013 Snowflake Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/SNOW)**:** Snowflake (like Palantir) is a software and technology company that primarily focuses on data. Snowflake provides data cloud services such as data engineering, data science, data applications, data sharing, and data warehouse. This is very similar to the applications and functions available on Palantir, however Palantir offers other functions that differentiate themselves. Snowflake also provides services for both commercial enterprises and government organizations, similar to that of Palantir.\n\n[**$SPLK \u2013 Splunk Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/SPLK)**:** Splunk provide software platforms that deliver insights derived from their clients\u2019 data in the USA and internationally. Splunk offers their Ecosystem solutions that consist of data inputs, workflows, reports, dashboards, data visualizations, actions, and methods, and help their clients/customers to make the best out of their data. All of this sounds eerily familiar to the description of Palantir, making it one of the closer competitors. Splunk also offers their services to the public sector as well as the government, making their business model resemble that of Palantir so much more.\n\n[**$TYL \u2013 Tyler technologies Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/TYL)**:** Tyler technologies is probably the company in this list that least resembles that of Palantir, this is because they provide management solutions, accounting systems, billing systems and other solutions geared toward the public sector. Tyler technologies works primarily with governments of all types (Federal, State, and Municipal), and education institutions. However, the one thing that Tyler has that makes them comparable to Palantir is their data and insight solutions. Their data insights software enables collaboration, displays data visualizations/measurements, and generates insights for their human operators to act on.\n\n*Q1 2021 Updates:*\n\nAll of the below information can be found in [Palantir\u2019s Q1 Investor Presentation](https://investors.palantir.com/files/Palantir%20Q1%202021%20Business%20Update.pdf).\n\nRecently, on May 11th, 2021, Palantir released their Q1 earnings report. When looking at Palantir\u2019s financial performance I did not take this into account, which means that this section will be packed with new information that will help us to understand Palantir\u2019s trajectory even more.\n\nFirst and foremost, this quarter was the first quarter in which Palantir has reported positive earnings. This is a big milestone for Palantir as a public company, and it helps to gets investors excited about the potentially profitable future of Palantir. In Q1, Palantir reported a free cash flow of $151M (was -$290M in Q1 2020) with a 44% adjusted FCF margin, they grew revenues by 49% YoY ($341M), and they grew billings by 248% YoY ($362M) which means that Palantir is acquiring new customers and negotiating higher contracts. These financials are great and show a promising future ahead for Palantir, which should excite their investors.\n\nFurthermore, during this quarter they also disclosed their investment in a SPAC. This SPAC is [$QELL \u2013 Qell Acquisition Corp.](https://utradea.com/stocks/QELL) which merging with Lilium. Lilium is an eVTOL transportation company, with this investment they also came to a deal with Lilium to use Foundry for design, engineering, testing, production, quality, logistics, and operations. A while back I looked at another eVTOL SPAC Archer ([$ACIC \u2013 Atlas Crest Investment Corp.](https://utradea.com/stocks/ACIC)), which has great upside and has a similar business model to Lilium, so if you want to read that to be more informed about Liliums potential performance, [click here.](https://utradea.com/positions/Take_a_SHOT_at_Archers_SPAC_ACIC)\n\nIn Q1, Palantir was also awarded with a [5-year $90M contract](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210405005238/en/Palantir-Selected-by-the-National-Nuclear-Security-Administration-for-5-year-89.9M-Contract-for-SAFER-Project) from the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), in which Palantir will provide the operational platform for their SAFER (Safety Analytics, Forecasting, and Evaluation Reporting) project. This is big news as this is one of Palantir\u2019s bigger contracts, and it shows the level of confidence of the NNSA in Palantir\u2019s software and their cross-enterprise data integration capabilities. On the topic of Palantir and Government Organizations, the DoD used Palantir\u2019s software in all 11 of their Combatant Commands for globally integrated intelligence. This high level of usage from the DoD definitely means that Palantir is doing something right, and if the DoD likes it so much, then it should be more than enough for commercial enterprises.\n\nLastly, in Q1, Palantir won 15 contracts worth over $5M, and 6 contracts worth over $10M with an average duration of 3.7 years (4.6 for commercial customers). This is fantastic for the company as they gained an additional 11 new commercial customers from this, and I will be keeping up to date with these contracts and others as they come up for renewal/negotiations. Additionally, Palantir was able to grow their gross margin to 83% (from 75% Q1 2020), and their contribution margin to 60% (from 41% in Q1 2020). This shows that Palantir business partners are maturing into their 3rd phase, the scale phase, which enables Palantir to grow their margins.\n\n***$PLTR \u2013 Palantir Investment Valuation:***\n\n*Comparable Analyses:*\n\nI decided to undergo 2 different comparable analyses in order to get a variety of valuations (or opinions if you will). Preferably, I would like both of these results to be consistent in terms of their fair value estimate, however, if they are not consistent, I will take the average result. I was only able to find 2 multiples/ratios that I could actually analyze due to the nature of these businesses and their lack of positive financial ratios/multiples.\n\n*EV/Revenue:*\n\nThis is a very common multiple among companies that are not profitable in their operations yet, like Palantir and some of these other comparable companies. By comparing Palantir\u2019s EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors (listed above on the \u201ccompetitors\u201d section of this report), I found that Palantir has a fair value of $32.85/share, which implies an upside to this investment of 23.31%. This implies that given Palantir\u2019s current price, they are undervalued, and the upside is very reasonable, however, I decided to undergo the next comparable to see if this result maintains.\n\n*P/B:*\n\nBy comparing Palantir\u2019s P/B ratio to that of their competitors, I found that Palantir has a fair value of $24.87/share, which implies that there is a downside risk of 6.64% to such an investment. As you have probably noticed, these results are not consistent, therefore I have decided to take the average result to get one, final price target.\n\n*Average Comparable:*\n\nBy taking the average result from the 2 comparable analyses underwent, I found that Palantir has a fair value of $28.86/share, which implies an overall upside of 8.36% to this investment. This also implies that Palantir, is in fact an undervalued growth stock, that has the potential to be one of the best undervalued stocks on the market.\n\n***My Plan for Investing into Palantir:***\n\nMy plan for this investment is a little different from usual.\n\nI see anything between $24.87/share (Fair Value of P/B ratio) and $28.86/share (average comparable) as a good chance to buy Palantir at (or below) its fair value. This helps to limit our downside risk of this investment.\n\nHowever, I think the best way to play an investment in Palantir is over the long-run 3+ years. I would attempt to buy in at the above prices and hold for these 3+ years. During this time, I would re-evaluate my investment with every new financial report and piece of news to decide if it is still worth holding.\n\n***Potential Risks to Palantir\u2019s Stock - $PLTR:***\n\n\u00b7 **Dilution:** Over the past year Palantir has experienced a lot of dilution, however, we have already attributed a great deal of this dilution to their Direct Listing. However, the 20% of dilution that was not derived from the direct listing is still quite high. As investors, we should keep an eye on their future levels of dilution to recognize any patterns/increases that we should be weary of. If these levels of dilution persist, potential investors may be scares off and current investor might sell their positions, which will hurt the share price.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance:** This year\u2019s financial performance was not one to be overly happy about. Although they were able to increase some pretty important aspects of their balance sheet, Palantir was still yet to make a profit, and increased their net losses by over 100%. If this poor financial performance continues, and they keep digging themselves into a bigger and bigger hole, investors will run away from this stock and never look back. However, the Q1 financial performance gives investors hope for a more profitable future, which will be discussed later.\n\n\u00b7 **Bad Press:** Historically, Palantir has not been looked at through a positive lens by many people investors and non-investors alike. Their first public backlash came through their involvement in deporting immigrants through [Palantir\u2019s partnership with ICE](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54348456). Palantir quicky spoke out against this backlash by saying ICE took advantage of their software without proper oversight, and that they are looking into the issues, furthermore they have since declined some potential partnerships with other border agencies to avoid further backlash. There have also been numerous smaller controversies and protests that have damaged Palantir\u2019s reputation, and if there are more large controversies Palantir\u2019s stock could get hurt as a result of it.\n\n***Potential Catalysts that can Help Palantir\u2019s Stock Price:***\n\n\u00b7 **Share Buybacks:** Over the past year, Palantir has bought back (both directly and indirectly, in a sense) over 4,300,000 of their common shares. This is good to see as an investor, especially this early in the company (and not too long after their Direct Listing). This gives me hope that Palantir will continue to repurchase more shares in the future. This will be good for the share price as it will increase the value of existing shares, and it will be especially good for the stock price if they continue to buyback more shares each year.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance:** Palantir\u2019s 2020 financial report was not favourable (as discussed previously), however there were definitely some good to take out of it. Palantir increased their revenue, gross profit, and margins by a hefty amount, which is good to see as an investor, however, there was bad aspects of this report as well that made the report unfavourable. However, their newly released Q1 2021 financial report has so much more to offer in terms of good aspects of a financial report.\n\n\u00b7 **Positive Press:** As previously mentioned, Palantir has had their fair share of bad press that has had a small effect on their share price. However, recently Palantir has been getting better press through helping organizations like the NIH and NHS in their fight against COVID-19, and their vaccine distribution efforts. Partnerships like this help to display the positive impacts that can be derived from Palantir\u2019s technology. Future events where Palantir can use their software for a good cause can help to combat the negative stigma around Palantir and attract more people to invest in their company. This should help their share price in the short term after these articles are released.\n\n\u00b7 **Success Stories:** Since Palantir have gone public, they have had a few success stories come out, I mentioned some of these stories throughout the article. These success stories show how impactful Palantir\u2019s software can be and can show companies that they can increase revenues, production etc. just by using Palantir\u2019s software. Any future stories like this that come out, highlighting the benefits of Palantir can help the stock soar, and potential clients to reach out and start business/inquiries with Palantir.\n\n\u00b7 **Renewing Contracts:** I have mentioned that the renewal of contracts can help Palantir\u2019s share price a couple times throughout this article but why is this the case? This is because these companies that are renewing have already been through Palantir\u2019s 3 stage business model and have experienced their software firsthand for numerous years. After their time with Palantir\u2019s software expires they decide to renew the contract. This is good because it shows that Palantir\u2019s software was effective enough to their business in the time they had it that it is worth these $5-15M+ contract renewals. Furthermore, these companies that are renewing already have underwent Palantir\u2019s installation, and these clients will provide Palantir with the highest margins, which will reflect well on Palantir\u2019s future financial reports.\n\n\u00b7 **New Partnerships/Contracts (and the expansion of commercial enterprise segment):** Every time that Palantir, or its partners release news that they have entered into a contract/agreement, this will help Palantir\u2019s stock. This is because Palantir needs to keep expanding their software into new companies in order to meet their expected growth projections. Furthermore, as more commercial enterprises try Palantir\u2019s software (and hopefully enjoy it), the more willing other companies might be to give Palantir a shot. I see their biggest potential for growth and to become a large company in their expansion of their commercial enterprise segment through Foundry. Every time Palantir gets more new clients on board it is fantastic and shows the feasibility of this segment, and as more contracts role in, more enterprises will take an interest. Furthermore, when Palantir signs these enterprises to a contract, it will help to increase their revenues, which will show up on their financial reports and hopefully help the, to beat estimates.\n\n*This analysis took a long time, and is one of the most comprehensive that I have seen, so I would greatly appreciate if you followed me* [*here*](https://utradea.com/member-portfolio/BeatingTheVTI?utm_source=R&amp;utm_medium=B&amp;utm_campaign=PLTR)*, and commented on my original post!*",

        "selftext": "So I read this article by Angela Harmantas from Proactive Investors today and it made me question things. Here\u2019s a quote: \n\n&gt;**It has been said that the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated the remote economy, but is that really true?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Before the pandemic hit in 2020, around 5% of Americans worked out of the home, but by the spring of that year\u00a0that number had **skyrocketed to 60%.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Kalish estimates that the remote economy is a \u201c**multi-trillion-dollar global marketplace**\u201d that has room for multiple players, many of which are just starting out. \u201cIt may seem like this is a mature economy, but I believe we\u2019re on the ground floor of opportunities in this tech space.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cAdopting any kind of flexibility to function in a remote world is going to be the new normal,\u201d Kalish said. **\u201cYou can be a doctor without an office, or a professor without a lecture room.\u201d**\n\nThe article you can see here [Xigem Technologies sees multiple opportunities to help companies make the shift to the remote economy](https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/954785/xigem-technologies-sees-multiple-opportunities-to-help-companies-make-the-shift-to-the-remote-economy-954785.html)\n\nThe first question, I can\u2019t find a direct definition for the \"remote economy\". I'm somewhat new to it, I know gig economy, sharing economy, but not remote economy. **What is it?** \n\nI get the general idea, but my best description is \u201cyou know, all this sh#t that started in 2019\u201d. I know that it will most likely bring me gains, i FEEL what it is, but I don\u2019t want to invest in \u201call this sh#t\u201d. it would be hard to explain lol. Some better words are needed. \n\nThey don't give the definition, mention the options: \n\n**$XIGM Xigem** \\- the subject of the article, so hard to be unbiased here for them, I guess. I already bought 700 shares a week ago in case of a shot anyway, revenue is promised in Q3, but so far it\u2019s a high risk - high win. And most importantly - it\u2019s just one stock;  \n\n**$CRM SalesForce** \\- it\u2019s growing, it looks promising, I like it, but it costs damn $246,3 per share. It\u2019s not a penny; \n\n**$ORCL Oracle** \\- 44% in the last 6 months, real \u00abremote economy\u00bb stock, but not a penny, it\u2019s $87,5 for share. \n\nI\u2019m a good-ol\u2019 rebel, so I tried to come up with **other ideas**. My best guesses, NOTE - before the DD on each of them: \n\n**$XELA - Exela tech**, business solutions, transactions management, and all that stuff. The stock that actually made me do the 2+2 with Xigem article, because it shot 48% up today, and it\u2019s 236% up in the last 6 months. No idea why and I wish I noticed it before. Guess I\u2019m late here. \n\n**$PIXY - ShiftPixy**, looks good and fits in the article, especially in the \u00abprofessor without a classroom\u00bb part, just for anyone. Basically a remote gig economy stock. Cheapie as well: $2,14 for share. Falling, but don\u2019t know yet whether any catalysts will be in the nearest future. \n\nI\u2019ve had a good, professional and in-depth discussion with my imaginary friends this whole morning, and now I invite you to join. **The main question:** \n\nWhat exactly is Remote Economy and what companies should shoot up on this train? Any other companies position themselves as providers for this this multi-trillion-dollar thing like Xigem, or they\u2019re the first ones in it? Given that the whole remote thing is not going anywhere, how to make money on it? \n\nBonus question for those in $XELA or $PIXY - am I late?",

        "selftext": "\\*I am new to Chainlink and this is my initial research/understanding, if you can correct me, or help me to understand more about Chainlink, please do in the comments\\*\n\n***Summary:***\n\nChainlink (LINK-USD) is a decentralized network that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Chainlink provides off-chain data/information to the blockchain, making it on-chain data that can be used for smart contracts via their Decentralized Oracle Networks (DON\u2019s).\n\nChainlink has been able to revolutionize smart contracts through the integration of off-chain data. This is because the off-chain data allows for exponentially more use cases for these smart contracts, which may help us adopt crypto faster than previously thought.\n\nIn the future, Chainlink plans to improve upon their anonymity (where they can and where it makes sense) and implementing what they call \u201cmeta contracts\u201d.\n\nNote: There will be a list of definitions at the end of this article to help clarify some general and technical terms used throughout this analysis.\n\n***The History of Chainlink:***\n\nThe Chainlink protocol was created in 2017, they were able to do this through a $32M round of funding. Chainlink\u2019s main goal is to solve the Oracle problem so that the power of the blockchain can be unlocked and adapted quicker. Chainlink aims to do this through their DON\u2019s.\n\nThrough their network, Chainlink is able to provide Price feeds (useful for DeFi), verifiable randomness, proof of reserve, the Keeper network, and more.\n\nRecently, they have released Chainlink 2.0 whitepaper, which broadens the capabilities of their Decentralized Oracle Networks, provides tamper-proof data delivery, and secure off-chain computation. This update was made to make Chainlink even more scalable by providing more security, privacy, and authenticity.\n\nLastly, this update lowers Chainlink\u2019s gas (transaction) price of Oracle updates by 90%.\n\n***General Information:***\n\nChainlink is a fixed supply coin and has a supply cap of 1B coins (currently there is only 435.51M coins in supply).\n\nCurrently, Chainlink has a price of $19.05 (USD), and is actively traded, with their volume being approximately $1B traded in the last 24 hours.\n\nChainlink has a market cap of $8.38B, making it the current 15th largest cryptocurrency. Furthermore, their fully diluted market cap is $19.25B.\n\nChainlink\u2019s (1B) token supply is distributed as follows:\n\n\u00b7 **Company:** 300M of their tokens are reserved/allocated to their parent company (Smartcontract.com). This number fairly standard and it is good that this is not higher, because the higher this number, the more likely a rug pull, and less of a potential upside.\n\n\u00b7 **Community Holders:** 350M of their tokens are reserved for their holders, investors, and community. This number being so high is good for Chainlink because it gives them the potential to have big returns.\n\n\u00b7 **Node Operators:** The other 350M tokens are reserved for Chainlink\u2019s node operators. This is also good to see such a large allocation of tokens to them.\n\n***Chainlink\u2019s Decentralized Oracle Network (DON):***\n\nChainlink is able to bring real world data to the Chainlink network and blockchain, through their DON\u2019s. This is especially important when looking at the application of Chainlink\u2019s smart contracts because DON\u2019s were made specifically to enhance and extend the capabilities of these contracts. **By utilizing a DON, Chainlink is able to improve upon existing smart contracts because they can now be connected to the real world**.\n\nDON\u2019s offer networking, storage, and computation systems, while providing confidentiality, integrity, and accountability. These are offered through 2 functions of DON\u2019s, executables, and adopters.\n\n\u00b7 *Executables:* Programs that run continuously, and in a decentralized manner to improve performance and allows for confidential computation, which will be discussed in-depth later. Executables run and perform their operations on Chainlink\u2019s DON, working hand-in-hand with adapters to link external data.\n\n\u00b7 *Adapters:* Adapters (when working in DON\u2019s) can send and retrieve data from off-DON systems, operate bidirectionally, and leverage joint computation to achieve more features (ie. Encryption for privacy)\n\n**Adapters communicate information from web servers to executables, then communicate the information from the executable to the blockchain. This is how Chainlink is able to fetch their off-chain data for their DON\u2019s (which consist of the executable and storage).**\n\nAn example of how this works is given through Chainlink\u2019s founder (Seregey Nazarov) in a podcast with Lex Fridman, found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPXTmVdlyoc).\n\nNazarov described their DON and smart contract capabilities through an example of crop insurance. Where he went on to say they could use their smart contracts that run on Ethereum to make crop insurance contracts between a farmer in Bolivia and an insurance company in America, in which the farmer gets paid if it does not rain for let\u2019s say 14 days straight. Chainlink\u2019s smart contracts can collect external data from 5-7 different and trusted API\u2019s (could be weather stations, radars, local news channels etc.) to determine how long it has not rained for, and if the period of time that it has not rained is verified and 14 days (as stated in the hypothetical contract), the contract will be executed, and the farmer will be compensated. This is a game changer and allows people (like farmers in Bolivia) to hedge their risk, which would never have been available to them otherwise. And all of this runs on DON\u2019s, adapters, and executables on Chainlink\u2019s system.\n\n*This technology, combined with smart contracts, has never been seen before, and has enormous potential in terms of future use cases.*\n\n***Hybrid Smart Contracts:***\n\nChainlink refers to their \u201chybrid smart contracts\u201d as combining on-chain and off-chain components securely. These hybrid contracts are what differentiates Chainlink from the thousands of other cryptocurrencies out there.\n\nChainlink saw a problem in the way smart contracts were previously operated as they were very limited in their uses, slow to execute, and overall expensive. So Chainlink decided to go all in on improving on the use cases for these contracts through the adoption of off-chain components to the blockchain. One of the use cases that Chainlink solved can be seen in the Crop Insurance example above.\n\nChainlink has been able to adopt this off-chain information through their DON\u2019s, which enable them to offer these hybrid smart contracts. Chainlink still recognize that there is a long way to go to further improve on their technology and add new features like anonymity which they plan to address in the future.\n\nHybrid contracts are the first step involved in eventually reaching \u201cmeta contracts\u201d which Chainlink believes will revolutionize the way in which we use crypto. Bringing us closer being able to transform the current monetary system into a digital one.\n\n*Example:*\n\nThis kind of technology has various uses that can improve the efficiency for all parties involved. Once again, I will use an example from the Lex Fridman podcast with Sergey Nazarov, found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPXTmVdlyoc)\n\nIn this podcast Sergey pointed out that this confidentiality technology could be used in the data marketplace very effectively. This is because there is one party who is buying the data (person A); however this party does not know the quality of the data they are purchasing from the other party (person B). Based on this fact, person A does not want to pay for person B\u2019s data because they do not yet know the quality, and Person B does not want to send the data over to person A for a quality check because then they would be giving it away for free. However, Chainlink\u2019s smart contracts provide a solution to this problem because their smart contracts can work as an impartial agent, because of the fact that they can process off-chain data. This ensures that Person B gets paid and knows nothing about person A\u2019s data algorithm, Person A gets their data automatically placed in their algorithm to keep person A\u2019s data private.\n\nThis process would work like this:\n\n\u00b7 Person A provides their funds and states what data they are looking for\n\n\u00b7 Person B provides their data\n\no Chainlink assesses this data by taking random cross-sections of this data and internally assesses the quality and potential match based on Person A\u2019s criteria.\n\no Chainlink determines the fair price of the data for both parties.\n\n\u00b7 If both parties agree upon the price, then the contract is executed and the transaction is approved.\n\n***Confidentiality:***\n\nBlockchains by their nature are very transparent. However, many people value confidentiality and would like to see some sort of confidentiality on the blockchain where it makes sense. This inherent transparency clashes with peoples desires for confidentiality and needs to be addressed in a way that makes sense for the users and for the blockchains.\n\nChainlink has proposed some ways in which they can implement confidentiality in their system to accommodate the need for confidentiality. These proposals include a combination of the following:\n\n\u00b7 *Confidentiality-Preserving Adapters:* Two technologies (DECO and Town Crier) enable oracle nodes to retrieve data from off-chain systems in ways that protect user privacy and data confidentiality.\n\n\u00b7 *Confidential Computation:* DON\u2019s can conceal their computations from blockchains to a certain extent.\n\n\u00b7 *Supported Confidential Layer-2 Systems:* Many layer-2 systems use zero-knowledge proofs to provide various forms of transaction confidentiality.\n\nThis kind of confidentiality is very important to people and has many cases where it can be used effectively. Once again, I will use an example from the Lex Fridman podcast with Sergey Nazarov, found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPXTmVdlyoc)\n\nThe example that he gave was with health insurance companies in which he explained the following. Through Chainlink, you can have a smart contract that hold a person\u2019s data and evaluates the data of the user (ie. Age, sex, medical history, medical conditions etc.) without sharing it to the insurance company. However, the insurance company will know that the smart contract will be able to effectively evaluate the patient properly and give them a policy with a price that fits their information. This solves the confidentiality worry about providing this data over the internet/blockchain and is only one example of a potential use case in which having confidentiality does not have an impact on the outcome of a result.\n\n***Trust Minimization:***\n\nChainlink\u2019s goal is to create a trustworthy layer of support for smart contracts through decentralization and crypto economic guarantees. This is because users favour a trust model for smart contracts made possible through Chainlink\u2019s DON\u2019s. Chainlink is always working on ways to improve their trustworthiness and security, and already have the following measures in place to ensure this right now.\n\n\u00b7 *Data-Source Authentication:* Data provides sign their data to ensure it is correct which helps to strengthen the relationship between the contracts and the data.\n\n\u00b7 *DON Minority Reports:* Flags can be issued and examined when there is malfeasance in the DON.\n\n\u00b7 *Guard Rails:* Detects anomalous conditions and halts the execution of the contract if it is suspicious.\n\n\u00b7 *Trust-Minimized Governance:* Gradual-release updates facilitate inspection and intervention in the case of a system failure.\n\nFurthermore, there is incentives for people when they help to identify and solve cryptoeconomic security concerns.\n\n***Chainlink Staking:***\n\nStaking in Chainlink is very different from staking in other cryptocurrencies. Staking in Chainlink is aimed to ensure the timely delivery of correct oracle reports. Chainlink\u2019s approach to staking is as follows:\n\n1. *Adversarial Model:* Covers attacks that are overlooked, such as prospective bribery (bribing nodes)\n2. *Super-Linear Staking Impact:* An adversary must have a budget greater than the combined deposits in all of the oracle nodes (which is large due to staking in these nodes)\n3. *Implicit-Incentive Framework (IIF):* Chainlink\u2019s incentive model that stretches beyond explicit, deposited, staking funds.\n\n***Transaction Execution Framework (TEF):***\n\nA TEF is an approach to the efficient execution of a Smart Contract across a mainchain and a DON. A TEF can support any layer-2 execution techniques, allowing it to process smart contract transactions. The TEF allows Chainlink to do so confidentially, with lower fees, and with higher performance. The TEF can do this because of the following functions:\n\n\u00b7 *Transaction Ingestion:* Executes, receives, or fetches user transactions through DON\u2019s or the mainchain.\n\n\u00b7 *Fast Execution:* Processes transactions locally (on the DON)\n\n\u00b7 *Low-cost Oracle &amp; Adapter Access:* Reduced cost through off-chain oracle access (on-chain storage is expensive).\n\n\u00b7 *Syncing:* Periodically updates their smart contracts.\n\n***Node Reputation and Performance History:***\n\nChainlink documents the performance histories of their nodes on the chain. Users can reference the past operations/performances of these nodes to make informed decisions. This decentralized compilation of accurate performing histories allows both users and operators to build their reputations to distinguish themselves on Chainlink\u2019s network. Something like this can be very important in the future for insurance companies or any other companies adopt Chainlink\u2019s technology, this is because users will be able to see the satisfaction scores and previous performances of these companies before they decide to do business.\n\nAn example may be an insurance company. By having performance histories, users can see if other users have been satisfied with their services, how many claims that they have settled, how many claims have been neglected, and how many customers this company serves. This gives very important information to the user, as they decide which company, they want to do business with. Furthermore, this history makes companies to compete for the best satisfaction and successful claims rate, in order to beat out their competition.\n\n***Exciting News:***\n\nAugur is launching a new platform to capture the quickly growing sports betting market. This new platform is called \u201cAugur Turbo\u201d. Augur has decided to use a combination of Polygon Matic $MATIC and Chainlink $LINK in order to decentralize their sports betting, reduce their fees, and improve their services.\n\nAugur will use $MATIC to keep their fees low (due to their very low gas fees.\n\nAugur will use $LINK for their Oracles, allowing them to transfer up-to-the-second, real-world data to the blockchain to help their increase their speed of adjusting the odds, updating the stats/scores, and paying their bettors out after the conclusion of their match(es).\n\n*Source:*\n\n[Augur Adds Sports Betting With Launch of Polygon-Based 'Augur Turbo' - CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/augur-adds-sports-betting-with-launch-of-polygon-based-augur-turbo)\n\n***Key Definitions:***\n\n\u00b7 **Oracle:** An oracle sends data from off-chain sources (ie. Temperature information) to a blockchain, namely Ethereum, which then transforms it to on-chain data. This data is then used in applications like smart contracts.\n\n\u00b7 **Decentralized Oracle Networks (DON\u2019s):** DON\u2019s are formed by committees of oracle nodes that cooperate in order to fulfill a specific task to provide persistent services to clients. DON\u2019s are a powerful tool that helps developers create off-chain support for smart contracts.\n\n\u00b7 **Verifiable Randomness:** Several types of developer applications require a verifiably correct source of randomness to enable verification. An example of this is a PoolTogether, where a promotion promises to give 5 lucky winners $50 in $LINK. This randomness will select these winners and automatically pay them out (via smart contracts) ensuring that their contest is legitimate and truly random.\n\n\u00b7 **Off-Chain:** Transactions, and/or data that takes place in the real world and can be put into a blockchain via Chainlink.\n\n\u00b7 **On-Chain:** This consists of transaction and/or data that is registered/recorded on some blockchain technology.\n\n\u00b7 **Smart Contract:** A Smart contract is a self-executing contract with terms that must be met by both sides for the contract to be executed. These contracts are traceable but irreversible. An example of this would be the sending me an automatic release of $50 in $LINK on my birthday. This smart contract would have to know my birth date, however once it does, a smart contract will execute every year on my birthday sending me this money.\n\n\u00b7 **Fixed Supply:** This means that there is a limit to the amount of supply, and that more supply of a coin cannot be created.\n\n\u00b7 **Fully Diluted Market Cap:** This refers to the market cap of a coin, given their maximum supply at current prices.\n\n\u00b7 **Node:** A node is a computer that connects and supports a given cryptocurrency network. The computer works on validating and relaying transactions onto the blockchain.\n\n\u00b7 **Oracle Node:** A committee of nodes with the goal of supporting/working alongside existing blockchains, rather than providing its own separate functionality.\n\n\u00b7 **Proof of Reserve:** Chainlinks Proof of Reserve (PoR) is the solution for maintaining end-to-end transparency for any platform utilizing backed/wrapped assets.\n\n\u00b7 **Keeper Network:** The Keeper Network is a decentralized network for projects that need software development and IT operations (DevOps) and eternal teams to find keeper networks (jobs).\n\n\u00b7 **Node Operators:** Chainlinks node operators are the backbone of their network. These operators participate in DON\u2019s, allowing engineers to fetch external data securely/reliably via API\u2019s. These operators are crucial for smart contracts and the real world data they need to use to run properly.\n\n\u00b7 **API\u2019s (Application Programming Interface):** API\u2019s provide real time data, by letting one software application to interact with another. Chainlink uses API\u2019s to take real-time, and real-world data and transfer the into the blockchain through their DON\u2019s.\n\n\u00b7 **Staking:** Actively participating in validating transactions, anyone who meets the minimum staking (balance) requirements can participate and earn rewards. Staking locks up your holdings and earns interest.\n\nIf you appreciate this research and want to see more research on other crypto's in the future, follow me [here](https://utradea.com/member-portfolio/CryptoCranium)",

THE MARKET CAP DISPLAYED IS THE SPACS MARKET CAP WHICH IS NO LONGER RELEVANT AND INCORRECT. *****\n\nRead first, thank me later. **AvePoint (ticker: AVPT), the Largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider was just listed publicly on Nasdaq last week.**\n\n**// About AvePoint**\n\nAvePoint is the largest data management solutions provider for the Microsoft cloud, with over 1,300 employees in 29 global offices. Key takeaway:\n\n* AvePoint was founded in 2001 as a company to help ease the complexity of SharePoint installations, which at the time were all on-premise. Today, it has adapted to the shift to the cloud as a SaaS tool and primarily acts as a policy layer enabling companies to make sure employees are using these tools in a compliant way\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dz089c2qxs971.png?width=2336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e3fe9e8a12840a67f2503570910b255758bc53f\n\nCompany's Footprint\n\n* Huge diversified blue-chip client base, \\~7 million members (as of Sep 30, 2020) with 16k accounts and 25% of Fortune 500 using the company\u2019s services. 7M users represent 3% or 250M Microsoft 365 client base with an estimated addressable market of $33 billion by 2022 (according to IDC). The Company sells directly to large and mid-market enterprises, and its solutions are also available to managed services providers on more than 100 cloud marketplaces globally. Regarding Microsoft, the company \u201cBridges the Gap Between What Microsoft Cloud Offers and What the Enterprise Requires\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qslefg2rxs971.png?width=1876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2147d70bf7dcc0029eb0bcdbad6ad605c8f2b15f\n\nBlue-Chip Client Base\n\n* Compared to other recent SPAC deals and business combinations we just saw, AvePoint has indeed a great track record. Expected 2020 revenues @ USD 148M, a + 26% YoY increase (78% recurring revenues). There are 212 public software companies and AvePoint is one of 5 that is growing at a rate of more than 25% revenue while maintaining a 14% EBIT margin and 30% ARR growth. The company is projecting significant growth for the next two years with revenue estimates of $257 million and ARR of $220 million by the end of 2022\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uar3z93sxs971.png?width=2676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7bada89e321ec83b63a02159e86304d0f824eee\n\nStrong Financials\n\n* Great market trends.

Target PPS: $100 (-54%), in 6 - 12 months\n\n&amp;#8203;\n\n    Product \n\nInvoicing and payment processes can be messy and physical documents are prone to human error, which can lead to incorrect or delayed payments. This is where Bill.com comes into the picture. Its platform automatically fills out invoices or recognizes information on incoming invoices, including supplier details and payment amounts, reducing the time for data entry and the likelihood of manual errors.\n\nThe platform offers automated field entries, bill approval and payment. Then, it is synced with the accounting software such as QuickBooks for reconciliation of accounting entries and bookkeeping. The integration between Bill.com and the accounting software eliminates double entry and human errors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8935sq7kpc971.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=478cf108c612f0e3a11537bceaceca021fc1a693\n\nIts payment tools enable remote approval and automated payments to suppliers via ACH, wire transfers or PayPal. The company\u2019s bill payment feature enables customers to make electronic payments to suppliers outside the US and, compared to banks, the company\u2019s transaction fees are more competitive. For example, banks usually charge an average of $38 as wire transfers fee whereas Bill.com charges almost 4 times less with its International Payments solution, providing costs savings to its customers. According to the company, it offers payments options to over 130 countries with a supplier network of over 2.5 million.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2afv204lpc971.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de1287971b64ee952f288b9ba858a407dee2787f\n\n    Revenue Model \n\nThe company earns revenues through **subscription** and **transaction fees** as well as **interest** on transactions held.\n\nIn the last quarter, which ended in March 2021, 49% of total revenues were recurring based on per user pricing for use of the platform as a fixed monthly or annual payment. Another 49% was transaction revenue, which represents usage-based fees collected for each transaction processed through the platform. The remaining 2% are float revenue, which is interest earned from customer funds while payment transactions are clearing.\n\nWhile 49% recurring revenue is very low compared to other SaaS businesses, it is fair to say that the other 49% transaction revenue are for the most part \u201crecurring in nature\u201d: A customer who only has access to the platform but does not have any transactions (let\u2019s say a payment of accounts payables), will not pay transaction fees. But customers have a certain number of transactions each month for which they will pay. The number of these may fluctuate to some degree, but for the most part, they can be seen as recurring.\n\n    Market Size \n\nIn 2018, there were approximately 30 million SMBs in the US. While 24 million of these SMBs are sole-proprietors, the company focuses on serving the over 6 million employer firms, because SMBs large enough to have employees tend to have a greater need for more advanced accounts payable and accounts receivable processes in their back offices.\n\nBy multiplying the average revenue per customer of $1,500 by the 6 million domestic employer firms and 20 million (sufficiently large) SMBs globally, the total annual addressable market for the company can be estimated at **$9 billion domestically** and **$30 billion worldwide**.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ss84shvlpc971.png?width=511&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c2afb1c0a258ea700a0f2a3f81c0ab66f8fa40a\n\n    Go-To-Market \n\nBill.com acquires customers **directly** through digital marketing and inside sales, and **indirectly** through accounting firms and strategic partners including accounting software companies and financial institutions.\n\nIts partner base includes over 80 of the top 100 accounting firms in the US and several of the largest financial institutions, including **Bank of America, JPMorgan and American Express**. Bill.com\u2019s platform can be integrated with many of the major accounting software providers including companies such as **QuickBooks Online, Xero, Sage Intacct and Oracle NetSuite**, who dominate the accounting software market.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o185frxmpc971.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd6508266264d04174de9d56ee2f298f73b3dfb9\n\nBill.com\u2019s integration with major accounting software and partnerships with financial institutions provides the company with an avenue to expand its market reach. However, the accounting software vendors could quickly turn from partners into competitors if they decide to provide similar services. Also, there is nothing stopping the partnered banks from collaborating with competitors in the future. On the contrary, it would be in the bank\u2019s and accounting firms\u2019 interests to work with several providers besides Bill.com.\n\n**To summarize,** the company\u2019s partnerships and integrations are valuable assets in its go-to-market approach. However, they are not a competitive moat.\n\n    Competition \n\nA range of other companies are offering good competing solutions. Differentiation can come from the breadth of the product offering or integrations with complementary systems like accounting, banking or ERP software.\n\nWith a user friendly and mature product, the company was well positioned to benefit from the move to digital that accelerated in 2020 and H1-2021 due to the pandemic. But while the company has an early-mover network advantage with various leading financial accounting software providers, financial institutions and accounting firms, competitive pressures are certain to increase in the future as various challenger companies are emerging and players from adjacent markets enter the competition to get a piece of the cake.\n\nFor example, payables automation solution provider **Tipalti**, who is valued at $2 billion. The company has stronger focus on enterprise customers and already counts player like Twitter, Twitch, Roblox, Roku, National Geographic, Business Insider and many other names to its customer base.\n\nAdditionally, cloud-based business spending management platform **Coupa** (COUP) has a TEV of $20 billion and is expected to generate ca. $540 million in revenue this year. Coupa provides companies control and visibility into how they spend money but also offers invoice automation and billing services similar to Bill.com\u2019s.\n\n    Divvy M&amp;A \n\nIn early June, Bill.com announced that it is going to acquired Divvy, a corporate spend management \u201cstartup\u201d. The total purchase price of around $2.5 billion is substantially above the company\u2019s roughly $1.6 billion post-money valuation that Divvy set in its January 2021 financing round. $625 million will be paid in cash, the remainder in shares.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8km8tvrnpc971.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0cbc696d6ee515f192146887d4c31d0a66583fd\n\n**Divvy by the numbers:**\n\n* $100 million annualized revenue\n* \\&gt;100% revenue growth YoY\n* $4 billion annualized total payment volume (TPV)\n\nSo Divvy sold for around 25x its current revenue-run-rate and the growth rate tells us that the company did not sell due to performance weakness.\n\n**Strategic rationale for the acquisition**: Bill.com extends its platform with Divvy\u2019s complementary spend management capabilities and therefore expands its overall market opportunity by serving a larger share of the customer\u2019s spend. Additionally, buying a company with an attractive financial profile and high growth will drive Bill.com\u2019s own growth.\n\nDivvy seems to be a suitable acquisition target that will strengthen Bill.com strategically and financially. The company will be able to provide a more wholistic offering to its customers and capture a larger share of their wallet. As the company expands its market, competition will increase from incumbents like Brex, Ramp, Airbase, Coupa, Expensify and Spendesk.\n\n    Financials \n\nIn the [last available quarter](https://s24.q4cdn.com/404137088/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/BILL-IR-DECK-Q3'21-Final.pdf) (ending March 2021),\n\n* total revenue was $60 million, up 45% YoY,\n* gross margin was 74%, vs 76% in the same quarter previous year (PY),\n* free cash flow was ($6.2) million, vs ($2.1) million PY,\n* implying a FCF margin of (10%), vs (5%) PY,\n* its rule of 40 value was 34%,\n* its dollar based net retention rate was 121%, and\n* its CAC payback period was 10 months\n\nLet\u2019s compare that with the average cloud software company in the SaaS index:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1iv78tlopc971.png?width=847&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b155a4b9a6381fbe86275c0dde55594d8d25c9ee\n\n* **Growth:** Bill.com is growing quite a bit faster than the average. This is important because growth is what investors pay the highest price for\n* **Gross margin:** Pretty much on par with the market\n* **FCF margin:** The free cash flow is notably lower than that of most other SaaS companies, as Bill.com is still burning cash to drive growth\n* **Rule of 40:** As a result of the negative profitability, its rule of 40 value is below average. Nevertheless, 34% is a decent value\n* **Net retention:** With 121%, the company is a little above average and shows a healthy ability of retaining and growing existing customers\n* **CAC Payback period:** The relatively low value of 10 months is good for the company and is likely a bi-product from the market moving from manual to digital, which means that the company is winning customers even without massively increasing sales and marketing spending\n* **Cash:** As of March 2021, Bill.com has almost $800 million in net cash on the balance sheet. $625 million of that will be used to pay for the acquisition of Divvy, leaving $175 million in net cash\n\n**In summary,** financials are very good driven by a strong tailwind from the market bringing customers to its doorstep. At the moment, the company seems to focus on keeping growth as high as possible at the expense of profitability. This is the smart thing to do in order to capture market share in a time when every SMB is looking for an automated bookkeeping solution. With $175 million in available net cash and a quarterly cash burn of $6.2 million, Bill.com has sufficient runway left. Nevertheless, the company will soon need to show investors the ability to turn profitable while maintaining a high growth rate.\n\n    Valuation \n\nAs of Friday\u2019s close, Bill.com has a total enterprise value of **$16.4 billion**. Based on estimated NTM revenues of $279 million (including the quarter that ended this week), this represents an astronomic TEV / NTM revenue multiple of **59x.**\n\nThe charts below show an index of cloud software companies, mapping their performance metrics (e.g. growth) against their valuation (TEV/NTM revenue multiple). You can see clear correlations. Think of it as\n\n&gt;**\u201cFor a company with x% of expected revenue growth, the market usually pays a valuation (multiple) of y\u201d.**\n\nPlus / minus some variation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nq5q7knppc971.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58f7c46ff09d63841e5b34303fcc6b9aaba9a153\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rnq5a8dqpc971.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=232cbb8b459ee530452d16645dfdc32e18f176bf\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4nu4bfrpc971.png?width=1111&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b959d9fb139c6135a0ca1de15298f7fc141c2de\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/su5jtegspc971.png?width=1110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ea09b404999e49a2fd28427bfd30298d4b32a75\n\nBill.com is a strong outlier on each of these charts. What does that tell us:\n\n* **Growth:** The market generally pays higher valuations for companies with higher growth. However, there are several companies growing as fast as Bill.com or even faster, which trade at lower valuations.\n* **Net retention:** The market generally pays higher valuations for companies with higher net retention rates. However, there are several companies with net retention rates as good or even better than that of Bill.com, but which trade at lower valuations.\n* \u2026\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nThe company\u2019s performance metrics are strong, there\u2019s no question about that. But there are numerous examples of companies with similar or better performance metrics which trade at cheaper prices.\n\n**In summary,** based on Bill.com\u2019s KPIs and the valuations that investors pay for such performance, the company should trade at a lower price.\n\n    Conclusion \n\nBill.com\u2019s bookkeeping automation software provides convenience, improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness to a broad customers base. The market it operates in has a significant size and is in the middle of a momentum from manual to digital &amp; automated. With top tier channel partners and a range of accounting and banking integrations, the company is well positioned to capture and capitalize on the increasing demand.\n\nThe acquisition of Divvy will add complementary features to its current product offering and strengthen stickiness with customers. Yet the possibilities for differentiation through technology are limited and competition will increase significantly in the medium term through both new challengers and adjacent incumbents.\n\nSoft factors and hard factors look positive and, per se, I am bullish about the company and the direction in which it is going. Nevertheless, Bill.com\u2019s valuation is too high. Companies with similar profiles are trading at **20x - 25x NTM revenue**. This means that Bill.com has a more than **100% premium valuation** to the market standard. Is this justified by a superior product offering, exclusive partnership agreements or a brand name? It doesn\u2019t seem this way.\n\n**How to play this**\n\n* **Long:** What needs to happen for the price to go up further?  \n\n   * The company must continue to execute and grow as expected by the market\n   * The macro environment (interest rates etc.) must keep stable\n   * The valuation multiple must stay at a premium of 100% over comps\n* **Short:** What could happen for the price to go down?  \n\n   * Commoditization of bookkeeping automation software which leads to price competition, lower revenue per customer and decreasing growth\n   * Rising inflation causes earlier interest rate increases, which usually hits high-growth software companies the hardest\n   * Contraction of Bill.com\u2019s valuation multiple towards market standards\n   * Major post-merger integration difficulties\n\nIt seems most likely that the company will continue to perform well, but that its valuation multiple will contract to a more market standard level, leading to a decline in share price.\n\nHowever, we cannot say exactly when this will happen and it is of course possible that the share price will continue to increase over the next few weeks. The target share price based on fundamentals is \\~$100, representing a 54% downside, which is realistically achievable over the next 6 - 12 months.\n\nFrom a portfolio-management perspective, adding a short position in an overvalued company can decrease the overall risk of the portfolio: In volatile times, gains in your short positions can (partially) offset losses in your long positions.",

Bill.com\u2019s platform can be integrated with many of the major accounting software providers including companies such as **QuickBooks Online, Xero, Sage Intacct and Oracle NetSuite**, who dominate the accounting software market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2mngq1kro6971.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ec0c3351e1711f983e90a735c6b2dcedd8cbdc8\n\nBill.com\u2019s integration with major accounting software and partnerships with financial institutions provides the company with an avenue to expand its market reach. However, the accounting software vendors could quickly turn from partners into  competitors if they decide to provide similar services. Also, there is nothing stopping the partnered banks from collaborating with competitors in the future. On the contrary, it would be in the bank\u2019s and accounting firms\u2019 interests to work with several providers besides Bill.com.\n\n**To summarize,** the company\u2019s partnerships and integrations are valuable assets in its go-to-market approach. However, they are not a competitive moat.\n\n    Competition\n\nA range of other companies are offering good competing solutions. Differentiation can come from the breadth of the product offering or integrations with complementary systems like accounting, banking or ERP software.\n\nWith a user friendly and mature product, the company was well positioned to benefit from the move to digital that accelerated in 2020 and H1-2021 due to the pandemic. But while the company has an early-mover network advantage with various leading financial accounting software providers, financial institutions and accounting firms, competitive pressures are certain to increase in the future as various challenger companies are emerging and players from adjacent markets enter the competition to get a piece of the cake.\n\nFor example, payables automation solution provider **Tipalti**, who is valued at $2 billion. The company has stronger focus on enterprise customers and already counts player like Twitter, Twitch, Roblox, Roku, National Geographic, Business Insider and many other names to its customer base.\n\nAdditionally, cloud-based business spending management platform **Coupa** (COUP) has a TEV of $20 billion and is expected to generate ca. $540 million in revenue this year. Coupa provides companies control and visibility into how they spend money but also offers invoice automation and billing services similar to Bill.com\u2019s.\n\n    Divvy M&amp;A\n\nIn early June, Bill.com announced that it is going to acquired Divvy, a corporate spend management \u201cstartup\u201d. The total purchase price of around $2.5 billion is substantially above the company\u2019s roughly $1.6 billion post-money valuation that Divvy set in its January 2021 financing round. $625 million will be paid in cash, the remainder in shares.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/plhkwgmvo6971.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b98691049600f9944ca9cdfe880b58363ffa919d\n\n**Divvy by the numbers:**\n\n* $100 million annualized revenue\n* \\&gt;100% revenue growth YoY\n* $4 billion annualized total payment volume (TPV)\n\nSo Divvy sold for around 25x its current revenue-run-rate and the growth rate tells us that the company did not sell due to performance weakness.\n\n**Strategic rationale for the acquisition**: Bill.com extends its platform with Divvy\u2019s complementary spend management capabilities and therefore expands its overall market opportunity by serving a larger share of the customer\u2019s spend. Additionally, buying a company with an attractive financial profile and high growth will drive Bill.com\u2019s own growth.\n\nDivvy seems to be a suitable acquisition target that will strengthen Bill.com strategically and financially. The company will be able to provide a more wholistic offering to its customers and capture a larger share of their wallet. As the company expands its market, competition will increase from incumbents like Brex, Ramp, Airbase, Coupa, Expensify and Spendesk. \n\n    Financials\n\nIn the [last available quarter](https://s24.q4cdn.com/404137088/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/BILL-IR-DECK-Q3'21-Final.pdf) (ending March 2021), \n\n* total revenue was $60 million, up 45% YoY,\n* gross margin was 74%, vs 76% in the same quarter previous year (PY),\n* free cash flow was ($6.2) million, vs ($2.1) million PY,\n* implying a FCF margin of (10%), vs (5%) PY,\n* its rule of 40 value was 34%,\n* its dollar based net retention rate was 121%, and\n* its CAC payback period was 10 months\n\nLet\u2019s compare that with the average cloud software company in the SaaS index:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fnqk1b4zo6971.png?width=847&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3749022f6924fa4d21c14ffeb3952ebd59b47772\n\n* **Growth:** Bill.com is growing quite a bit faster than the average. This is important because growth is what investors pay the highest price for\n* **Gross margin:** Pretty much on par with the market\n* **FCF margin:** The free cash flow is notably lower than that of most other SaaS companies, as Bill.com is still burning cash to drive growth\n* **Rule of 40:** As a result of the negative profitability, its rule of 40 value is below average. Nevertheless, 34% is a decent value\n* **Net retention:** With 121%, the company is a little above average and shows a healthy ability of retaining and growing existing customers\n* **CAC Payback period:** The relatively low value of 10 months is good for the company and is likely a bi-product from the market moving from manual to digital, which means that the company is winning customers even without massively increasing sales and marketing spending\n* **Cash:** As of March 2021, Bill.com has almost $800 million in net cash on the balance sheet. $625 million of that will be used to pay for the acquisition of Divvy, leaving $175 million in net cash\n\n**In summary,** financials are very good driven by a strong tailwind from the market bringing customers to its doorstep. At the moment, the company seems to focus on keeping growth as high as possible at the expense of profitability. This is the smart thing to do in order to capture market share in a time when every SMB is looking for an automated bookkeeping solution. With $175 million in available net cash and a quarterly cash burn of $6.2 million, Bill.com has sufficient runway left. Nevertheless, the company will soon need to show investors the ability to turn profitable while maintaining a high growth rate.\n\n    Valuation\n\nAs of Friday\u2019s close, Bill.com has a total enterprise value of **$16.4 billion**. Based on estimated NTM revenues of $279 million (including the quarter that ended this week), this represents an astronomic TEV / NTM revenue multiple of **59x.**\n\nThe charts below show an index of cloud software companies, mapping their performance metrics (e.g. growth) against their valuation (TEV/NTM revenue multiple). You can see clear correlations. Think of it as \n\n&gt;**\u201cFor a company with x% of expected revenue growth, the market usually pays a valuation (multiple) of y\u201d.**\n\nPlus / minus some variation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxanaow3p6971.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2deaa46b9aab2670fde6a252106c072ef7a0099\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9q10jph4p6971.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04aca47233cf88f485b371d61a3926dda21f7a48\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jze3qu25p6971.png?width=1111&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee4e4ea334114efbd80e6ec432df1808f9b5991b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lydm9pt5p6971.png?width=1110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04911cefd4e09da2cdb4c8bb9be9aa5752f04464\n\nBill.com is a strong outlier on each of these charts. What does that tell us: \n\n* **Growth:** The market generally pays higher valuations for companies with higher growth. However, there are several companies growing as fast as Bill.com or even faster, which trade at lower valuations.\n* **Net retention:** The market generally pays higher valuations for companies with higher net retention rates. However, there are several companies with net retention rates as good or even better than that of Bill.com, but which trade at lower valuations.\n* \u2026\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nThe company\u2019s performance metrics are strong, there\u2019s no question about that. But there are numerous examples of companies with similar or better performance metrics which trade at cheaper prices.\n\n**In summary,** based on Bill.com\u2019s KPIs and the valuations that investors pay for such performance, the company should trade at a lower price.\n\n    Conclusion\n\nBill.com\u2019s bookkeeping automation software provides convenience, improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness to a broad customers base. The market it operates in has a significant size and is in the middle of a momentum from manual to digital &amp; automated. With top tier channel partners and a range of accounting and banking integrations, the company is well positioned to capture and capitalize on the increasing demand. \n\nThe acquisition of Divvy will add complementary features to its current product offering and strengthen stickiness with customers. Yet the possibilities for differentiation through technology are limited and competition will increase significantly in the medium term through both new challengers and adjacent incumbents.\n\nSoft factors and hard factors look positive and, per se, I am bullish about the company and the direction in which it is going. Nevertheless, Bill.com\u2019s valuation is too high. Companies with similar profiles are trading at **20x - 25x NTM revenue**. This means that Bill.com has a more than **100% premium valuation** to the market standard. Is this justified by a superior product offering, exclusive partnership agreements or a brand name? It doesn\u2019t seem this way.\n\n**How to play this**\n\n* **Long:** What needs to happen for the price to go up further?   \n\n   * The company must continue to execute and grow as expected by the market\n   * The macro environment (interest rates etc.) must keep stable\n   * The valuation multiple must stay at a premium of 100% over comps\n* **Short:** What could happen for the price to go down?  \n\n   * Commoditization of bookkeeping automation software which leads to price competition, lower revenue per customer and decreasing growth\n   * Rising inflation causes earlier interest rate increases, which usually hits high-growth software companies the hardest\n   * Contraction of Bill.com\u2019s valuation multiple towards market standards\n   * Major post-merger integration difficulties\n\nIt seems most likely that the company will continue to perform well, but that its valuation multiple will contract to a more market standard level, leading to a decline in share price. \n\nHowever, we cannot say exactly when this will happen and it is of course possible that the share price will continue to increase over the next few weeks. The target share price based on fundamentals is \\~$100, representing a 54% downside, which is realistically achievable over the next 6 - 12 months.\n\nFrom a portfolio-management perspective, adding a short position in an overvalued company can decrease the overall risk of the portfolio: In volatile times, gains in your short positions can (partially) offset losses in your long positions.",

But it's not the end for Microsoft's connected defense ambitions.\n\nThe initiative was expected to drag the DoD\u2019s computing platforms into the 21st century by consolidating them into a single entity. The idea was to ensure everyone from DoD employees in the U.S. to soldiers on the frontline could access and manipulate data and support innovations in artificial intelligence at the speed of modern enterprises.\n\nMicrosoft initially won the contract in 2019, giving its cloud platform, the second largest in the world, a massive win over market leader Amazon. But the deal was fraught with issues including accusations of interference by then-President Donald Trump \u2014 who expresses disdain for Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN?p=AMZN&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 and worries about a single company controlling the government\u2019s entire cloud platform.\n\nIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom for Microsoft, though. The company now has the option to bid on JEDI\u2019s replacement, the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability initiative, a multi-cloud project that could see Microsoft and Amazon win the contract together.\n\n**A potential win for both Microsoft and Amazon**\n\nIn a statement announcing the end of JEDI, the DoD more or less lays out that Microsoft and Amazon are still its top contenders for the JWCC contract.\n\n\u201cThe Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability (JWCC) will be a multi-cloud/multi-vendor Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cThe Department intends to seek proposals from a limited number of sources, namely the Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) and Amazon Web Services (AWS), as available market research indicates that these two vendors are the only Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) capable of meeting the Department\u2019s requirements.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the initiative\u2019s contract is listed for an indefinite delivery and indefinite quantity means that it could stretch beyond the $10 billion of JEDI, which would benefit the two tech giants.\n\nSo while Microsoft would certainly like to know it\u2019s got a $10 billion contract with the DoD under its belt, the knowledge that it\u2019s almost guaranteed to at least share the JWCC contract with Amazon should offer some relief.\n\n**Project JEDI has been controversial for years**\n\nProject JEDI was plagued with controversy since it was announced in 2018 \u2014 with cybersecurity experts like NYU Tandon School of Engineering professor Justin Cappos pointing to the dangers of the DoD relying on a single cloud vendor, a relative rarity even in the enterprise space.\n\nThe reason using a single vendor is so controversial? It\u2019s simply safer to use multiple cloud vendors. Think of it this way: If a single cloud vendor is hit with a cyberattack and can\u2019t provide the services the DoD needs, the Pentagon is out of luck. But its operations can continue if it can rely on a backup provider.\n\nIn fact, Microsoft\u2019s then general manager of national security Leigh Madden said as much during a [2018 interview with TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/23/dod-clarifies-winner-take-all-cloud-contract/), telling the publication, \u201cit\u2019s counter to what we are seeing across the globe where 80% of customers are adopting a multi-cloud solution.\u201d\n\n**Microsoft didn\u2019t even start work on the project**\n\nThe DoD released its final request for proposal (RFP) for JEDI in July 2018, after receiving 1,500 comments and questions on previous RFPs.\n\nWhile Amazon was considered a shoo-in for the project because of its massive cloud business, it was not Microsoft\u2019s only competition. Oracle ([ORCL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ORCL?p=ORCL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) and IBM ([IBM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IBM?p=IBM&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), which are also players in the cloud market, were among a number of firms vying for JEDI's $10 billion contract.\n\nIn the end, though, Amazon and Microsoft, which have a slew of data centers stationed throughout the world, and a history of working with the [government, came in as the two finalists](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/technology/amazon-microsoft-jedi-pentagon.html), the Pentagon said in April.\n\nWhen Microsoft won the contract in 2019, Amazon filed suit alleging the Trump administration interfered with the award process. The thinking from Amazon was that Trump had a bone to pick with then-Amazon CEO Bezos, who owns the Washington Post \u2014 a paper that had scrutinized the Trump administration.\n\nAn investigation by the [DoD\u2019s Inspector General](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Apr/15/2002281438/-1/-1/1/REPORT%20ON%20THE%20JOINT%20ENTERPRISE%20DEFENSE%20INFRASTRUCTURE%20(JEDI)%20CLOUD%20PROCUREMENT%20DODIG-2020-079.PDF), however, found the Trump administration had not interfered with the process. Still, Amazon sought to fight the award to Microsoft, and won a restraining order blocking the Windows maker from beginning work on the project.\n\nAmazon\u2019s legal fight picked up steam in April when [Amazon beat out a motion to dismiss its case](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409245/amazon-microsoft-jedi-contract-reject-motion-dismiss-trump-influence). That left the JEDI\u2019s existence up in the air, raising questions about whether the DoD would continue to slog through court fight after court fight to maintain the project.\n\n\"We understand and agree with the DoD\u2019s decision,\" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, the contract award was not based on the merits of the proposals and instead was the result of outside influence that has no place in government procurement.\"",

        "selftext": "SAN FRANCISCO,\u00a0March 17, 2021 --\u00a0Coalition, the leading cyber insurance and security company, today announced it has raised\u00a0$175 million\u00a0to accelerate its rapid growth and global expansion. Index Ventures led the funding with participation from General Atlantic and the company's existing investors, valuing Coalition at\u00a0$1.75 billion.\n\nCoalition has raised\u00a0$300 million\u00a0in equity funding from leading global technology investors, including Index Ventures, General Atlantic, Ribbit Capital, Vy Capital, Hillhouse Capital, and Valor Equity Partners, among others. Founded in 2017 by\u00a0Joshua Motta\u00a0and\u00a0John Hering, Coalition is one of the largest cyber insurance and security providers in\u00a0the United States\u00a0and\u00a0Canada. Today, Coalition serves over 42,000 customers, providing no-cost cybersecurity tools to prevent losses, security and incident response services to contain them, and comprehensive insurance to help organizations recover from failures and breaches. The investment follows long-term capacity commitments from leading global insurers\u00a0Swiss Re\u00a0and\u00a0Arch Insurance.\n\n**Company profile**\n\n**The basic information**\n\nDate of establishment: March 2017 \n\nLocation: Headquartered in San Francisco, the company has offices in New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C.\n\n**The company size**\n\nValuation: The Series C round valued the company at $890 million\n\nNumber of customers: More than 25,000 customers when the Series C financing was completed\n\nRevenue: Estimated 2019 revenue of $27 million\n\n**Founded background**\n\nCoalition, an online insurance company co-founded by Joshua Motta and John Hering, two cyber-security experts.\u00a0They also hired Catherine Lyle, head of network claims at Swiss Re, and Shawn Ram, head of Crystal's technology and network business. Coalition combines comprehensive insurance and cyber security tools to help enterprises manage and mitigate cyber risks.\n\nAccording to Joshua Motta, we live in an age where the Internet has changed everything. Problems caused by technical glitches or cyber attacks include disinformation, election rigging, hospital closures and even widespread power outages. And when that happens, how we protect ourselves becomes a problem.\n\nIn fact, while enjoying the convenience brought by technological development, major insurance enterprises are also faced with a variety of network risks such as data leakage and ransomware attacks. Oracle spokesperson Deborah Hellinger has confirmed that BlueKai, the technology giant's data management platform, has leaked the records of billions of people around the world because its servers were not encrypted. In addition, Facebook, Yahoo and other giants in various fields have been suffered a huge blow due to the data leak, and they were\u00a0faced with\u00a0class action lawsuits and huge fines. According to a 2019 study by IBM on the costs of data breaches, the average cost to victims of a data breach is $3.92 million. Therefore, for the majority of small and medium-sized enterprises, data leakage and other network security problems will be devastating.\n\nThe emergence and development of this risk have made the insurance industry see the importance of network security insurance. Motta, one of the founders of Coalition, pointed out that working in Coalition can provide a guarantee for those enterprises that are not large in scale and cannot afford comprehensive security technology.\n\n**Finance course**\n\nCoalition raised $10 million in Series A round in 2018, Its investors include VY Capital, Ribbit Capital, Valor Equity Partners, Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator, and Deep Nishar,\u00a0senior managing director of the SoftBank Vision Fund.\n\nIn 2019, Coalition closed a $40 million Series B funding round. The round was led by Ribbit Capital, with Greenoaks Capital and Hillhouse Capital also participating.\n\nIn May\u00a02020, Coalition raised $90 million in Series C funding round led by Valor Equity Partners, along with Felicis Ventures, Greyhound Capital, and existing investors including\u00a0Vy Capital, Ribbit Capital, Hillhouse Capital and Greenoaks Capital. \n\nOn March 17, 2021, [Coalition](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3099544-1&amp;h=4237564897&amp;u=https://www.coalitioninc.com/&amp;a=Coalition) announced it has raised\u00a0$175 million\u00a0to accelerate its rapid growth and global expansion. Index Ventures led the funding with participation from General Atlantic and the company's existing investors, valuing Coalition at\u00a0$1.75 billion.\n\n**Business model**\n\nAs for the mission of Coalition, Motta defines it as solving cyber risks. To achieve this goal, Coalition combines free cybersecurity tools and services to enable businesses to manage and mitigate cyber risk.\n\n**Product: comprehensive and fast**\n\nCompared with the traditional network security insurance, Coalition lays more emphasis on the protection of network security for enterprises. Joshua Motta mentioned that network security is not a technical problem, but a risk management problem. Traditional network security technologies, such as firewalls, protect the network rather than the enterprise. So instead of providing any hardware or software, Coalition protects the entire enterprise by offering cybersecurity and incident response services and comprehensive insurance up to $15 million.\n\nThe word \"comprehensive\" can be fully reflected in the first network insurance product launched by Coalition. The product will compensate companies for direct financial losses caused by fraud in the use of business services, including SaaS, IaaS, NAAS, and telephone services. It avoids the three risks of unauthorized access and fraudulent use of an organization's business services, long-distance telephone fraud, and encryption and password hijacking.\n\nAs for adding new content to an already comprehensive insurance offering, Joshua Motta says, \"Cyber attacks are no longer just about data breaches and the theft of large amounts of data. They have expanded to the theft of an organization's IT services and infrastructure for criminal proceeds and password theft. The resulting costs may be there for an organization, but they are not included in most insurance policies today.\"\n\nFor enterprises, in addition to getting protection for the specific risks they are facing,\u00a0the whole process of getting insurance is more concise. Coalition mainly sells products through insurance brokers. Through the online platform of Coalition, after brokers input the basic information of customers, they can get the quotes and policies generated for the company within a few minutes. In this process, Coalition used public information to access a large number of data, so as to understand the risks of the company and accurately price it. It is worth noting that Coalition can not only collect a large amount of data related to risks, but also make underwriting decisions in a very short period of time through these data, which greatly simplifies the whole insurance purchasing process and achieves accuracy on the basis of speed.\n\n**Services: supply\u00a0of risk management applications**\n\nFor policyholders, Coalition provides them with a proprietary network security application aimed at detecting, managing and mitigating threats, including automatic security alerts, threat alerts, expert guidance and other services, which can help enterprises when they face cyber attacks without paying extra fees. In the face of the heterogeneity of network risks, Coalition continues to add more functions and applications to help enterprises manage risks in various forms.\n\nIn the claim link, Coalition has improved the speed of processing and resolving claims through a large number of technologies. Coalition's Incident Response Experts are available to assist users when they call Coalition due to a cyber attack. Coalition, together with its partner companies (including public relations, legal and crisis management experts), stands ready to help businesses recover from a cyber security incident.\n\nWith comprehensive products and perfect service, and currently with the support of\u00a0Swiss Re, Lloyd's of London and Argo group, Coalition provides up to 15 million U.S. dollars in network and technology insurance for companies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, and 20 million Canadian dollars in insurance for companies in all 10 Canadian provinces. Its clients include technology companies, investment companies, retail merchants, banks, and manufacturers, etc.\n\n**The future development**\n\n\"The future of cybersecurity and insurance is an integrated solution for cyber events across all asset types,\" said Shawn Ram, director of Coalition's insurance practice, in response to Coalition's announcement last\u00a0year that it was expanding its services to companies in Canada. \u201cWe are excited to make this future a reality in the Canadian market.\"\n\nThe expansion of the business also helps Coalition to have a better understanding of network security, and Coalition has not stopped innovating in products. Also last\u00a0year, Coalition announced the acquisition of BinaryEdge, a Swiss-based Internet scanning and cybersecurity company. BinaryEdge has an Internet data collection platform that enables continuous scanning of the global Internet, mapping and providing real-time threat intelligence to more than 5 billion devices of more than 15 million commercial entities.\n\nWith this acquisition, Coalition could\u00a0integrate BinaryEdge's technology with its network insurance and security platform so that policyholders can map their Internet attack surfaces for real-time monitoring and proactive fixes to vulnerabilities.\n\nIn fact, the field of network security keeps changing,\u00a0and\u00a0the development of science and technology gives criminals a chance. Data leakage and other hazards to network security continue to exist, and may occur at any time. Behind this widespread phenomenon, companies will increasingly recognize that having a cybersecurity insurance policy is a protection against potentially catastrophic losses. According to the WEF white paper, the cyber security market, including cyber security insurance, was\u00a0expected to reach $170\u00a0billion\u00a0by 2020 and maintain an annual growth rate of at least 10-15 per cent.\n\nTherefore, network security insurance has become a big opportunity for insurance companies. In this field, Anda Insurance, Zurich Insurance and other foreign insurance companies have been operating\u00a0business for a long time. In China,\u00a0PICC property insurance, Ping An property insurance and other companies have also successively launched corresponding products. The comprehensive product guarantee, rapid response to claims and additional risk detection tools are undoubtedly the trump card for Coalition to surpass many rivals.",
