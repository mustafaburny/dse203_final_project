        "selftext": " The **Semiconductor Sector** has generated more than just solid gains so far this year, chip shortage has helped accelerate sales of semiconductors, sending the stock prices of companies that design and sell chips skyrocketing.  \nIn the last couple of weeks, I thought about adding a Semiconductor company to my portfolio, I decided to focus on AMD, NVIDIA, and INTEL, but because it might be a long post I decided to post in parts, the next post will be bot AMD so stay tuned.\n\n**If you think there is a company in this sector more worthwhile looking into, I'd be happy to hear some suggestions.**\n\n[ IMAGE SOURCE: youtube - cha cha video](https://preview.redd.it/avit8vg2dgr71.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a7f6bd2f815eaffa877381a845b1f0061e66ccb)\n\n#  Nvidia ~ $NVDA\n\n&gt;\"Nvidia is a platform story. We think there are many tentacles of future growth opportunity for Nvidia inclusive of the data center momentum that they are seeing today\" - Wells Fargo analyst\n\nNvidia is a big winner of many of the big tech events of the past year, including the global chip shortage, cryptocurrency volatility, and mining, the relentless fight by PC gamers to find RTX 30 series graphics cards in stock, and rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers. During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021.\n\n# Q2 Earnings\n\nAlmost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue \u2014 all those RTX 30 series graphics cards \u2014 hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates.\n\n# Crypto Market dependence\n\nWhen of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company\u2019s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs.\n\nFor Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell **$400 million** worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just **$266 million.**\n\n# Future Growth In the Gaming Segment\n\nNVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates\u00a0that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. \n\n# Arm Deal\n\nNvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it.\n\n# Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD\n\nAMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record\u00a050% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance.\n\n[ IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech](https://preview.redd.it/faswa7u5dgr71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99fdf6382da174aa1c34fff4ffb72dab7abaa7f2)\n\n#  Q2 Earnings And Growth\n\nOn July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform \"Steam\" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded\u00a030%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market.\n\n[ AMD website - q2 Financial results](https://preview.redd.it/jjeh28b8dgr71.png?width=1041&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1194ec52ebd44ff97c9ae9686ff69f63d4787d4b)\n\n#  Video Games Potential Growth\n\nVideo game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from\u00a0last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected\u00a0to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected\u00a0to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024.\n\n**AMD** supplies\u00a0semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for **Nintendo**'s Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell\u00a025.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022.\n\n# Xilinx Acquisition\n\nAMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx\u00a0is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly.\n\n# Intel ~ $INTC\n\nIntel\u2019s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It\u2019s struggled with R&amp;D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%.\n\nIntel fell behind **TSMC** in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to **AMD** in PC and data center CPU markets.\n\n[ IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL](https://preview.redd.it/sxqjttladgr71.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b541cb7bc838e7c7ddb580196ebc1e085bedce22)\n\n#  New CEO = New Future?\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia.\n\nIf Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again.\n\n# GPUs War\n\nIntel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from **Nvidia** and **AMD**, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.\n\n# Financial Comparisons\n\n[Market Size](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/AMD:NVDA:INTC/advanced%20micro%20devices:intel:nvidia/Market%20Cap?ref=nvdastonkssubreddit)\n\n1.

Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***Personal note:*** *Feel free to diagree and express your opinion about the post.*\n\n**Sources:**  \n[Jika.io](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/AMD:NVDA:INTC/advanced%20micro%20devices:intel:nvidia/Revenue?ref=nvdastonkssubreddit) \\- Companies comparisons  \n[Motleyfool.com](https://motleyfool.com/) \\- stocks news  \n[nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com/) \\- news and information  \n[amd.com](https://amd.com/) \\- investor relations  \n[investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/) \\- investor relations",

        "selftext": "AMDs stock has been a hot commodity these last few months with great earnings, even better guidance, and a strong likelihood that their acquisition of Xilinx will be completed by the end of the calendar year. So why should you sell AMD short? I'll tell you why:\n\n* The acquisition deal states that Xilinx shareholders will receive 1.7234 shares of AMD for each share they own. At close today AMD's shareprice was 116.33 and Xilinx was at 170.24. In order for the share prices to be effectively equal at the time of acquisition AMDs shareprice would have to drop to 98.78, or a bit more than 15% lower than the current share price.\n\n* Most shareholders are assuming the acquisition will be successful, and the anticipation of the merger's completion is artifically inflating the stock despite the fact the merger will have no immediate financial gain, especially since short sellers have been unable to properly arbitrate AMD/XLNX shares.\n\n* The chip shortage is not ending soon. It seems like every time I look it is expected to end later than before. Last estimate I heard was June. That's a long time for AMDs sales to remain below what they have the potential to be.\n\n* Finally and most importantly, you should sell AMD short because recent stocks have been doing the opposite of what WSB sentiment and positions currently are, and if you retards help AMD to rocket then that would really help my calls.\n\nPositions: 3 11/19 100C, 2 6/17/22 90C",

        "selftext": "There has been a lot of developments in [$AMD \u2013 Advanced Micro Devices stock](https://utradea.com/positions/AMD-Stock-Investment-Update-and-Earnings-Prediction), since I last covered them on June 21st. My previous coverage was my initial coverage of their company, and gives an outline of their whole company, financials, and other important information, which can be found [here](https://utradea.com/positions/AMD-is-a-fantastic-investment-idea). However, this analysis is not going to repeat this, rather it is designed to update you with recent news, events, and SEC filings to stay up to date on AMD\u2019s stock.\n\n**SEC Filings:**\n\nRecently, there have only been 2 noteworthy SEC filings, which are:\n\n*Current Report (8-K):*\n\nOn October 26, 2020. AMD entered into a merger plan with Xilinx Inc., making Xilinx a subsidiary of AMD. This merger proposal was officially passed by the UK Competition and Markets Authority on June 29th, making Xilinx an official subsidiary of AMD.\n\n*Quarterly Report (10-Q):*\n\nOn July 27th 2021, AMD released their Q2 2021 financial results. Overall AMD beat their earnings estimates by over 16%, and they raised their guidance. Both of these factors are bullish and assisted in AMD closing 7.5% higher on the trading day following this earnings release.\n\nThe most important factors from this report were that AMD increased revenues 100% YoY (12% QoQ), increased their gross margin by 4 percentage points YoY (2 percentage points QoQ), had a massive increase in their operating incomes and net incomes both YoY and QoQ, and lastly, they announces a $4B share repurchase program.\n\n**Recent News:**\n\n*Windows 11 Updates:*\n\nRecently, Windows 11 has released an update which has slowed the performance of AMD\u2019s CPU\u2019s. AMD is looking into their slower performance with this update and said that they are aiming to fix this problem by the end of the month (October 31st 2021). However, if these problems persist, many people may switch over to another brand of CPU\u2019s (ie. Intel). This will not only cost AMD revenues, but it will be giving those revenues to AMD\u2019s direct competitors.\n\n*AMD Stock Performance:*\n\nOverall, AMD has performed very well since my coverage and is up nearly 50% since my post. There have been a lot of catalysts over this time frame that have led AMD to have sustained such large growth over the past 4 months. Firstly, AMD beat earnings and raised their guidance, which immediately boosted the stock 7.5%. Furthermore, AMD has gained partnerships with elite companies including Tesla and Google.\n\nQ3 2021 Earnings:\n\nAMD is reporting their earnings today (October 26, 2021) after market close. This is sure to be a catalyst for movement in their stock. In the next section I will give my earnings estimate and how I would play it.\n\n**Earnings Estimate:**\n\nI am trying to get this out quickly, so I do not have time to take you through my reasoning for my earnings predictions.\n\n*Revenues:*\n\nI think that AMD will report quarterly revenues of $4.4B, which is 7% higher than AMD guidance suggested, and 7% higher than the average analyst earnings estimate of $4.12B. I think that the growth in their revenues will be the cause of a large growth in their data center revenues.\n\n*EPS:*\n\nI believe that AMD\u2019s EPS (based on my revenue projection) will be $0.72/share, which would indicate an earnings beat of 7.5%.\n\nOverall, I think that AMD is going to beat earnings, but by a relatively small margin. However, it is difficult to predict how the market will react to this. As a result of this, I am taking a more neutral and safe approach through a bull call spread of 126/132. This would cap your losses at $174/bull call spread, and yield a max gain of $426/bull-call spread.",

Both stocks fall in value, but AMD will have a greater negative than Xilinx\n\n- Merger is rejected. \n\n- If the merger agreement is terminated under other specified circumstances, including the failure to receive certain required regulatory approvals, AMD may be required to pay Xilinx a termination fee of $1.0 billion. If the merger agreement is terminated under other specified circumstances, including if the AMD board of directors changes its recommendation, AMD may be required to pay Xilinx a termination fee of $1.5 billion. (Copied from the SEC doc.)\n\n- AMD drops? Xilinx drops? Idk how this\u2019ll play out. \n\n\n \n \n\n\n**Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Most of my portfolio consists of Xilinx shares. I sold my AMD shares at 114$ as I thought the only way forward was for the ratio to even out.** \n\n\nStock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, changes in AMD\u2019s or Xilinx\u2019s respective businesses, operations and prospects, the uncertainty as to the extent of the duration, scope and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, market assessments of the likelihood that the merger will be completed, interest rates, general market, industry and economic conditions and other factors generally affecting the respective prices of AMD and Xilinx common stock, federal, state and local legislation, governmental regulation and legal developments in the industry segments in which AMD and Xilinx operate, and the timing of the merger and receipt of required regulatory approvals.",

        "selftext": "This is a warning, I am no expert on the stocks. I am drunk and the wife sent me to the couch tonight so why not dabble in some random dd and speculate earnings on AMD  with some hosers like myself.  I am gonna add my 2 cents on AMD. Please keep in mind that I again am not an expert and I have lost money in the best bull\nmarket in history. I am degenerate who has been playing weekly\u2019s on AMD so please let me know your thoughts. I am bullish on AMD. Since last week I gave it an 8% run up till earrings that was on the 12th opened at $104, and we have passed $113 already. Predictions are that AMD will run till earnings dip and then run again. My reasons are as follows. \n1.) TSLA earnings on 10/20, AMD chips are used in production of Model S and Model X, TSLA\u2019s record number of sales in China  is a good indicator, musk tweets about AMD being good to work with on 09/21. I think Elon fucks. Sales of those two models are important as shit could that be another market share for AMD? \n2.) APPL cucked INTC today with their new chip. \n3.)Still waiting more info on the XILINX deal, 4.)TSM beat expectations\n5.)INTC earnings on 10/21 expecting another move on AMD in anticipation of their earnings regardless of the results.\n6.)Also need to consider the recent partnerships with Microsoft and Google.\n\nHas it all been priced in? I am not sure we have ran over 8% since last week and had a major pop from the new graphics card. I am no expert and I don\u2019t have enough time to dive into the rabbit hole of semi conductors. This is just speculation and not a reliable source of information but I feel like there are plenty more gains to be had.",

        "selftext": "When I turned 3 years old I got a motorcycle. Some might think it was too early, but I was a quick learner and there wasn't much to do in Tasmania on the country side. My parents had a big yard and it made sense. It was pretty cheap, cost about 300 AUD and I used it for about 4 years. We moved to Denmark and later sold it for 400 AUD and it was in that moment that I had written enough for this post not to be considered low effort and therefore be able to talk about the title in question.\n\nThe title pretty much explains it. Given this odd trade, how will it pan out for Xilinx option holders? I currently see a few options..\n\n- It becomes an AMD option in a 1 to 1 conversion - If so, that would constitute a loss.\n\n- It gets sold at market price. If so, then it will also potentially mean a loss\n\n- It converts to AMD options in a 1 to 1.7234 conversion and then the excess will go back to the buyer. If so what's the amount that goes back to the buyer?",

        "selftext": "Xilinx Earnings post market beat earnings. No big deal. In fact it's somewhat expected. \n\nIf we look at EPS, Revenue of TXN and AMD they are more or less inline with expectations. \n\nTXN EPS: 2.07act vs 2.05est and 22% Rev increase (guidance took a shit because of supply chain issues)\n\nAMD EPS: .73act vs .67est and 54% rev increase\n\nSo what is Xilinx Earnings missing? Guidance. Which they refused to provide. why? because like the rest of the retards out there, they are waiting buyout by AMD. \n\nThey know they have supply chain issues and mentioning it will hurt their short term outlook and payday when AMD finally settles on a share price. Xilinx has been pumping up their numbers since Q2 and hasn't dipped since. \n\nThe earnings for Xilinx is fucking scamming AMD and their lack of supply chain issues are coming for them.",

        "selftext": "Stocks continued their remarkable rally, with all three major indexes rising and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) reaching a fresh intraday high amid continued strength by mega-cap tech stocks during earnings. This is despite new economic data that showed US GDP slowdown to its slowest expansion rate in over a year and new weekly unemployment claims. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed the major indexes on the day. Looking ahead, market participants continue to digest the ongoing corporate earning season.\n\nThe GDP report showed the economy decelerated to expand at the slowest rate in over one year for the July through September quarter, with the Delta variant and supply-side constraints capping economic activity. GDP rose at a 2.0% annualized rate, missing estimates for the 2.6% pace consensus economists anticipated. However, despite this report and other recent tepid economic data, market participants have remained remarkably resilient and kept buying up any dips.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Conference Board, a non-profit business research organization, released their October monthly consumer confidence index, which showed confidence rising as coronavirus cases in the US continued to retreat from the latest spike. Cases in the US retreated from a high in the previous spike of 285,058 to 105,561 in between September 13 and October 25. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 113.8 in October from 109.8 in September. This came in higher than the 108.0 consensus economists were looking for, according to Bloomberg data. It also marked the first monthly increase in confidence since June.  \n\nThe latest batch of earnings results helped affirm to Wall Street that many companies will be able to work through rising price pressures to continue delivering estimates-topping sales and profits. Though the expectation is that  inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions could last for longer than previously anticipated, the impacts will be surmountable to most companies. \n\nLori Calvasina, Chief Equity Strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said \u201cWhat we\u2019ve got from these supply chain issues is a near-term earnings problem. I think it's something we do have to monitor in the first half of the year. Earnings growth is only tracking at 4% or 6% in the first two quarters of next year. So companies do have to keep managing through for the market to continue to move up. But the reality is that the underlying economic backdrop simply is not stagnant.

        "selftext": "There has been a lot of developments in [$AMD \u2013 Advanced Micro Devices stock](https://utradea.com/positions/AMD-Stock-Investment-Update-and-Earnings-Prediction), since I last covered them on June 21st. My previous coverage was my initial coverage of their company, and gives an outline of their whole company, financials, and other important information, which can be found [here](https://utradea.com/positions/AMD-is-a-fantastic-investment-idea). However, this analysis is not going to repeat this, rather it is designed to update you with recent news, events, and SEC filings to stay up to date on AMD\u2019s stock.\n\n**SEC Filings:**\n\nRecently, there have only been 2 noteworthy SEC filings, which are:\n\n*Current Report (8-K):*\n\nOn October 26, 2020. AMD entered into a merger plan with Xilinx Inc. to make Xilinx a subsidiary of AMD. This merger proposal was officially passed by the UK Competition and Markets Authority on June 29th, making Xilinx an official subsidiary of AMD.\n\n*Quarterly Report (10-Q):*\n\nOn July 27th 2021, AMD released their Q2 2021 financial results. Overall AMD beat their earnings estimates by over 16%, and they raised their guidance. Both of these factors are bullish and assisted in AMD closing 7.5% higher on the trading day following this earnings release. \n\nThe most important factors from this report were that AMD increased revenues 100% YoY (12% QoQ), increased their gross margin by 4 percentage points YoY (2 percentage points QoQ), had a massive increase in their operating incomes and net incomes both YoY and QoQ, and lastly, they announces a $4B share repurchase program.\n\n**Recent News:**\n\n*Windows 11 Updates:*\n\nRecently, Windows 11 has released an update which has slowed the performance of AMD\u2019s CPU\u2019s. AMD is looking into their slower performance with this update and said that they are aiming to fix this problem by the end of the month (October 31st 2021). However, if these problems persist, many people may switch over to another brand of CPU\u2019s (ie. Intel). This will not only cost AMD revenues, but it will be giving those revenues to AMD\u2019s direct competitors.\n\n*AMD Stock Performance:*\n\nOverall, AMD has performed very well since my coverage and is up nearly 50% since my post. There have been a lot of catalysts over this time frame that have led AMD to have sustained such large growth over the past 4 months. Firstly, AMD beat earnings and raised their guidance, which immediately boosted the stock 7.5%. Furthermore, AMD has gained partnerships with elite companies including Tesla and Google.\n\nQ3 2021 Earnings:\n\nAMD is reporting their earnings today (October 26, 2021) after market close. This is sure to be a catalyst for movement in their stock. In the next section I will give my earnings estimate and how I would play it.\n\n**Earnings Estimate:**\n\nI am trying to get this out quickly, so I do not have time to take you through my reasoning for my earnings predictions.\n\n*Revenues:*\n\nI think that AMD will report quarterly revenues of $4.4B, which is 7% higher than AMD guidance suggested, and 7% higher than the average analyst earnings estimate of $4.12B. I think that the growth in their revenues will be the cause of a large growth in their data center revenues.\n\n*EPS:*\n\nI believe that AMD\u2019s EPS (based on my revenue projection) will be $0.72/share, which would indicate an earnings beat of 7.5%.\n\nOverall, I think that AMD is going to beat earnings, but by a relatively small margin. However, it is difficult to predict how the market will react to this. As a result of this, I am taking a more neutral and safe approach through a bull call spread of 126/132. This would cap your losses at $174/bull call spread, and yield a max gain of $426/bull-call spread.",
