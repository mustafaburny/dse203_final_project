        "selftext": "I am interested in hearing a bull case for doordash. I've seen many youtube videos, reddit posts, and more always dump this stock yet this stock is trading at a high valuation at 18 times sales which implies at least 20-25% sales growth for the next 10 years based on my model. Even Uber, which I consider to be massively overvalued, is trading only 17 billion more for postmates and most dominant ride haling service. \n\nWith earnings miss, i would thought that this stock would go down, but instead as of writing this post it is up 1.5% while airbnb is down on better earnings. Even Disney stock, which crushed earnings, is only up 1.8% as of writing this, and trades at a more reasonable valuation. In my opinion, you cant miss earnings, and expect to go up, yet DoorDash did and the guidance wasnt that great either. \n\nSo why did doordash go up today on earnings? I didn't see any reddit post on doordash earnings, in fact I rarely hear anyone talk about this stock which is surprising considering its a 62 billion growth company. ( i hear more people discuss corsair which is a 2 billion company)\n\n I would like to hear your thoughts on why this stock is worth the price, I always like to hear bull cases, on companies I find overvalued (like i read other people's post on crowdstrike, nvidia, moderna so even thought I find those stocks are overvalued I understand the market valuation is so high on those companies.) \n\nIn short, I am interested in hearing a bull case for doordash and why doordash went up on earnings while most stocks went down on earnings (like sofi, ttcf, which is consider to be reasonable valuation)",

Shot back up in June and then crumbled back close to break even again recently.\n\nI have learned a lot over the year. A lot about growth vs value and the importance of fundamentals.  I've made some mistakes like fomoing but I think now it's made me a smarter investor.\n\n\nI recently basically liquidated all my shares and moved to a  cash position on everything bar some dividend stocks and some safe tech like AAPL and NVDA( up a good few percent on both so a massive correction to breakeven wouldn't even worry me. \n\nI'm in my 20s and my total investment worth is about 15k including My recent cash position. \n\nI sold tesla today and this hurt. I will be buying back. I must think it's way too risky in the short term. And I also need a house so the 15k would be close to a deposit down payment. But I'm not against going all in on an undervalued company such as HPQ(price to earnings is like 10 and they pay dividends.)\n\nI made some profits off Chinese EV. But personally I feel that is one of the most dangerous sectors in the market. Especially with what's going on with CCP recently.\n\n\nJust wanted to make this to  see if there is similar sentiment about thinking valuations have gone absolutely insane in growth stocks , tech and EV.\n\n\nI am now a bear on the market as a whole. And take my advise. I used to think dividend or value plays were a real boring way to invest. They seemed it in 2020. But in 21 they are a far better play.\n\n\nMy advice: inflation is going to wreck growth in the short term. And I'd keep some cash aside for dips if you are an investor. I can't shake the feeling the market is being propped up so artificially, and we are in for a serious correction.\n\n\nLove to hear from you guys and don't feel like you can't dm me or comment some questions..\n\nBTW I'm not into memes. Its cool if you are but my post isn't signalling the MO ASS because I think we are in for a correction or crash. In fact i think stocks like amc and gme will suffer like growth will as well.

They even tried 'coaching' me on investing, to which I agreed because I believe that there's always knowledge that I can attained, however, it felt like a cell group meeting where they feed each other with confirmation biases.\n\nI personally hold some value stocks myself and I understand the need to look long-term when it comes to investing. But honestly, what's wrong with riding on some growth stocks for short-term gains? I genuinely feel that they are annoyed that basic investors like me are making some decent returns while they are still stuck with their marginal returns due to their stubborn philosophy in investing, and trying to read too deep in annual and financial reports. Where else for me, I get all the info I need from the simple metrics provided by Morningstar, reading financial news and of course awesome subreddit communities like this.\n\nAnyone else have such experience dealing with value investors?\n\nPS.

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been an Intel user since forever. \n\nAfter seeing all the NVDA/AMD news for the past few weeks, I even considered  upgrading my Intel CPU to an AMD CPU. This makes me wonder, what happened to the great Intel?  Are they stoned?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---Promise or Non-sense?--- \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# INTC is beaten badly on the market.\n\nThe most demand for semiconductors is from business instead of gamers/ individuals. Intel has been losing their customers as they lost competition. \n\nOn the other hand, AMD gradually over the quarters, showing innovation with a cutting-edge chip and in other sectors. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Buy Intel\u2019s dip instead of AMD or NVDA?\n\nIt\u2019s a big no for me. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, Intel is far from dead or less competitive. Balance sheet is great and the new CEO looks pretty promising. \n\nHowever, the big question - Will INTC go back to their glory days?  \n\nNot gonna happen if they don\u2019t show any innovation. I\u2019m laying my hands off for now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Don\u2019t panic if you have INTC, here\u2019s why.\n\nIf you already got some INTC on your hand, don\u2019t sell just yet. INTC is kind of overlooked due to how great NVDA and AMD did recently. However, if you do hold INTC, best case scenario INTC gets back on their feet and stomps AMD and NVDA. \n\nWorst case? \n\nThey stay like this for a couple more years. Nothing really bad would happen for a company with such cash in hand. If they use the cash the right way, many things could be achieved.  \n\nWhat do you guys think?

        "selftext": "# TLDR: If you like free money - buy XLNX and wait.\n\nFor context, AMD announced Xilinx acquisition in october last year: [https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2020-10-27-amd-to-acquire-xilinx-creating-the-industry-s-high-performance-computing](https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2020-10-27-amd-to-acquire-xilinx-creating-the-industry-s-high-performance-computing)\n\nThe acquisition is an all-stock deal, which means for every Xilinx stock you will get exactly 1.7234 of AMD stock after the merger is completed. The merger is planned to be completed by the end of the year, and it has been reiterated during 2 of the previous earning calls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What is there to gain?\n\nAMD stock is trading today at $112. Xilinx today is trading at $146. This means a ratio of 1.30 instead of 1.7234. Buying Xilinx you are buying AMD stocks for $85 after merger happens. This is 30% upside of free monies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What is there to lose?\n\nIf AMD/XILINX deal doesn't go through, XLNX will most likely jump straight back to pre-merger announcement territory, it will probably end up around $110-$115.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What could stop the merger from happening?\n\nThere are several regulators that have to approve merger. Most of the important ones already did:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\\_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory\\_approval\\_status](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory_approval_status)\n\nHowever it hasn't been approved by China yet: [https://www.enterpriseai.news/2021/07/01/with-approvals-in-from-the-ec-and-the-uk-amds-35b-acquisition-of-xilinx-now-up-to-china/](https://www.enterpriseai.news/2021/07/01/with-approvals-in-from-the-ec-and-the-uk-amds-35b-acquisition-of-xilinx-now-up-to-china/)\n\nThe moment China approves the deal, Xilinx stock will jump very close to 1.7234 multiple of AMD (and possibly drag AMD down a bit, however merger approval is *good news* for AMD as well).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What are the chances China does not approve of the deal?\n\nOf course it's a gamble with high US-China tensions, but let's take a look at some facts. In 2019 Chinese antitrust committee reviewed 465 deals. It approved all of them (!!).\n\n[https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=1421064d-d8f4-4591-963c-d0d65999ff57](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=1421064d-d8f4-4591-963c-d0d65999ff57)\n\nIn 2020 they reviewed 458 deals. Out of all of them, they rejected a single one (DouYu merger with Huya, both Chinese companies).\n\n[https://www.gibsondunn.com/antitrust-in-china-2020-year-in-review/](https://www.gibsondunn.com/antitrust-in-china-2020-year-in-review/)\n\nThis means only one rejection out of 923 deals!\n\nNvidia purchased Mellanox in 2020 and it was conditionally approved through China. This is equivalent of AMD/XLNX deal. AMD owns ATI, which was started by Chinese Canadians. Both Xilinx and AMD are US based. They already have heavy business connections with China. I'm not bold enough to estimate the odds, but the facts suggest they're quite high!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# If this is such a good deal, why is nobody else buying XLNX?\n\nThey were, but had to cover their shorts! The most common way to play XLNX/AMD merger is to go short AMD and long XLNX, and that's what most investors did. However, with recent magnificient AMD run up after Q2 earnings call they were forced to cover their short positions as they became too expensive to hold till the merger. And I have proof that prices were closely correlated until very recently, let's take a look at this XLNX/AMD ratio graph: [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio\\_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio)\n\nUp until very recently the deal was oscilating within 1.5-1.6 area and after recent AMD run up it's been lagging strongly behind. Unless there's some hidden factor major investors know about but not common folks, this is literally the best time in history to buy XLNX to convert into AMD after the merger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: XLNX leaps, XLNX stock, AMD stock",

        "selftext": "We all know that AMD is a great company. Its last earning surprise and its great growth guidance led the price to go 30% up. Additional bullish news about MacPro is also boosting this price up with 4x higher volume. \n\nHowever, we all gotta know that we always need to \"sell the news\", and \"sell the greed\" in order to make profits(especially options) because realistically, institutions and big hands have better models, connections, business relationships, and platforms which bring the fastest and newest information to them so they can take their profits out faster than one another. Most stocks are already priced in when its bullish news comes out, and I think AMD would not be an exception.\n\nReasons:\n\n1. The price is already too high, Quarterly RSI:82, 350.55 P/E, (Remember, Nvidia is still strong enough to keep their #1 position for a while).\n2. 76% owned by institutions (most of us can't buy or sell faster than them. Too risky to fight with them. That is why \"sell the news\", and \"sell the greed\" became quotes for retail investors aka ants). \n3. The current market sentiment is not bullish enough. We all know that the whole market went up too much since the COVID due to low interest rate and stimulus checks. Institutions and big hands all perceive that there will be a huge correction before the end of this year, but they can't start a big sell off now because thankfully the Fed and retail investors are helping them to take little more profits before they eventually start selling off. Therefore, I think AMD's current price rise was high enough to be the peak before it drops. \n\n[sourced by \\\\\"forecasts.org\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/anekyswaykf71.png?width=1222&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e680a785d30f55216511aeee2fa0a035c548b55)\n\nAs you can see by this forecasts, S&amp;P 500 index keeps decreasing from August 2021 to January 2022, and then bouncing back from February 2022. It is just a forecast, but if the Fed says they will actually start considering about tapering in next year or something, there will be a high chance that the market goes down like this forecast values. \n\n4. AMD needs a healthy correction before it goes up again. Every stock needs a correction in order to prevent its froth. \n\nI hope that Bulls do not hate me by this DD because I love AMD too! \n\nI used to kept my long position until yesterday and sold at $119 and bought some puts with a small amount.\n\nI just want to do both ways to maximize my profits though. Indeed, I am going to buy Calls again later when it dips.\n\nOh btw, I'm the one who wrote Micron DD if anyone saw it lol Let's go Micron too!! It is a solid stock. \n\nThis is not a financial advice, just a DD. Thank you guys :D\n\nBless all you investors aka ants!!!!!!!! Let's do this!!!!!!!",

        "selftext": "# Last Week's Review\n\nWe hit some home-runs last week with AMD, CLF, and TLRY. All of which were up over 20% at one point. The other names are not doing too bad either and IMO still \u201cconsolidating\u201d with their charts &amp; technicals. Here\u2019s a snapshot of the ticker performance from the last two weeks. In the same time-period SPY has gone up 3%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b0g8wtx6mte71.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28e727f9ead432e46e22074c9489e03a8fbc44f0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI exited my position on CLF as I felt it was beginning to get into the \u201cred zone\u201d I talk about. The ticker has been on an unbelievable uptrend since the start of the year and the chart is beautiful. However, I highlighted below a short-term risk area after the stock has shot up 30% in 7 days (due to good earnings as well). It\u2019s nearing the top of the trend channel and could potentially see a reversal. Either way, I protected my trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore we get into the tickers for this week here's a breakdown of some of my charting rules and terminology.\n\n# Chart Guidelines &amp; Terms\n\nI use the term \"meme stock\" loosely as these aren't necessarily meme companies. I really mean that the ticker has a HIGH PROBABILITY to trend on social media and the stock price could be affected by social sentiment. The watchlist I give is usually comprised of tickers that have taken a breather after getting too hot from a social aspect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoving along, I like to look at my charts from a risk-reward perspective.\n\n\"Red Zones\" are high-risk lotto plays.\n\n\"Orange Zones\" are a bit of a mixed bag between being too hot or early in the trend.\n\n\"Green Zone\" is where I try to buy. These trades are never guaranteed (nothing in life is), but from a risk-to-reward point of view they are in my favor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs always, this is not financial advice or a recommendation to buy or sell a stock. Please do your own research before entering any positions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Meme List\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Skillz Inc (SKLZ)**\n\nI categorize this play on the meme stock list because SKLZ has been known to trend on various social media outlets and gain momentum through retail traders. This is a lucrative play and considered a YOLO with earnings coming up on Tuesday after the close. Looking at the chart the stock price is back to 3-month lows and where it was trading last December.\n\nIt\u2019s current valuation at $14 is still pretty rich (5b market cap off 270m in sales), but should the stock continue to drop it might become quite favorable. This ticker traded at $45 back in February and is down 60% since.\n\nThere are many doubters in the viability of this company\u2019s business model, but for a high-risk, high-reward play I like it at this current price. Having said that, ARK ETFs currently hold about 20 million shares of SKLZ.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j7ns8wfcnte71.png?width=2558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98f2044dc2a34e2b8b1df98f8b2a8a22f5a98070\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Peloton (PTON)**\n\nPTON chart looks ready for another break-out to the upside. This could be a potential \u201cfear of lockdown\u201d play and any news of Covid variants will cause this to pop. Glancing at the fundamentals the company has quite a strong balance sheet with very little debt, and strong growth. Most analyst\u2019s concerns on this name are regarding if the growth is actually sustainable for the long-term.\n\nAt $118 per share the stock is nearing the bottom of the channel for it\u2019s most recent trend over the last 3 months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xlljgnkdnte71.png?width=2558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=377b626ef469edf1bef1f1e57f63bb872cb7ad39\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FuboTV (FUBO)**\n\nLast, but not least on the meme\u2019s list we have FUBO. Remember the meme\u2019s list are tickers that have the potential to gain momentum through retail traders and popularity. This can sometimes be a driving force and the truth is you need to be in on these names BEFORE the hype-train leaves the station.\n\nFUBO had exceptionally strong performance back in December last year when it hit $60 per share. Concerns over the company\u2019s growth and sustainability have knocked the share price down by 60% and currently sits at $26. IMO we could be entering a green zone as the stock has traded sideways for a month now. FUBO reports earnings August 10.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hhhr705ente71.png?width=2554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a63ee2d3908f955b45ee2ad8afdee4fc882da56\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The BTFD List\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Teladoc (TDOC)**\n\nTDOC is one of the leaders in the \u201ctele-health\u201d industry. It gained momentum and popularity throughout lockdowns, but as the world-reopened the stock price has tumbled. In March, Amazon also announced their entry into the tele-health services and investors did not like this increase in competition.\n\nThis is a risky play and is potentially reliant on the lockdown catalyst, but at $148 per share and a 50% haircut from it\u2019s 52-week high, I will be looking to enter this position.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mu0ufnpfnte71.png?width=2556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19e074e533d51665dd9a9273c59bb3dcc5acb142\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**American Airlines (AAL)**\n\nAmerican airlines is a re-opening play. Travel is nearly back to pre-pandemic levels and most \u201cre-opening\u201d stocks are still trading at a discount due to future uncertainties.\n\nThe chart for most airlines will be quite similar to each other, and in my opinion the worst is behind us. I\u2019m looking for short-term upside on this one before the trend breaks down again.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/urudccegnte71.png?width=2554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94cac360b0279142c64e47042c42fdd996f85c07\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Micron Technology (MU)**\n\nOut of all the semi-conductor plays it always seems like MU gets no love. AMD and NVDA are performing very strong, but MU seems to be the laggard. MU is trading at a PE of 21 while NVDA and AMD trade at 92 and 37, respectively.\n\nMU just posted very solid earnings and the macro environment should be a strong driver of growth for semi-conductors in general. There has been a chip-shortage for some time now affecting many industries and all this pent up demand will last into 2022.\n\nI thought this stock was going to continue it\u2019s breakout at $95 a share, but it broke down starting in April and may have found a bottom at $77. I like MU here and might enter a position.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oegg5jwgnte71.png?width=2550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb72bd73ec1eedbeebad5b81c17168db4c370d16\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Closing Thoughts\n\nThat\u2019s the end for this week. Remember, investing is about PAYtience because it pays to be patient. There are A LOT of uncertainties in this market right now which means it is not the time for crazy YOLOs. We have risks from inflation, covid, rates &amp; QE tapering, re-opening risk (or lack of going back to \u201cnormal\u201d).\n\nThe VIX might not be close to the highs, but volatility is STILL HERE. We are seeing 2-5% daily swings in a lot of stocks right now. If anyone remembers before the pandemic you would be lucky to see a 2% move in most names.\n\nHope you all had a great weekend and I\u2019ll be back next week. Just FYI I might start adding a mid-week update some of the weeks to spot existing up-trends, down-trends, or tickers hyped on social media.",

This honestly leads us to wonder when the next ATH will be, when will $AAPL hit 155, 160? $AAPL reached ATH recently near $151\\~ range and seems to be consolidating for now. \n\nWhile looking at open interests on AAPL options today, I noticed a whopping volume of 210k for 9/17 150c volume. Are the hedgies or MM's blasting $AAPL up to new ATH soon?  Yes even though $AAPL's trading average is 70\\~80M shares per day, an influx of 150 ITM calls will create 21M more shares that need to be covered. (Not including the other weeklies 150c's) That's 1/3\\~1/4 of the daily average.

        "selftext": "AMD has had an incredible run these past few days, following their phenomenal earnings. The question is: how much more can it go? Well, I put together some quick numbers and it seems it is still very cheap. I focused on Market Cap / Turnover, which is a ratio that I personally like a lot.\n\n\tNVDA\n\n|Year|Turnover|Growth|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2018|11,716||\n|2019|10,918|\\-6.8%|\n|2020|16,675|52.7%|\n|TTM|19,256|15.5%|\n|2018-Today||64.36%|\n|Market Cap|492B||\n|MC / TO|25.6||\n\n\t\n\nAMD\n\n|Year|Turnover|Growth|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2018|6,475||\n|2019|6,731|3.9%|\n|2020|9,763|45%|\n|TTM|13,340|36.6|\n|2018-Today||106%|\n|Market Cap|132B||\n|MC / TO|9.9||\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see above, MC/TO ratio on NVDIA is almost 3x higher than on AMD despite AMD having higher recent growth. It is obvious that this is not the only ratio that matters and other factors come into play when pricing a stock, but AMD is an incredible growth stock and I strongly believe it will keep crushing on Turnover and closing the MC/TO gap to NVDA. Even a small increase from 9.9 to 12 would mean an additional 20% in stock price assuming current Turnover, which will be history very soon given the rapid growth.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that NVDA is up 45% in the past 6 months vs 28% for AMD and this is mostly due to the XLNX acquisition, which brought concerns to investors. Recent numbers from XLNX have given some comfort to the market.\n\nTL/DR: AMD still cheap. I see $150 in the horizon.",

Intel is securing its foothold in the semiconductor industry by building infrastructure, acquiring companies, and signing contracts. \n\n\tIntel wants to increase chip output and drive down its average costs to stay ahead of the competition. Intel is expanding into the automotive, consumer electronics, and foundries industry. Intel faces stiff competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung. All three companies have announced plans to increase research development by 2023-24.\n\n\tMoore's Law is key to understanding how the chip shortage occurred and how to prevent it from happening again. Intel, TSM, and Samsung have all announced multibillion-dollar research and development plans in the U.S. The market for semiconductor chips is increasing exponentially.\n\n\tThe U.S has been falling behind countries like Asia in the global semiconductor market. The U.S aims to secure global chip supply through its U.S $50B subsidy plan. The subsidy plan will boost the research and development of semiconductors in the U.S. Companies like Intel, TSM, and Samsung are now chomping at the bits.\n\n\tThe global market for semiconductors is growing exponentially. The recent semiconductor chip shortage is proof of Moore's law. The U.S plans to expand into the global market through a $50B subsidy plan to attract research development to the U.S. Chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water. You control the chips, you control the future.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. I am not an expert. Do your research.\\*\\**",

        "selftext": "Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO were weak Monday after a fatal accident involving a NIO car with self-driving features.\n\nThe fatal crash of a NIO ES8 sport-utility vehicle took place last week in China. The SUV is equipped with several driver assistance functions, including features enabled by Intel (ticker: INTC) division Mobileye, that enable some forms of autonomous driving. NIO\u2019s driver assistance functions are called NIO Pilot and employ cameras as the so-called eyes of the car.\n\nNIO has other autonomous-driving technology, referred to as NAD, such as radar, lidar\u2014a laser-based radar\u2014and camera vision, as well as computing power provided partly by Nvidia (NVDA) to process all the data points coming at the car.\n\nThe NAD features don\u2019t appear to be available on all NIO vehicles, including the ES8. All autonomous driving systems require the driver to pay attention to the road at all times.\n\nNIO responded to a request for comment with a Weibo post in Chinese. The post indicates the company is cooperating with police regarding the investigation.\n\nThe global automotive industry is still wrestling with regulatory and branding issues surrounding autonomous technology. Self-driving features, such as adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assistance, make driving safer as long as systems are used as intended. But drivers might rely too much on the features when systems are dubbed pilot or autopilot. Government safety regulators, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, are still drafting plans to prepare for the introduction of more advanced self-driving features.\n\nLink: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/nio-stock-price-self-driving-crash-51629118508](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nio-stock-price-self-driving-crash-51629118508)",

        "selftext": "First, no one cares about earnings miss in this market when it relates to tech stocks. If so, $NVDA, $AMZN, $GOOG and the like would soar to infinity beyond every earnings report but often go down after record breaking earnings. Why? Because of buying the rumor and selling the news and forward projections.\n\nThese companies are established and have to work hard to establish how they are going to continue growing at that pace, but for newer companies earnings miss are not only expected but a shakeout of weak paper hands. Remember $TSLA anyone?\n\nSo let's talk about $RBLX, who just post earnings announcement.\n\nHere is the TLDR;\n\nQ2 was less growth than Q1 compared to last year \ud83e\udd26- well duh!?!?\n\nLast Q2 was Apr 2020 - June 2020 which encompassed a rapid growth period for Roblox during the lockdowns.\n\nHere's the incredibly bullish thing though - **there was growth** \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.  The bears against this suggest that it was just a pandemic play and that it faced strong headwinds because of that. Yet, despite the economy vast re-opening and $DIS exploding it's park attendance with blowout earnings, $RBLX still experienced vast growth YoY in the headwind environment. I think this will only continue to curve upwards as pandemic surge data moves out of focus. For the short-term and my tendies, the earnings call tomorrow will make a big impact whether this will print or not. The Delta variant is growing lockdown concerns again too. Either way, more lockdowns or not, $RBLX is a strong play with lots of insider buying too.

Intel is securing its foothold in the semiconductor industry by building infrastructure, acquiring companies, and signing contracts. \n\n\tIntel wants to increase chip output and drive down its average costs to stay ahead of the competition. Intel is expanding into the automotive, consumer electronics, and foundries industry. Intel faces stiff competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung. All three companies have announced plans to increase research development by 2023-24.\n\n\tMoore's Law is key to understanding how the chip shortage occurred and how to prevent it from happening again. Intel, TSM, and Samsung have all announced multibillion-dollar research and development plans in the U.S. The market for semiconductor chips is increasing exponentially.\n\n\tThe U.S has been falling behind countries like Asia in the global semiconductor market. The U.S aims to secure global chip supply through its U.S $50B subsidy plan. The subsidy plan will boost the research and development of semiconductors in the U.S. Companies like Intel, TSM, and Samsung are now chomping at the bits.\n\n\tThe global market for semiconductors is growing exponentially. The recent semiconductor chip shortage is proof of Moore's law. The U.S plans to expand into the global market through a $50B subsidy plan to attract research development to the U.S. Chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water. You control the chips, you control the future.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. I am not an expert. Do your research.\\*\\**",

Things will likely go back\n3. Growth looks intact, and the optionality is plentiful\n4.

APP Ranking slump seems temporary, and people in the      industry think it is so. It doesn't matter if the money printer is turned      on.\n6. Stock seems cheap enough that crusty value investors      might buy it\n7. BUY THE DIP ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 1. Can $WISH Make Money?\n\nInvesting in growth is all well and good, but can they actually make money? Will the advertising spend forever be higher than the customer value?\n\nHere's the 1Q earnings call link: [https://ir.wish.com/events/event-details/wishs-first-quarter-2021-conference-call](https://ir.wish.com/events/event-details/wishs-first-quarter-2021-conference-call). In it at \\~27:00 the CFO says: \"When we slowed down growth we became extremely profitable\". Waaat? Surely they have been growing all along? On annual data it doesn't look like it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zq13fp5qdfh71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7b5f919264746e89a02f9776499f5b140b86a0a\n\nI reckon a lot of market participants see this and conclude WISH is dead. However, if we look at the quarterly data we find a gem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lv3atb1rdfh71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3367cd5304631ba0ef2cabf4ac5e94a1fa0f5d4\n\nSo in 1H 2019, when there's no Covid, and they turn the advertising off, they make money. A lot of money. From operations they make $109M, on $870M revenue. At least 10% profit margin overall, and that's in 2019, with no covid. Our revenue is much higher now, and a lot of costs are fixed, and Covid effects will go away eventually.\n\nAnd before you say that Q2 2019 revenue decreased, this quarter is always lower, as the CFO stated in the Q1 2021 earnings call, which brings me on to the next point.\n\nTakeaway: ***10% Profit Margin at any time.***\n\n#  2. Fucking COVID, and Everyone Panicking.\n\nCovid fucked a lot of shit up. Q2 is supposed to bring in less revenue than Q1. When the revenue collapsed to the natural take-up the CEO probably shit himself because he's buried in the monthly numbers. He himself said that in the 3 quarters up to July monthly users are down a large number and he now won't give any guidance.\n\nSee here the revenue for every Q, early years I used (annual rev)/4. Q2 2020 is messed up, it's way too high. Q2 2020 is supposed to be below Q1, instead it's $300M (70%) too high.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/auxqya7sdfh71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b084f7b870598b7646ec766ea28e7e6640a23583\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qf5szltsdfh71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d3e1712fa84e0b9d2635d048c44c2db8c1a0c7b\n\nThe earnings call was a shitshow of pessimism, they had so much positive to talk about that they didn't elaborate on, and so the optics are really bad, and I think it's mostly because the revenue got a huge artificial boost from Covid, very similar to the \"insert shitcoin\" bubble for NVDA and AMD if you want a case study.\n\nWhen the revenue boost ended, the revenue declined, and everyone panics, twitter is full of retards saying that revenue is decreasing and $WISH is dead. I don't think there's much to panic about: look at the revenue graph, look at the covid graph. Why panic?\n\nTakeaway: ***Covid fucks shit up, even if you get extra money from it. Things will likely go back.***\n\n \n\n# 3. Does $WISH Still Grow?\n\nIn this market everyone wants growth. After they see consistent growth they then say things along the lines of \"What's the TAM?\" or \"TAM Big\" or \"TAM HUGE\" or \"I Love TAM\". TAM Being total addressable market.\n\nThe app, in its current shitty state, was able to grow revenues for half a decade at least (it's longer, but S-1 only goes so far back). There's also no way they have completely captured all their potential TAM yet. The revenues aren't entirely the app revenue, but even so, bearing in mind the pandemic of doom, I think the revenue from the core marketplace is respectable and doesn't show signs of a true fuckup like the earnings call sounded like. The revenue is almost as high as Covid-everyone-at-home-time 1H 2020.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wbkxequtdfh71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=342ef998ed921fc7425b975af36423febd9d88a4\n\nNot to mention the optionality that is possible with this company. They built a whole logistics business from scratch, and that revenue just exploded, and now the number one complaint isn't shipping times any more. That is quite a drastic and striking way to solve a problem, yet these guys just went and solved it. I never heard of Wish till a year ago, I live in the middle of nowhere, I look for WISH pickup locations and WTF, there's 6 within a few miles of me. I order something, and the lady at the pickup shop says first thing: \"is it a WISH parcel? or...\".\n\nTheres also 1Sansome, built from zero, and is growing just fine. What happens when 1Sansome uses the WISH logistics network and always arrives sooner than Shein? Or where you can pick up the clothes from a WISH store?\n\nThen there's finance stuff. Jackie Reses is a business rock star, and she's on the $WISH team. What's this payment services license in the EU? What are they doing with that? What sort of product/service could they offer with this to buyers or sellers? IDK what they are cooking up, but the potential is there, and just the exact perfect person so happens to be there to execute it.\n\nTakeaway: ***Growth looks intact, and the optionality is plentiful.***\n\n \n\n# 4. But the Insiders are Selling! It's a Sinking Ship!\n\nIf anyone tells you this you should congratulate yourself, because you have 100% identified a true specimen of sheeple. It could be family, friends, relatives, I'm very sorry for your loss if it is a loved one, but if they say the insider selling is an issue, there is nothing that can be done, they are sheeple and probably can't think for themselves.\n\n\"Insider selling\" was selling stock for tax reasons. On some data feeds it looks like insider selling because the CFO fucked up the paperwork. The CFO probably got kicked out for this reason.\n\nI don't know for sure and I don't care about this, because the insiders are so heavily invested in this company it's basically a part of them. If you invest in $WISH you are investing alongside Peter Thiel, Joe Lonsdale, Peter Szulczewski, the Galileo fund guy, Danny(one of the founders), etc. \n\nThe insider investors are not sitting still either, they are deeply involved. How did Jackie Reses get there, for example.\n\nAnother thing about these insiders, you're dealing with the Paypal Mafia here, I think they know what they are doing. Go and read the Mafia Bosses book, you'll find that this guy doesn't diversify at all, he bets big when he thinks he'll win. Even better, lets look at what public stuff his fund is invested in: \n\n  \n   \n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fr818pqudfh71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3a82c236a227ab7c077d9d53c74b004c3ef873e\n\nTakeaway: ***The insiders, including Paypal Mafia people, they are betting big and I think they know things about WISH we don't.***\n\n  \n\n# 5. But the App Ranking? \n\nI can't think of any other reason other than the android advertising space got competitive. Advertising spend on Android went up a lot from the IOS privacy update. Though if I take a quote from this article: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2021/05/19/ios-145-causes-massive-shift-in-ad-spend-to-android/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2021/05/19/ios-145-causes-massive-shift-in-ad-spend-to-android/)\n\n\u201cIt's early days,\u201d he added. \u201cAs more users adopt 14.5 and marketers get comfortable with the new normal on iOS, most of us expect ad spend on iOS to fully recover.\u201d\n\nThis being a quote from a senior guy in that business. The viewership on IOS is really huge, it doesn't seem likely that advertising money permanently moves to android.\n\nAlso if you turn off the advertising, WISH already has a clientele, you don't need big advertising budget for that.\n\nTakeaway: ***This seems temporary, and people in the industry think it is so. It doesn't matter if the money printer is turned on.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 6. Crusty Old Value Investing Thinking\n\nI want to calculate a very rough price I think this business is worth. Then I buy below this, something about intelligent investor, margin of safety, uncle Buffett, MicHaEl burrry, Charlie \"I Love Costco\" Munger, etc. I want the calculation as simple as possible so that I don't have to think about this. I want a valuation that is roughly what we can reasonably assume, I'm not looking for the worst or best case scenario, because I don't want to think too much about this.\n\nI know they can get 10%+ margin at any time because it's been done, they spend a whole 6 month period with the advertising turned off and it made 10%. In the Avory&amp;Co research ([https://docsend.com/view/r35zrpbdzftxbeb2](https://docsend.com/view/r35zrpbdzftxbeb2)) they think they can get 15-20% margin. WISH thinks it can get 20%+ margin eventually, which I think makes sense as Ebay has a similar profit margin.\n\nOK so how about the revenue? We can safely assume it'll make $3Bn soon. How big can it get? IDK, let's assume there's no financial crash and it gets to $5Bn at some point. Remember they grew at 20%+ a year for a decade already. At a 10% margin that's $500M per year.\n\nOK so what multiple? 20 seems fine. Remember the business can grow. Over the last 10 years the P/E distribution appears like below.\n\n   \n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bnf9o12wdfh71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a45da67844444f34e07fbecb35b7a6017384e60\n\n[Code from here](https://github.com/Damonlee92/Build_Your_Own_AI_Investor_2021/tree/main/Chapter_4_to_6_AI_and_Backtesting)\n\n**Quick and dirty rough future value: $5Bn \\* 0.1 \\* 20 = $10Bn.**\n\n**Current Market Cap = $4.7Bn.**\n\nBefore the value investors come out of the woodwork and complain, yes I know it may very well not grow, in which case use a revenue of $3Bn and you still get to a value of $6Bn, in which case there's upside from here.\n\nAlso they have no debt, they can take a loan any time for $300M. Even if there is a financial crisis, they can sit and do nothing for 2 years, and in all that time the optionality of the stuff all these very capable people is given no value, which is retarded. We're talking about Reses and Paypal mafia here, in a service that no one else has, that Amazon wanted to pay $10Bn for some years ago and the CEO walked away from.\n\nIf a financial crisis hits the multiple is going to decrease, but the company itself will likely do just fine, and grow afterwards, since the formula already works. When good times come back what multiple do you think the market will give this company?\n\nTakeaway: ***This seems cheap enough that crusty value investors might buy it***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#  7. Relative To The Rest Of The Stock Market\n\nNKLA is an actual fraud, has less cash, no revenue, and a gravity powered truck. It's market cap? $3.8Bn\n\nLuckin Coffee Inc. is an actual fraud, might get fucking delisted from the stock exchange. It has negative Gross margins. It has $500M revenue.

A win rate - 90%. Better than July\u2019s 77%. A little experience helps!\n* My wins brought in $567.68\n* Losses took away $104.00\n* Net profit $463.68.\n\nWins: ABNB, BBY, CRM, CSCO, DASH, GPS, HPQ, INTU, M, MRVL, NVDA, PTON, SNOW, SPLK, TGT, TJX, ULTA, URBN, WDC\n\nLosses: LOW, JWN\n\nThe wins are great - no doubt. But it is the losses that are really interesting and have a high learning value. My losses show my indecision between two lines of thought: to defend a losing trade or to exit ASAP to minimize the loss. I have seen convincing arguments for both approaches, and am not yet sure where I stand on this.\n\nI managed my losing LOW trade fairly well in the beginning, brought it from several hundred down to around $30 loss. I could have brought it to a win, but I made a mistake - misread where I was standing and exited for a small loss. I learned how to read the position correctly and did another losing trade right - turned it into a win.\n\nI decided to take a loss on JWN because my overall win rate for August was around 93% and I thought I could afford a small loss. But now I think it could\u2019ve been managed and perhaps turned. But we\u2019ll never know if it could and if I had the skill to do it.\n\nWhere do you stand on this question? Do you defend? Or take a loss and move on to the next trade?",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, August 4, 2021**\n\nToday was another choppy day, with stocks ending the day mixed, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) climbing 0.14% while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) fell 0.48% and 0.89% respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-cap stocks, fell 1.25%. It seems market participants were disappointed by a report from ADP, a leading employment services company, which estimated that private employers added half the expected amount of jobs in July. This sets a negative backdrop for the official July Jobs Report, set to be released this Friday. \n\nADP, a leading payroll and human services software company, released its July 2021 Employment Report, which estimated that private employers added only 330,000 jobs in July, less than half the 690,000 gain expected by economists. While ADP\u2019s report isn\u2019t 100% accurate, it\u2019s usually fairly close and sets a negative backdrop for the official July Job Report on Friday. ADP\u2019s report shows that the labor market imbalances stemming from the coronavirus pandemic remain. Moreover, with concerns surrounding the Delta variant increasing, that could be a relatively new factor adding more pressure. Here is the entire report: [https://adpemploymentreport.com/](https://adpemploymentreport.com/)\n\nConcerns surrounding the highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant continue to rise, with Florida emerging as the US\u2019 new epicenter for the disease. Cases in Florida have jumped dramatically, going from 2432 on July 1 to 38,776 on July 30 and have so far had three consecutive days of record infections. Thankfully, however, despite the surge in cases, the death rate has so far remained stable and relatively low, a sign that the vaccines are very effective at preventing hospitalizations and serious death. \n\nSo far, 59% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85%, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 2009. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Lyft (LYFT) fell roughly 10% despite posting its first profitable quarter. Earnings are very weird.\n* Shares of GM slipped 8% after posting earnings.\n* Shares of NovaVax (NVAX) gapped up roughly 20$ after the company announced an agreement with the EU to sell up to 200 million COVID vaccines. \n* Shares of some Chinese companies somewhat after pulling back yesterday following signaling that the CCP may be targeting video game companies next as the regulatory crackdown on tech stocks continues. Yesterday, shares of Tencent (TCEHY) and other tech stocks fell after a state-media called video games \"spiritual opium\". This prompted Tencent to say it will limit gaming time for minors and may even ban those under 12 from its platform. \n* Shares of Robinhood (HOOD) gapped up again today, rising roughly 50% today.\n* Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida said Wednesday the central bank is still on track to begin raising rates off their current near-zero levels in 2023, as long as the economic recovery remains on its current trajectory. He said \u201cWhile, as Chair Powell indicated last week, we are clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates and this is certainly not something on the radar screen right now, if the outlook for inflation and outlook for unemployment I summarized earlier turn out to be the actual outcomes for inflation and unemployment realized over the forecast horizon, then I believe that these three necessary conditions for raising the target range for the federal funds rate will have been met by year-end 2022.\u201d\n* \\*\\***Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Akami Technologies (AKAM) with two target raises.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 24, 2021**\n\nStocks continued their strong performance, recovering from jitteriness last week to reach new intraday record highs in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ). The Dow Jones (DIA) traded modestly even and remains roughly $2 from its record high. The Russell 2000 (IWM) which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued rallying after steeply underperforming last week, climbing roughly 3% in the last two days. After an initial shock following the release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting minutes, it seems fears over the taper timeline have receded for the moment. As I have been saying, I remain unfazed by any talk about a potential taper timeline. On a personal note, I remain bullish until discussion about an interest rate hike begins, and will reconsider my position then. Looking ahead, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to give his annual Jackson Hole speech on Thursday.\n\nThis earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking success. 91% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 87% of those outperforming estimates in revenue. The blended, year-over-year earnings growth rate is an eye-popping 85.1%, absolutely smashing original estimates of 66.5%. What is most remarkable is this comes among a resurgence of coronavirus cases due to the delta variant, supply-side disruptions, and labor market imbalances in the US. \n\nKeith Lerner, Chief Market Strategist at Truist Financial, gave this take about earnings, \u201cWe think the primary trend is higher. We\u2019re only about one year into this economic expansion. Expansions typically last about five years, And the earnings season which we just got out of was phenomenal. Even if it\u2019s peak growth, we still think it\u2019s going to be strong growth. You have earnings moving forward and then you look at the relative comparison of stocks relative to bonds and they\u2019re still attractive. Overall, we think the right position is to be overweight stocks.\u201d\n\nUS Crude oil prices gained for a second straight session, building on advances after recently hitting a seven-day consecutive losing streak.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, August 19, 2021**\n\nStocks finished mixed today in a choppy session, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) recovering some losses after yesterday\u2019s session, closing 0.17% and 0.47% higher respectively. On the other hand, the Dow Jones (DIA) fell modestly, closing 0.18% down while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued underperforming, closing 1.21% down today and almost 5% down this week. Market participants continue to digest the implication of the Federal Reserve\u2019s July Meeting Minutes, which showed there are increasing discussions surrounding a potential taper timeline, with members suggesting they could begin this year if the current pace of economic recovery continues.  The most important thing is the Fed re-committed to maintaining the interest rate near-zero until at least 2023. That will be the real test for equities in my opinion. \n\nYesterday\u2019s meeting minutes suggested members of the Federal Reserve were advancing the debate over the timing and scope of tapering the pace of the pandemic-era asset purchasing program. In the latest minutes, the Fed said, \u201clooking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.\u201dAs I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Fed\u2019s goal has not yet been reached. The meeting minutes said, \u201c most participants judged that the Committee\u2019s standard of \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met.\u201d \n\nToday, the Labor Department released their Weekly Unemployment Report, which, along with other recent reports, vindicates the Fed\u2019s assessment that the labor market has substantially recovered from heights of the pandemic-induced recession. Initial Unemployment claims came in at 348,000, the lowest level since March 2020 and better than the 364,000 expected and 377,000 the previous week. Continuing claims came in at 2.82 million, roughly in line with the 2.8 million expected\n\nIn order to stave off another \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d and directly address interest rates concerns, the minutes explicitly stressed the need to \u201creaffirm the absence of any mechanical link between the timing of tapering and that of an eventual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.\u201d Participants voted to maintain the interest rate near zero. I cannot stress this enough, potential interest rate hikes in 2023 will be the real test for equities. Until then I remain very bullish and will continue buying up every dip (has worked wonderfully so far). Of this, the meeting minutes said, \u201cA couple of participants also noted that a tapering of asset purchases did not amount to a tightening of the stance of monetary policy and instead only implied that additional monetary accommodation would be provided at a slower rate.\u201d\n\nOn inflation, the minutes said \u201cWith regard to inflation, participants commented that recent inflation readings had been boosted by the effects of supply bottlenecks and labor shortages and were likely to be transitory\u201d and \u201cSome other participants emphasized that recent high inflation readings had largely been driven by price increases in a handful of categories. These participants pointed out that there was no evidence of broad-based price pressures or of inappropriately high longer-term inflation expectations. Several participants also commented that price increases concentrated in a small number of categories were unlikely to change underlying inflation dynamics sufficiently to overcome the possibility of a persistent downward bias in inflation, as might be associated with the effective lower bound.\u201d However, other participants, like St. Louis President James Bullard, raised concerns about recent inflationary readings and the need for the Federal Reserve to be ready and able to act if current circumstances change.\n\nIn short, the meeting minutes showed there was some divide in opinion among members, with the only thing unanimously agreed on was that interest rates will remain near-zero for the foreseeable future. One quote I think highlights the minutes well is this one, \u201cA few participants expressed concerns that maintaining highly accommodative financial conditions might contribute to a further buildup in risk to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee\u2019s dual-mandate goals. In contrast, a few other participants suggested that preparations for reducing the pace of asset purchases should encompass the possibility that the reductions might not occur for some time and highlighted the risks that rising COVID-19 cases associated with the spread of the Delta variant could cause delays in returning to work and school and so damp the economic recovery.\u201d\n\nI recommend everyone read the full meeting minutes, it's really not that long and super insightful: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* In more earnings news, shares of Robinhood (HOOD) fell 10% after reporting earnings while my favorite stock Nvidia (NVDA) rose 4% after smashing earnings estimates and raising guidance moving ahead.\n* The Nigerian government said it expected to lift its ban on Twitter (TWTR) by the end of the year.\n* The SEC charged 3 former Netflix (NFLX) employees and two of their associates for insider trading accumulating $3 million.\n* The Federal Trade Commission filed a new version of its antitrust lawsuit against Facebook (FB) on Thursday, seeking to jump-start its case with bolstered allegations that the company is abusing a monopoly position in social media.\n* Tesla (TSLA) is holding an event, billed AI Day, in order to promote and showcase its AI technology. This comes amid an investigation by The National Highway Traffic Safety Safety Administration over Tesla assisted-driving technology\n* Toyota, Volkswagen (VWAGY), Ford Motors (F) have been forced to cut production once again due to the global shortage in semiconductors.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Analog Devices (ADI) with a host of target raises.

        "selftext": "# Last Week\u2019s Review\n\nThe SPY and QQQ ended flat last week while IWM and small-caps closed down -1%. The market did not react well to the Fed hinting of a potential taper by the end of 2021 or early 2022. Growth names took a beating, but most of last week\u2019s list performed relatively well being down only 2-3%.\n\nJackson hole Fed meeting, virtually, is taking place this Friday August 28 and will be a big tell in what\u2019s to happen next for the market. They will discuss economic policies that, as we know, rule over the stock market and dictate where valuations should be. If you are an investor this will be a key event to keep an eye on. Due to the meeting I will be trading light this week, but I\u2019ve still put together a few names on my watch-list down below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe market is in a peculiar place. We have:\n\n* Retail sales lower than expected\n* China retail sales lower than expected\n* China stocks still in hot lava\n* Fed saying it\u2019s time to taper\n* Inflation being transitory and also maybe not transitory\n* Covid news flip-flopping daily between good and bad\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is more information than the market can even digest, which is a possible factor for this increase in volatility and choppiness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to eventually get into all the details of how I find stocks to choose from. It\u2019s really nothing fancy like boilinger bands or ichimoku clouds, but rather simple technicals such as support and resistance lines, moving averages, and trend channels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere will never be a clear leading indicator of when to buy or sell a stock for max profit. Most of it is knowing about the stock/company and finding a reasonable entry point for it, like we\u2019ve been doing with out \u201cBuy The Dip\u201d charts. Next week I\u2019ll cover some of these charting and technicals a bit more in-depth, but for now I\u2019ll leave you with several questions I ask myself before entering the play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Is the company fundamentally strong? If not, am I playing a bounce or what is my game-plan, aka how long will I hold the position?\n* Is the stock in an up-trend? If yes, is it near the top of the channel, or at the lower trend-line and a decent entry?\n* Is the stock in a down-trend? Has the stock price settled or bottomed? If yes a base might be forming. If not, am I catching this knife because I think the share price over-reacted to bad news? Is the company still trading at ridiculous PE or P/S? Did the company\u2019s moat get threatened? Has growth slowed?\n* Am I trading on stock hype? Has the hype died off and provided a potential entry, AKA my green/orange/red zones? Am I FOMOing into the trade or should I re-visit this stock in 7 days and see if it\u2019s still something I want to buy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are all important questions to ask yourself before you enter any position. Figure out your game-plan and strategy and fine-tune it into something that works for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do a pizza, gambling, and tech stock have in common? Nothing, but let\u2019s buy the Fing dip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The MEME List\n\n**DraftKings (DKNG)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8s5zajbrpzi71.png?width=2254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd20aed890bd535e8de05ed1fdd9dabd3cd27899\n\nDKNG had a great run up to $70 earlier this year, but since then it saw a steady decline, with most other growth stocks, back to the $40 level. Looking at the 50 EMA line it was clear that it was in a downtrend, but it just recently crossed back over. I wouldn't say an uptrend is confirmed just yet, but we are almost there. This may prove to be a good entry and I'm willing to take the risk on this fairly risk-averse play.\n\nThere is potential it could drop back to $45 level, but IMO this could also be a $75 stock. I see 10-20% downside risk with 50% potential upside and that is a risk-reward I prefer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Snowflake (SNOW)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqpiwkyrpzi71.png?width=2266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=566d8b20a657abf145c1b299142dfbb6fc1fca5d\n\nThe over-hyped IPO of SNOW that shot the stock up to over $400 per share and eventually into a quick reversal back to the high $200's. I added an orange zone box to show where the stock started to bottom out. SNOW has lost most of it\u2019s volatility that surrounded the IPO and since May has been on a SLOW grind back up. SNOW is down 8% over the last 5-trading sessions and is sitting at the 50 EMA (orange line). I'll be looking for a bounce off this line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The BTFD List\n\n**Paypal (PYPL)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9y31ffispzi71.png?width=2266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7752d2fdaf2c6cb822a8b90a1684dddea361f93a\n\nPaypal stock dropped recently on earnings after Ebay announced a transition to their own managed payments system. PYPL did post impressive earnings, but had soft guidance for Q4 and the stock tumbled.\n\nUnlike meme stocks PYPL's trends have been steady and consistent. Looking at the chart it just recently dipped below the 50 EMA to potentially form a reversal (but not yet), and is sitting at the 100 EMA where I am looking for a bounce. Should we lose this level I might exit the position as the trend would be confirmed to the downside and potentially $240.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Dominoes Pizza (DPZ)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oouz0k4tpzi71.png?width=2270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2bf6d69ce71c1c22ac70f6683a482c4b0b41157\n\nLed by international expansions and strong domestic growth Dominoes pizza has been one of the most out-performing stocks of 2021. Similar to PYPL above it has been on an extremely consistent uptrend. The recent 5% dip has given an entry point and IMO any dip to the 50 EMA can also provide an entry. The stock is also hitting some over-sold indicators which would agree with my bias.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Taiwan Semis Manufacturing (TSM)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lv8267stpzi71.png?width=2262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68bdfd8e676eef73ca3bb7b27f4d2387a1772736\n\nThe semi-shortage has been affecting many industries. With how cyclical production can be analysts are nervous about the over-production and over-supply that might eventually hit. However, I expect chip demand to remain robust for the foreseeable future. TSM was trading in a range for almost 6 months and oversold levels are starting to show, but IMO this is a value play. TSM trading at a much lower PE relative to their competitors of NVDA and AMD, and not getting much love. To be able to buy this name back at almost the same price as 9 months ago is a value entry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat\u2019s the end of this week\u2019s edition! Hope you all are able to take something away from it. For those that are interested in the memes I\u2019ll be bringing some of those back as well. Hope you had a great weekend all and see you next week!",

Last weeks theme was selling options, and boy did we sell! **$APPS short strangles returned close to 100%, with $BIDU following closely behind netting around 80%. Meme stocks also had muted volatility. I sold an $AMC 34 strangle for $630, and although I closed early, I was given the opportunity to close it out at the end of the week for mere pennies on the dollar. Last but not least, a long strangle on $UPST would\u2019ve netted you a whopping 460% return!** Unfortunately for us, earnings season is slowly coming to a close, meaning the quality of our plays will be diminishing greatly! Those looking to trade this week should proceed with caution, as there isn\u2019t much of an edge to be gained this time round. If you wish to track my trades and try them out for yourself, feel free to check out the community links on my profile! Let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don\u2019t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn\u2019t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It\u2019s literally all just gambling, and as a result I\u2019m probably gonna sit this week out entirely. Pay little attention to the sample plays below, as I\u2019ve only included them for inspiration, and in case anyone sees something I may have missed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Selling $DNUT puts may prove to be profitable.** Although justified, Krispy Kreme has been on a downtrend since its IPO. $DNUT is literally hemorrhaging money and fundamentally the company is a terrible investment. A couple of years ago they actually went private after defrauding investors, doing shady audit practices, and literally using company money to buy back stores owned by family members of the executive board for FIVE TIMES what they were worth. More info on that [here.](https://www.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2009/03/three-krispy-kreme-ex-execs-settle-sec-charges/) Nowadays, the stock is priced as what it is - a fraudulent, cash burning business. Earnings is priced to fail, and as a result, any semblance of positive news will likely send us going upwards. If you have the balls, selling puts may prove to be profitable. The 15P is going for $0.80 giving you a breakeven of around 5.5%. You can even pickup pennies in front of the steamroller and sell the 12.5P for $0.05, giving you a breakeven of 17%. Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we\u2019re going up.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing. Options are pricing a 2% move, while historically Cisco moves around 5%. Given that prices remain the same or get cheaper by earnings, a strangle should net you some nice profits. If you\u2019re poor or want a binary directional play, I\u2019d look to buy puts. $CSCO is at ATHs so we\u2019re probably gonna do the classic \u201cdump after earnings regardless of the outcome\u201c thing that everyone seems to get tricked by. Regardless, at the time of writing, $CSCO strangles give us nice edge.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll that being said, there aren\u2019t many trades to run this time round! If I notice anything extra during this week, I\u2019ll look to keep you guys posted on my socials. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nAll in all, pretty awful week for trading. Most tickers are complete garbage, and there\u2019s little edge to be gained among those that aren\u2019t. No shame in sitting this one out! That being said, if you see any appealing plays I\u2019ve missed, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you\u2019d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**",

        "selftext": "Is Nvidia (NVDA) a buy after its impressive Q2 earnings?\n\n# Last earnings:\n\n* Q2 Figures:\n\nFor the quarter that ended on August 1st, Nvidia generated a record $6.51 billion in revenues, exceeding the expected $6.33 billion. Revenue rose 68% annually whereas, in the previous quarter, sales grew 84%. Adjusted earnings amounted to $1.04, exceeding expectations of $1.01.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Graphics Segment:\n\nThe segment which is primarily made up of graphics cards grew 87% to $3.91 billion or more descriptively, faster than the compute and network segment, which includes chips for data centers, which grew 46% to $2.6 billion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Gaming Market\n\nWhen it comes to markets, gaming was one of the highlights, its sales went up 85% compared to last year and reached $3.06 billion. This increase is owed both to GeForce graphics card sales and the chips it sells to game console makers, such as the processor which is at the heart of the Nintendo Switch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Data Center Business\n\nDue to graphics cards for data centers, both industrial use and among cloud providers, this business also hit an all-time high as it grew 35% annually to $2.37 billion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Professional Visualization\n\nThe segment that consists mostly of graphics cards for high-end professional workstations went up 156% annually to $519 million. Its automotive business remains a small portion of the company's sales, with sales of $152 million, down sequentially from the previous quarter but up 37% from last year's respective quarter that was shaped by the global pandemic that halted auto production.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* CPM Fell Short\n\nThe company's new Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP), the dedicated chips it makes for cryptocurrency mining, failed to hit Nvidia's own predictions. It reported $266 million in cryptocurrency card sales, as opposed to $400 million it predicted, making the prediction 33% off. CMP sales were likely impacted by China's cryptocurrency crackdown as miners were selling off used graphics processing units.\n\nNvidia says its cryptocurrency cards are an effort to ensure there is sufficient chip supply for gamers and it applied software to its GPUs to prevent them from mining cryptocurrencies. Going forward, Nvidia's CFO, Colette Kress, expects a \"minimal contribution\" from CMP sales.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Potential Dangers :\n\nSupply issues that began late last year are still in the air, as Nvidia's latest line of graphics cards has remained mostly sold out in stores and it was seeing longer lead times throughout its supply chain. But this is not a surprise as the company announced back in May that it expected supply issues to persevere throughout the second half of the year. This time around, it revealed it expects GPU supply constraints for the \u2018vast majority of 2022 as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#  Catalysts:\n\nData centers -- the computing units that form the backbone of cloud computing -- are also ramping up their use of GPUs, putting them to work as computing accelerators to handle complex workloads and applications like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNvidia has had a flurry of innovation on this front in recent years, unleashing a slew of new chips designed for these data center customers. It also made the acquisition of networking hardware company Mellanox early last year to bolster this emerging area of expertise. As a result, the data center segment hauled in $2.37 billion in sales in Q2 and has been steadily catching up to the gaming unit in size.\n\nFor comparison, when the cryptocurrency crash of 2018 sent Nvidia sliding backward (during Nvidia's fiscal 2019), data centers represented only about one-quarter of total revenue. They now account for more than one-third of the total.\n\nNvidia is only just getting started on this front, too. Some of its more recent hardware announcements for data centers haven't even begun to be commercialized yet. This is a huge segment of the semiconductor industry that has long been dominated by **Intel**. Tens of billions in annual sales are up for grabs if Nvidia's innovations can continue to steadily garner momentum.\u00a0\n\n# TLDR:\n\nFor the undergoing quarter, Nvidia expects $6.8 billion in revenue exceeding Refinitiv expectations of $6.5 billion. The company is in a period of sustained, massive growth in its business as semiconductors are in short supply across the globe while the demand for the kind of processors it specializes in is skyrocketing. Not surprisingly, over the last year, its shares are up over 57%. Granted, another uptick in cryptocurrency activity would help, but it isn't a primary catalyst for this chip designer. This is the best long-term semiconductor investment around, as it benefits from multiple secular growth trends in the global economy.",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone and thank you for your time. I come to you with a serious issue because the NASDAQ, SP500 and Dow 30 keep making record highs almost daily and many stocks are near 52 week lows. Many months ago maybe all the time pre March 2021 I used the 3 as indicators when I traded to cool down, stay on the sidelines or jump in a trade. Unfortunately for me, I do not trade SPY/VOO I know the SP is the most popular indicator but what can you look at when your watch lists have a sea of red and these 3 indexes are making new highs?\n\nI have also tried using the NASDAQ 100 which is cap weighted \\[Which means MSFT, AAPL, FB, GOOG, NVDA\\] mean so much more for this index, as they do on the SP..\n\nSo I ask is there a NASAQ 1000? I have also tried the Russell 1,000 and 2,000 and they can be green and my stocks red. Some of the stuff on the Nasdaq which I refer to \\[BCOV, COMP, CPNG, CRSR, GRPN, HIMS, KNBE, TIGR, PUBM\\] These are just some on my watch list near 52 week lows while the indexes mega caps, blue chips are making all time highs\u2026 to be honest other watch lists have a lot of red\u2026 but the blue chips are making highs\u2026\n\nI am sure maybe someone may have an ETF or mutual fund that may cover Nasdaq 500-2000?

        "selftext": "Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO were weak Monday after a fatal accident involving a NIO car with self-driving features.  \n\n\nThe fatal crash of a NIO ES8 sport-utility vehicle took place last week in China. The SUV is equipped with several driver assistance functions, including features enabled by Intel (ticker: INTC) division Mobileye, that enable some forms of autonomous driving. NIO\u2019s driver assistance functions are called NIO Pilot and employ cameras as the so-called eyes of the car.  \n\n\nNIO has other autonomous-driving technology, referred to as NAD, such as radar, lidar\u2014a laser-based radar\u2014and camera vision, as well as computing power provided partly by Nvidia (NVDA) to process all the data points coming at the car.  \n\n\nThe NAD features don\u2019t appear to be available on all NIO vehicles, including the ES8. All autonomous driving systems require the driver to pay attention to the road at all times.  \n\n\nNIO responded to a request for comment with a Weibo post in Chinese. The post indicates the company is cooperating with police regarding the investigation.  \n\n\nThe global automotive industry is still wrestling with regulatory and branding issues surrounding autonomous technology. Self-driving features, such as adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assistance, make driving safer as long as systems are used as intended. But drivers might rely too much on the features when systems are dubbed pilot or autopilot. Government safety regulators, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, are still drafting plans to prepare for the introduction of more advanced self-driving features.\n\nLink: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/nio-stock-price-self-driving-crash-51629118508](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nio-stock-price-self-driving-crash-51629118508)",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, August 20, 2021**\n\nStocks rose today, recovering some of the losses from earlier this week as market participants shake off some taper concerns. Market participants continue to weigh several factors affecting the market, including but not limited to (1) the taper timeline, (2) record-breaking corporate earnings, (3) and surging coronavirus delta variant infections. \n\nThe S&amp;P 500 (SPY) rose 0.79% today, recovering earlier losses, but finished the week 0.31% down. The Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.04% today and staged a remarkable comeback this week, coming from 2% down Thursday to finishing 0.01% higher. The Dow Jones (DIA) rose 0.65% today but finished the week 0.96% down, underperforming the other two major indexes. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, rose 1.68% today but finished the week 1.98% down.\n\nOn Wednesday, meeting minutes suggested members of the Federal Reserve were advancing the debate over the timing and scope of tapering the pace of the pandemic-era asset purchasing program. In the latest minutes, the Fed said, \u201clooking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.\u201dAs I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Fed\u2019s goal has not yet been reached. The meeting minutes said, \u201c most participants judged that the Committee\u2019s standard of \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met.\u201d \n\nIn order to stave off another \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d and directly address interest rates concerns, the minutes explicitly stressed the need to \u201creaffirm the absence of any mechanical link between the timing of tapering and that of an eventual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.\u201d Participants voted to maintain the interest rate near zero. I cannot stress this enough, potential interest rate hikes in 2023 will be the real test for equities. Until then I remain very bullish and will continue buying up every dip (has worked wonderfully so far). Of this, the meeting minutes said, \u201cA couple of participants also noted that a tapering of asset purchases did not amount to a tightening of the stance of monetary policy and instead only implied that additional monetary accommodation would be provided at a slower rate.\u201d\n\nRead the full meeting minutes here: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf)\n\nAs of yesterday, 91% of companies in the SPY have reported Q2 earnings, with 87% of these topping consensus estimates on earnings per share, according to data compiled by FactSet. The expected, year-over-year overall growth rate for the SPY currently stands at 89.3%, the fastest increase since the Q4 2009. David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said \u201cIn an earnings season with many surprises \u2013 including the highest frequency of EPS \\[earnings per share\\] beats in our 22-year data history \u2013 one of the most notable was the surge in corporate buyback activity. Strong corporate equity demand is one reason we forecast a 5% return to our SPY year-end target of $470\u201d\n\nThe U.S. now has an average of 143,827 new COVID-19 cases per day as of yesterday, a rate that has doubled in a little over two weeks, the number of hospitalized is at a six month high, and roughly 911 people are dying each day, triple the death rate seen in late July. For context, the US was averaging roughly 20,000 new cases per day on July 1.\n\nHowever, while this is definitely not good, it is important to mention that cases remain highly concentrated in areas of high vaccine hesitancy. According to John Hopkins University, almost \u2153 of all COVID hospitalizations in the US are in Texas or Florida. \n\nAccording to data analysis by the Associated Press using data through May 2021, shows that 98.9% of those hospitalized with COVID are unvaccinated (only 1,200 of 107,000 hospitalizations as of May 2021). Dr. Rochelle Wolensky, Director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said \u201cThere is a clear message that is coming through: This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The price of digital currencies surged after Coinbase (COIN) announced it was investing $500 million and would allocate 10% of quarterly profits into a digital currency portfolio. \n* Yesterday was Tesla AI Day, in which the company unveiled new technologies and ideas the company is working on. Among the most interesting was a humanoid robot that will be operated using Tesla\u2019s full-self driving technology (FSD). The robot is designed to do \u201cdangerous, repetitive, boring tasks\u201d according to Elon Musk. Interesting to say the least.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) boosted the price of Office 365 for the first time since the service was launched a decade ago. This caused the surge to spike to a new all-time high. The company said collaboration tools now used by more than 250 million monthly active users\n* After 70 years, the MLB dropped Topps as the creator of the iconic baseball cards. As a result, Topps merger into the market was terminated a day before shareholders were set to vote.\n* Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) continued beasting after smashing earnings and raising guidance moving forward. I love this stock so much\n* Shares of Alibaba (BABA) continue to bleed among the regulatory crackdown by the Chinese Communist Party. The stock is now way below even March 2020 level and is trading at the lowest level since June 2019.\n* Facebook (FB) unveiled a new product called \u201cHorizon Workrooms\u201d, which is a VR powered, remote work app that uses the company Oculus Rift headset. Zuckerberg called it the first step in building a \u201cmetaverse\u201d, which is a collectively-shared virtual space where people are able to interact using avatars. This seems like the next big trend among giant internet companies.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* AbbVie (ABBV) target raised by SVB Leerink from $145 to $148 at Outperform. Stock currently around $119\n* Applied Materials (AMAT) with two target raises. Stock currently around $127\n   * Mizuho from $158 to $161 at Buy\n   * Morgan Stanley from $139 to $150 at Equal-Weight\n* Invitation Homes (INVH) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $45 to $48.50 at Overweight. Stock currently around $40.50\n* Microsoft (MSFT) with two target raises. Stock currently around $304\n   * UBS Group from $325 to $350 at Buy\n   * Wedbush from $325 to $350 at Outperform\n* Peloton Interaction (PTON) target raised by MKM Partners from $110 to $130 at Buy. Stock currently around $108\n* Sherwin Williams (SHW) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $315 to $345 at Overweight. Stock currently around $307\n* Tapestry (TPR) target raised by Robert W Baird from $58 to $60 at Outperform. Stock currently around $40.50\n\n\u201cIn my view, the biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital. Not only is the mere drop in stock prices not a risk, but it is an opportunity. Where else do you look for cheap stocks?\u201d - Li Lu",

        "selftext": "Ive been wondering about this strategy, but I lack the experience to be able to really evaluate it, so I hope I can gain some insight here.  \nSo lets say you take a volatile stock or an etf that has a high return over the last 5 years. And then dedicate a fraction of your portfolio into atm/otm put options, for example a 100 put contract to cover for 40 shares, would you be over insured or could you actually use the leverage of the puts to make a windfall in a sudden bear market?   \n\n\nThe strategy that I am looking for would seek to cover all losses of 20% at any given point and make a windfall for losses of 40% or more. Im not exactly sure what the best percentage is to dedicate annually but lets say 5% as that is a conventional amount. This is not a lot and would not allow you to buy itm puts to cover your shares, also it would constitute significant drag and would require a performant underlying to ensure that on average years a decent return can still be made despite the cost.   \n\n\nI was playing around with a put option calculator noticed that buying more puts than shares held would result in a greater win if the market tanks due to the leverage. Also weeklies appear cheaper than longer term options as this continuous purchase strategy could try and eliminate premiums on theta and could therefore get better strikes. I am interested what you guys think about buying \"overprotection\" this way, say 50 stocks per 100 contract, 40 per 100 seems to be a bit sweeter even. Depending on market sentiment this ratio could be adjusted by buying or selling shares depending what direction is more anticipated.  \n\n\nFor example take $nvda at a price of 200, 40 shares cost 8000$. 5% insurance would be around 400$ annually. This would result in 7,69$ insurance per week or 8cents per option. 8 cents could buy a strike of 167.5 (right now). Buying this contract for the course of the week, would permit losses of up to 20% and then gradually reduce them due to the profit of the options until a potential maximum return of +100% is made if nvda goes all the way to 0 (and the 167.5 put goes to 16,750). This appears to me to be a really interesting strategy, but I am sure I am missing something because it seems too good to be true.   \n\n\nIs it because of coincidence that I found a good price strike combination (and could this work on \"the right\" picks) or will this always fail because puts just happen to be cheap right now and in times where these drops might happen put prices will have already increased to an unusable level? Also will weeklies work or is it better to buy more time? Also I thought about transaction costs, but that would be 1 contract per week, therefore about 52$ a year lets say, but maybe there are issues finding people selling weeklies every week. Is there anything else I am missing? Is there anything similar I could look into or any change you could recommend?  \n\n\nIn anyway thank you for your attention, I look forward to hearing from you and hope I can learn something from your insights and experiences.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, August 12, 2021**\n\nStocks largely finished higher, with all three major indexes managing to close out the day in the green. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) once again recorded fresh intraday highs.  The Nasdaq (QQQ) broke two consecutive red days and finished higher today. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed relative to the major indexes, closing the day 0.26% down. It seems a pattern has emerged in the last week or so, in which the market pulls back early in the morning before reversing to the upside. Market participants continue to weigh new economic data and corporate earnings with concerns around the coronavirus Delta variant and potential inflationary pressures. \n\nYesterday, The Labor Department reported Wednesday that its consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.4% in July from a year earlier, in line with June\u2019s figure and matching the largest jump since August 2008. The government said CPI increased 0.5% on a month-over-month basis, matching a consensus forecast from economists surveyed by Dow Jones.\n\nCore CPI which excludes energy and food, rose by 0.3% last month, shy of a forecasted 0.4% increase and well below June\u2019s rise of 0.9%. The core figure is up 4.3% over the last year, a slight deceleration from June\u2019s 4.5%. Economists often consider core CPI to be a more reliable indicator since it\u2019s insulated from the frequent swings in petroleum and food prices. It\u2019s encouraging to see prices slowly moderate as the economic recovery continues to mature and pent-up consumer demand is increasingly released. \n\nThe US Senate gave surprisingly bipartisan approval to a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads and bridges, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation\u2019s broadband infrastrucutre. The vote, 69-30, was uncommonly bipartisan given the seeming contention the Republicans had for the initial drafts of the infrastructure bill. President Biden said, \u201cThis historic investment in infrastructure is what I believe you, the American people, want, what you\u2019ve been asking for for a long, long time.\u201d Mitch McConnell, who earlier in the year publicly declared \u201c100% of my focus is on stopping this new administration\u201d said of the deal, \u201cI was proud to support today\u2019s historic  bipartisan infrastructure and prove that both sides of the political aisle can still come together around common-sense solutions.\u201d The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads and bridges, bolster public transportation, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation\u2019s broadband and 5G infrastrucutre.

        "selftext": "Hello Canadian Investors,\n\nI am looking for some advice here...\n\nBackground: \nI completed my undergrad back in 2017 and got a full time job to save money for grad school. Then I put most of that money in my TFSA. The Canadian TFSA was mostly weed stocks, and I didn't cash out during the weeks leading up to legalization. Live and learn. Today I'm down 40% on it, hoping one day it will come back up.\n\nNow, the good part. I also bought several American stocks, namely Tesla, Apple, Nvidia and lately Moderna and BioNTech. I just graduated from grad school and I'm already working in my field making 25$/hr, 70$/hr as of October. \nMy American TFSA is up 150% and if I sell everything I can pay off a student line of credit I got through my bank. \n\nHere's why I'm looking for advice: \n- Any interest from that sLOC isn't tax deductible because it isn't considered a student loan. \n- Interest rate on the LOC is 4%. Profit rate on the TFSA is higher than that for sure, but it's a gamble.\n- I haven't seen my American TFSA go above 155%, which is why I'm inclined to sell everything and reduce my student debt considerably. \n- I could hold and use the TFSA for a down payment on a house in a couple of years, and just pay my LOC with money that comes in through work. \n\n\nWhat is the most sensible thing to do here? \na. Sell it all/pay off debt/rebuild the TFSA as new money comes in.\nor\nb. Hold/pay off LOC as new money comes in? \n\nI know we can't predict the market, and I figured I could ask here in case there's something else I should consider before making a decision.\n\n\nThanks for reading and sorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile.",

Let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don\u2019t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn\u2019t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It\u2019s literally all just gambling, and as a result I\u2019m probably gonna sit this week out entirely. Pay little attention to the sample plays below, as I\u2019ve only included them for inspiration, and in case anyone sees something I may have missed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Selling $DNUT puts may prove to be profitable.** Although justified, Krispy Kreme has been on a downtrend since its IPO. $DNUT is literally hemorrhaging money and fundamentally the company is a terrible investment. A couple of years ago they actually went private after defrauding investors, doing shady audit practices, and literally using company money to buy back stores owned by family members of the executive board for FIVE TIMES what they were worth. More info on that [here.](https://www.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2009/03/three-krispy-kreme-ex-execs-settle-sec-charges/) Nowadays, the stock is priced as what it is - a fraudulent, cash burning business. Earnings is priced to fail, and as a result, any semblance of positive news will likely send us going upwards. If you have the balls, selling puts may prove to be profitable. The 15P is going for $0.80 giving you a breakeven of around 5.5%. You can even pickup pennies in front of the steamroller and sell the 12.5P for $0.05, giving you a breakeven of 17%. Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we\u2019re going up.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing. Options are pricing a 2% move, while historically Cisco moves around 5%. Given that prices remain the same or get cheaper by earnings, a strangle should net you some nice profits. If you\u2019re poor or want a binary directional play, I\u2019d look to buy puts. $CSCO is at ATHs so we\u2019re probably gonna do the classic \u201cdump after earnings regardless of the outcome\u201c thing that everyone seems to get tricked by. Regardless, at the time of writing, $CSCO strangles give us nice edge.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll that being said, there aren\u2019t many trades to run this time round! If I notice anything extra during this week, I\u2019ll look to keep you guys posted on my socials. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nAll in all, pretty awful week for trading. Most tickers are complete garbage, and there\u2019s little edge to be gained among those that aren\u2019t. No shame in sitting this one out! That being said, if you see any appealing plays I\u2019ve missed, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you\u2019d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**",

        "selftext": "I have 1000 shares of Nvidia at $202.16 I bought in July. I thought it was going down for a few months, so I sold 10 covered calls due in mid October for $11k with a strike price of $202.5. Now the price is at $226, and I would be positive $25k if I didn't have the covered call. If the price stays the same, I'm sure I'll get executed on and make the $11k covered call premium, and nothing else. \n\nHowever, if the big crash happens before mid October and Nvidia doesn't go up until 5 years from now, I will be very upset. I was considering buying back my covered call for a $16,000 loss, and then selling Nvidia for a $25,000 gain. This would get me out of the market in case of a crash or correction so I can capitalize on the dip.\n\nIf I do this, will it count as a wash sale, and I only owe  taxes on the $9k net profit, or will I owe taxes on the gross $25k profit? \n\nThanks,",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, August 25, 2021**\n\nStocks continued their momentum, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again reaching intraday record highs. It seems market participants have looked past the Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting minutes, which included language signaling that tapering may begin sooner rather than later, and continue to digest Q2 record-breaking earnings season and new developments coming out of Washington D.C. Looking ahead, market participants await Fed Chair Jerome Powell annual Jackson Hole speech, scheduled this Friday morning.\n\nThis earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking success. 91% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 87% of those outperforming estimates in revenue. The blended, year-over-year earnings growth rate is an eye-popping 85.1%, absolutely smashing original estimates of 66.5%. What is most remarkable is this comes among a resurgence of coronavirus cases due to the delta variant, supply-side disruptions, and labor market imbalances in the US. \n\nUS Crude oil prices continued gaining, building on advances after recently hitting a seven-day consecutive losing streak. West Texas intermediate crude oil rose by nearly 3% on Tuesday to settle at $67.54 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also gained to top $71 per barrel.\n\nEnergy prices gained as optimism mounted over a pick-up in consumer mobility following the full FDA approval of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine. U.S. crude oil prices have so far risen 39% for the year-to-date.\n\nYesterday, The House of Representatives voted to adopt a $3.5 trillion budget resolution, taking a major step toward enacting President Biden\u2019s ambitious economic agenda that calls for increased spending on education, health care and renewable energy. The 220-212 vote, which fell along partisan lines, was originally delayed after a group of moderate Democrats said they would not approve the budget until the infrastructure bill was voted on. \n\nFollowing the vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, \u201cPassing an infrastructure bill is always exciting for what it means in terms of jobs and commerce in our country.\u201d President Biden thanked every member of the House, saying, \u201cThere were differences. Strong points of view. They\u2019re always welcome. What\u2019s important is that we came together to advance our agenda.\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve's virtual Jackson Hole Symposium, which kicks off on Thursday. After last week's July Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes came off as more hawkish than many market participants were expecting, more clues on the path forward for monetary policy remain a key focal point. Namely, traders are looking to see whether central bank officials signal when they will announce and implement tapering of pandemic-era quantitative easing.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Mortgage applications unexpectedly rose, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Overall applications were up 1.6% during the week ended August 20, following a drop of 3.9% during the previous week. Home purchases led the advances, with these rising 3% week-on-week on a seasonally adjusted basis to reach the highest level since early July.\n* Western Digital (WDC) is in advanced talks to merge with Japanese semiconductor company Kioxia in a deal valued roughly $20 billion.\n* Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) continued absolutely beasting, which makes me so happy. As I have said before, NVDA is by far my favorite stock in the market.\n* President Joe Biden called cybersecurity a \"core national security challenge\" in a meeting with leaders from Silicon Valley, the water and energy sectors, the banking and insurance industries and academic institutions on Wednesday to discuss [shoring up the nation's cybersecurity.](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/12/politics/cybersecurity-executive-order/index.html) IMO cybersecurity stocks are a great place to look into for future value.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Advance Auto Parts (AAP) with a host of target raises. Average price target $240 at Outperform. Stock currently around $212\n* Affirm (AFRM) target raised by Bank of America from $71 to $82 at Buy. Stock currently around $72\n* Best Buy (BBY) with two target raises. Stock currently around $121\n   * Jefferies Financial from $136 to $145 at Buy\n   * Telsey Advisory Group from $140 to $150 at Outperform\n* Digital Realty Trust (DLR) target raised by Barclays from $177 to $178 at Overweight. Stock currently around $159\n* Intuit (INTU) with a host of target raises. Average price target $650 at Buy. Stock currently around $557\n* Marvell Technology (MRVL) target asied by Susquehanna from $64 to $72 at Positive. Stock currently around $63\n* Pinduoduo (PDD) target raised by Bank of America from $143 to $148 at Buy. Stock currently around $97\n\n\u201cIt is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it\u201d - Aristotle",

        "selftext": "Hey all, I\u2019m just some tech nerd who likes to dabble in investing and \"investing.\" However, there is a company that I\u2019m interacting with that, frankly, I\u2019m surprised hasn\u2019t blown up higher than they are. Figured I\u2019d share it on a much more popular place, because I think it deserves a little love.\u00a0\n\nAmbarella ($AMBA) is a somewhat small (3.4B market cap as of writing this) semiconductor company that seems to be very focused on creating the best computer vision processors out there. They also make really good, normal application processors that have fantastic video processing capabilities. I've gotten my hands on them a bit, not as much as I would like, but I see some promise in their new stuff and think they're undervalued.\u00a0\n\n# Competition:\n\nBasically if you think of AI vision processing you probably have the one behemoth in mind: Nvidia. How the hell is this company that's worth 1/200th of Nvidia going to compete? Well it comes down to architecture. Nvidia slams the same design from their top end A series card to their lowest end GPU, designed for hardcore parallel processing like you would expect a GPU to be. This works for sure, but it is inefficient for pure vision processing, compared to a purpose built processor. Ambarella can do stereoscopic vision processing in their highest end processor in a silicon die that's probably at least 5x smaller than Nvidia's highest end processor, at likely significantly less cost too. That's a big deal for both power efficiency, and pure cost.\u00a0\n\nAMBA is also one of two companies that has an AI vision and video processing API with AWS. I bet you can guess the other one. That's great for developers to get used to the ecosystem, and easy access to new talent that may be able to bring their employer in.\u00a0\n\nI am unaware of any other company that has nearly the level of ability in their processors for computer vision. With the constant increase of self driving startups out there, I can only imagine that AMBA playing at the top of the field alone will be huge, as not every single company can afford hundreds of millions to design their own silicon, like Tesla did after moving away from NVDA.\u00a0\n\n# Catalysts:\n\nAMBA is holding their earnings one week from now, August 31st. This will be the first earnings that they are going to have been working with ARVL and KeepTruckin. KeepTruckin handles 90,000 drivers in the US currently, and ARVL has at least 10k sales planned in the future. I\u2019ll let those people talk more about what\u2019s going on there, I\u2019m not up to date with the car manufacturer space and I\u2019m pretty sure that they were a meme stock at some point, so they\u2019ll probably go crazy talking about all their sales that I\u2019m hoping they get.\u00a0\n\nHaving more customers as a semiconductor company creating products on high end process nodes is *basically free* when you\u2019re running in lower quantities. Why? How? Well it just comes down to the massive non-recurring costs in semiconductor manufacturing. This is something the semiconductor people know well, but I\u2019ll give a rough outline for those of you not in the know. Manufacturing silicon on the most cutting edge nodes is insanely expensive, even if you\u2019re just wanting to produce one single die, you\u2019re spending tens, or hundreds of millions of dollars just to make the patterns to make your chip. For TSMC 7nm it\u2019s likely in the hundred to hundreds of millions of dollars that you have to spend once. Every single wafer you buy gets made with those patterns. Each wafer costs money of course, but each one pales in comparison to the amount you spend in the actual photomasks to make your chips.\n\nIf they end up selling more chips, the NR costs get spread out over more, allowing either more competitive pricing if they want, or just more profit. With what is probably 100k of their top end chip sales public, that's a big deal for AMBA as each of their chips costs probably ~$50 to make, and probably sells for significant multiples of that. They are also definitely selling many more than that in more low-end devices like security cameras and action cameras, but that's not the high end flashy cool tech so I'm not gonna bore everyone with that.\u00a0\n\n# Future: \n\nThis is more of a \"what I see and what I want\" kinda section. I'm very much an outsider, and it's very hard to get any word from the company, so everything here should be taken with a grain of salt. \n\nI can definitely see AMBA upping their software friendliness and taking a page out of Nvidia's book and making a Jetson competitor. As I said in the title, they're a very quiet company. I would have never heard about them had I not been working with building software for action cameras. Getting their products and software into the hands of real developers to create products with their chips, regardless of if they sell 100 or 100k would be good for sales directly, and massive for brand recognition. AMBA is competing directly with custom silicon, like what's in Tesla, Waymo in my opinion, and if they can get a good enough product that it's worth these big companies not spending hundreds of millions to make their own silicon and instead just using the CV2 processor or whatever comes next, that's be great. I'm seeing the same thing that happened way back in the 90s with companies that had their own custom processors just moving to Intel or AMD because it just didn't make sense to spend the money designing and building their own processor when they could just use someone else's. If AMBA could become the Intel or AMD of computer vision, that's be pretty huge. \n\n## Position and plan\n\nWhat am I planning on doing? Well, hodling my 100 shares. I\u2019m no rich man, and frankly although I think this earnings will be fantastic, good news isn\u2019t always correlated with good stock price. So dumb shares it is, no options or anything.\u00a0",

        "selftext": "I am sitting here preforming my nightly Tendies analysis of different stocks and I believe I have found the perfect storm.  I am entering into a position tomorrow.  The due diligence below is my personal opinion and is by no means financial advice. \n\nT (Technical Analysis): The ticker has clearly broken above the EMA and the 50 day moving average. The MA appears to be curling pretty quickly in the upward direction, along with a close at the average last Friday and a clear bounce upwards yesterday.  I believe that if we can break above the 14.80-15.00 range that the stock will be quickly headed towards 25.20 (ATH), if that happens to break then there is a good chance this continues to go parabolic.   To cap it off, all of this has occurred with MUCH higher than average volume, signaling that this is most likely a legit break out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nE (EV):  The EV space has been absolutely HOT recently.  Given the recent runs up for TSLA and the LCID IPO, there is a lot of attention in this sector for good reason.   With a very high barrier to entry in electric charging, MVST sits far ahead of its competition.  They are focused on fast charging, which is what is needed before the globe transitions to all electric vehicles.  In my opinion, it would be smart for Tesla to look into buying this company out to further their transition into a future energy business of the world.  Charging stations will replace all your local Shell gas stations in the future, mark my words. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nN (News): This one is pretty simple, the infrastructure bill  is expected to be passed any day now.  This bill may include up to 85 billion for the charging companies.  Putting this large number aside, it is a sign that further is to come in the future and that instead of credits towards cars specifically, there may be more money going towards the charging end.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nD (Downside): With pretty heavy support around $9 this represents a downside of approximately 30%.  However, with the electric industry bound to be over a trillion dollar industry (in my opinion), this represents a very high upside for both the short term and the long term.  If the stock does happen to reject at its all time highs, then this would still be a much better risk to return ratio.  Anyways, you really thing Microvast at a 4.1 billion dollar valuation is fair compared to Nikola who may potentially go bankrupt?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI (Innovation):  There is not much to say here.  Its fucking electric.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nE (Earnings): There is little word on earnings and I do not want to make any predictions that I cannot 100% confirm.  I know that there has been rumor about them releasing their earnings report very very soon and I bet this stock could run up on this rumor and into the eventual date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nS (Short Interest): The most recent short interest report I have seen shows the short interest to be around 9%, but some have rumored for it to be much higher.  With more and more interest in the stock, it is bound that some better numbers will start to come out soon.  I don't think the institutions want these numbers out, because they know what we will do.  Even putting short squeeze potential aside, this is an ACTUAL company with tons of growth ahead.  Remember when NVDA had market caps of 50 billion?  EV is the next round of innovation to come.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo with this info as you wish and do not make your decision based on me, I may be falling asleep as I write this.  I will see you all at market open.  Cheers and goodnight.",

In the past year, walmart and target started at close prices but target surged and did well executing. Do you guys think walmart could make a comeback of sorts and do well on earnings? Also, do you guys think target will continue their good work and do well? Nvidia? It's been doing well and it should be doing better than amd, which is doing great. And roblox, it's new but could it move on earnings? I wanna make some earnings plays this week let me know your guys thoughts! Thanks",

        "selftext": "Ok idiots listen up AMD is now headed to $269 before EOY.\n\nHere is why:\n1) Intel is getting pantsed by AMD\n2) NVDA is the benchmark stock for AMD to compare against\n3) XLNX merger closes in November (potentially earlier)\n\nFor you non nerds: Smart Intel engineers went to go to work for Facebook, Amazon, Google, Tesla. The idiots that remained screwed up massively over the last 2 years getting ready for the next generations of chips.\nSemiconductor manufacturing is complicated and takes 3 years to work out the kinks on the new technology. TSMC is good and Intel sucks. This will continue for 2-3 more years minimum.\n\n\n1.AMD revenue growth. Last week announced 99% yearly growth. Still room to grow after pulling down Intel\u2019s pants (10% market share for EPYC today, every cloud and enterprise customer is now validating EPYC).\n\n2. NVIDIA is run by the Elon Musk of the semiconductor industry. Jensen has been CEO longer than all the other semiconductor CEOs combined (Internet+Broadcom+Qualcomm+AMD+TSMC+AMD). NVDA earned their 94 p/e. Whose next? AMD\n\n3. Big players are arbitraging XLNX acquisition. Once this selling pressure disappears (presumably around merger closing) it\u2019s gonna rip.\n\nAt the end of this (rev growth, reduced selling pressure, P/E matching NVDA today) AMD will be at $269.",

        "selftext": "I am still very bullish on semiconductors and have been buying AMD (and later TSMC) for quite some time. After the recent run in AMD I sold a part of my position, figuring it might cool off and I could take some profits. While I was thinking about where I wanted to reinvest I started to think about Nvidia which became quite interesting after their recent split. I kinda also wanted ASML and finally did some DD on Intel (Intel could go either way). At this point I figured, I might as well just buy a semiconductor ETF and play it safe. Year to date TSMC and AMD were both outperformed by VanEck Vectors Semiconductor UCITS ETF (VVSM) anyway, so I would have made more if the same amount of cash would have gone in the ETF. The ETF has a 0.35% fee so I should keep that in mind. And yes, YTD NVIDIA and ASML were the better choice, but I've been in AMD a bit longer and TSMC might have been a bad choice (bought in february). \n\nI see three options next (10+ year investment horizon + DCA for these):\n\n1. Invest in TSMC, AMD, NVIDIA, ASML and let them ride. \n\n2. Play it safe and go for the ETF that consists of 10.8% NVIDIA, 10.5% ASML, 9.3% TSMC, 8.7% Intel, 6.11% AMD and a bunch of others (25 positions total) in the same sector. \n\n3 A bit more risk/reward: pick a potential winner and go all in with either NVIDIA, ASML or AMD. \n\nSo what would you do? And did you experience the same in another sector where your portfolio was basically becoming an ETF, what did you do?",

        "selftext": "\n\nSHANGHAI, Aug 3 (Reuters) - China's regulatory agency is launching an investigation into chip distributors in the auto industry, citing suspicions of price gouging, it said on Tuesday.\n\nThe action by the State Administration For Market Regulation (SAMR) is the latest in a regulatory crackdown following a range of companies and industries targeted over the past year as the Chinese government clamps down on industry.\n\n\"In response to prominent problems such as speculation and high prices in the automotive chip market, the State Administration of Market Supervision has recently filed an investigation on car chip distributors,\" the agency said.\n\nThe firms were suspected of driving up prices, based on price monitoring and reporting clues, it added in its statement, and vowed to investigate and punish illegal acts such as hoarding, price-gouging and collusion.\n\nA global shortage of chips that began last December has disrupted supply chains and the hardware sector worldwide. Though initially concentrated in the automotive sector, it has since spread to affect a wide range of gadgets.\n\nPanic about supply uncertainty has occasionally led chip buyers and distributors to purchase more chips than they need, creating a vicious cycle that further drives up prices.\n\nIn June, the chief executive of chipmaker Intel said he expected the shortage to hit bottom by year-end, with the market retuning to normalcy only by 2023.\n\nIn April China's regulator imposed a record fine of $2.75 billion on e-commerce giant Alibaba for engaging in anti-competitive practices.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/china-regulator-investigate-auto-chip-distributors-suspicion-price-gouging-2021-08-03/\n\n**Ok, this is getting a bit out of hand. A constant barrage of bearish news coming out of China after some stabilizing that happened at the end of last week. Not sure what the endgame here is for China or the CCP. On one hand, it makes no sense for them to lose the confidence of foreign investors with moves like this. Are they pushing the boundaries of patience of investors? Or is this a deliberate attempt to crackdown on each sector one by one?**\n\n*Stocks likely to be affected by this: AMD, INTC, QCOM, NVDA. If you know some others that are a part of the cars in China, please post them in the comments*",

        "selftext": "**Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation and Analysis (Q2 Week 6) - $RBLX, $NVDA, $WMT, $HD, $CSCO, $TGT, $LOW and More**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat\u2019s poppin\u2019 bull gang, Flux here with your weekly Historical Post Earnings Moves spreadsheet! Last weeks theme was selling options, and boy did we sell! **$APPS short strangles returned close to 100%, with $BIDU following closely behind netting around 80%. Meme stocks also had muted volatility. I sold an $AMC 34 strangle for $630, and although I closed early, I was given the opportunity to close it out at the end of the week for mere pennies on the dollar. Last but not least, a long strangle on $UPST would\u2019ve netted you a whopping 460% return!** Unfortunately for us, earnings season is slowly coming to a close, meaning the quality of our plays will be diminishing greatly! Those looking to trade this week should proceed with caution, as there isn\u2019t much of an edge to be gained this time round. If you wish to track my trades and try them out for yourself, feel free to check out the community links on my profile! Let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don\u2019t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn\u2019t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It\u2019s literally all just gambling, and as a result I\u2019m probably gonna sit this week out entirely. Pay little attention to the sample plays below, as I\u2019ve only included them for inspiration, and in case anyone sees something I may have missed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Selling $DNUT puts may prove to be profitable.** Although justified, Krispy Kreme has been on a downtrend since its IPO. $DNUT is literally hemorrhaging money and fundamentally the company is a terrible investment. A couple of years ago they actually went private after defrauding investors, doing shady audit practices, and literally using company money to buy back stores owned by family members of the executive board for FIVE TIMES what they were worth. More info on that [here.](https://www.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2009/03/three-krispy-kreme-ex-execs-settle-sec-charges/) Nowadays, the stock is priced as what it is - a fraudulent, cash burning business. Earnings is priced to fail, and as a result, any semblance of positive news will likely send us going upwards. If you have the balls, selling puts may prove to be profitable. The 15P is going for $0.80 giving you a breakeven of around 5.5%. You can even pickup pennies in front of the steamroller and sell the 12.5P for $0.05, giving you a breakeven of 17%. Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we\u2019re going up.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing. Options are pricing a 2% move, while historically Cisco moves around 5%. Given that prices remain the same or get cheaper by earnings, a strangle should net you some nice profits. If you\u2019re poor or want a binary directional play, I\u2019d look to buy puts. $CSCO is at ATHs so we\u2019re probably gonna do the classic \u201cdump after earnings regardless of the outcome\u201c thing that everyone seems to get tricked by. Regardless, at the time of writing, $CSCO strangles give us nice edge.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll that being said, there aren\u2019t many trades to run this time round! If I notice anything extra during this week, I\u2019ll look to keep you guys posted on my socials. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nAll in all, pretty awful week for trading. Most tickers are complete garbage, and there\u2019s little edge to be gained among those that aren\u2019t. No shame in sitting this one out! That being said, if you see any appealing plays I\u2019ve missed, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you\u2019d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**",

        "selftext": "W\ufffcith Apple\u2018s iPhone typical fall launch is fast approaching, details about the device\u2019s new capabilities have started to leak out.\n\nAs consumers and gadget fans pore over the tidbits for taste of what Apple\u2019s (ticker: AAPL) latest pocket computetr will have in store, chip investors too are scrutinizing the trickle of information. In a Tuesday report, Bloomberg News said the new Apple phones will feature new video and camera features, a faster Apple-designed chip to power the gadget, and new screen technology. Apple will keep the same iPhone dimensions and designs as last year\u2019s models, the report said.\n\nBased on the scarce available details, the exact makeup of the guts of the next line of iPhones is highly speculative at this point. But, investors know a few things already based on past designs and the bare-bones description. \n\nOne of the biggest changes in recent memory was the iPhone\u2019s adoption of 5G technology, requiring a batch of new chips to support the fast uplink speed. For many phones, including Apple\u2019s, that tended to mean much more silicon overall, which was good news for the chip makers that supply Apple with parts.\n\nFor the 5G modems themselves, the iPhone 12 contained chips made by Qualcomm (QCOM), which suggests it too will likely supply the iPhone\u2019s 5G wireless chip\u2014at least for now. Apple has reportedly launched its own effort to design wireless radios, so that may change in the future. The chip giant has made other chips for the iPhones such as power modules. \n\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) make radio-related iPhone components, too, and have both been historic suppliers. Broadcom (AVGO) also has made wireless chips and other iPhone components. Barclays chip analyst Blayne Curtis has staked Qorvo has his favorite of the batch of Apple suppliers he watches.\n\nFor the new camera, it\u2019s possible Texas Instruments (TXN) could play a role, as it has supplied the power-management chip for previous iterations of the iPhone camera. Its chips that help with battery-charging have also been spotted in past phones.\n\nMemory-wise, according to an iFixit teardown, the last iPhone used random access memory made by Micron Technology (MU). Micron has said the 5G upgrade cycle has benefited it because new generation phones typically carry more RAM than their 4G counterparts. The iPhone 12\u2019s flash storage was produced by closely held Kioxia Holdings, a Japanese memory maker that has been considering an initial public offering in recent months.\n\nWe know Apple is designing the chips that power its phones, and has for several generations, effectively cutting out Qualcomm from the processor part of iPhone revenue. Taiwan \nSemiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), has made the chip in the past, and it is all but certain to be making the latest iPhone processors.\n\nSource: Barron's\n\nSome of the semi stocks mentioned in this article are still worth to buy. qcom, tsm, mu, skws and qrvo are all trading between 20 to 30 pe. The revenue growth for these stocks are still attractive. With apple releasing the new iphones at September, these stocks will definitely benefit from the ongoing 5G trend.",

        "selftext": "Most investors have probably never heard of exosomes until Codiak\u2019s (NASDAQ: CDAK) chief exec, Doug Williams, made his pitch about this cool molecules at the JP Morgan conference two weeks ago. So for starters, let's define what is an exosome. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) of endosomal origin that range in size between 30 and 150nm. Exosomes are secreted by a wide range of cells, since virtually all living cells utilize exosome-mediated communication. Exosomes carry cell-specific cargos of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that are selectively taken up by recipient cells.  In essence, these are a critical building block of organic life and have a myriad of unexplored biopharma applications.  \n\nThe cargo contained within exosomes can offer information for a wide range of diseases, therefore exosomes can also act as prognostic indicators and predictors of a patient\u2019s response to a specific course of treatment.  Exosome-based diagnostics are minimally invasive, offering both ease-of-use and speed of detection. Numerous approaches are being researched for creating drug-loaded exosomes and they can exert powerful effects. For example, if a patient has a disease caused by a missing or defective protein or microRNA, the patient\u2019s exosomes can be isolated, modified with the appropriate siRNA or protein, and injected back into the patient for treatment.\n\nFor these reasons, exosomes have gone from being overlooked to rapidly gaining momentum as a novel strategy for accessing the therapeutic effects of cells without the risks and difficulties of administering cells to patients.  Exosome-related technologies have been developing rapidly over the past few years. Substantial growth is expected for the market as they get highly integrated into the elite healthcare fields such as liquid biopsy, precision medicine and regenerative medicine.\n\nWithin the past 5 years, there have been at least 7 major partnership deals within the exosome industry, 8 large venture capital events, and 2 landmark acquisitions.  Today, the exosome industry is witnessing rising numbers of clinicals trials investigating exosome therapeutics and diagnostics. Here are some listed companies taking exosome science to the next level:\n\n**Innocan Pharma (CSE: INNO) (FSE: IP4) (OTCQB: INNPF) Combining Exosomes &amp; CBD**\n\nInnocan Pharma, in collaboration with a Tel Aviv university team, is developing a revolutionary cell therapy - based technology, loaded with CBD (Cannabidiol), designed to target coronavirus infected lung cells and central nervous system diseases. Innocan\u2019s CLX Therapy holds the potential to provide a highly synergistic effect of anti-inflammatory properties and help in the recovery of infected lung cells. This product is planned to act as a \"guided missile\" to the infected lungs, combining the cell healing properties of exosomes and the anti-inflammatory properties of CBD.\n\nInnocan's CBD Loaded Exosome (CLX) Therapy project demonstrates the capability of having reliable large-scale production of exosomes and is an important milestone in the CLX Therapy development process. Innocan managed to produce trillions of exosomes in a short period of time in a 3-dimensional bioreactor, and that may lead to economic large-scale exosome production for the CLX. This achievement is expected to pave the way for larger tests and studies.  Combine its CLX program R&amp; with their established credentials as a cannabis/CBD powerhouse, and in a final evaluation this company holds a lot of long-term promise for making strong and early inroads into the exosome market.\n\n**Sarepta Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SRPT) and Codiak BioSciences (NASDAQ: CDAK)**\n\nOn June 22, 2020, Sarepta Therapeutics and Codiak BioSciences signed a global research and option agreement to design and develop engineered exosome therapeutics to deliver gene therapy, gene editing and RNA technologies for neuromuscular diseases. The engineered exosome approach offers the potential to effectively deliver genetic therapeutics without triggering the adaptive immune response. The two-year agreement includes up to five neuromuscular targets. Codiak is eligible to receive up to $72.5 million in upfront and near-term license payments plus research funding.  That equates to a lot of capital that, if invested wisely, can go back into research for the next generation of exosome studies and clinical trials.\n\n**Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: JAZZ) and Codiak BioSciences (NASDAQ: CDAK)**\n\nOn January 03, 2019, Jazz Pharmaceuticals and Codiak BioSciences signed a strategic collaboration agreement focused on the research, development and commercialization of exosome therapeutics to treat cancer. Codiak granted Jazz an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to develop, manufacture and commercialize therapeutic candidates directed at five targets to be developed using Codiak\u2019s engEx precision engineering platform for exosome therapeutics. The targets focus on oncogenes that have been well validated in hematological malignancies and solid tumors but have been undruggable with current modalities. Codiak received a $56 million upfront payment.\n\nIn sum, the companies explored above are all approaching the budding exosome industry from different angles.  Innocan\u2019s point-of-departure is CBD and its range of applications in the biomed/pharma sectors. Likewise, Codiak, Sarepta, and Jazz are all making powermoves to determine the efficacy of exosome therapies in diverse areas such as immune disorders and hematological malignancies.",
