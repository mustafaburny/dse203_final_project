I have 22 different holdings at the moment, and I feel like 12-18 is the ideal range to shoot for based on what I've seen around here and other sites. Thoughts on whether I should sell any of these to consolidate? Primarily long term investor (5-10 year+)\n\nAAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMD, ENPH, SEDG, FTNT, AMZN, CHGG, TTWO, CHE, ALXN, VEEV, VRTX, MDT, ISRG, COST, LULU, ADBE, BIIB, EQIX, TMO\n\nAlso have about 15% in a S&amp;P ETF\n\nI tried picking stocks primarily on strong balance sheets and financials. Any I should consolidate? Atm, I'm thinking to drop ALXN and maybe TTWO. Thanks!",

        "selftext": "I have bought mostly all of the companies I aimed to get. My goal is to hold long term (10-15 years) and push for capital appreciation. I\u2019m only 20 years old so have plenty of time to hold. \n\nMy portfolio consists of mainly blue chip companies with some other small gambles. I would like my last investment to be in a promising/strong stock so I\u2019ve narrowed it down to these :\n\nMicrosoft - Rock solid stock with a good dividend history but could lack the capital growth I might be after.\n\nDisney - Significantly below pre-Covid value but has a while to go before the parks/full revenue streams open up. Launch of D+ has been okay so far but Netflix is still the king of streaming.\n\nNvidia - Riskier stock but has a lot of potential with popular and strong products. Expensive though. \n\nFortinet - Key provider of cyber security and this area is only going to get more needed with all this tech. Again riskier though.\n\nAMD - Hear a lot about this possibly promising stock but is it all speculation? Could the bubble burst? \n\nI\u2019m open to any feedback, suggestions and criticism is encouraged!",
