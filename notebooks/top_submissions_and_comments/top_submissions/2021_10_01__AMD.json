        "selftext": "Do you know about AAPL, the original cult stock?\n\nWell, it\u2019s now the largest company in the world.\n\nThe AAPL cult is now not so vocal, because it has matured. \n\nDIS cult, Nintendo cult etc have made their companies huge players in their respective industries. Now they are just dormant.\n\nLet's come back to some present day cults. AMD, Valve(private company) and NVDA are the biggest pc gaming related cults that are out there. Go to r/pcmasterrace or other similar places, the cult vibe is relentless and unending. Their only position being: INTC and Epic(private company) bad. AMD, NVDA, Valve daddies good.\n\nAnd look at the stock price of AMD and NVDA!! They speak volume of the power of that cult!\n\nOf course, PTON the workout cult is also a good example to showcase this example or NKE.\n\nCult stocks generally have higher valuation relative to their peers or their valuation may even be nonsensical.\n\nI am kinda a AMD cult person(indoctrinated by the pcmasterrace cult), but let me demonstrate the valuation difference by comparing AMD and INTC.\n\nAMD has almost 73% market cap of INTC. This would indicate that ultimately AMD would have 73% of the free cash flow of INTC. Is that likely? Hell no.\ud83d\ude02\nINTC is much more diversified and has almost 6 times more revenue than AMD and even the most optimistic projections won't make that prediction.\n\nBut does that mean INTC will keep a larger market cap than AMD within 1 or 2 year? No, I think the opposite will happen, AMD will surpass INTC in market cap regardless of fundamentals.\n\nIt\u2019s supply and demand. Cult followers not just buy their product, but also the stock (I think).\n\nAlso, there are cults surrounding GME, AMC stocks and if those cults are long lasting, well, elevator valuation is highly likely.\n\n\nNow, let us talk about the current biggest cult of all. TSLA. Need I say anything?\nIf the cult is to be believed, TSLA will have 3 trillion in robotaxi, solar energy and other revenues within 2025 or something. \n(I am not saying you shouldn\u2019t buy TSLA, my whole post is about showing the power of cult)\n\nAs long as there is a cult which has buying power and buys the product+stock, the stock would reward one handsomely.\n\nWith all that prologue, I have recently started browsing some online discussion circles, and I think DWAC is a similar big cult in the making. They have a huge portion of the populace by the balls as potential customers and regardless of what their product is, if the cult has staying power (which I believe it does), the product would hardly matter.\n\nTL;DR: Invest in cult. Invest in DWAC and other similar cults.",

        "selftext": "Intel Reaffirms: Our Discrete GPUs Will Be On Shelves in Q1 2022\n\n&gt;there\u2019s one little tidbit in the earnings presentation about its upcoming new discrete GPU offerings. The earnings are usually a chance to wave the flag of innovation about what\u2019s to come, and this time around Intel is confirming that its first-generation discrete graphics with the Xe-HPG architecture will be on shelves in Q1 2022.\n\n&gt;The fundamental building block of Alchemist is the Xe Core. For manufacturing, Intel is turning to TSMC\u2019s N6 process to do it. Given Intel\u2019s Q1\u201922 release timeframe, Intel\u2019s Alchemist GPUs will almost certainly be the most advanced consumer GPUs on the market with respect to manufacturing technology. Alchemist will be going up against AMD\u2019s Navi 2x chips built on N7, and NVIDIA\u2019s Ampere GA10x chips built on Samsung 8LPP. That said, as AMD can attest to, there\u2019s more to being competitive in the consumer GPU market than just having a better process node. In conjunction with the use of TSMC\u2019s N6 process, Intel is reporting that they\u2019ve improved both their power efficiency (performance-per-watt) and their clockspeeds at a given voltage by 50% compared to Xe-LP. Note that this is the sum total of all of their improvements \u2013 process, logic, circuit, and architecture \u2013 so it\u2019s not clear how much of this comes from the jump to TSMC N6 from Intel 10SF, and how much comes from other optimizations.\n\n&gt;The Q1 launch window puts CES (held the first week of January) as a good spot to say something more.\n\n\n Source:\n\nhttps://www.anandtech.com/show/17026/intel-reaffirms-our-discrete-gpus-will-be-on-shelves-in-q1-2022",

This puts the Core i5 Alder Lake at a massive 50% lead over the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X and even faster than AMD's 8 core and 16 thread Ryzen 7 5800X which is very impressive. Versus the leaked Core i5-12400 benchmarks, the Core i5-12600K offers a 45% increase in multi-threaded performance which means that those E-cores are being used properly plus the higher clock speeds really push the performance even further. Even Intel's Rocket Lake flagship couldn't keep up with the new Core i5 chip which ends up 13% faster in single and 10% faster in the multi-core tests.\n\nThe Intel Core i5-12600K beats the Rocket Lake flagship, the Core i9-11900K, with ease and it shows that Intel is seriously going to give AMD a tough time in the mainstream segment if these numbers are to be believed. We are just a few weeks away from the NDA lift and the Core i5-12600K is going to be one chip that many consumers, especially gamers, are going to be interested in.",

        "selftext": " The **Semiconductor Sector** has generated more than just solid gains so far this year, chip shortage has helped accelerate sales of semiconductors, sending the stock prices of companies that design and sell chips skyrocketing.  \nIn the last couple of weeks, I thought about adding a Semiconductor company to my portfolio, I decided to focus on AMD, NVIDIA, and INTEL, but because it might be a long post I decided to post in parts, the next post will be bot AMD so stay tuned.\n\n**If you think there is a company in this sector more worthwhile looking into, I'd be happy to hear some suggestions.**\n\n[ IMAGE SOURCE: youtube - cha cha video](https://preview.redd.it/avit8vg2dgr71.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a7f6bd2f815eaffa877381a845b1f0061e66ccb)\n\n#  Nvidia ~ $NVDA\n\n&gt;\"Nvidia is a platform story. We think there are many tentacles of future growth opportunity for Nvidia inclusive of the data center momentum that they are seeing today\" - Wells Fargo analyst\n\nNvidia is a big winner of many of the big tech events of the past year, including the global chip shortage, cryptocurrency volatility, and mining, the relentless fight by PC gamers to find RTX 30 series graphics cards in stock, and rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers. During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021.\n\n# Q2 Earnings\n\nAlmost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue \u2014 all those RTX 30 series graphics cards \u2014 hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates.\n\n# Crypto Market dependence\n\nWhen of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company\u2019s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs.\n\nFor Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell **$400 million** worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just **$266 million.**\n\n# Future Growth In the Gaming Segment\n\nNVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates\u00a0that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. \n\n# Arm Deal\n\nNvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it.\n\n# Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD\n\nAMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record\u00a050% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance.\n\n[ IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech](https://preview.redd.it/faswa7u5dgr71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99fdf6382da174aa1c34fff4ffb72dab7abaa7f2)\n\n#  Q2 Earnings And Growth\n\nOn July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform \"Steam\" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded\u00a030%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market.\n\n[ AMD website - q2 Financial results](https://preview.redd.it/jjeh28b8dgr71.png?width=1041&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1194ec52ebd44ff97c9ae9686ff69f63d4787d4b)\n\n#  Video Games Potential Growth\n\nVideo game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from\u00a0last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected\u00a0to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected\u00a0to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024.\n\n**AMD** supplies\u00a0semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for **Nintendo**'s Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell\u00a025.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022.\n\n# Xilinx Acquisition\n\nAMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx\u00a0is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly.\n\n# Intel ~ $INTC\n\nIntel\u2019s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It\u2019s struggled with R&amp;D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%.\n\nIntel fell behind **TSMC** in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to **AMD** in PC and data center CPU markets.\n\n[ IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL](https://preview.redd.it/sxqjttladgr71.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b541cb7bc838e7c7ddb580196ebc1e085bedce22)\n\n#  New CEO = New Future?\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia.\n\nIf Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again.\n\n# GPUs War\n\nIntel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from **Nvidia** and **AMD**, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.\n\n# Financial Comparisons\n\n[Market Size](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/AMD:NVDA:INTC/advanced%20micro%20devices:intel:nvidia/Market%20Cap?ref=nvdastonkssubreddit)\n\n1.

Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***Personal note:*** *Feel free to diagree and express your opinion about the post.*\n\n**Sources:**  \n[Jika.io](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/AMD:NVDA:INTC/advanced%20micro%20devices:intel:nvidia/Revenue?ref=nvdastonkssubreddit) \\- Companies comparisons  \n[Motleyfool.com](https://motleyfool.com/) \\- stocks news  \n[nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com/) \\- news and information  \n[amd.com](https://amd.com/) \\- investor relations  \n[investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/) \\- investor relations",

Leaked reports, if true will be able to beat AMD at their respective price points. (Of course AMD can always just play price cuts. Additionally, AMD has already showed their new tech V Cache which can supposedly improve peformance by up to 15% over their existing 5k Ryzen series but those will come ETA 1st half 2022.) Intel is also going to release GPUs (which will probably be buggy since its the first time Intel is selling GPUs), but they \\*claim\\* they can fight with Nvidia's RTX 3070. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNew CEO May be good for intel. He was the ex VMWARE CEO and used to be an Intel employee before. Was mentored by Intel's founder. He tripled VMWare's revenue while he was their CEO from 2012-2021. Intel is also investing heavily into R&amp;D and making new foundries, which is in line with USA's national interest in not being overly reliant on an endangered Taiwan SMC in case China takes over it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImportantly, Intel just failed their Q3 earnings HORRIBLY (AS EXPECTED from SHITEL) and cut guidance. Their stock crashed from $56 last week to $48 today. The stock is partially beat down (though imo, i think it still could bleed out further. Will pick up more INTC if it drops more.) Expectations for this company has been reduced due to their poor performance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy buy these calls instead of the stock? Because there is almost no theta for these calls. $30 strike + $18.15 = $48.15 for a 2023 LEAP. And $40+$8.05 = $48.05 for a 3mths call. Stock is at $48.05 at time of posting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is a half decent chance that Intel can do a partial AMD. AMD was a loser that made inferior cpus for 10 years. Intel has been a loser for 2 years. Even being competitive with AMD is an upgrade from being a loser.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Intel has positive catalysts in new, competitive CPUs launching on Nov 4. CEO has changed and expectations for the company are reduced, which means it's easier to surprise people.",

        "selftext": "Hi, I have a few thoughts on intel and would like some discussion around it. I think it's a great long term value investment right now and would input. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Finances**\n\n- Market Cap: ~220b\n\n- P/E: ~12\n\n- 80b revenue\n\n- 2.58% dividend\n\n- P/E much lower than industry average, and much better than competitors (Intel @12, AMD @36)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Bear case arguments:**\n\n**Failure to deliver**\n\nThe biggest argument I hear against Intel, is that they have failed to deliver, again and again. That it's a value trap and is a slowly sinking ship. AMD is rapidly stealing market share. I will address these with bull points under growth &amp; management below.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Shrinking market share**\n\nTheir % market share has barely declined, yet the market is pricing them as if they had been decimated.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Using TSMC is giving up on its own fabs**\n\nI will address this below, it's actually super bullish for Intel long term and is great for transitioning to their new fabs (under construction).\n\nhttps://www.techradar.com/news/intel-locks-down-all-remaining-tsmc-3nm-production-capacity-boxing-out-amd-and-apple\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Please let me know others, which I will investigate.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Bull case arguments:**\n\n**Good products, high demand, too big to fail**\n\n- There is a global shortage for semiconductors at the moment. Demand is constantly increasing as basically all new devices utilize semiconductors in one way or another. As long as intel can keep building chips, there will be buyers.\n\n- Intel is 'too big to fail' in the USA. The US military and government rely on their chips. They need US factories and companies to build these chips. They are not going to design their military chips in Taiwan, especially with the increased global tensions. The US military alone will continue to prop up intel if things go south.\n\n- Intel still controls ~77.5% of the x86 market share.  \u200bhttps://www.extremetech.com/computing/325848-amd-x86-cpu-market-share-soars-hits-14-year-high\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Growth &amp; management**\n\nThe biggest argument I hear against intel, is that they have been unable to deliver, again and again. That it's a value trap. I argue that it was mainly an issue with management, of which they have a completely changed. It will be a non-issue moving forward.\n\n- Their next gen cpu's (alder lake) leaks suggest that they outperform amd 5950x in both single &amp; multithreaded benchmarks. We will know for sure in early nov (nov 4th, rumoured release date). If true, this hints towards a turnaround already starting and that they are resolving their issues. https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2021/09/27/new-benchmark-leak-reveals-impressive-performance-of-intels-12900k-12700k-and-12600k-alder-lake-processors/ \n\n\n- Intel has basically bought out all of TSMC's 3nm nodes (https://www.techspot.com/news/90780-intel-has-reportedly-secured-majority-tsmc-3nm-production.html). This is insanely good news for the long term outlook of Intel. At a high level, it appears that Intel is giving up on their own fabs and are on the decline. Looking deeper, I strongly disagree. Intel's previous CEO refused to use TSMC or anything beyond their own FABS to save face. They kept digging a deeper and deeper hole and falling further and further behind. Gelsinger (new CEO) acknowledges these issues, and is heavily investing (&gt;$120b) into new FABS, and using TSMC in the meantime to stay relevant, while transitioning to their new fabs.\n\n- Their new fabs are using ASML's next gen tech (ie: ASML's EUV chip-printing machines). Intel will get them before TSMC &amp; Samsung. There have been many closed door meeting between Gelsinger (intels new CEO) and ASML. https://fortune.com/2021/09/10/intel-ceo-big-honking-fab-planned-eu-europe-most-advanced/\n\n&gt; Thanks to an agreement the Intel CEO struck with his immediate counterpart at ASML, whom Gelsinger has already met three times face-to-face in the six months since taking the helm, the Intel facility should be the first to employ the Dutch company\u2019s upcoming \u201chigh numerical aperture\u201d EUV chip-printing machines. (ASML customers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., known as TSMC, and Samsung are on a waiting list, however.)\n\n&gt; This second generation evolution of ASML\u2019s extreme ultraviolet photolithography can reduce the size of transistors\u2014the building blocks of integrated semiconducting circuits\u2014to just 20 angstroms (\u00c5). That would make them less than a third in length of the current seven-nanometer nodes found in many of today\u2019s smartphones. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- Management changed. This is the biggest point for me. They booted out the bean counters, and replaced them with engineers. Gelsinger (new CEO) was the CTO of intel during their glory years and is known as being a super strong / smart engineer. In my opinion, an engineer leading intel is more likely to make the company succeed vs a finance guy trying to cut corners. He is credited with designing some of their flagship cpu's / architectures that made Intel relevant in the first place. He knows what has to be done.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger\n\n- Hopping into the GPU game. Intel is known for having a good integrated graphics team. I would think that they have enough experience to pull off the dedicated gpu. Time will tell. https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-claimed-to-be-officially-targeting-rtx-3070-performance-with-first-alchemist-gpu/\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat are your thoughts? \n\n*Yardsale2*",

        "selftext": "For all the AMD / Nvidia fanboys, tech specs are here. Cant just endlessly say Intel is terrible.\n\nhttps://wccftech.com/intel-core-i5-12600k-cpu-faster-than-ryzen-5-5600x-blows-away-rocket-lake-core-i9-11900k-leaked-benchmarks/\n\n&gt;The performance benchmarks show the Intel Core i5-12600K blasting up the single-core test with a score of 773 points and the multi-core test with 7220 points. This puts the Core i5 Alder Lake at a massive 50% lead over the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X and even faster than AMD's 8 core and 16 thread Ryzen 7 5800X which is very impressive. Versus the leaked Core i5-12400 benchmarks, the Core i5-12600K offers a 45% increase in multi-threaded performance which means that those E-cores are being used properly plus the higher clock speeds really push the performance even further. Even Intel's Rocket Lake flagship couldn't keep up with the new Core i5 chip which ends up 13% faster in single and 10% faster in the multi-core tests.\n\n&gt;Now think about it this way, you are essentially getting slightly better performance than the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, a $400 US+ chip, in a processor that costs $30 US lower than the Ryzen 5 5600X. It sounds like an absolutely phenomenal deal. Obviously, there are a few drawbacks which include investing in a brand new platform and migrating to a new OS platform (Windows 11 in this case) which would raise the cost and effort but if you set your mind aside from these short-term concerns, the Core i5-12600K could end up serving you far better performance at an insane value proposition. Furthermore, it is also stated that owing to the 12600K being segmented in the Core i5 lineup, its power consumption and thermals won't be as rampant as the high-end models.",

        "selftext": "Below is a list of what I consider possible bullish sectors/industries in the next 3-12 months. We all know of the supply chain issues, the semiconductor shortages, worker shortages, &amp; inflation issues. As a result I'm considering these sectors/industries as possible bullish options in the next 3-12 Months. Please understand that I know that I did not get all stocks in each category. So if you're favored stock isn't listed, don't get angry, post it in the comments below. And if you feel I missed a sector, please let me know. \n\n.\n\n**1)** **Inelastic &amp; Fairly inelastic Industries:** (*Meaning people usually pay for the good or service no matter what the price \"insensitive to changes in price or income\"*) \n\n* Pharmaceuticals (With highly used patented meds for diseases &amp; illnesses)\n* Oil/Gas/Natural Gas (No matter how scarce it gets, people will buy it)\n* Energy (Be careful, many producers of electricity are heavily regulated)\n\n**2) Agriculture/Farm Equipment/Fertilizers/Farm Chemicals:** People got to eat ... and have you seen the price of softs futures? This will incentivize farmers to produce more which in turn will require more farm equipment, farm construction, pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, seeds, chemicals etc. It does not help that food is rotting on the docks right now &amp; people are panic buying.\n\n* **Examples:** YTEN, TITN, NTR, SANW, DE, DOLE, ANDE, CLXT, ADM, CLXT, AGRO, AGCO, ADM, LMNR, TWI, ADM, BG, CALM, GRWG, HYFM, FMC, MEOH, \n\n**3) Semiconductors, Passive Semiconductors, &amp; Electronic Components:** Semiconductors are suffering due to worker shortages &amp; supply chain issues. However demand is seriously backed up. As soon as the supply chain situation gets straightened out expect semiconductors to explode.\n\n* **Examples:** NVDA, INTC, ARCB, AMKR, MU AMD, TXN, VSH, STM, ASYS, WOLF, TSM, QCOM, ON, ASML, NXP, AMAT, AVGO, LRCX, SWKS, MRVL, KLAC, MCHP, QRVO, SSNLF, DIOD\n\n**4) Shipping/Bulk Transportation/Freight/Transportation Services:** Shipping / Bulk Transportation / Freight / Transportation Services / are more in demand now than ever before in US history. In fact these services are in so much demand that they're clogging up the ports. And while ships sitting off the coast are likely loosing money as the supply chain issues worsen, you can bet they'll explode with business for pint up demand as the situation unwinds. \n\n* **Examples:** ZIM, JBHT, NSC, TNK, TGP, CNI, CMRE, REVG, DAC, SB, HTZZ, GRIN, ODFL, ASC, EDRY, XPO, SBLK, FWRD, BEST, CPLP, MATX, SAIA, INSW, GASS, PATI, PSHG, NETI, PXS, ULH, USDP, TFII, KNOP, KNX, CHRW, GLOP, EDRY, CVLG, PAC, HUBG, EDRY, MRTN, GLNG, NMM, HMLP, BEST, CPLP, DESP, HTLD, PWFL, GOGL, EGLE, SHIP, ZTO, LSTR, WERN, USAK, ESEA, GNK, CICOY, OROVY, PCFBY, CSX, DSX, MMLP,  PANL, KEX, NAT, UNP, WJRYY\n\n**5)** **Chemicals:** Agriculture chemicals, industrial chemicals, construction chemicals, drilling chemicals, textile chemicals, take your pick. The worlds manufacturers do not run without chemicals of some sort. And once supply chain issues are put behind us &amp; workers start to fill these empty job seats, you can bet that increased production will ramp up the demand for industrial chemicals. \n\n* **EXAMPLES:** HUN, OLN, DOW, LYB, EMN, GLTC, KRO, UNVR, CBT, MEOH, APD, OEC, VHI, ODC, TREC, TROX, IOSP, DD, KOP, ALB, LAC, PPG\n\n**6) Staffing Firms:** There's a massive worker shortage &amp; those positions will need to be filled. You can bet staffing firms are in high demand.\n\n* **EXAMPLES:** DLHC, CCRN, KFY, CBRE, HQI, RHI, WDAY, NSP, HSII, RGP, TBI, KFRC, \n\n**7) Inferior goods:** Ever notice how demand for some products go up when prices rise? These are generally inferior goods. Ramen Noodles &amp; Mac&amp;Cheese are a few examples. Dollar Stores are filled with inferior goods. \n\n* DG, DLTR, WMT, ROST, KHC",

Our free money glitch remained unpatched for another update, allowing many of us to pull clean double baggers across the board. God bless $SNAP. With all of big tech set to report this week, it could prove to be more lucrative than the last. We\u2019ve got a large variety of trades we can make this week ranging from educated gambles, to good old fashioned theta plays. We\u2019ve even have a couple of opportunities to sprinkle in some collateral plays if we wish! Let\u2019s get into it!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing) instead!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Jetblue is inefficiently priced.** Historically Jetblue moves roughly **4%** post earnings (inline with all the other American airlines),  yet this quarter, the options are pricing in a move of roughly **10%**. If we sell straddles or strangles, we can collect this extremely inflated premium with very little risk on our end. I looked into the entire sector as a whole since I planned on trading it last week, and I came across nothing that would\u2019ve fundamentally caused this spike in volatility in airlines, or Jetblue specifically. The odds are awesome on this trade, and I plan or robbing some gamblers next week. For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Twitter is inefficiently priced. Avoid it.** Historical move of **6.5%**, priced move of **11%** - on paper, this trade gives us insane edge, but I\u2019m still not touching it, as we saw what happened with $SNAP on Thursday. Although Twitter dropped 5% as the market tried to price $AAPL\u2019s privacy policy in, I don\u2019t feel like taking on additional risk because the fundamentals have shifted right before its\u2019 earnings. Normally I would take this trade 10/10 times simply from a pure numbers standpoint, but I\u2019m not as confident anymore because of the added volatility created by $SNAP. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Oil stocks tend to experience Post Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD).** PEAD is the phenomenon where a stocks price will drift in the direction of an earnings surprise for several weeks following an earnings announcement. If a stock beats, it will continue to grind up for weeks following the ER report, and vice versa if it misses. This is especially true among oil stocks - check the charts if you don\u2019t believe me. The best way to play oil this quarter would be to capitalize on this effect, and do **monthly** call or put debit spreads based on the results that come out Friday. To those curious, standard weekly options provide no edge at the time of writing, so it\u2019s best not to gamble this time round.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Collateral Plays are your friend!** If you\u2019re bullish on big tech, look to long $QQQ this week to alter your risk exposure and bag some safer gains. If you\u2019re bearish on oil, look to short $XLE instead of any of the individual companies for an added safety net. If you think $AMD is gonna knock it out of the park, look to play $NVDA or $SOXL instead. There\u2019s lot\u2019s of opportunities for collateral plays this week, and I\u2019ve just barely scratched the surface. If you wish to learn more about collateral plays, refer to [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nWe've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!  If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you\u2019d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**",

        "selftext": "19yo who has experience investing in index funds but never really bought individual stocks will be attempting to invest into the following companies for long term growth (20-30+ years) over the course of next week.\n\nStocks I am eyeing right now: \n- Snap\n- FB\n- GOOGL\n- AMZN\n- AAPL\n- TSM\n\nRecently dipped:\n- Snap: I am optimistic that they will find a work around to Apple\u2019s new policies. The 26% dip is just too tempting (someone PLEASE talk me out of this).\n- FB: Dropping, and am confident that it will drop more after they release their earnings report tomorrow. Strong company that I know will recover long term.\n- Googl: Been growing steadily this whole year until recent Apple policies, optimistic that they will dip after earnings report is released and then bounce back.\n\nStrong stocks:\n- Amazon: Been sideways this whole year. Will buy a few shares if they dip below $3.2k, which I hope they will post earnings report.\n- AAPL: Again, hoping for a dip after they release their earnings report (historically they\u2019ve seen a dip post earnings report). Will buy once it hits low $140s\n- TSM: Recently gaining the interest of large companies such as AMD and invidia. Apple proved to us from M1 and now their M1 Pro/Max chips that TSM keeps up to their word and is able to supply tech giants even in chip shortages. TSM will start to replace intel in the coming years, as evident first by Apple.",

I noticed this article after reading in the other intel thread that someone claimed that apple was ahead of intel, so I googled it and found this:\n\n&gt;So we have something very interesting for our readers today.

        "selftext": "AMDs stock has been a hot commodity these last few months with great earnings, even better guidance, and a strong likelihood that their acquisition of Xilinx will be completed by the end of the calendar year. So why should you sell AMD short? I'll tell you why:\n\n* The acquisition deal states that Xilinx shareholders will receive 1.7234 shares of AMD for each share they own. At close today AMD's shareprice was 116.33 and Xilinx was at 170.24. In order for the share prices to be effectively equal at the time of acquisition AMDs shareprice would have to drop to 98.78, or a bit more than 15% lower than the current share price.\n\n* Most shareholders are assuming the acquisition will be successful, and the anticipation of the merger's completion is artifically inflating the stock despite the fact the merger will have no immediate financial gain, especially since short sellers have been unable to properly arbitrate AMD/XLNX shares.\n\n* The chip shortage is not ending soon. It seems like every time I look it is expected to end later than before. Last estimate I heard was June. That's a long time for AMDs sales to remain below what they have the potential to be.\n\n* Finally and most importantly, you should sell AMD short because recent stocks have been doing the opposite of what WSB sentiment and positions currently are, and if you retards help AMD to rocket then that would really help my calls.\n\nPositions: 3 11/19 100C, 2 6/17/22 90C",

        "selftext": "Intel is set to report fiscal third-quarter results after the market closes on Thursday. Analysts are already looking beyond the report. Intel shares (ticker: INTC) are up 11% year-to-date but have fallen about 12% in the past six months. The stock closed up 0.2% to $55.37 on Wednesday. For the third quarter, analysts expect adjusted earnings of $1.11 a share and sales of $18.23 billion, according to FactSet. \n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore wrote earlier this week that the stock has underperformed since June amid concerns about Advanced Micro Devices winning market share, manufacturing delays, and Apple pivoting from Intel to its own M1 line of chips for Macbooks. \n\nFor the third quarter, Moore expects the PC market will be weaker than usual due to broader supply constraints for things like power management chips, which have held back the overall PC business despite solid demand. Still, he thinks such trends are already baked into estimates. Instead, he thinks investors are more focused on the company\u2019s Nov. 18 analyst day. At that event, he expects the company to address several key debates regarding 2022, including gross margin pressures. Moore predicts gross margins will be more stable than some pessimists anticipate. \u201cBut we would also argue that if there is anything from the analyst meeting that investors could see as a negative, on gross margin, on capital spending, or on product timing, the company should try to get that negative color out on thisearnings call, as we don\u2019t think the company is going to want the stock to potentially sell off on the day of the analyst day,\u201d Moore wrote.\n\nMoore rates Intel stock Overweight with a $67 price target. He wrote that Pat Gelsinger, who was previously VMWare\u2019s chief executive, becoming Intel\u2019s CEO earlier this year was among the best case scenarios for that role. \u201cWhile we don\u2019t see the new CEO as a quick fix, we do see the company creating a multi year path back to a stronger market position,\u201d Moore wrote.\n\nSusquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland, who has a Neutral rating and $60 price target, wrote Wednesday that while he doesn\u2019t expect a formal 2022 guidance yet, the narrative around the next year will be very important for investors. \u201cDemand for education/low-end PCs and Chromebooks will be of particular importance, an area that slowed considerably in 3Q, and one in which Intel holds dominant share today,\u201d Rolland wrote. He ultimately expects the company to beat expectations for the third quarter. Still, he\u2019s more focused on the risks heading into the fourth quarter and beyond amid concerns about declining PC demand backdrop and the potential for worsening margins.\n\n\u201cNote that just a few days later on October 27, Intel will also host an event to showcase its latest technologies and perhaps launch new products,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTherefore, investors should prepare for potential increased volatility around these dual announcements.\u201d\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/intel-reports-earnings-thursday-what-to-expect-51634774690?mod=mw\\_latestnews](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/intel-reports-earnings-thursday-what-to-expect-51634774690?mod=mw_latestnews)",

So if you're favored stock isn't listed, don't get angry, post it in the comments below. And if you feel I missed a sector, please let me know.\n\n.\n\n**1)** **Inelastic &amp; Fairly inelastic Industries:** (*Meaning people usually pay for the good or service no matter what the price \"insensitive to changes in price or income\"*)\n\n* Pharmaceuticals (With highly used patented meds for diseases &amp; illnesses)\n* Oil/Gas/Natural Gas (No matter how scarce it gets, people will buy it)\n* Energy (Be careful, many producers of electricity are heavily regulated)\n\n**2) Agriculture/Farm Equipment/Fertilizers/Farm Chemicals:** People got to eat ... and have you seen the price of softs futures? This will incentivize farmers to produce more which in turn will require more farm equipment, farm construction, pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, seeds, chemicals etc. It does not help that food is rotting on the docks right now &amp; people are panic buying.\n\n* **Examples:** YTEN, TITN, NTR, SANW, DE, DOLE, ANDE, CLXT, ADM, CLXT, AGRO, AGCO, ADM, LMNR, TWI, ADM, BG, CALM, GRWG, HYFM, FMC, MEOH,\n\n**3) Semiconductors, Passive Semiconductors, &amp; Electronic Components:** Semiconductors are suffering due to worker shortages &amp; supply chain issues. However demand is seriously backed up. As soon as the supply chain situation gets straightened out expect semiconductors to explode.\n\n* **Examples:** NVDA, INTC, ARCB, AMKR, MU AMD, TXN, VSH, STM, ASYS, WOLF, TSM, QCOM, ON, ASML, NXP, AMAT, AVGO, LRCX, SWKS, MRVL, KLAC, MCHP, QRVO, SSNLF, DIOD\n\n**4) Shipping/Bulk Transportation/Freight/Transportation Services:** Shipping / Bulk Transportation / Freight / Transportation Services / are more in demand now than ever before in US history. In fact these services are in so much demand that they're clogging up the ports. And while ships sitting off the coast are likely loosing money as the supply chain issues worsen, you can bet they'll explode with business for pint up demand as the situation unwinds.\n\n* **Examples:** ZIM, JBHT, NSC, TNK, TGP, CNI, CMRE, REVG, DAC, SB, HTZZ, GRIN, ODFL, ASC, EDRY, XPO, SBLK, FWRD, BEST, CPLP, MATX, SAIA, INSW, GASS, PATI, PSHG, NETI, PXS, ULH, USDP, TFII, KNOP, KNX, CHRW, GLOP, EDRY, CVLG, PAC, HUBG, EDRY, MRTN, GLNG, NMM, HMLP, BEST, CPLP, DESP, HTLD, PWFL, GOGL, EGLE, SHIP, ZTO, LSTR, WERN, USAK, ESEA, GNK, CICOY, OROVY, PCFBY, CSX, DSX, MMLP,  PANL, KEX, NAT, UNP, WJRYY\n\n**5)** **Chemicals:** Agriculture chemicals, industrial chemicals, construction chemicals, drilling chemicals, textile chemicals, take your pick. The worlds manufacturers do not run without chemicals of some sort. And once supply chain issues are put behind us &amp; workers start to fill these empty job seats, you can bet that increased production will ramp up the demand for industrial chemicals.\n\n* **EXAMPLES:** HUN, OLN, DOW, LYB, EMN, GLTC, KRO, UNVR, CBT, MEOH, APD, OEC, VHI, ODC, TREC, TROX, IOSP, DD, KOP, ALB, LAC, PPG\n\n**6) Staffing Firms:** There's a massive worker shortage &amp; those positions will need to be filled. You can bet staffing firms are in high demand.\n\n* **EXAMPLES:** DLHC, CCRN, KFY, CBRE, HQI, RHI, WDAY, NSP, HSII, RGP, TBI, KFRC,\n\n**7) Inferior goods:** Ever notice how demand for some products go up when prices rise? These are generally inferior goods. Ramen Noodles &amp; Mac&amp;Cheese are a few examples. Dollar Stores are filled with inferior goods.\n\n* DG, DLTR, WMT, ROST, KHC",

        "selftext": "I feel like almost everyone in r/amd_stock could have told you this, but here we go.\n\n**TDLR:** Merger incoming. Possible profit by purchasing Xilinx shares instead of AMD. \n\n---\n\n10/27/2020 Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) announces merger with Xilinx ($XLNX). \n\n[AMD Press Release 10.27.20](https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2020-10-27-amd-to-acquire-xilinx-creating-the-industry-s-high-performance-computing)\n\n[SEC registration 03.12.20] (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000119312520309831/d83168ds4.htm#rom83168_8) \n\n######**About AMD**\n\nFor more than 50 years AMD has driven innovation in high performance computing, graphics and visualization technologies \u2015 the building blocks for gaming, immersive platforms and the data center. Hundreds of millions of consumers, leading Fortune 500 businesses and cutting-edge scientific research facilities around the world rely on AMD technology daily to improve how they live, work and play. AMD employees around the world are focused on building great products that push the boundaries of what is possible. \n\n######**About Xilinx**\n\nXilinx develops highly flexible and adaptive processing platforms that enable rapid innovation across a variety of technologies - from the cloud to the edge and to the endpoint. Xilinx is the inventor of the FPGA and Adaptive SoCs, designed to deliver the most dynamic processor technology in the industry. We partner with our customers to create scalable, differentiated and intelligent solutions to enable the adaptable, intelligent and connected world of the future.\n\n\n######**Regulatory approval**\n\n_________________\nUS: Approved\n_________________\n\nUK: Approved\n_________________\n\nEU: Approved\n_________________\nChina: Processing. Predicted to be finalized by the end of 2021.\n_________________\n\n\n\n#**Status at market close (10.07.21)**\n\nXilinx price: $158,07\n\nAMD price: $106,45\n\nAgreed share ratio: \nXilinx x1 = 1,7234x AMD\n\nCurrent share ratio: 158,07/106,45 = 1,4849\n\n1,7234/1,4849 = 1,1606 --&gt; 16,06%\nhttps://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio\n\n**My thoughts:** \n\nXilinx is currently valued higher than the share ratio by 16%. The ratio has been in the 10-15% area since the merger announcement. This means that by purchasing Xilinx shares at 158$, you\u2019re essentially buying AMD at a discount. **($91,72 vs $107,45 /ea share)** \n\n#Possible outcomes:\n\n- AMD drops in value until the price is equal AMD*1,7234 = Xilinx stock value\n\n- Xilinx rises until its value is Xilinx/1,7234 = AMD stock value\n\n- Market crash. Both stocks fall in value, but AMD will have a greater negative than Xilinx\n\n- Merger is rejected. \n\n- If the merger agreement is terminated under other specified circumstances, including the failure to receive certain required regulatory approvals, AMD may be required to pay Xilinx a termination fee of $1.0 billion. If the merger agreement is terminated under other specified circumstances, including if the AMD board of directors changes its recommendation, AMD may be required to pay Xilinx a termination fee of $1.5 billion. (Copied from the SEC doc.)\n\n- AMD drops? Xilinx drops? Idk how this\u2019ll play out. \n\n-\tBoth Stocks rise in value. Xilinx more than AMD. \n\n\n \n \n\n\n**Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Most of my portfolio consists of Xilinx shares. I sold my AMD shares at 114$ as I thought the only way forward was for the ratio to even out.** \n\n\nStock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, changes in AMD\u2019s or Xilinx\u2019s respective businesses, operations and prospects, the uncertainty as to the extent of the duration, scope and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, market assessments of the likelihood that the merger will be completed, interest rates, general market, industry and economic conditions and other factors generally affecting the respective prices of AMD and Xilinx common stock, federal, state and local legislation, governmental regulation and legal developments in the industry segments in which AMD and Xilinx operate, and the timing of the merger and receipt of required regulatory approvals.",

Leaked reports, if true will be able to beat AMD at their respective price points. (Of course AMD can always just play price cuts. Additionally, AMD has already showed their new tech V Cache which can supposedly improve peformance by up to 15% over their existing 5k Ryzen series but those will come ETA 1st half 2022.) Intel is also going to release GPUs (which will probably be buggy since its the first time Intel is selling GPUs), but they \\*claim\\* they can fight with Nvidia's RTX 3070. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNew CEO May be good for intel. He was the ex VMWARE CEO and used to be an Intel employee before. Was mentored by Intel's founder. He tripled VMWare's revenue while he was their CEO from 2012-2021. Intel is also investing heavily into R&amp;D and making new foundries, which is in line with USA's national interest in not being overly reliant on an endangered Taiwan SMC in case China takes over it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImportantly, Intel just failed their Q3 earnings HORRIBLY (AS EXPECTED from SHITEL) and cut guidance. Their stock crashed from $56 last week to $48 today. The stock is partially beat down (though imo, i think it still could bleed out further. Will pick up more INTC if it drops more.) Expectations for this company has been reduced due to their poor performance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy buy these calls instead of the stock? Because there is almost no theta for these calls. $30 strike + $18.15 = $48.15 for a 2023 LEAP. And $40+$8.05 = $48.05 for a 3mths call. Stock is at $48.05 at time of posting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is a half decent chance that Intel can do a partial AMD. AMD was a loser that made inferior cpus for 10 years. Intel has been a loser for 2 years. Even being competitive with AMD is an upgrade from being a loser.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Intel has positive catalysts in new, competitive CPUs launching on Nov 4. CEO has changed and expectations for the company are reduced, which means it's easier to surprise people.",

I\u2019ve been buying and reinvesting my earnings back into index funds for a year and now that I feel more comfortable with the market, I want go get into stocks. I was hoping if you all could guide me into sorting out my portfolio with short term, mid term, long term stock picks. \n\nAlso, as you will see the majority of my stock picks are from the tech industry. Any suggestions on how I could diversify?\n\n\nShort term: Don\u2019t really know any good short term stocks. Really need help here on the time intervals of buying and selling short term stocks.\n\n\nMid/long term: Please advise,\n\nBuying soon:\n- AMD: With their TSMC and hopefully soon Xilinx buy, I hope AMD kills the chip market now that Tesla, Microsoft, Sony, and Google are starting to use their chips for cloud computing, gaming, self driving/AI etc. Elon also states that the chip shortage is a short term issue.\n\n- Apple: Killing the consumer technology.  MacOS with ARM and the whole Apple ecosystem is slowly going to kill Windows. As a college student, everyone has a MacBook, iPhone, AirPods. And a lot of people wear Apple Watches and are using iPads over notebooks for note taking. I highly doubt all of these people will switch over to Windows after graduating.\n\n- FB: FB knows about the amount of hate they have. They are taking steps to mitigate this, seen primarily by its rebrand. The Metaverse concept is very interesting and I\u2019m excited to see how it will pan out, especially with collaboration on work, etc. FB has all of the tools it needs for creating the Metaverse: VR, Users, and the cash flow.\n\nOn the fence:\n- PLTR: Idk if this company is a meme or not, but the governments been liking them a lot. Curious to see how they will grow with Foundry and targeting corporations.\n\n- TSMC: Again, these people are killing it and have tech giants contracting with them, yet the stock has been sideways this entire year\u2026 can anyone explain this?\n\n- ASML: Lots of room to grow, especially with their monopoly on chip production processes. Yet lots of analysts are saying that this stock is overvalued, how?\n\n- Google: Waiting on dip to buy \u2014 strong earnings and good future with cloud computing.\n\n- Costco: Need to do more research, but I love Kirkland products (sometimes more than the brand name)\ud83d\ude02\n\n- Amazon: Terrible earnings report, not good Q4 expectations. Supply chain and labor issues. Sideways this whole year as the pandemic slowly dies off. Not really feeling amazon.",

        "selftext": "There has been a lot of developments in [$AMD \u2013 Advanced Micro Devices stock](https://utradea.com/positions/AMD-Stock-Investment-Update-and-Earnings-Prediction), since I last covered them on June 21st. My previous coverage was my initial coverage of their company, and gives an outline of their whole company, financials, and other important information, which can be found [here](https://utradea.com/positions/AMD-is-a-fantastic-investment-idea). However, this analysis is not going to repeat this, rather it is designed to update you with recent news, events, and SEC filings to stay up to date on AMD\u2019s stock.\n\n**SEC Filings:**\n\nRecently, there have only been 2 noteworthy SEC filings, which are:\n\n*Current Report (8-K):*\n\nOn October 26, 2020. AMD entered into a merger plan with Xilinx Inc., making Xilinx a subsidiary of AMD. This merger proposal was officially passed by the UK Competition and Markets Authority on June 29th, making Xilinx an official subsidiary of AMD.\n\n*Quarterly Report (10-Q):*\n\nOn July 27th 2021, AMD released their Q2 2021 financial results. Overall AMD beat their earnings estimates by over 16%, and they raised their guidance. Both of these factors are bullish and assisted in AMD closing 7.5% higher on the trading day following this earnings release.\n\nThe most important factors from this report were that AMD increased revenues 100% YoY (12% QoQ), increased their gross margin by 4 percentage points YoY (2 percentage points QoQ), had a massive increase in their operating incomes and net incomes both YoY and QoQ, and lastly, they announces a $4B share repurchase program.\n\n**Recent News:**\n\n*Windows 11 Updates:*\n\nRecently, Windows 11 has released an update which has slowed the performance of AMD\u2019s CPU\u2019s. AMD is looking into their slower performance with this update and said that they are aiming to fix this problem by the end of the month (October 31st 2021). However, if these problems persist, many people may switch over to another brand of CPU\u2019s (ie. Intel). This will not only cost AMD revenues, but it will be giving those revenues to AMD\u2019s direct competitors.\n\n*AMD Stock Performance:*\n\nOverall, AMD has performed very well since my coverage and is up nearly 50% since my post. There have been a lot of catalysts over this time frame that have led AMD to have sustained such large growth over the past 4 months. Firstly, AMD beat earnings and raised their guidance, which immediately boosted the stock 7.5%. Furthermore, AMD has gained partnerships with elite companies including Tesla and Google.\n\nQ3 2021 Earnings:\n\nAMD is reporting their earnings today (October 26, 2021) after market close. This is sure to be a catalyst for movement in their stock. In the next section I will give my earnings estimate and how I would play it.\n\n**Earnings Estimate:**\n\nI am trying to get this out quickly, so I do not have time to take you through my reasoning for my earnings predictions.\n\n*Revenues:*\n\nI think that AMD will report quarterly revenues of $4.4B, which is 7% higher than AMD guidance suggested, and 7% higher than the average analyst earnings estimate of $4.12B. I think that the growth in their revenues will be the cause of a large growth in their data center revenues.\n\n*EPS:*\n\nI believe that AMD\u2019s EPS (based on my revenue projection) will be $0.72/share, which would indicate an earnings beat of 7.5%.\n\nOverall, I think that AMD is going to beat earnings, but by a relatively small margin. However, it is difficult to predict how the market will react to this. As a result of this, I am taking a more neutral and safe approach through a bull call spread of 126/132. This would cap your losses at $174/bull call spread, and yield a max gain of $426/bull-call spread.",

Anyway, here's the TLDR version of the meat and potatoes of that info.

(NASDAQ:TRVN)|October 9, 2021 |\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What To Watch With $ABUS Stock This Week**\n\nThis week there are a few things to follow with Arbutus. The first comes on October 5th. The company presents at its first of 2 planned conferences. Arbutus will participate in a fireside chat at the Chardan Genetic Medicines Conference starting at 4:30 PM ET.\n\nLater on this week, things could also put ABUS stock in focus. On October 7, the United States Court Of Appeals For The Federal Circuit will [hear arguments](http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/arguments/PublicCalendar-October2021.pdf) from Arbutus and Moderna. So if ABUS stock or MRNA, for that matter, is on your list this week, keep this date in mind.\n\n**What To Watch With $KLDO Stock This Week**\n\nThis week, the market could get a bit more clarity on where all of Kaleido\u2019s treatments stand. On October 5, the company hosts an R&amp;D presentation to discuss clinical data and pipeline advancement. The agenda includes corporate strategy, data from its non-IND study evaluating KB295, and preclinical data supporting the advancement of KB109 in COPD patients.\n\n**What To Watch With $MNKD Stock This Week**\n\nThis week and this month could be important for MannKind. First, on October 5, the company participates at the Lytham Partners Fall Investor Conference. CEO Michael Castagna, PharmD, will discuss different facets of the company.\n\nIn addition, while a specific date wasn\u2019t given, a September update discussed that FDA action on a New Drug Application (NDA) for Tyvaso DPI is expected this month. This comes after United Therapeutics submitted an NDA to the FDA seeking approval of Tyvaso DPI for treating adult patients with PAH and PH-ILD.\n\n**What To Watch With $ADVM Stock This Week**\n\nThis week, October 9th, will be the date to focus on. This is when the company delivers its Phase 2 Data on ADVM-022. Following this presentation, Adverum will also give results from its Phase 1 OPTIC Trial in neovascular AMD treated with ADVM-022. These won\u2019t come until early next week at the ASRS Scientific Meeting (which we\u2019ll update next week).\n\n**What To Watch With $TRVN Stock This Week**\n\nThis week, Trevena\u2019s OLINVYK\u00ae will be a point of focus. Earlier in the year, two abstracts were accepted at ANESTHESIOLOGY\u00ae 2021. Both abstracts highlight safety data from the OLINVYK (oliceridine) injection program. The meeting is sponsored by the American Society of Anesthesiologists and will be shown on October 9th.",

        "selftext": "Hi r/options! I was thinking of buying [**LEAP**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leaps.asp) call options on some top tech stocks that I'm generally bullish on (**MSFT, FB, NVDA, AMD, FB, SNAP** etc.) but wasn't sure if the macroeconomic factors at this point would support this investment. More specifically:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Fed taper**: News reports suggest that the Fed taper will begin sometime [before the end of 2021 ](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/feds-clarida-employment-test-begin-bond-taper-all-met-2021-10-12/) and conclude sometime in the [middle of 2022](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/22/federal-reserve-holds-interest-rates-steady-says-tapering-of-bond-buying-coming-soon.html). Some articles do however suggest that the [impact of this on the market won't be too high](https://www.thebalance.com/fed-tapering-impact-on-markets-416859) and that the \"[tantrum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp)\" from 2013 was more fear than actual impact on the market.   \n\n2. **Fed interest rate hikes**: News report suggest that with inflation and/or stagflation, interest rates would have to be [hiked either in 2022 or early 2023](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/federal-reserve-releases-minutes-from-its-september-policy-meeting.html)  \n\"*In the \u201cdot plot\u201d of individual members\u2019 expectations for interest rates, the committee indicated it could begin raising interest rates as soon as 2022. Markets currently are pricing in the first rate hike for next September, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Following the release of the minutes, traders increased the likelihood of a September hike to 65% from 62%.\"*  \n\n\nWhat would the impact of these factors be on tech stocks like the ones I mentioned above? Is it still a prudent decision for me to buy LEAPs on these stocks that expire in say Jan 2023 / June 2023?",

        "selftext": "\nI feel like almost everyone in r/amd_stock could have told you this, but here we go.\n\n**TDLR:** Merger incoming. Possible profit by purchasing Xilinx shares instead of AMD. \n\n---\n\n10/27/2020 Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) announces merger with Xilinx ($XLNX). \n\n[AMD Press Release 10.27.20](https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2020-10-27-amd-to-acquire-xilinx-creating-the-industry-s-high-performance-computing)\n\n[SEC registration 12.03.20] (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000119312520309831/d83168ds4.htm#rom83168_8) \n\n######**About AMD**\n\nFor more than 50 years AMD has driven innovation in high performance computing, graphics and visualization technologies \u2015 the building blocks for gaming, immersive platforms and the data center. Hundreds of millions of consumers, leading Fortune 500 businesses and cutting-edge scientific research facilities around the world rely on AMD technology daily to improve how they live, work and play. AMD employees around the world are focused on building great products that push the boundaries of what is possible. \n\n######**About Xilinx**\n\nXilinx develops highly flexible and adaptive processing platforms that enable rapid innovation across a variety of technologies - from the cloud to the edge and to the endpoint. Xilinx is the inventor of the FPGA and Adaptive SoCs, designed to deliver the most dynamic processor technology in the industry. We partner with our customers to create scalable, differentiated and intelligent solutions to enable the adaptable, intelligent and connected world of the future.\n\n\n######**Regulatory approval**\n\n_________________\nUS: Approved\n_________________\n\nUK: Approved\n_________________\n\nEU: Approved\n_________________\nChina: Processing. Predicted to be finalized by the end of 2021.\n_________________\n\n\n\n#**Status at market close (10.07.21)**\n\nXilinx price: $158,07\n\nAMD price: $106,45\n\nAgreed share ratio: \nXilinx x1 = 1,7234x AMD\n\nCurrent share ratio: 158,07/106,45 = 1,4849\n\n1,7234/1,4849 = 1,1606 --&gt; 16,06%\nhttps://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio\n\n**My thoughts:** \n\nXilinx is currently valued higher than the share ratio by 16%. The ratio has been in the 10-15% area since the merger announcement. This means that by purchasing Xilinx shares at 158$, you\u2019re essentially buying AMD at a discount. **($91,72 vs $107,45 /ea share)** \n\n#Possible outcomes:\n\n- AMD drops in value until the price is equal AMD*1,7234 = Xilinx stock value\n\n- Xilinx rises until its value is Xilinx/1,7234 = AMD stock value\n\n- Market crash. Both stocks fall in value, but AMD will have a greater negative than Xilinx\n\n- Merger is rejected. \n\n- If the merger agreement is terminated under other specified circumstances, including the failure to receive certain required regulatory approvals, AMD may be required to pay Xilinx a termination fee of $1.0 billion. If the merger agreement is terminated under other specified circumstances, including if the AMD board of directors changes its recommendation, AMD may be required to pay Xilinx a termination fee of $1.5 billion. (Copied from the SEC doc.)\n\n- AMD drops? Xilinx drops? Idk how this\u2019ll play out. \n\n\n \n \n\n\n**Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Most of my portfolio consists of Xilinx shares. I sold my AMD shares at 114$ as I thought the only way forward was for the ratio to even out.** \n\n\nStock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, changes in AMD\u2019s or Xilinx\u2019s respective businesses, operations and prospects, the uncertainty as to the extent of the duration, scope and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, market assessments of the likelihood that the merger will be completed, interest rates, general market, industry and economic conditions and other factors generally affecting the respective prices of AMD and Xilinx common stock, federal, state and local legislation, governmental regulation and legal developments in the industry segments in which AMD and Xilinx operate, and the timing of the merger and receipt of required regulatory approvals.",

Too much is on the line and I believe the us will enforce a strict embargo against on China and force their hand. \n\n   Like with TSMC, AMD traded in a channel for almost a year with the last couple months barely staying over 80 a crucial support yet although sentiment was crushed AMD just like TSMC was beating earnings after earnings and trading at the same if not lower level. Now TSMC has the lowest PE in the industry (higher than intel but cmon) with massive cash on hand and massive investments into semiconductors. TSMC has been trading flat since January whereas AMD was last July of 2020. \n\n Everything I said is just a semi educated guess but I imagine this may trade flat for another couple days and when all hope seems lost it will finally pick up again even the lowest analyst prediction sit above 130. With factories being built in US, EU, Japan massive subsidy packages from these nations we could see a supercycle for semiconductors for the next 5-7 years\n\nThe numbers are their these supply chain issues are temporary so is the Taiwan China fears.

        "selftext": "This is a warning, I am no expert on the stocks. I am drunk and the wife sent me to the couch tonight so why not dabble in some random dd and speculate earnings on AMD  with some hosers like myself.  I am gonna add my 2 cents on AMD. Please keep in mind that I again am not an expert and I have lost money in the best bull\nmarket in history. I am degenerate who has been playing weekly\u2019s on AMD so please let me know your thoughts. I am bullish on AMD. Since last week I gave it an 8% run up till earrings that was on the 12th opened at $104, and we have passed $113 already. Predictions are that AMD will run till earnings dip and then run again. My reasons are as follows. \n1.) TSLA earnings on 10/20, AMD chips are used in production of Model S and Model X, TSLA\u2019s record number of sales in China  is a good indicator, musk tweets about AMD being good to work with on 09/21. I think Elon fucks. Sales of those two models are important as shit could that be another market share for AMD? \n2.) APPL cucked INTC today with their new chip. \n3.)Still waiting more info on the XILINX deal, 4.)TSM beat expectations\n5.)INTC earnings on 10/21 expecting another move on AMD in anticipation of their earnings regardless of the results.\n6.)Also need to consider the recent partnerships with Microsoft and Google.\n\nHas it all been priced in? I am not sure we have ran over 8% since last week and had a major pop from the new graphics card. I am no expert and I don\u2019t have enough time to dive into the rabbit hole of semi conductors. This is just speculation and not a reliable source of information but I feel like there are plenty more gains to be had.",

        "selftext": " \n\n \n\n**GFS - The Sisyphean AMD child**\n\n**Who is GFS:**\n\nGlobalFoundries Inc. (GF or GloFo) is a multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company incorporated in the Cayman Islands and headquartered in Malta, New York. Created by the divestiture of the manufacturing arm of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), the company is privately owned by Mubadala Investment Company, the sovereign wealth fund of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe company manufactures chips designed for markets such as mobility, automotive, computing and wired connectivity, consumer internet of things (IoT) and industrial.\n\nAs of 2021, GlobalFoundries is the fourth-largest semiconductor manufacturer; it produces chips for more than 7% of the $86 billion semiconductor manufacturing services industry. It is the only one with operations in Singapore, the European Union, and the United States: one 200 mm and one 300 mm fabrication plant in Singapore; one 300 mm plant in Dresden, Germany; one 200 mm plant in Burlington, Vermont (where it is the largest private employer) and two 300 mm plants in the State of New York: one in East Fishkill and one in Malta.\n\nIn 2019, Thomas Caulfield, the chief executive officer (CEO), said GlobalFoundries plans to become a publicly traded company in 2022. In 2021, the company submitted an initial public offering (IPO) filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \n\n**AMD Spin Off:**\n\n* In 2008, AMD decided to spin off its fabrication division in a move to leverage its competitive advantage in the microprocessing side of the Chip industry. This would give AMD a much needed cash infusion and freedom to solely focus on the side of the business that was actually working, a situation that was necessary for the struggling stock at the time. \n* After the spin off, AMD would own 34% of the manufacturing company with 66% belonging to Advanced Technology Investment Company (ATIC), a subsidiary of the Mubadala Investment Company. \n* AMD would hold the right and plan to taper off the ownership of the company over time.\n* AMD would also be transferring 1.2Billion in debt to the newly formed company. \n* By 2012, AMD was fully divested from Global Foundries.\n\n**Global Foundries:**\n\n* On March 4, 2009 Global Foundries(GFS) was officially announced. \n* GFS primary business is its Foundry business. Understanding the Foundry side of the semiconductor industry is important as it will give an important insight to its position in the market. If we think of chip manufacturing like photography, AMD/Intel/NVidia would be the photographers and GFS would be the print shop. These companies design the chips and GFS manufactures them.\n* GFS has tried to compete in the designing of chips on many occasions and has failed every time. \n* As of 2015, the firm owned ten fabrication plants. fabrication 1 is in Dresden, Germany. Fabs 2 through 7 are in Singapore. Fabs 8 through 10 are in the northeast United States. These sites are supported by a global network of R&amp;D, design enablement, and customer support in Singapore, China, Taiwan, Japan, India, the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In February 2017, the company announced a new 300 fabrication \\[fabrication 11\\] in China for growing semiconductor market in China.\n* In 2016, GlobalFoundries licensed the 14 nm 14LPP FinFET process from Samsung Electronics. In 2018, GlobalFoundries developed the 12 nm 12LP node based on Samsung's 14 nm 14LPP process.\n* On August 27, 2018, GlobalFoundries announced it had cancelled their 7nm process due to a strategy shift to focus on specialized processes instead of leading edge performance.\n* On January 29, 2019, AMD announced an amended wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries. AMD now has full flexibility for wafer purchases from any foundry at 7 nm or beyond. AMD and GlobalFoundries agreed to commitments and pricing at 12 nm for 2019 through 2021.\n* On May 20, 2019, Marvell Technology Group announced it would acquire Avera Semi from GlobalFoundries for $650 million and potentially an additional $90 million. Avera Semi was GlobalFoundries' ASIC Solutions division, which had been a part of IBM's semiconductor manufacturing business. On February 1, 2019, GlobalFoundries announced the $236 million sale of its fabrication 3E in Tampines, Singapore, to Vanguard International Semiconductor (VIS) as part of their plan to exit the MEMS business by December 31, 2019. on April 22, 2019, GlobalFoundries announced the $430 million sale of their fabrication 10 in East Fishkill, New York, to ON Semiconductor. \n* In May 2020, GlobalFoundries stated it was fully abandoning its plans of opening fabrication 11 in Chengdu, China due to reported rivalry between the latter and the US.\\[30\\] This was three years after the manufacturer announced it would invest $10 billion to open the new fab; the fabrication was never brought online.\\[31\\]\n\n**Bear Case:**\n\n* GFS IPO is an exit strategy for the majority shareholder ATIC, which has proved to be a Sysphean for the fund. (https://semianalysis.com/globalfoundries-gfs-ipo-mubadala-lost-over-22-4b-now-they-are-hoping-public-markets-bail-them-out/)\n* GFS has wasted billions on failed ventures(fabrication 11, 7nm) while its competitors have had no issues in their ventures in the same field. \n* AMD is and was their largest customer, but they have been rapidly declining.\n* TSM, MU and NXP all are taking a large stake in the fabrication industry.\n* The timing of the IPO is to capitalize on inflated market, inflated semi conductor reliance, and looming self-confidence in GFS.   \n* Gross profit of the last three years have been a net loss, and has increased negatively by 58% (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001709048/000119312521290644/d192411df1.htm)\n\n**Subjective Bear Case:**\n\n* A bit of context, I worked as an intern at GFS at their HQ. \n* They had 3 MULTI million $ accidents while I was there. One caused by a hardware technician accidentally pressing an emergency stop button during an etching process. When these processes are stopped for ANY reason, the wafers being processed are as good as garbage. Semiconductor manufacturing is incredibly expensive, time consuming, and if a wafer is not PERFECT on a nano scale, the wafer is rendered useless. \n* The building was beautiful, this might sound like a pro but let me explain why it is a con. GFS has never been in a financial situation where they are able to spend the amount of money that they spent on their office. There were at least 60-80 meeting rooms JUST for engineers and in every single room there were 82inch flat screen HD monitors. There were \u201cto go\u201d chrome books on every corner where if you needed an extra laptop for any reason, you could just grab it. Everyone, even the janitors, were given company laptops, phones, backpacks, etc that were updated every year. \n* Because of the international importance of semiconductors and limited pool of talent, diversity among engineers is an understatement. The amount of engineers I would be in contact with on a daily basis that didn\u2019t speak english/spoke really broken english was quite literally counterproductive. There were times I had to have people from my team come with me to someone else\u2019s desk so they could translate for me.\n* They had a soccer field in the back of the site where they would PAY the employees to partake in - again, definitely a pro but a con in regards to finances. \n* All of this spending while being in a financially rough spot screams to me money hemorrhaging at the management level. \n\n**Bull Case:**\n\n* The IPO will give GFS a needed cash infusion to leverage itself as a top contender in the fabrication industry.\n* Deepening relationships(straight from SEC prospectus) could mean long term contracts with their clients which would mean more stable revenue for the following years. \n* Inflated market, semiconductor prices, and needs of chips means higher revenue and profits for GFS. Due to an increase in need also means customers will be much more willing to work with GFS if they can compete with TSM, MU etc or their competitors don\u2019t have the bandwidth to meet customer demand. \n* Loss from operations has decreased over the last three years(delta of 34%) and compared to last year is a fraction of what it was. \n* Loss per share is almost 14% of what it was compared to 2018(-4.7 vs -.6) \n\n**Conclusion and Summary:**\n\nI wish I could\u2019ve had a more quantitative approach to this post but almost all of the data can be seen at the SEC filing so I will let you guys do the calculations you want to know. I also believe that the qualitative information surrounding GFS is far more interesting than the numbers currently. These are incredibly dynamic times for the semiconductor industry, so the numbers used in the SEC filing are not fully representative of the future of the company. I am interested to see what happens AFTER IPO. Overall, I am net bearish on GFS but I do hold a part of me that believes they could leverage this cash infusion in their benefit. The semiconductor industry will/has seen a massive explosion that will keep exploding for some time.",

        "selftext": "What is [Blackbbery IVY](https://youtu.be/fwDnUNENSoY) (Intelligent Data Platform) works one every vehicle and every platform(in vehicle and cloud)\n\nMany are asking if GM is using WEJO([GPS data platform](https://www.wejo.com/)) for its ULTIFI platform ([software platform](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/general-motors-new-software-platform-ultifi-is-coming-to-vehicles-starting-in-2023/) ) instead of Blackberry Ivy ([intelligent vehicle data platform](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws))\n\nThe clear and straight forward answer is NO! WEJO and AUTONOMO ([here](https://otonomo.io/)) only provide GPS type and location data. They both LICENSE data from OEM and sell it to whoever wants to use. This data is NOT processed in cars using machine learning models or in cloud learning models.  the ULTIFI platfrom is bigger than just GPS coordinate data...the GM ULTIFI platform needs data from all 300+ sensors in car. \n\n[Blackberry Ivy](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-ivy-to-provide-secure-vehicle-based-payments) is a pipeline that sucks in data from over 300 sensors in each car. It then processes it right on the edge (in car chips) and then creates a AI model to use in real time by car APPS and then it also uploads that model in the cloud for other app developers to use. All this data is owned by OEM and they can decide who to give it. Blackberry ivy is NOT just GPS but camera videos to seat sensors to wiper sensors to accelerator sensors to gas sensors to battery sensors to turn signals etc!!! it's mother of all sensors processing platforms. \n\nThe software platform that GM launched (ULTIFI) is coming out in 2023 models the same time Blackberry IVY is coming out. GM is using Blackberry IVY for the data pipeline and providing it to their own app developers and then eventually will open up to other outisders...just like apple store and android play store. \n\nBlackberry ivy can sit on BB QNX operating system, BB QNX Hypervisor, Linux, anywhere!!! GM is using LINUX for ULTIFI platform to blackberry IVY will sit in there processing thee data. The QNX is embedded in pretty much every car sensor's chips (AMD,Qualcomm, etc) so each sensor has the ability to process all this data in realtime and apply machine learning to it for insight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yes the final answer is GM ULTIFI software platform is using Blackberry Ivy!!!! This is bigger than anything...this is huge. First big customer of BB Ivy.",

        "selftext": "I think we're all familiar with the concept of \"time in the market beats timing the market\". \n\nBut where exactly does that apply?\n\nI'm sure it applies to broad index funds like VTI, VT, VOO etc.\n\nI'd assume it doesn't really apply to individual stocks where aspects like fundamentals and the industry it operates in etc. matters a lot. Maybe AMD at price X was a buy last week, but now at Y it's not anymore. Whereas the price of VTI doesn't really factor into the purchasing decision. \n\nBut what about sector ETF's like VHT (Vanguard's Health Care ETF) or VGT (Vanguard's Information Technology ETF)?

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 4, 2021**\n\nAfter an encouraging day last Friday, the stock market sank once again as market participants continue to closely monitor developments out of Washington and wait for upcoming economic and earnings data to gauge concerns over supply chain disruptions and inflation. Tech stocks once again came under pressure as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield continues to rise. The Nasdaq (QQQ) close the day 2.1% lower, which means the tech-heavy index is now roughly 8% below its previous all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.29% lower, the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.92%, and the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 0.91%.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen previous episodes of rising rates, both earlier this year as well as when the Fed first announced intentions to begin tapering quantitative easing in the not too distant future. Each of these episodes caused a hiccup but didn\u2019t derail the broader bull market. According to Edward Jones, yields went from below 1% to 1.75% during the first three months of this year, a period that included pullbacks in the S&amp;P 500 of 3.7% for four days and 4.2% for 12 days. However, during that entire three-month stretch in which rates were rising, the stock market rose more than 7%.  In this current spate, 10-year rates have jumped from 1.30% on September 15 to as high as 1.54% last week, reflecting a renewed concern over inflation pressures and reduced Fed stimulus expectations\n\nStocks are struggling to regain their footing after the September selloff, given that many of the concerns that sparked last month\u2019s drop remain. Congressional lawmakers have yet to come to an agreement on a solution to raise the debt limit to prevent a potential government default sometime mid-October. Failure to do so would be catastrophic for the US economy.  As a reminder, Congress successfully averted a government shutdown last week. The House approved a bill late on Wednesday suspending the debt limit through December 2022. The Senate could vote on it as early as this week Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, but Republicans are expected to block it again as they have twice before. This is an evolving situation. In my humble opinion, I think the Republicans are playing political games with the debt ceiling and will pass it last minute, similar to the spending bill to avoid the government shutdown. \n\nPut simply, a default by the US would be an economic and political disaster that must be avoided. I cannot fathom the government willingly plunging the US into an unprecedented financial crisis for political reasons, though one can never guess the future. According to a report by Moody\u2019s Analytics, one of the three big along with Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Group, approximately 6 million jobs would be lost and the unemployment would spike dramatically, US GDP would decline, and there would be an irrevocable stain on the faith and strength of US financial markets. \u201cInternationally, the United States will have for the first time undermined the full faith and credit of its own currency -- a blow to our standing in the world and a boon for our adversaries such as China who are arguing to the world that the US is on the decline\u201d\n\nThe report goes on to say, \u201cGlobal financial markets and the economy would be upended, and even if resolved quickly, Americans would pay for this default for generations, as global investors would rightly believe that the federal government\u2019s finances have been politicized and that a time may come when they would not be paid what they are owed when owed it. To compensate for this risk, they will demand higher interest rates on the Treasury bonds they purchase. That will exacerbate our daunting long-term fiscal challenges and be a lasting corrosive on the economy, significantly diminishing it.\u201d\n\nHere is a link to the full report, I encourage you to read it\n\n[https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2021/playing-a-dangerous-game-with-the-debt-limit.pdf](https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2021/playing-a-dangerous-game-with-the-debt-limit.pdf)\n\nLooking ahead, the September Jobs Report will be released later this week. Market participantsd are hoping to see payroll gains accelerate after a shockingly disappointing August report, which shoed just 235,000 new payrolls gains verses more than 700,000 expected. Consensus economists anticipate that 475,000 payrolls returned in September, and that the unemployment rate fell to 5.1%, or the lowest since March 2020.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Facebook (FB) underperformed the market after major outages and disruptions of service were reported across the company\u2019s suite of products. \n* Amazon (AMZN) is suffering its worst streak of underperformance in roughly two years and has turned negative year-to-date.\n* GlobalFoundries, which was created by the divestiture of the manufacturing arm of AMD reportedly filed for a US IPO.  \n* Tesla (TSLA) unexpectedly topped estimates for third-quarter deliveries, despite the global semiconductor shortage that is affecting all automakers. Comparatively, Ford (F) deliveries were down 27.4% in the third quarter. While one can\u2019t make direct comparisons due to scale differences, still very impressive to see Tesla (TSLA) successfully navigate the shortage.\n* A group of Tesla investors filed a court filing to argue that Elon Musk to repay the company $9.4 billion for the benefits he received after Tesla bought SolarCity, which Musk partly owned. \n* Factory orders were up 1.2% in August month-on-month, [according to Commerce Department data ](https://www.census.gov/manufacturing/m3/prel/pdf/s-i-o.pdf)on Monday. This came in faster than the 1.0% rise expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data, and represented a fourth consecutive monthly advance.\n* Qualcomm (QCOM) and investment partnership firm SSW Partners announced an agreement to purchase automobile technology company Veoneer (VNE) Monday morning for $37 a share, which values the company at $4.5 billion",

Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and Marvell Technology Inc (MRVL.O) have similar but slightly different offerings.\n\nThere's speed and security benefits:\n\n&gt;For cloud providers, tasks like setting up the virtual machines and getting customer data to the right place are essentially overhead costs. The Mount Evans chip, which Google and Intel have dubbed an \"infrastructure processing unit\" (IPU), separates those tasks out from the main computing tasks and speeds them up. Doing so also helps ensure the safety of those functions against hackers and adds flexibility to the data center.\n\nBut this part is interesting:\n\n&gt;But Intel and Google are working together on a set of software tools that will be released for free in hopes of making Intel's version of the chip a broader industry standard used beyond Google's data centers.\n\nThe server market is what's going to determine the stock price for AMD and Intel. Some questions:\n\n* What kind of impact will this have on AMD's growth in the server space? Is AMD working on something similar?\n* How significant is it that Google picked Intel to partner up with on this project?",

        "selftext": "For my full breakdown check the link [here.](https://greencandleinvestments.substack.com/p/nvidia-corporation-ticker-nvda-brief?r=ksa6f&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCompany Description  \nNvidia Corporation is a visual computing company that designs graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and professional markets, as well as system on a chip units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive markets. The GPU segment offers processors, which include GeForce for PC gaming and mainstream PCs; GeForce NOW for cloud-based gaming; Quadro for design professionals working in computer-aided design, video editing, special effects, Tesla for artificial intelligence (AI) utilizing deep learning, accelerated computing, general purpose computing, and much more. NVIDIA sells their products directly to manufacturers and system builders and is one of the leaders in the chip manufacturing industry.  \n\n\nQuantitative Analysis  \nAt the time of this writing (10/10/2021), NVDA is trading at $208.31 with a 52 week range of $115.66 - $230.43 and a market cap of $519.11B. In Q2 of their fiscal year 2022, NVDA\u2019s revenue was $6.51 billion, up 68% year over year. NVIDIA\u2019s gaming revenue grew 85% year over year to $3.06 billion. The data center revenue grew 35% year over year to $2.37 billion. Return of equity (ROE: Net Income / Total Equity \\*100) of NVDA is 39.25% and net margin (net income / revenue) is 32.33%. The price to earnings (price per share / earnings per share) ratio was 74.61 and the debt to equities ratio (total liabilities / total equity) is 0.83.  \n\n\nQualitative Analysis  \nNvidia is a global leader in the growing industry of computer chip manufacturers and supplies major companies such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google. The COVID pandemic brought a massive increase in demand for computer chips and supply simply could not keep up, leading to the ongoing chip shortage around the world. The impact of the chip shortage is particularly evident in the automotive industry, where new car manufacturing has fallen dramatically and prices of both new and used vehicles continue to hit all time highs month after month. Outside of traditional computing usages, Nvidia has a unique opportunity to integrate into the emerging cryptocurrency industry.\u00a0 In order to mine Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, computers and mining processors need chips similar to what Nvidia creates. There are countless other uses for chips and potentially other uses of chips that have yet to be discovered. With the increasing need and the backing of a large investment from Nancy Pelosi, there\u2019s positive momentum behind one of the global leaders in chip manufacturing.  \n\n\nBullish Thesis  \n1. Backing of Nancy Pelosi Investment: \u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u2019s investment activity has gained a lot of traction and attention, a Twitter account has even been created that now has over 114k followers to track her investments. As mentioned above, Pelosi has a significant investment of $6.5 million in Nvidia. As outlined in the article, Pelosi has had extreme success and retail traders who have shadowed Pelosi have also seen incredible returns. Although this isn\u2019t a bullish point based on the fundamentals of the company, you cannot ignore the success of Pelosi\u2019s investments.  \n\n\n2. Increasing Demand: There are more and more products in need of chips. With increasing artificial intelligence in \u00a0vehicles and chips being placed in everyday products, the need for Nvidia\u2019s products will continue to increase.  \n\n\n3. Major Suppliers: Nvidia supplies chips to major companies such as Amazon, NIO the automated car manufacturer, Facebook, Google, and Tesla currently use Nvidia\u2019s graphics chips. With major companies using their chips, it provides a safety net for sales of Nvidia\u2019s products.  \n\n\nBearish Thesis  \n1. Competition: There are a number of other major chip manufacturing companies that offer NVDA stiff competition. Although Nvidia holds a strong position in chip market share, investors should keep a close eye on several other chip manufacturers. Competitors include: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel (INTC), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM), and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM).  \n\n\n2. Short-term supply chain issues for semiconductors: The demand for semiconductor chips skyrocketed during the pandemic, leaving many manufacturers unable to keep up. This has been particularly evident in the automotive market, where the chip shortage is estimated to cost auto makers \\~210B dollars. Worse still, some have estimated that the chip shortage could continue into 2022 and even 2023. It\u2019s apparent that chip manufacturing companies have had a hard time scaling production, likely due to a number of supply-chain and other COVID-related issues. With demand likely to remain steady, NVDA will be pressured to scale up production and increase supply - time will tell how successful they are in doing so.  \n\n\n3. Automakers designing their own chips: The chip shortage has caused new car production - and thus supply and sales - to plummet over the last year. Because of the low supply, both new and used car prices have skyrocketed to record highs. Rather than simply wait for chip manufacturing companies to catch up, some automakers have started to consider designing and manufacturing chips internally. For example, Tesla has already begun making their own chips and one of GM\u2019s China joint ventures announced in September that they would begin designing their own chips. If chip manufacturing companies are unable to meet demand, expect more large companies with R&amp;D funds to follow Tesla and GM.\u00a0 \u00a0",

        "selftext": "Some exciting stuff this earnings season! Any opinions or thoughts on the companies below are appreciated. I have a number of other stocks i trade or hold but these are a handful of the companies I really believe in longterm with the exception of maybe snapchat. I just had to note that one due to the 22% sell-off we are seeing after hours...\n\nNetflix - reported solid numbers overall with eps coming in at 3.19, an 83% increase over the same period last year...they brought in 7.48 Bil in revenue and 1.45 Bil in net profits. They added 4.38 million new paid subscribers and expect that number to double next quarter, bringing the total count to 213.6 million. I believe the price action to the upside is justified and will continue. \n\nTesla - best quarter yet for the ev car maker ! 13.76 Bil in revenue and 1.6 Bil in net profits. Gross profit margin increased to 26.6%. They delivered 241,300 vehicles and total production came in at 237,823. Numbers looking good and the price action/sentiment is very strong. Arkk base case for tesla shares is steep but starting to sound like a very possible reality. if the stock breaks above the previous all-time-highs of 900.40 we should see a decent move to the upside. I'm thinking 1k could come quick. \n\nSNAP - down 22% after hours on a fairly decent Q3 report...fwd p/e is a little high so it doesn't surprise me. Investors want a big beat on these growth companies sometimes and push the price down hard if eps doesn't come in much higher than expectations \n\nShopify - earnings coming up next week on October 8th along with Amazon...growth is not appearing to slow up in 2021. Looks to me like they started ballooning as a company at the perfect time. They were well positioned to take advantage of the lock downs and have managed to maintain strong sales moving forward as things begin to open back up to some degree. I do not believe a full reopening of the economy would hurt the company at all. In fact it would likely be a driving factor for more growth and would help them sure up their position in the e-commerce sector. Nothing to report here yet for Q3 but i will be waiting patiently. \n\nCoinbase - expected to report November 5th, seems well positioned from a TA perspective to really take advantage of what is likely to be another rally in the crypto space...\n\nSome of my other favorite companies and their expected Q3 earnings dates \n\nDocusign - December 2nd \nYeti - November 4th \nDraftkings - also November 4th \nAmd - October 26",

My parents had a big yard and it made sense. It was pretty cheap, cost about 300 AUD and I used it for about 4 years. We moved to Denmark and later sold it for 400 AUD and it was in that moment that I had written enough for this post not to be considered low effort and therefore be able to talk about the title in question.\n\nThe title pretty much explains it. Given this odd trade, how will it pan out for Xilinx option holders? I currently see a few options..\n\n- It becomes an AMD option in a 1 to 1 conversion - If so, that would constitute a loss.\n\n- It gets sold at market price. If so, then it will also potentially mean a loss\n\n- It converts to AMD options in a 1 to 1.7234 conversion and then the excess will go back to the buyer. If so what's the amount that goes back to the buyer?",

With all of big tech set to report this week, it could prove to be more lucrative than the last. We\u2019ve got a large variety of trades we can make this week ranging from educated gambles, to good old fashioned theta plays. We\u2019ve even have a couple of opportunities to sprinkle in some collateral plays if we wish! Let\u2019s get into it!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing) instead!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Jetblue is inefficiently priced.** Historically Jetblue moves roughly **4%** post earnings (inline with all the other American airlines),  yet this quarter, the options are pricing in a move of roughly **10%**. If we sell straddles or strangles, we can collect this extremely inflated premium with very little risk on our end. I looked into the entire sector as a whole since I planned on trading it last week, and I came across nothing that would\u2019ve fundamentally caused this spike in volatility in airlines, or Jetblue specifically. The odds are awesome on this trade, and I plan or robbing some gamblers next week. For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Twitter is inefficiently priced. Avoid it.** Historical move of **6.5%**, priced move of **11%** - on paper, this trade gives us insane edge, but I\u2019m still not touching it, as we saw what happened with $SNAP on Thursday. Although Twitter dropped 5% as the market tried to price $AAPL\u2019s privacy policy in, I don\u2019t feel like taking on additional risk because the fundamentals have shifted right before its\u2019 earnings. Normally I would take this trade 10/10 times simply from a pure numbers standpoint, but I\u2019m not as confident anymore because of the added volatility created by $SNAP. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Oil stocks tend to experience Post Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD).** PEAD is the phenomenon where a stocks price will drift in the direction of an earnings surprise for several weeks following an earnings announcement. If a stock beats, it will continue to grind up for weeks following the ER report, and vice versa if it misses. This is especially true among oil stocks - check the charts if you don\u2019t believe me. The best way to play oil this quarter would be to capitalize on this effect, and do **monthly** call or put debit spreads based on the results that come out Friday. To those curious, standard weekly options provide no edge at the time of writing, so it\u2019s best not to gamble this time round.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Collateral Plays are your friend!** If you\u2019re bullish on big tech, look to long $QQQ this week to alter your risk exposure and bag some safer gains. If you\u2019re bearish on oil, look to short $XLE instead of any of the individual companies for an added safety net. If you think $AMD is gonna knock it out of the park, look to play $NVDA or $SOXL instead. There\u2019s lot\u2019s of opportunities for collateral plays this week, and I\u2019ve just barely scratched the surface. If you wish to learn more about collateral plays, refer to [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nWe've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!  If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you\u2019d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**",

I also have a bunch of Canadian Pacific and Canadian National stocks since these are stable companies in a market that's not easy for new players to enter and is not going away anytime soon. \n\nSo, my question is, are freight railroads a good-enough hedge in case tech goes to shit? Or should I also pick-up some stocks in some other sector (REITs? Commodities?). What sector is likely to be unaffected in case there is a big drop-off in tech?",

It hit 127$ and I was 95% sure it was going to drop in the next few days.  At 125$ I bought a 123$ put.  Its in the money today.  So I\u2019d like to unload it and get my money(fake money).  But with a put, I\u2019m not sure weather I should sell or exercise the option.  If I sell, is it the same as writing a put option?  Just don\u2019t want to loose money later in the day if it drops more.\n\nMay be a dumb question, but I see potential in smart option trading, however I\u2019m starting with a fake account to learn.  So any help is appreciated.",

        "selftext": "Xilinx Earnings post market beat earnings. No big deal. In fact it's somewhat expected. \n\nIf we look at EPS, Revenue of TXN and AMD they are more or less inline with expectations. \n\nTXN EPS: 2.07act vs 2.05est and 22% Rev increase (guidance took a shit because of supply chain issues)\n\nAMD EPS: .73act vs .67est and 54% rev increase\n\nSo what is Xilinx Earnings missing? Guidance. Which they refused to provide. why? because like the rest of the retards out there, they are waiting buyout by AMD. \n\nThey know they have supply chain issues and mentioning it will hurt their short term outlook and payday when AMD finally settles on a share price. Xilinx has been pumping up their numbers since Q2 and hasn't dipped since. \n\nThe earnings for Xilinx is fucking scamming AMD and their lack of supply chain issues are coming for them.",

I transferred to Fidelity after about a month because of speculations that Robinhood is a shady company at the time. I then bought more of each stock through Fidelity. I can see through Fidelity of when I bought all my shares of each stock, the first amount of shares through Robinhood, and then the rest that I had bought through Fidelity. I very much intend to pay the appropriate capital gains taxes after I sell during the #MOASS.
