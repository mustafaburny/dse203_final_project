        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, December 2, 2020**\n\nThe market rallied throughout the session after opening in the red, with the indexes holding near-record levels, with market participants optimistic that the approval and distribution of a vaccine could come relatively soon. Coronavirus cases in the United States are still on the rise, unfortunately. \n\nIn recent weeks, investors have been cheering positive vaccine developments from companies like Pfizer (PFE), Moderna (MRNA), and AstraZeneca (AZN), fueling optimism that distribution of an effective medical solution for COVID-19 is coming relatively soon. Moderna and Pfizer have already submitted their vaccines to European and American health administrations for emergency use authorization. According to CBS News, during a conference call, Vice President Mike Pence told state governors that distribution of a vaccine could begin as early as mid-December. According to audio obtained by CBS News, Vice Presiden Pence said, \u201cWe strongly believe the vaccine distribution process could begin as soon as the week of December 14. With the news that Moderna is joining Pfizer in submitting for emergency use authorization, we continue to be on pace.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the number of patients hospitalized with COVID set another record, with the Center of Disease Control (CDC) Director warning of difficult times ahead if the curve is not flattened again soon. As of yesterday, there are more than 98,000 people hospitalized, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Hospital systems across the nations are warning they are reaching capacity and are lacking resources. In response, Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC warned, \"The reality is, December and January and February are going to be rough times. I actually believe they're going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation, largely because of the stress that's going to be put on our health care system.\u201d\n\nYesterday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers unveiled a new $908 billion targeted stimulus. The lawmakers say their plan aims to find common ground on some of the most pressing issues, and it could be used as a framework for the next stimulus package. The bill includes money for local and state governments, additional business protections, and to fund vaccine research and distribution. House Speaker Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have both supported the bill. It is unlikely any sort of bill will pass through Congress but we will keep you updated surrounding this situation.\n\nHighlights\n\n* The UK became the first country to approve Pfizer\u2019s (PFE) coronavirus vaccine.\n* Salesforce (CRM) fell more than 9% after the company announced it would be purchasing workplace messaging software company Slack (WORK) in its largest-ever deal valued at $27.7 billion, confirming a week\u2019s worth of media reports over the tie-up. The announcement coincided with Salesforce\u2019s third-quarter earnings results, which topped estimates, though its fourth-quarter profit guidance disappointed.\n* United Parcel Service (UPS) was forced to impose shipping restrictions on some large retailers such as Gap Inc. and Nike Inc. this week, an early sign that the pandemic-fueled online shopping season is stretching delivery networks to their limits. UPS is metering the flow of packages into its network to preserve its performance during one of the busiest shipping weeks of the year. \n   * Fedex (FDX) has followed suit to an extent by increasing shipping prices and holding merchants to volume agreements\n* Alphabet (GOOG) announced the acquisition of Actifo, a company that specializes in data back-up and recovery in the event of a disaster\n* Salesforce (CRM) target increase by JMP Securities from $272 to $282 at OUTPERFORM\n* Fate Therapeutics (FATE) target raised by Barclays from $60 to $70 at OVERWEIGHT. Stock currently around $61.\n* NetApp (NTAP) target raised by Credit Suisse from $54 to $64 at OUTPERFORM. Stock gained 10% for the day to close at $59\n* Peleton (PTON) target raised by Needham &amp; Co. from $125 to $140 at BUY. Stock rallied to $117 intra day and closed even at $112\n* Red Rock Resorts $RRR target raised by Macquarie from $28 to $30. Stock currently around $22\n* Suncor $SU target raised by Barclays from $29 to $31. Very notable because stock only around $16.\n* UnitedHealth Group $UNH with multiple target bullish price target increases from notable analysts. Average price target around $375 and rating of OVERWEIGHT\n* Children\u2019s Place (PLCE) was up almost 8% on the day after Wedbush increased price target to $48 from $32 yesterday\n\n\"If your dreams don't scare you, they are too small\" -Richard Branson",

However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares.
