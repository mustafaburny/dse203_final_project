If you owned this stock, you should be very pleased.\n\nWhat's is the next Broadcom? People are talking 5G. People are talking ARM. Qualcomm will supply hardware to Apple for 5G, but their performance has been underwhelming. Softbank has ARM, but the company is a waste of existence. MRVL may have potential, but its been stagnant.\n\nWhat is your next broadcom and why?",

        "selftext": "Their earnings are coming up in a few days - 6/4. Not sure why the date is more publicized, Robinhood and Yahoo doesn't have it correct for instance, but yeah now is your chance to get in before the earnings run-up.\n\nThey are a massive semi-conductor company, meaning they make all sorts of tiny, unique parts for all sorts of devices. Apple is totally reliant on them, as are many, many other tech companies. They made most of the internal wireless antennas for the last generation of cell phones, and they are making most of the next gen ones too.\n\nNvidia is also basically a semi-conductor firm and look at their recent results. I think AVGO will go on a similar run. It's just a clutch industry for the big boys.\n\nStill around 20% under pre-corona levels, unlike most stocks in tech.\n\nIVs for June 19th are literally still less than 40%, you will make a killing just from the IV crush.\n\nVery well run company. Rarely miss earnings, but did so in Q1 2020, so lowered expectations this time around. Almost every analyst has them with a Buy or Strong Buy rating.\n\nI personally will be buying 6/19 $330 and $340 calls.",

Given that it has a good IP portfolio, do you think the stock is reasonably priced right now?\n\nFor comparisons, AVGO has a P/E of ~50, while INTC is at 12, QCOM at 25 and AMD at 130.\n\nI\u2019m a total noob, but I was thinking of investing in it.

        "selftext": "This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares.

They finished at +6.55% and 4.37% respectively. If you played these in the after-hours market Friday you should have made out pretty well. Unfortunately, my limit orders were never filled. The Classic UOA picks of SABR and APA collectively did okay. SABR was quite a bit higher in the morning at 11.50 but proceeded to drop for the rest of the day ending at -1%. If you had a reasonable take profit that should have hit. The second pick, APA, ended up 9.77%.\n\nSite update \u2013 Economic Calendar has been updated to be more useful. This week I am going to focus heavily on the resources area so be sure to check it out. Eventually it will be a database with the most useful sites both free and paid that could help you to make the best decisions possible. There is also an email subscribe button now (it has yet to be tested).\n\nHere\u2019s the Option Activity Summary for today \u2013\n\n**June 8th, 2020 Option Activity Fast Facts (Stocks &gt;$6)**\n\n**Highest Multiple over Daily Avg (with ADV &gt;5k) \u2013** **IVR with 11x it\u2019s ADV of 20,489. 202k calls traded and 31k puts.**\n\n**Ticker with most contracts Traded \u2013 GE with 591k contracts traded and 2x it\u2019s ADV of 285k. 462k calls traded and 128k puts.**\n\n**Largest Put to Call Ratio (w/ Option volume over 10k) \u2013 IEF with P/C ratio of 70 and 159 calls and 11k puts.**\n\n**Largest Call to Put Ratio (w/ Option volume over 10k) \u2013 SONO with 33 C/P ratio. 37k calls and 1.1k puts.**\n\n***1.*** ***Ticker : FTCH***\n\n**Spot Price** : $15.58 +1.55, +11.05%\n\n**Company Summary** (from Yahoo Finance)**:** Farfetch Limited, through its subsidiary, Farfetch.com Limited, provides an online marketplace for luxury goods in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific. It operates in three segments: Digital Platform, Brand Platform, and In-Store. The company operates Farfetch.com, an online marketplace, as well as Farfetch app for retailers and brands.

Previous OI of 575.**\n\n**My Impression :** FTCH is presenting at the Deutsche Bank dbAccess 17th Global Consumer Conference 2020\u00a0June 11th, 2019.It had a large spike today, but has been as high as $16.59. The Calls at ask % looks pretty bullish to me. This is similar to FLEX, BHC, and HPE. This is mostlikely buying the rumor and selling the news. Looks solid to me, I bought shares AHs.\n\n***2.*** ***Ticker :*** ***EVRI***\n\n**Spot Price** : $7.88, +.90, (+12.86%)\n\n**Company Summary** (from Yahoo Finance)**:** Everi Holdings Inc. provides technology solutions for the casino gaming industry in the United States, Europe, Canada, the Caribbean, Central America, and Asia. The company operates in two segments, Games and FinTech. It offers gaming products, such as classic mechanical reel games, video reel games, core HDX, Empire MPX and the Texan HDX, wide area progressive games, and slot tournament systems; and sells player terminals, licenses, back office systems, and other related equipment.

With the run up of PENN and DKNG I am amazed this fell through the cracks. It\u2019s 52 wk high was $15. I don\u2019t see any news on briefing to warrant the sharp increase.\n\n**CLASSIC UNUSUAL OPTIONS ACTIVITY \u2013**\n\nYou can view this at [www.noeticoptions.com](https://www.noeticoptions.com)\n\nSummary : Friday\u2019s picks HPE and BHC ended up pretty well today. Keep in mind, both of these stocks have conferences coming up. BHC has the Goldman Sachs 41st Annual Virtual Global Healthcare Conference June 10th and HPE has the conference tomorrow. Keep this in mind if you held through today. Buying the rumor and selling the news is usually a safe bet.\n\nRegarding the momentum stocks, EVRI and FTCH look solid to me. With the recent run up of gambling stocks EVRI seems all around solid for a shorter-term hold. I bought both EVRI and FTCH in after hours. As for the Classic UOA stocks, I\u2019m not playing either of these but will likely do a call spread on TSLA tomorrow.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nDISCLAIMER \u2013 These are my observations that I have made at the end of each day and trades that I am considering placing or watching. I am not responsible for your financial losses if you follow any of these trades. As always, do your own due diligence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: If you liked the post please don't forget to upvote and or leave a comment!",

Nice.  \n\nDue to the demand for more classical unusual option plays these posts will now be divided into Unusual Momentum Option Activity and Classic Unusual Options Activity. \n\nUnusual Momentum Option Activity - \n\n**June 5th, 2020 Option Activity Fast Facts \u2013** \n\n**Highest Multiple over Daily Avg (with ADV &gt;5k) \u2013 DD with 8x its ADV of 8,327 and 10k calls traded and 59k puts.**\n\n**Ticker with most contracts Traded \u2013 AAL 1.1 Million and 4x it\u2019s ADV. 571k calls traded and 536k puts**\n\n**Largest Put to Call Ratio (w/ Option volume over 10k) \u2013 BKLN with 135.4 P/C Ratio and 40,746 puts and 301 calls.** \n\n**Largest Call to Put Ratio (w/ Option volume over 10k) \u2013 CDEV with 150 C/P Ratio and 36,520 calls and 243 puts traded.** \n\n***1.***  ***Ticker :BHC*** \n\n**Spot Price** : $19.24\n\n**Company Summary :** Bausch Health Companies Inc. develops, manufactures, and markets a range of pharmaceutical, medical device, and over-the-counter (OTC) products primarily in the therapeutic areas of eye health, gastroenterology, and dermatology.

Jun 19 \u201920 20C also had 2k.** \n\n**My Impression :** June 10th of next week is the Goldman Sachs 41st Annual Virtual Global Healthcare Conference. Perhaps this is a play for some great news on the conference. Regardless, the momentum is very bullish and I don\u2019t think this move is veiled by CoVID-19 euphoria. The call C/P Ratio and amount of calls at ask are quite bullish. \n\n***2.***  ***Ticker :*** ***HPE***\n\n**Spot Price** : 11.15, +.67 (+6.39%)\n\n**Company Summary** (from Yahoo Finance)**:** Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company provides solutions that allow customers to capture, analyze, and act upon data from edge to cloud.

Perhaps some are expecting some news from HPE. A lot of the volume for the Jun 19 \u201920 11.5C came in after 3 pm. The C/P ratio is pretty positive. Could be a good play to buy the rumor and sell the news. \n\n**CLASSIC UNUSUAL OPTIONS ACTIVITY \u2013** \n\nThese can be found on todays post at [https://www.noeticoptions.com/](https://www.noeticoptions.com/).\n\nSummary : \n\nQuick note about ON : This stock would have made the list today, but it was already included a few days ago. If you are still holding ON, I\u2019d keep your position. C/P Ratio was 56.8% with 51% of calls bought at the ask. This hit my 5% TP this AM so I am out, but it still looks like a solid play. The JUN 19 \u201920 21 strike had a lot of action today 11k contracts sold. \n\nSABR would have also made momentum list but I decided to include in the Classic UOA section. In my opinion it fits both and looks like a good buy. \n\nBoth BHC and HPC are getting volume from conferences. This worked out reasonably well with FLEX earlier in the week. Buying the rumor and selling the news is always a good idea. If you are to enter any plays I would wait until after the open Monday because there is likely to be a decent pull back. \n\nAs always, please visit my website [https://www.noeticoptions.com/](https://www.noeticoptions.com/) . In the future only half of the plays will be posted here. I also have an instagram : [https://www.instagram.com/noeticoptions/](https://www.instagram.com/noeticoptions/) which I will post on when there is a new post. \n\nThanks for reading, enjoy the weekend!  \n\n\nDISCLAIMER \u2013 These are my observations that I have made at the end of each day and trades that I am considering placing or watching. I am not responsible for your financial losses if you follow any of these trades. As always, do your own due diligence.",

        "selftext": "First, I want to say I know most of us, even the professionals have no idea what is going on, ever.\n\nSecond, nearly every news article and blog to me is consistently wrong. But what really pisses me off is the follow up news articles, postings, etc have a bogus explanation why something happened. The information that should of been presented prior if it were a true future analysis. There is no benefit figuring out a short term explanation for increase or decrease in a stock after the fact when the stock market is a future fight.\n\nFinally, I am no better than anyone else, but I get gut feeling on some stocks that just stand out based of their trend and my intuition. I haven't got cocky and gone all out on any of these, but I have strong feelings. For example:\n\no 2016 I invested $200 dollars into AMD (60 Shares) which is worth \\~$3200 today. I was looking through various businesses and saw AMD significantly lower than Intel at the time. It was like 2 dollars a share! I was certain it would have substantial growth, maybe dumb luck, maybe intuition. I won't lie, I have no idea when to sell and rarely do. They still appear to be doing so well and will have a significant hand in AI, future of gaming and other technologies. \n\no 2020 At the bottom of Tesla's stock in March trading about \\~350 a share, I knew that would quickly rebound as the future is now, the clear path to transportation is self driving just as significant as all revolutionary technologies. For me, when I retire in 30-40 years I see myself in a self driving RV, with virtual reality capabilities. So, I held off on Tesla at this time because I listed to people full of shit thinking the economy was going to crash and Tesla would be worth less than 250 a share. \n\no Currently, I've invested in a couple commercial airliners, because look at those margins. Analyzing how long it takes airlines to recover, I say full recovery in 2-3 years. I eyeballed Boeing hard, many articles cautioning 'too big to fail' what a load of garbage. They are critical to national transportation. I was going to put down $1,000 on them at about $120 per share. They are up to $173 per share today, and I believe this is only the beginning. \n\no Also, Ford is a lot like the airlines, I have watch this stock sadly die away for four years, and I don't think it will be gone for good. It was \\~9 a share prior to COVID, and went sub $5. I bought a little then and I think they could get to $7 maybe even 8$ before continued their downward trend. \n\nI deviated with my own holdings, but I want this to be about inaccurate articles saying we are going into a recession, specific companies are the next Apple/Amazon that usually go down. Seriously, look up old news articles on companies are overwhelmingly wrong. \n\nIf you are curious of my holdings: ALK, F, SBUX, WEN, MSFT, TSLA, CSCO, SFM, NVIDIA, KR, AMD, CANN\n\nIn the past 4 years, I have 50% gain. Whatever you do, don't buy CANN, I knew this was a dumb move, but i had a little greed in me when I did it.",
