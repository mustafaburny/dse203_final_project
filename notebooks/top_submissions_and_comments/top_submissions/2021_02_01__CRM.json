        "selftext": "Honestly, this DD requires a lot of critical thinking. If that\u2019s not your jam, please enjoy this cartoon of Alex Karp crushing the competition, then scroll down to the bottom of the DD where you\u2019ll find my plan for the end of my lockup plus a few diamond emojiis, a couple of hand emojiis and a bunch of vacuum optimized transportation device emojiis.\n\n[ \\(photo credit for the Karptoon goes to ex-Palantir designer u\\/gottacroe and my wife u\\/LindsayatAdaDiamonds photoshopping in the Salesforce Einstein\\)](https://preview.redd.it/alrclog6jph61.jpg?width=2550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ccc3ebfc134179b868459db097dd9d1e51534c1)\n\nLots of words below, so here\u2019s the TL;DRs, Table of Contents, a self dox, and position disclosure before my DD.\n\n**TL;DR #1**: After watching Demo Day twice, I am blown away at how much Palantir\u2019s products have matured in the last 6 years since I left Palantir. I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG, MSFT, and CRM. Apollo is absolutely incredible, and it\u2019s going where no clouds have gone before\u2026 from Humvees to nuclear submarines. Lastly, it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best-of-class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir. Bottom line: I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients.\n\nPLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day:\n\n[You've come a long way baby.](https://preview.redd.it/fuvi00aejph61.jpg?width=1182&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d993cff432e6b8f49b6728ac4d180cbbb2979080)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**TL;DR #2:** IBM just surrendered to PLTR. In the words of POTUS, this is a\u2026\n\n# Big.\n\n# Fucking.\n\n# Deal.\n\nTo put it politely, IBM and Palantir don\u2019t have a very good past relationship. So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing: Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry-wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp.\n\n* First they ignore you.\n* Then they laugh at you.\n* Then they fight you.\n* Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries.\n* Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**TL;DR #3:** Regardless of how \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 the 2020 earnings are tomorrow, I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B+ market cap for Palantir \u2013 BP renewing their enterprise deal, Rio Tinto and PG&amp;E signing a new enterprise deals, AT&amp;T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills, and 2,500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world, etc. IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world.\n\nIf they\u2019re in, I\u2019m in.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**TL;DR #4**: Eventually, institutional traders will comprehend the immense long-term value of ~~Planeteer~~ ~~Planter~~ Palantir and the stock will join the PFAANG club (though I vote that we rename it the FAAPNG club).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n\n1.

Musings on Earnings and Unlocking\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBecause there are so many shills, pumpers, and bullshiters on WSB these days, I\u2019ll self dox myself. I\u2019m Jason Payne. I joined Palantir in early 2007, when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams, and left in 2015 to become the CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/) (hence my username).\n\nI joined Reddit to do an official [AMA on laboratory-grown diamonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8pb8d5/i_grow_diamonds_i_make_custom_jewelry_with_these/) a few years ago that hit the front page, stuck around, and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community. Thus, I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee.\n\nYou may think that I\u2019m a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD. I\u2019m not. Turns out I have a DD-writing fetish. Don\u2019t kink shame. [Here\u2019s a couple of my prior DDs](https://medium.com/@Jason_Payne) on De Beers, Tiffany &amp; Co., and the FTC.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Positions or ban:** At the current PLTR share price, I hold a Keyser S\u00f6ze position - I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset. But I\u2019m not going to. I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20%, and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon-to-be-unlocked 80%, with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position, regardless of earnings tomorrow.\n\nWhy? I like the stock, a lot.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**#1) Praise &amp; Constructive Criticism for Demo Day**\n\nExistentially, Demo Day was incredibly impressive. This thread with u/namingisreallyhard, u/DentalFox, and u/jamauer sums it up:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d0p7dwzijph61.jpg?width=526&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9caa7b51ca8f7c2315988eda62f4afa7f30f7b07\n\nFour things stood out to me:\n\n**Superior Design Language to CRM, MSFT, and GOOG:** Palantir has a completely different front-end user experience (UX) than my time at Palantir, that I saw for the first time on Demo Day. I find it practical, beautiful, and efficient.\n\nThe design language is called Blueprint Javascript, and it\u2019s built on React, a modern web development platform that Facebook built. Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS, meaning that anyone can use it: [https://blueprintjs.com/](https://blueprintjs.com/)\n\nBlueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data-dense interfaces for desktop applications. Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce\u2019s Lightning, the flat UX of Google, and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office, I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day.\n\nI struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded. Getting that balance right is really difficult.\n\n**Deep Investment in Deployability**: Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software. No-one buys the backend system, so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software.\n\nSalesforce still hasn\u2019t ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1.0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system. Google\u2019s back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools - Gmail, Calendar, AdWords, etc.\n\nThe admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance. I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40-75% faster than Salesforce.\n\n**Migration from \u2018*****Find the Terrorist*****\u2019 to '*****Cheat Code for War*****':** When I was at Palantir, the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy. Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions.\n\nAnother Redditor described Gotham as \u2018cheat code for war,\u2019 and I think that is spot on. That\u2019s why Palantir has won so many different logistics, mission planning, command and control, etc. military contracts recently, including the Space Force\n\n**DoD IL-6 SaaS Approval:** Palantir moving to IL-6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own, but I\u2019ll keep it short. It\u2019s a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks, and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hl1j7wwkjph61.jpg?width=1314&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4dc190a30dc75e8d66bcd6c8ab74cb42472137d\n\nNow that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day. I\u2019d give the presenters a C+ at best. I found it rushed, confusing, and difficult to follow. I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content, and I\u2019ve given 500+ Palantir demos in my lifetime! My constructive criticism:\n\n* Slow down 15-20%\n* Err on the side of a simpler, more approachable lexicon\n* For the love of God, stop reading from scripts. Use bullet points\n* Handoffs were way to abrupt. Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic\n* Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations\n* Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals\n\nI\u2019m not alone in my take on Demo Day. Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation:\n\n&gt;*\u00b7 I don't know if it is just me, but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\u00b7 It lacked charisma and charm, and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\u00b7 I was watching the demo day presentation, and left feeling underwhelmed. It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry, but from someone outside of it, it all sounded greek to me.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\u00b7 I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills.*\n\nI know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir, so here\u2019s a direct message to those behind Demo Day - if everyone told you that you \u2018*killed it*,\u2019 you \\*really\\* need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**#2) Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit**\n\nOne of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me: At Palantir, we build Iron Man suits, not robots.\n\nNo, Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits (AFAIK).\n\nPalantir builds *cerebral* cyborgs, not *physical* cyborgs. Palantir\u2019s products create a symbiotic relationship between human beings and computers to better solve *cerebral* tasks, not *physical* tasks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Iron Man. Cerebral Edition.](https://preview.redd.it/77xps5ipjph61.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb3acbee813e27ca69f7b94c9158fba44c6e142a)\n\nIf you have not watched Demo Day yet (or you rewatch it), listen for how many times they say the words \u2018decision\u2019 and \u2018decision makers.\u2019\n\nWhy a **diamond fisted** Iron Man suit? Palantir just closed an enterprise deal with Rio Tinto, who is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world. So Rio Tinto will be using their PLTR-powered Iron Man suits to dig for fistfuls of diamonds on multiple continents.\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**\n\n**#3) The True ROI of Palantir**\n\nPalantir is really expensive. No question about it.\n\nBut you know what\u2019s more expensive than Palantir? Bad Decisions. Being wrong is really, really expensive. See the Airbus 380, Microsoft\u2019s market share of cell phones, the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant, shorting GME in early January, and BMW/Mercedes/Lexus\u2019s dismissal of TSLA.\n\nThe true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization. Even a moderate improvement in decision making creates deep fucking value for an organization.\n\nFor example, Airbus claims that Foundry helped them improved the speed of A350 production by 33%. There are 5 million discrete parts in an A350, and the Foundry-powered decisions led to a 33% improvement in production. Palantir doesn\u2019t make that claim. Airbus makes that claim. That\u2019s absolutely bonkers and that\u2019s why this is no surprise:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img ns8wcvvsjph61...*\n\nThe BP renewal and the new deals (PG&amp;E, Rio Tinto, Fiat, etc) prove u/petroduct is right. If you have complex logistics, you should have Foundry.\n\nSay that Palantir improves the quality of decisions made at United Airlines by 6.9%. How much will the UAL stock appreciate over the next decade? If Palantir helps Rio Tinto improve decision making by 4.20%, how much will their bottom line grow by 2025?\n\nBelow are a few excerpts from United's Director of Technical Operations on how they use Foundry. This is just scratching the surface of how an airline can use Palantir to improve operations; however, if each of these models/decisions are incrementally improved, even a little bit, the value to United is fucking deep.\n\nThe entire blog post is a great read if you want to go deeper on Foundry: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/)\n\n&gt;*\\[minor edits for brevity\\]*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The return-to-service model recommends which specific aircraft to return at which time in the future and how to utilize our available maintenance capacity (internal &amp; external) to ensure they\u2019re airworthy when we need them. Since we don\u2019t know when air travel demand will recover, the models need to account for slow recoveries, fast recoveries, and everything in between.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Our optimization models consider when \u201cbig events\u201d (airframe checks, engine overhauls, and landing gear overhauls) will be due, along with the cost of those events and the available maintenance capacity to complete them. The models also incorporate other factors: parts availability and cost, available technician hours at each maintenance station, ability to secure supplemental maintenance lines at external MRO providers, aircraft-specific mechanical reliability and on-time performance, and even the quality of the in-flight products (seats, Wi-Fi, entertainment, power outlets).*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The team is also helping optimize the cycling of active and parked aircraft whenever we have surplus planes available to fly, which ensures regulatory compliance with the maintenance program, minimizes operating costs, and enables our Tech Ops team to be very intentional about balancing our operational objectives \u2013 do we want to fly the most reliable aircraft, the lowest cost aircraft, or the aircraft with the most time left until its next major maintenance event?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**#4) Muthafuckin\u2019 Clouds in Nuclear Submarines**\n\nToward the end of the Apollo demo, one of the presenters offhandedly mentioned something that caused my jaw to hit the floor: Palantir will be deploying Apollo on US Navy submarines.\n\nIL-6. Clouds. In. Nuclear. Submarines.\n\nAs someone who has installed and managed Palantir servers in server rooms all over the world, I can\u2019t state how huge it is that the US Navy is approving the Apollo modular cloud architecture to be deployed on some of their most sensitive and expensive assets.\n\nThe fact that upgrades to the entire fleet can be managed like upgrading an AWS server?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img mvmtqwdvjph61...*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**#5) Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments?**\n\nOne of the favorite arguments of the Palantir bears is that Palantir is an unscalable, overvalued services company that should have the same P/E as Accenture, Booz, BAE, etc. The bears say that Palantir only has a handful of clients and can\u2019t scale. In my mind, the quality of the admin tools show on Demo Day and the IBM partnership announcement eviscerated that argument.\n\nWhen I was at Palantir, it was a bitch to build and manage deployments. From what I saw on Demo Day, Palantir is now easier than Salesforce to deploy. I say that as someone who has written tens of thousands of lines of code for Salesforce (Lightning, Apex, SOQL and Visualforce).\n\nEventually, Palantir will have the same ecosphere of 3rd party developers that deploy and manage instances of SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft, etc. but that will take years to fully mature that ecosphere. Eventually, Palantir will have robust certifications for various skills and tasks to manage Palantir deployments.\n\nBut in the meantime, Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) will continue to directly manage deployments. Given how much progress Palantir has made on the tools to improve the efficiency of the FDEs, I no longer worry about the scalability of that team.\n\nSay that three utility companies all buy Palantir \u2013 PG&amp;E, ConEd, and Entergy.  Palantir invests 4 years worth of FDE time in PG&amp;E, 1 year in ConEd, and none in Entergy.\n\n* PG&amp;E improves decision making by 10% and does a massive enterprise deal with Palantir to deploy to every part of the organization.\n* ConEd improves decision making by 2% and does a moderate renewal for a few specific teams.\n* Entergy bungles their deployment and actually makes worse decision as a result. They do not renew.\n\nAssuming \\~$500k/year all in is the cost for a good FDE at Palantir, we're talking about small up front investments that return bigly for PLTR in the long run as those deployments are extended like the BP deal.\n\nTo put it another way, when you think about Palantir deployments in months or years, the FDE overhead is spooky. But when you think about those deployments converting into decade long *operating system for XXXXXX* deals, the FDE overhead is not significant.\n\nAlso, to be honest, there are very few people with TS/SCI security clearances that even know what React is, much less how to write code against it, so in some of the more sensitive use cases for Palantir, I think that FDEs will be the way for a long time.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**#6) Should you YOLO on PLTR?**\n\nI\u2019m not going to give anyone financial advice, but I do want to point out a few things:\n\nPLTR is not a meme stock. Palantir is not a small-cap that can move bigly because, a bunch of furry quadrupeds gathering on internet messaging boards collectively decide that we like the stock.\n\nPalantir is a bunch of wickedly smart people building Iron Man suits for the largest, most important organizations in the world.\n\nMany of the larger institutional investors still don\u2019t truly comprehend Palantir and the medium term public valuation may not properly reflect the present and future value created by Palantir. I have no idea when the analysts will finally get the value of PLTR.\n\nA lot of historically successful investors think PLTR is extremely overvalued. They may be right.\n\nA lot of historically successful investors have massive positions long PLTR. CathThey may be right.\n\nSo my crystal ball says PLTR may go up, down, or sideways for longer than you can stay solvent or interested in Karp memes.\n\nRegardless of the ticker, if you YOLO, please YOLO responsibly my friends, and for the love of god take some off the table if/when you\u2019re fortunate enough to have green dildoes in your accounts\u2013 whether your gains are from PLTR or any other stock you happen to like, a lot.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**#7) My Appreciation for the Palantir Team**\n\nI do want to take a moment and say to anyone who has been a part of building Palantir over the last few decades: what you have built is incredible. Thank you. As an American, thank you. As a stockholder, thank you.\n\nEnjoy your tendies, you\u2019ve earned them my friends.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**#8) How I Play My Lockup**\n\nRegardless of how the markets view the earnings report tomorrow, I\u2019m largely HODLing my remaining Palantir shares, as I think Palantir is in a class of it\u2019s own, lapping the competition like SpaceX and Tesla.\n\nI do have a professional advisor and we have prepared tax-optimized divestment strategies for a number of scenarios, but none of those scenarios involve paper handing out of my remaining position, regardless of a good, bad, or ugly response to the 2020 earnings report tomorrow.\n\nWhy would I sell now if I believe that FAANG-like is growth coming over the next 10 years? Why would I sell when I think Palantir in 2021 is like Mercedes F1 in 2014 about to go on a worldwide domination over the next few years? Also, with the shares finally unlocked, I can borrow against them for the first time.\n\nI've already responsibly taken enough off the table pre-IPO, so I\u2019m not in any rush to sell. My first substantial limit order will be at a market cap of \\~$100B with a ladder up to \\~$250B. So I\u2019m skeptical that I\u2019ll sell any more than 5% of my remaining shares this week.\n\nThat\u2019s my $0.02 on Demo Day and some of the recent news.\n\nSo long, and thanks for all the tendies. See ya at the restaurant at the end of the universe PLTR gang!\n\n# \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\n\n# \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 22nd, 2021.\n\n# **Stronger economic data could power stocks that thrive in a rebound in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/stronger-economic-data-could-power-stocks-that-thrive-in-a-rebound-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; A decline in new Covid infections, along with improving economic data and stimulus hopes, could boost stocks that flourish in a resurging economy in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, expectations for a strong economic rebound helped boost interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; While the broader stock market was choppy, sectors that do well in a rebound \u2013 financials, airlines and industrials \u2013 stood out as leaders. This is known as the reflation trade.\n*****\n&gt; Those stocks gained at the expense of growth and technology, down 2%. Strategists expect that reflation trade to continue as signs suggest that the economy could make a sharp comeback.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.7% on the week to 3,906, while the Dow was up a tiny 0.1% at 31,494. The Nasdaq was off 1.57% for the week, to 13,874, with the decline in tech. Apple, for instance, gave up 4% on the week.\n*****\n&gt; The big event in the week ahead is testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who delivers his semi-annual testimony on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; He is expected to discuss the increase in interest rates, as well as concerns that inflation could begin to take off.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to acknowledge that the data is improving and the virus situation is improving quite materially,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America. \u201cIt is going to be hard for him to sound as dovish as he has been.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Powell is expected to continue to emphasize that the Fed will keep rates low for a long time and maintain its easy policies to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; # Improving forecasts\n&gt; Economists this past week ratcheted up tracking forecasts for first quarter gross domestic product, fueled in part by an unexpectedly sharp jump of 5.3% in January retail sales.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman upped first-quarter growth to 6%, and Morgan Stanley said it was tracking at 7.5% for the first quarter. Economists linked the surprise gain in retail sales to stimulus checks sent to individuals under the last $900 billion stimulus program approved by Congress in late December.\n*****\n&gt; The Biden administration has proposed another $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. That could come before the House of Representatives in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; \u2033[Powell\u2019s] going to stick to the script. The script is lawmakers need to continue to provide support for the economy. He\u2019s going to be supportive of the administration\u2019s effort to get a big package through,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n*****\n&gt; # Key data during the week\n&gt; Earnings continue to be important. There are more than 60 companies reporting, including Home Depot, Macy\u2019s and TJX.\n*****\n&gt; Key economic reports dropping next week include durable goods on Thursday, along with personal income and spending data on Friday\n*****\n&gt; The Friday report includes the personal consumption expenditure price index, which the Fed monitors. The market is on the lookout for signs of rising inflation.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the boom is going to start sooner than most people think,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.\n*****\n&gt; He said the stronger economy is helping drive Treasury yields higher, with the 10-year hitting a one-year high of 1.36% on Friday. Keon said the vaccine rollout is helping the outlook, as is the slowing spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think people were expecting a second-half boom, but I think the second quarter is going to be very strong, as people change their behavior,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe caution when it comes to savings and not going out, that\u2019s going to go away sooner than we think,\u201d Keon said. \u201cRight now, you might see a 10% GDP number in the second or third quarter. That\u2019s also due to the fact we\u2019re likely to get a big stimulus package.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said investors are underestimating the surge in economic activity that should start in March and pick up steam in the second and third quarter as more people resume dining out and other activities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the world is going to look very different than it has over the past 12 months. We\u2019re still bullish. We\u2019re still overweight stocks,\u201d Keon said.\n*****\n&gt; He said a flood of money could hit the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe size of the U.S. economy last year was about $21 trillion,\u201d Keon added. \u201cHouseholds now have excess savings of about $1.5 trillion and the stimulus package probably will be in the vicinity of $1.2, $1.6 trillion.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the service sector should start to see a benefit that has been lifting the goods making side of the economy. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see an incredible boom.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KHikwKA.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qGZEgZB.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/E5ZhAnt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/TIhMYEf.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Y65lpFs.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EY3NC9X.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wmMRYoi.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VasEMj8.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uOalt0h.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/SMspx2i.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RP7xVdo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Value Outperforming Growth But Only for Large Caps\n\n&gt; While the S&amp;P 500 traded lower today, value stocks had a strong finish to the week. Starting with a look at dividend stocks, the iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) rose 1.35% today for its best day since January 6th when DVY rose nearly 4%. As shown below, DVY has recently been on a tear.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-DVY.png))**\n\n&gt; Along with the dividend ETF (DVY), the iShares S&amp;P 500 Value ETF (IVE) rose 0.31%, reaching a new 52-week high intraday. That compares to the growth counterpart, the iShares S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), which saw a bearish engulfing on its 0.65% decline. Today was the widest outperformance for value (IVE) over growth (IVW) since mid-January. As shown below, while both are still trending nicely higher long-term, the value ETF is at new highs while growth is closer to its 50-day moving average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**\n\n&gt; Value's outperformance today only applied to large caps, though. While small caps have fallen over the past several sessions, the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) and Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) both rebounded nicely today with identical gains of 2.08%. In the case of small-cap growth (IWO), the recent declines have been more severe meaning today's strong performance still leaves it further below its highs than small-cap value (IWN).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-R2K.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-R2K.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Industrial Metals Shining Bright\n\n&gt; While precious metals like gold have been facing their fair share of selling recently alongside rates, elsewhere in the metals markets, industrial metals have been surging. Year to date, industrial metals\u2014as proxied by the Bloomberg Industrial Metals total return index\u2014are up 11.43% while their precious metals counterpart is down by over 4%. With a fairly flat January, most of those gains have come from this month alone. As shown below, so far this month the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index has risen 11.41% for its strongest performance through the first 14 trading days of a month since September of 2012. Going back to the start of the index in early 1991, the only other months with stronger performance were March of 2008 (11.42) and April of 2006 (14.94).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Again, whereas industrial metals are flying, precious metals have been trending lower since the summer. In the chart below, we show the relative strength of the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index versus the precious metal counterpart index over the past five years. Times that the line is rising indicates outperformance of industrial metals and vice versa. Precious metals had been outperforming since mid-2018, but the relative strength line bottomed out back in August of last year. From then through the late fall, industrial metals outperformed, and after some consolidation from November through the end of January, industrials are once again outperforming in a big way.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-3.png))**\n\n&gt; Delving deeper, tin, copper, and nickel have been leading in those gains. As shown in the charts below, both year to date and over the past year, these three metals have risen the most with tin in the number one spot in both respects.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-2.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-4a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One Year Later: 3 Lessons Learned Since the Market Peak\n\n&gt; \u201cBulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.\u201d Old Wall Street saying.\n\n&gt; Today marks one year since the market began to price in the effects that COVID-19 would have on the world. The old market adage \u201cstairs up, elevator down\u201d certainly rang true over the coming weeks, as the S&amp;P 500 recorded the fastest bear market (closing 20% below a previous all-time high) in history, accomplishing that feat in a mere 16 days.\n\n&gt; The stock market is a peculiar mechanism however, and despite the turmoil the world has experienced since the outbreak of the pandemic, the S&amp;P 500 marched forward to set new all-time highs less than 6 months later on August 18 and hasn\u2019t looked back. So after such a wild year since the market peaked on this day in 2020, what have we learned?\n\n&gt; **1. Markets are forward looking.** While it\u2019s difficult to pin down a date when we can expect our lives to completely return to normal, the stock market is already pricing in the normalization of daily life, even if that remains uncertain. Economic conditions around the world have been improving relative to how they were at the beginning of the pandemic. While pockets of weakness remain, the market is more concerned with where the economic conditions will be, not where they are currently.\n\n&gt; **2. Sector performance is dynamic.** Investing in \u201cstay at home\u201d themed growth and technology stocks whose earnings were viewed to be relatively well insulated by the effects of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns provided both downside protection during the March volatility as well as outperformance after the market bottomed. However, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, conventional early-cycle leadership from financials and energy stocks has emerged over the past three months:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.19.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; **3. Remember your timeline.** Everyone would love to be able to pull their money at the exact top, avoid all major market corrections and reinvest at the bottom, but unfortunately, there is no holy grail timing mechanism and market volatility is the cost of admission for stock investing. \u201cIt\u2019s our jobs as investors to focus on our long-term goals,\u201d noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cDrawdowns and bear markets are part of the path to get there, and limiting the latest shiny object from affecting our decisions is key to any investment strategy.\u201d If an investor pulled their money from the market during last year\u2019s volatility, there have been a plethora of reasons to be hesitant to reinvest it, and the subsequent bounce from the lows happened in a flash, meaning they may have bought back in at a higher price than they originally sold.\n\n&gt; Thankfully, bear markets and extreme volatility like we experienced last year are rare, but they provide a unique learning opportunity for investors. No one truly knows what the future holds for the stock market, so making sure we learn from the past is crucial for long-term success as investors.

The sharp increase in new COVID-19 cases led to additional curbs on activity to contain the virus, triggering a rise in weekly jobless claims, and many feared we might have a double-dip recession.\n\n&gt; Sensing a need to act, Congress passed a fifth relief bill at the end of December, including additional direct payments to households. The lame-duck injection of fiscal stimulus to the US economy was just what it needed. Following a weak retail sales number in December\u2014ordinarily one of the strongest months for retail sales\u2014consumer spending rebounded firmly in January, rising 5.3% month over month according to the US Census Bureau\u2014the most in seven months\u2014and greater than all of the estimates in the Bloomberg economist survey.\n\n&gt; Looking under the hood makes the headline number even more remarkable. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the largest month over month increases came in categories associated with discretionary spending, including a 23.5% surge in spending at department stores:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blog-2.18.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cFiscal stimulus was just what the doctor ordered for the US consumer in January,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe boom in spending on discretionary categories could become a trend if a wave of pent-up demand gets unleashed on the economy in 2021.\u201d\n\n&gt; Clearly, direct payments to households had a major effect on January\u2019s retail sales, so does this mean that February sales will disappoint? Not exactly. Direct payments to households totaled roughly $166 billion, but the increase in January sales was only $29 billion and the savings rate remains high. Of course, not all of that money was spent on retail items, but there may be some gas left in the tank for February retail sales, particularly by individuals who didn\u2019t receive their payments until later in the month or who will be receiving a credit on their federal tax returns.\n\n&gt; Earlier this month, we raised our gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the US from 4\u20134.5% to 5\u20135.5%. Yesterday\u2019s retail sales number puts us on a solid path toward achieving that target\u2014and may even raise the prospects of exceeding it. The first quarter of 2021 is expected to be the weakest of the year, so the January surge in retail sales removes much of the risk of the US economy stumbling out of the gates as we begin 2021.\n\n&gt; However, a strong start to the year may embolden the call for a smaller price tag for President Biden\u2019s fiscal stimulus proposal. Despite this, we ultimately believe a stimulus package north of $1 trillion is likely, which should prime the US economy for continued growth in 2021 as the battle against COVID-19 improves.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Tech Leading in New Highs\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been reversing from its record highs over the past couple of sessions, but on an individual stock basis there are still a large number of names that have reached new 52-week highs. As shown in the charts from our Daily Sector Snapshot below, through yesterday's close, a net percentage of just over 15% of the S&amp;P 500 reached new 52-week highs. That is the strongest reading in new highs since January 12th. Outside of several days at the start of 2021, the only other days of the pandemic era with as high if not higher readings were September 2nd, October 9th, and November 9th. Most of the sectors are also seeing their number of new highs rise to strong levels. In addition to the S&amp;P 500, yesterday's reading for Communication Services, Financials, Materials, and Tech all were in the top decile of all days since at least 1990. In the case of Materials, while new highs have been trending higher and yesterday's reading was historically strong, it was still well off the record highs from earlier this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH.png))**\n\n&gt; On the other hand, perhaps the most impressive sector in terms of net new highs has been Technology. Yesterday, 35.53% of the sector's stocks reached a new 52-week high. Not only is that the highest reading with respect to the other sectors, but that high reading also stands in the top 0.5% of all days for the sector since at least 1990. In other words, there have only been 38 other days since 1990 that the Tech sector saw as strong of a reading in net new highs as yesterday. The most recent of those was November 9th when 43.84% of the sector touched a new 52-week high. Overall, in the context of more broadly positive breadth with strong readings in new highs for other sectors, Tech's large number of new highs is an added plus for the broader market given the massive 28.08% weight of the sector.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH-Tech.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Cap Growth Taking the Lead\n\n&gt; One of the topics we covered in last Friday's Bespoke Report was the outperformance of small caps over the past year. Even on a much shorter time horizon, that outperformance has been evident. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, in the five days ending last Friday and on a year to date basis, both Small Cap Growth (IJR) and Small Cap Value (IJS) have been two of the top-performing ETFs in our US Styles screen while large-cap counterparts have also been higher but with more modest gains. With a particular focus on growth stocks, while the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Growth (IJT) ETF was up the most of these ETFs last week with a 3.96% gain, the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) was the second-worst performer after 'only' rising 1.05%. That continued a trend that has been in place YTD with the performance spread between the two ETFs topping ten percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-TA.png))**\n\n&gt; We are coming up on the one-year anniversary of the last highs on February 19th, 2020 just before the COVID crash. For most of the past year since then, large-cap growth (IVW) had actually been outperforming small-cap growth (IJT), but since the new year began, small-cap growth has jumped ahead. Now, the S&amp;P Small Cap Growth ETF (IJT) is up 35.31% since the 2/19/20 high compared to a 28.16% gain for the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). As shown in the second chart below, IJT had been catching up on IVW for some time now though. The relative strength line of IJT versus IVW had been in a downtrend for most of the past five years meaning large-cap growth had been generally outperforming the small-cap counterpart. Since the lows last March, the line trended sideways meaning neither one saw significant outperformance, but come the fall, the line has taken off in favor of small caps. With more outperformance in the past week and a half, that line has turned sharply higher once again reaching the highest level since December of 2019 last week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-Small-vs-large-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Is A/D Line Signally Late-February Weakness?\n\n&gt; Back on January 21 in our February Almanac post our Market Probability Chart highlighted the pattern of late-February seasonal weakness. A disappointing jobless claims number today appears to be the straw the sent the market lower. In this chart of the NASDAQ 100 Index (NDX) I have overlaid the NASDAQ Composite Advance/Decline Line. The NASDAQ A/D Line peaked and flattened out about six trading days ago and is now heading lower.\n\n&gt; This coincides with the seasonal pattern of late-February weakness. However, we expect recent support to hold above 13,000. Should that level be breached major support exists around the old September doji high of 12,240. Considering how far the market has come in the face of some formidable economic and pandemic obstacles and how frothy sentiment had become, a little consolidation and pullback is to be expected.\n\n&gt; We may see some further weakness into month-end and into March, but with vaccine rollout gaining some traction, more stimulus likely and a supportive Fed we do not expect any major selloff at this juncture.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e5f4b2427b7d5d4b28aae29e57eecf9b/74d4cbea052ab1c5-33/s500x750/45f747ae1ae952b17ebfa05517216899ec4f49ae.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jtxCols.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/b6PPTlQ.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.22.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EcVeV4l.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.22.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/Iz5xLzt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  2.23.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4p4q8a9.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.23.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EgzN86P.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ODRTBoH.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.24.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/3udXvVZ.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/sMcEWeM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.24.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EHTrDMd.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bzVMSxO.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/79N1qSy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.25.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/WwOgLCj.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/wZD3pAb.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.25.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FztoNlM.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MuAL2DJ.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/gkCoskC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.26.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UCHvMLo.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.26.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/To6WCZh.png))\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # NVIDIA Corp. $597.06\n**NVIDIA Corp.

        "selftext": "Yesterday I posted a lengthy DD on Palantir Technologies ($PLTR), where I went in-depth on my evaluation of the firm's history, its financials, and why I believe the naysayers are wrong (Link included here:[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq8rw4/i\\_think\\_pltr\\_is\\_invincible\\_rn\\_and\\_in\\_the\\_long\\_run/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq8rw4/i_think_pltr_is_invincible_rn_and_in_the_long_run/) )-i do recommend reading this first, this post is meant to be a follow-up/supplement to my liking of this stock.\n\nBut I wanted to go more in-depth into just why I find this company so special and unique. As I mentioned in my DD last night, I am just a 19-year-old college student, not an investment banker or hotshot market maker, but I believe the information I have ascertained about Palantir by just scouring the web distinguishes it from any company on the planet (but we'll keep it strictly to the software industry in this DD).\n\nWhat is truly unique about Palantir's software (Gotham, Foundry, Apollo) is how collaborative, scalable, and advanced it is. Let me break this down: Palantir's software is COLLABORATIVE b/c it meshes the company's clients' data into a mega cloud. For example, the LAPD, BP, JP Morgan, and top law firms all upload their data onto Palantir's cloud, where they can get insights into efficiency, efficacy, and receive suggestions from the advanced software on how to improve their venture (these guys are all PLTR clients btw), and particularly useful for say, defending an embassy or managing a supply chain.\n\nNow, just to get it straight, there is no data/cloud that can come ANYWHERE close to the insights and knowledge on what Palantir has.  You might often hear from Wall Street research analysts/CNBC shills who complain that PLTR has too many rich clients (big companies/gov't). But I think what boomers don't understand is that building your foundation amongst the biggest fish in the sea is quite the ADVANTAGE, not a weakness.\n\nLet me use an example from our beloved Cathie Wood and her firm Ark Invest's large position in Tesla extremely quickly (I promise). When asked about how she felt about Tesla's performance in the autonomous driving space compared to competitors like Waymo (owned by Google), she commented last year that **having a vast collection of data** would separate those who succeed from those who attempt. As a reference, Tesla cars all transmit self-driving data back to the firm, which comes about through the many Tesla owners who drive all over the world. On the other hand, Waymo is committed to private testing stages only, which is shallow-minded b/c it doesn't have access to trial data on say, congested roads.\n\nBack to PLTR. The reason I bring up the Waymo-Tesla-Ark example is to highlight just how many clients PLTR's revenue base represents, and how impactful that is on a company's growth, scalability, and ultimately, the *success of their product*. But I mean when you think about it, Palantir's clientele is the **ENTIRE GLOBAL ECONOMY/SOCIETY**. Go to the *Financial Times*, and try to find me an article that doesn't talk up Palantir's greatness in the U.K and their work helping NIH. EU members like Greece/France also use it for COVID vaccine tracking. Palantir has contracts with the Japanese/South Korean governments. Palantir has notably helped the U.S. catch infamous cucks like Osama Bin Laden to Bernie Madoff. Quite the diversity!\n\nThe reason for that entire BJ to Palantir right there is to illustrate just how extensive this scale is. Not only is all this data accessible RIGHT NOW to all these clients to collaborate on Palantir's platform, but is comprised of the single most dominant and sustainable institutions/enterprises in the world. No matter how the political winds blow or how the global/domestic economy winds up, you can count on 3M, the DoD, Ferrari- to name a few- to continue seeking ways to scale, grow, expand, and Palantir certainly is the way.\n\nThis gets back to another central, bulletproof thesis surrounding Palantir. Who are its competitors? Who can do what Palantir does? \n\nLet's start with Snowflake. All credit to their talented team, Warren Buffett, and their gang of bulge bracket banks who underwrote their IPO and cheerlead the stock on media outlets on the daily. But for lack of a better word, their software just isn't *dope* enough. I mean the UI contrast speaks for itself, but the intelligence is what matters here. Yes, data warehousing is no joke and is certainly a scalable business, but what kind of innovative insights can you draw from just essentially a digital warehouse that doesn't add any value? All Snowflake really is is Salesforce dressed up in pretty bells and whistles. Really makes me question Buffett's whole commitment to \"value.\"\n\n[C3.AI](https://C3.AI) at least has me interested. It seems like a real knock-off version of Palantir based on what I can ascertain from their public materials, but so what? A bunch of washed-up junkies from Oracle think they can lead the transition to AI? Compared to a company that was seeded in 2003 specifically to work with the CIA and other intelligence agencies after 9/11 (PLTR also called the \"gold standard\" by these agencies according to *TechCrunch*), why waste your time in [C3.AI](https://C3.AI) or Snowflake? Don't even get make me started on Splunk, IBM (who conceded they suck by signing on w/ PLTR last week), or MSFT.\n\nAnd while we're at it, let's talk about valuations to drive the point home. According to the *Financial Times,* PLTR is valued at a $48B market cap and is trading at 34X 2021 estimated sales. To start, yes that is very lofty, even after accounting for the recent sell-off due to earnings/lock-up fears. But I'll pick on my prime targets, SNOW and AI, if we can even call them competitors (we'll be nice). SNOW has just under an $80B market cap, but is trading at 80x 2021 estimated sales! AI is trading at a $15B market cap, and is trading at 70.5x 2020 estimated sales!! That's fucking crazy, and Buffett should sell SNOW immediately if he cares about value (or he just doesn't understand technology).\n\nSince the whole speculation is going to be about earnings in the next few years, let's talk about that. As I mentioned in my DD yesterday, PLTR reported EPS of $0.06/share on a non-GAAP basis, which is TRIPLE what the street predicted!! But thanks to a $100M stockholder compensation expense, the GAAP basis was a loss of $0.02/share, and Wall ST took the opportunity to AMBUSH PLTR. \n\nIf you understand how business development works, these incentives are necessary in the early stages of a company. How else do you expect to attract top talent to the company and incentivize existing brains to stay? But as you grow into your valuations, like PLTR will, why do you need to do it? (PLTR has essentially promised 30% + growth for 5+ years, and earnings are on the way this year thanks to their earnings report). Who does Apple need to incentivize to stay? Wall St is simply trying to make something out of nothing.\n\nI also mentioned PLTR was a direct-listing yesterday, unlike any of these other names here. If you don't know what that means, basically PLTR didn't have its IPO underwritten by banks or pay them massive fees in the process. So equity research, investment banking, asset management, and other areas of lucrative finance have no incentive to talk up PLTR (just Jeffries it seems for now).\n\nAnd this is what I mean. Again as I mentioned yesterday, it happens with all megacap tech companies. Think about it as evolution. Facebook. Apple. Tesla. Google. Microsoft. These guys weren't oversubscribed by the money makers either, nor were they cheaply valued either. But by the time the robust top line translated into earnings, these firms were worth hundreds of billions of $ with the snap of your fingers, which is exactly what will happen with Palantir (we are already seeing this- their institutional ownership nearly doubled from 12% in January to 21% right now).\n\nThis is what I want you all to think about. As a disclosure, I am very long PLTR (you can view my positions on yesterday's DD), but irregardless of whether you will invest in it or not, read about Palantir Technologies. This is the company of the future: able to tailor its cutting-edge technology to all the intricate challenges the 21st century projects: climate change, further space exploration, geopolitical/nuclear tensions, renewable energy adoption, inequality, police reform, and so much more, while providing a platform for all these parties to collaborate and improve. Given the world is an ever expanding place, and the dominant players are already seated at the table, I could not feel more relieved or excited than to have all my chips in the one waiter who will serve them all.\n\n\\*\\***This is not financial advice. I recommend you read up on PLTR, pour through its financials, and hear more from its CEO, Alex Karp, and Chairman, Peter Thiel- then make your own informed, balanced, intelligent, rational decision. Without a doubt, this will be** ***the*** **company being discussed in the decades to come, and I just want to expedite the conversation now.**",

        "selftext": "FIRST OF ALL I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR AND I AM NOT AUTHORIZED TO GIVE YOU INVESTMENT ADVICE.\n\nHoldings [https://i.imgur.com/ayvuyB1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ayvuyB1.jpg)\n\nWhen it comes to stock picking I like to consume information from a variety of sources to get a better understanding of what's going on in the world of economics today, this week, this month, this year, this decade, this century. Remember that mainstream media has its own agenda and the CEO or hedge fund manager being interviewed is typically only there to benefit themselves.\n\nI start looking for sectors with potential price movement based on the direction I think the world is going.\n\n    EXAMPLE 1: News reports about climate change. Democratic leader Joe Biden becomes president and has made climate change a priority. Biden wants to increase jobs and green technologies. Automotive manufacturers to start producing more electric vehicles.\n    \n    TRADE IDEA: Long EV car production. Short oil.\n    \n    \n    \n    EXAMPLE 2: Frequent news reports about pandemic. People stay at home instead of going to the workplace.\n    \n    TRADE IDEA: Long remote working, DIY home renovation. Short travel, hotel, cruise.\n    \n    \n    \n    EXAMPLE 3: Recurring news reports about companies getting hacked which leads to more businesses being concerned about their digital security.\n    \n    TRADE IDEA: Long security companies. Short company that got hacked.\n\n*The trick is to get really good at the skill of understanding what's going on but isn't being widely discussed yet. Do this by consuming lots of information from a variety of sources to the point where a logical conclusion or prediction can be made about what is likely to happen in the future within a specific sector and time frame.*\n\nNot all the information consumed should be via media. Before covid a great technique was to simply take note of which stores are extraordinarily busy at the shopping mall and ask why is this store busy but not that one?\n\nAnother great way to discover new stocks is to talk with industry experts.\n\n    I remember chatting with a friend way back in 2009 who worked in marketing for a digital agency and they kept talking about this cool new tool called Salesforce because of how much it's helped them with their job.\n\nAfter identifying a potential stock or sector that interests me, I'll start looking for top performing ETFs within the same sector. Then inside those ETFs I'll look for the top 3 names that frequently appear inside those ETFs. Sometimes the ETF itself is the best decision, sometimes it's not.\n\nFor each of those top 3 I'll look at their annual reports.\n\n* Do they have revenue? Why not?\n* Is revenue rising or falling quarterly? How about annually?\n* Do they have debt?\n* Is debt rising or falling?\n* Does leadership have years of relevant experience?\n\nNext I'll look at the chart as zoomed out as it can go. What's the trend? Up, flat, down?\n\nThen I'll zoom in the chart notch by notch looking for the trend. Annually, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, 30mins, 15mins, 5mins, 1min.\n\n**I buy when I've identified potential price movement, the price is low, and is hovering around a level that has support.**\n\n**I sell when I need the cash to invest in something else or when I no longer believe in the future of the company or sector.**\n\nI don't pay attention to anybody pumping a stock with emojis. Why? Because emojis are used to represent emotion and if you make an investment or trade decision based on emotion or hype you're doing it wrong and in most cases are probably too late anyways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; \n\nSpend 80% of your \"investing time\" coming up with original trade ideas and 20% on technicals and charts when you execute the trade.\n\nIf you aren't trading with your own ideas and instead choose to follow someone else's buy recommendation then I hate to break it to you, but you'll probably end up buying into someone else's exit strategy and become a bag holder for days, weeks, months or even years to come just waiting for that big turnaround day which may never come.",

        "selftext": "So... this could be a bit long, but let me double down  on my thoughts on PLTR. Recently, we\u2019ve seen a little turmoil in the broader market that has scared some growth investors, and I do think there is some justifiable fear.\n\nA lot of folks are going to tell you this is a great discount on names like TSLA or PLUG, and I certainly don\u2019t disagree with them- I just want to have all my bases covered.\n\nNow we have seen some structural shifts in the broader market. The 10-Year shift up to 1.35% is a noticable tick up, and this is something all of us \ud83e\udd8d have to be wary of.\n\nAs much as I like discounts, when the market prices in tighter money, the Fed will have to listen. I believe Uncle Jay will continue to have the market\u2019s back, and I think the 10-Year should be capped at roughly 1.5-2%. We\u2019ll see how this develops, but the bottomline is these forward-looking growth giants are going to get CRUSHED if they miss expectations.\n\nAnd well, if technology continues to be a deflationary pressure through innovation as we all expect, then \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 regardless and we can cap the discussion here.\n\nSo here\u2019s where sweet good PLTR comes into play. I really, really like how they delivered earnings last week. Didn\u2019t REALLY disappoint: beat earnings on a non-GAAP basis and had 45% annual top line growth.\n\nBut that\u2019s not even the kicker for me. The fact that PLTR leadership is essentially guaranteeing at least 30% growth over the next 5 years (read the earnings call transcript), which will look like an absolute bonanza if rates actually start to go up.\n\nNow, the thesis is that growth firms\u2019 future profits are less valuable today if rates start to go up, which would not be great for big growth names like PLTR. But then here\u2019s the thing: it would absolutely WRECK mega tech growth like FAANG or the EV/battery state field.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to earnings. Karp and the PLTR team are essentially setting the bar very low, telling investors to sit back and expect ONLY 30% growth for 5+ years. (For boomers, they realize this is fucking crazy btw).\n\nEssentially, if there is any surprise to the upside, which is totally reasonable with a disruptor like Palantir, and this thing will be worth hundreds of billions in the blink of an eye.\n\nBut think of how all these great stories came about. Tesla in 2017-2019. Facebook in 2012-2013. Apple in 2008-2009. These tech stars never had a straight shot up, and the same goes for PLTR.\n\nThey faced the same problems. I\u2019m only a college student, but I remember for as long as I have been alive from skeptical financial analysts that Tesla was gargantually overvalued and didn\u2019t have the cash to survive in the EV market.\n\nI watched as a kid as some whiz built up a social media platform from his dorm room, but Wall St attacked him for wearing a hoodie to his IPO. Not only did they not think he could expand his platform from PC to mobile, but they questioned how its cutting edge technology differed from Myspace and Tumblr, and wondered if he could ever scale ad revenue. \nHe shore could.\n\nYes, PLTR is overvalued. What isn\u2019t? Snowflake trades for 80X estimated sales. C3.AI trades at 73.5X its 2020 revenues. Salesforce, Splunk, and MSFT ain\u2019t cheap. \n\n(For reference, PLTR is trading just under 37X 2021 sales, which is lofty, but looks reasonable compared to these other names that have way higher multiples and much less sophisticated/scalable software).\n\nAnd if we look at it... PLTR was profitable by roughly $0.06/share if you take out a stockholder compensation expense that otherwise would have left them with $100M+ in operating profit. \n\nIs it profitable? PLTR has 70% fucking margins. How are Finance pricks not creaming over this??? You want high margin/earnings- this is it right here, man.\n\nBut no, no, big bad overvalued Palantir want to pay executives/advisors/shareholders extra money. Bad. Bad- I say they worth $20 in equity research reports and on CNBC instead, but still load up behind the scenes \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd21.\n\nFuck the shills who say Palantir can\u2019t continue robust growth or be profitable. \n\nOn top of that, yes their revenue base is dominated by gov\u2019t clients at roughly 52%, but let\u2019s pause and realize this is a good thing. I mean... i don\u2019t want to get too political here, but broadly, you\u2019re a fool if you think the Dod, DoJ, or CDC/NIAID are cutting back anytime soon (amongst alm of them, they have dozens of contracts with PLTR worth hundreds of millions of $).\n\nAnd let\u2019s take what Cathie Wood said the other day: roughly along the lines that some of the greatest innovations come from the military. I think we can point to the WWW as a pretty decent example of that.\n\nGiven PLTR traces its roots to the CIA\u2019s venture capital arm and loading up on national security contracts with all the intelligence agencies after 9/11, I feel pretty confident that this will provide much value in revenue AND earnings to PLTR, especially if rates starts to rise.\n\nFurthermore, the cross that bogged Tesla, Apple, FB, and pretty much every mega cap tech company is restraining Palantir right now. The Street wonders if they will be able to continue locking down corporate clients, which it has been rapidly expanding in recent years.\n\nThe answer is yes. But Wall St doesn\u2019t want you to think so at the moment. B/c PLTR was a direct listing, they weren\u2019t underwritten by investment banks, and thus don\u2019t receive the same financial shilling that names like Snowflake or C3.AI do.\n\nBut we almost just always double down on our convictions. If you have seen Palantir\u2019s demos, read its financials, or listened to their CEO, then you know the potential of this company.\n\nI believe in people. I believe in Peter Thiel and his track record. I believe a guy who founded PayPal with Elon Musk, seeded Facebook when no one else would, and decided to seed PLTR w/ the CIA (when no one else would)- yes, I believe he knows what he is doing.\n\nAnd I believe he is capable of finding talent like Alex Carp and collaborating with him to build an absolute behemoth.\n\nAs a disclosure, I am very long PLTR and am simply sharing my thoughts. This is not financial advice.\n\nPLTR TO THE MOON \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "**Hello everyone! This isn\u2019t my usual kind of post, but man, I can\u2019t stand to see how people just follow every freaking YouTuber out there blindly!** In this post, we are going to talk about why I believe Tom Nash may be a **fraud**, so please do have some patience and read the full post, as I will go through an in-depth research of his past and his claims.\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nLet\u2019s start by talking about who Tom Nash is &amp; says he is. He is a new &amp; trendy \u201cfinance &amp; stock market\u201d YouTuber which has recently passed 150K subscribers after exploding during this retail investor boom, but here is a short [video](https://imgur.com/yuNMUlv) from his YouTube describing himself.\n\nIn the video he is claiming he is a former \u201csenior financial analyst\u201d which is very hard to believe in my opinion after doing a lot of research about him.\n\nSo let\u2019s go through the **5 reasons** I believe he is lying about his past &amp; why you should never take anything any YouTuber out there says for granted and you should do your own research as well:\n\n**1)  Let\u2019s start with the biggest one, his valuation methods are flawed**\n\nEven though he has posted some videos that have panned out, it\u2019s very hard to differentiate good analysis from pure luck in this recent bull market, even monkeys could throw darts at stocks in the past 11 months and be right after the March sell-off.\n\nI was pretty curious of his valuation methods so I joined his channel membership and asked him a direct question, about his DCF valuation, to which he [responded](https://imgur.com/Zdtm2dI) bluntly that I am doing things wrong. I also sent him a direct link to a well-known financial institute, where we can see that the most common cash flow used for financial [modeling](https://imgur.com/MSJgiSk), which is the unlevered free cash flow, implies that you subtract any capital expenditures of the company, which contradicts the way he sees it and is plain wrong, it\u2019s like he uses 2nd grade math, if you subtract a negative number then your cash flow actually increases, which doesn\u2019t even make sense. How can something that costs you money be a positive on the free cash flow?\n\nI\u2019ll let you digest this as I will next show you some of his DCF valuations &amp; how he uses absurd numbers and changes the formulas as he pleases just to reach some insane valuations for companies just to be catchy.\n\nHere are a couple of short extracts from his Salesforce DCF calculations,\n\n[**Exibit A**](https://streamable.com/vu2agx) \\- everything seems legit until here, now he starts with the biggest mistake in this DCF\n\n[**Exibit B**](https://imgur.com/BWeAZw8) \\- I\u2019ll be blunt you can never, ever add the Capex number to a DCF valuation, that literally throws the hole calculations off, but let\u2019s continue\u2026\n\n[**Exibit C**](https://imgur.com/LgHKupD) \\- So, using a discount rate of 6% is also insane, even with the current low interest rates, you should at least discount the average [SP500](https://imgur.com/YTxt90T) return, or use the WACC or any other type of metric, which is much safer than picking out a single company, as the SP500 has proven over long-stretches to be a great performer.\n\nBut yeah guys, this isn\u2019t the first time he has done these kind of errors, you can see he is using most of these methods in many stock picks which are then spread out to thousands of new investors, who don\u2019t really have the knowledge to test what he is saying. I\u2019m just showing you here a couple of stocks like [Dynatrace](https://imgur.com/hAO37u8), [Opendoor](https://imgur.com/66rMYZe), [Alibaba](https://imgur.com/ikLetLL), [Peloton](https://imgur.com/WRoLdIL), [Salesforce](https://imgur.com/D9Ky3gl) as I showed in the previous video and even [Apple](https://imgur.com/g8k7ZxA) that have been analyzed and spread to the public this way.\n\nThe other big issue with his valuations is that he is using insane long-term growth rates, as he used a 5% growth rate for [Peloton](https://imgur.com/EV2WB9Y) to reach a higher valuation, so can you imagine? If Peloton grows at a 5% rate in perpetuity it means they should more than double the inflation [rate](https://imgur.com/xaN3Dxw) every year and is way higher than any GDP [growth](https://imgur.com/Jkk01c9) the US has seen since 1984.\n\nHe is also [implying](https://imgur.com/Wkd2AV8) that Peloton has no debt on it\u2019s balance sheet, which is 100% false, as you can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/rsB0fJg), he used the cash, cash equivalents &amp; marketable securities to calculate the short term assets while completely ignoring the over $700M in accounts payable no to mention the other current liabilities which would add up to almost exactly the $1.4B in assets he added to his calculations.\n\nBut who knows guys? Maybe he is the real deal, as he has made some [correct](https://imgur.com/v3ZYhSU) DCF implications for some stocks like [Fortinet](https://imgur.com/kCTo7jC) and [FuboTV](https://imgur.com/vojljFt), by actually subtracting the Capex finally, though he doesn\u2019t do this in every analysis, not even in the most recent ones while also keeping that big long-term growth rate at 5%, when I myself never use a bigger one than 4%.\n\nJust for an [example](https://imgur.com/tnWSWVa) I took his CRM numbers and popped them up in my spreadsheets, and even given his methods I couldn\u2019t quite get to the same results without manually editing numbers, as those implications resulted in a 7% undervaluation for the stock, while only adjusting the Capex to be a negative on the cashflows and not touching anything else that might be wrong in this DCF, [resulted](https://imgur.com/5vxgKqI) in a 10% overvaluation for the stock.\n\nSo, I think if he really was a 10+ years wall street analyst I don\u2019t think he could have made these obvious mistakes.\n\n**2) So, Is Tom Nash whom he says he is or is he lying about his past?**\n\n[HERE](https://imgur.com/wbJ8Csh) is the channel intro for his YouTube (Which I can't even see anymore, but i was lucky to download it a couple of days ago)\n\nAs you Can see, I don\u2019t doubt that he actually went to Michigan or that he got and MBA, but I do doubt that all of his Successful \u201cSenior\u201d Financial analyst &amp; consulting Career can be described with only a couple of weak-ass photos of him at an NBA game, or him casually at some kind of a course program as that is exactly what it looks like with the other guys in the back-left of the photo.\n\nAlso, are we to believe all of this great financial career ended with him just taking out his fake plant from his office, while also smiling as he threw away at least a decent salary for a gamble on YouTube, which is very hard to do, especially when you are starting, as YouTube doesn\u2019t really help the small guys.\n\nHis YouTube journey seemed to have [started](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) on the path of exposing guru\u2019s and not financial advice, as he also says in the video, so how did he turn to do financial analysis on YouTube? Seems pretty convenient that he just became an expert in stock analysis as YouTube videos on such things were booming.\n\nYou can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/Vq4ov7x), he didn\u2019t make a single stock analysis for the most part of 2020, which seems pretty off, as now most of his videos are on stock analysis, and while his channel was created in 2017, he conveniently deleted all the previous videos, which is another weird move to do.\n\nI also went on a deep internet dive and did a lot of searching about him and I found this video [podcast](https://imgur.com/09mBKRU) of him.\n\nHis main intro in this podcast is that he works as a consultant indeed, from Israel, and also the consultancy job isn\u2019t for a financial company, it\u2019s rather to help people on YouTube grow, so let's look at some extracts from the video:\n\n[**Exibit I**](https://streamable.com/xrbv3o) \\- We can see the main part of the talk is nothing about anything related to his financial past, let\u2019s continue\n\n[**Exibit II**](https://imgur.com/Ziftnpi) \\- It seems he started with a gaming channel, not even a fake guru channel, and I also found something about that FB [GROUP](https://imgur.com/Xdt4H1i) which isn\u2019t active anymore and all of the videos he made for that have also been deleted as you can see in this [post](https://imgur.com/FyKSrIq) from way back in 2018 as he was [teaching](https://imgur.com/T5lbbH2) how to make money on YouTube well through 2019, and was even giving out free workshop [experiences](https://imgur.com/K89Yk3S)  as he was pumping out creator [content](https://imgur.com/z196rMB) which is miles apart from financial analysis (BTW, he is using the same freaking photo in his old banner &amp; logo as his current one, just changing the green screen background), just look at [his](https://imgur.com/JUnuYDE) old YouTube banner (YouTube tips &amp; tutorials)\n\n[**Exibit III**](https://imgur.com/kZddAl3) \\- Yeah, it seems he also did some video on how to promote on Reddit, and what comes next guys is literally mind blowing, how much more can this dude lie &amp; hide?\n\n[**Exibit IV**](https://streamable.com/ji6ne2) \\-  Well\u2026 Nothing to hide then\u2026 He even had a Fiverr account which was called tomernash you can see clearly [HERE](https://imgur.com/topDW52), that is his username, and when I went out to check it out right now, he is [using](https://imgur.com/HVqNkwv) a fake picture &amp; and still might live in Israel, not the US, and on top of this he might not actually even be from Russia, which he has been saying over &amp; over again on his channel. You can [SEE](https://imgur.com/18Yiimf) he reiterates he is a certified YouTube consultant with no mention of his financial skills or certifications.\n\nAnd even more, you see what picture he uses as a logo yeah? Well, I did a reverse google search and found the other guy also has a YouTube [channel](https://imgur.com/DWpofDb) about kinetic cycling.\n\nMaybe he was one of his clients that he reached a deal to use his picture, wtf, the more I dig in the more I am amazed of the lengths this man has gone to reach fame on YouTube.\n\n[**Exibit V**](https://streamable.com/sdtd7d) \\- So\u2026 A financial analyst with no sheets, no paper, no nothing, great stuff for a senior financial analyst, I literally can\u2019t take more of this so let\u2019s move to the next reasons\n\n**3) Getting in front of the lie?**\n\nI believe that\u2019s what he was trying to do to, by making a [VIDEO](https://imgur.com/CeH7ePh) on this very subject in mid-2020 and popping up higher in the search rankings before his channel boomed.\n\nIn the video he clarifies that Tom Nash isn\u2019t his real name, but he also restated that he was working for a big consultancy firm as recent as this summer, and that he does shit tons of stuff which is very hard to believe, as usually this big consultancy firms have different departments for different things that he mentioned in the video. You can still find that video on his channel if you are interested\n\nBut, by the way, how was he working on that job while also doing hundreds of Fiverr jobs as a YouTube consultant?\n\nHe also claims to not offering any courses, e-books or other stuff like this, which is false as i showed in the previous reasons with his past YouTube courses &amp; other stuff, and as you will see in the next reasons, something smells really bad out here.\n\n**4) Claims about his past**\n\nI also took a deeper dive into more of his past, as you can see in [his](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) previous channel cover and info, he had only about 4K subscribers as he was doing guru video reviews on YouTube, but all of a sudden, he [became](https://imgur.com/r6X2yHg) a senior financial analyst from wall street that was living in Israel &amp; doing Fiverr gigs, I don\u2019t know what to say but it seems pretty fishy to me.\n\nI also checked his LinkedIn [page](https://imgur.com/Xpbq7Im), and all of his skills &amp; endorsements seem to be related to his YouTube skills and nothing about finance or the stock market.\n\nBut I also found his [profile](https://imgur.com/9FxHnCb) on Quora, where he wasn\u2019t that active but still, well back in [2017](https://imgur.com/EUPer8h) he was posting things about gaming &amp; YouTube while supposedly still working on Wall Street as a financial analyst, and it\u2019s interesting that there is no [mention](https://imgur.com/kcpxh2X) of him following anything related to stocks, finance, economy, accounting, statistics or anything other related to the stock market.\n\nSo yeah guys, I guess when you make a new type of video and it boosts your channel from just [10K](https://imgur.com/GEvQ7yB) subscribers all the way up to [150K](https://imgur.com/3F0D4rI) subscribers, you are willing to push the limits and lie about your past just to keep everything going, as YouTube is a really good way to make money right now.\n\n**5) The Transformation**\n\nHe has had even more channels in the past not only this one, which he has transformed overnight from a YouTube Channel [Reviewer](https://imgur.com/JUnuYDE) to a Guru [Reviewer](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) and finally to a financial [analyst](https://imgur.com/oCIBljZ) , as He created a second &amp; third YouTube account called [GearlyReviews](https://imgur.com/9vAPlu3) where he reviews electronics and [EuroBall](https://imgur.com/G130Wgr) where he only posted 2 videos.\n\nI also searched him through his Reddit [posts](https://imgur.com/zmsRhbB) and only could find things related to marketing &amp; social media, nothing about finance yet again.\n\n# So, my personal opinion which I doubt to be wrong guys, if there is a case of a dubious &amp; fishy person out there, he is one of them.\n\nI believe that he has never worked as a senior financial analyst and especially not a stock market, asset or any other type of equity analyst.\n\nMost of his stock [picks](https://imgur.com/uOgFNkQ) are small-caps that are highly volatile or a couple of recent high flyers which are very catchy to any YouTube audience.\n\nThere are many things wrong about the picture he has painted about himself even though he has gone through a lot to try and erase his past. The fact that there are no mentions of things from the wall street or consulting firm, bad stock analysis and methods, fishy and dubious moves of his YouTube channels and especially fishy things about him being a consultant &amp; analyst in early 2020 while he was already doing YouTube and other stuff back in 2017-2018 really makes me not want to buy his story.\n\nFolks, be careful out there, you can find a lot of YouTubers out there who make more money from their advice giving on YouTube, Patreon or other kind of subscriptions and courses, compared to the actual money they are making or have ever made in the stock market.\n\nSo yeah guys, I don\u2019t want to make a final judgment on this guy, but you should consider everything I have showed about him and all the problems with his past &amp; his financial methods &amp; just remember as always **in a bull market everyone is an expert &amp; genius**, while in a bear market you can\u2019t find any of these people as they all flee.\n\nThank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or \"counterfeit\" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.\n\nMuch of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.\n\nOne thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**Methodology**\n\nI'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that\n\n1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.\n2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.\n3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date\n\nHowever, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.\n\n**The Code**\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    import time\n    import requests\n    POLYGON_API_KEY = '&lt;ADD YOUR API KEY HERE&gt;'\n    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&amp;apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY\n    \n    data\n    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))\n    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n    for line in f:\n        parts = line.split('|');\n        date = parts[0]\n        ticker = parts[2]\n        try:\n            fails = int(parts[3])\n            price = float(parts[5])\n            value_of_fails = price * fails\n            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)\n        except ValueError:\n            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')\n            pass\n    \n    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():\n        day = int(date[-2:])\n        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))\n        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])\n        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] &gt; 10000000, sorted_stocks)\n        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:\n            val_of_fails = data[0]\n            num_fails = data[1]\n            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))\n            res = req.json()\n            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':\n                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))\n                continue\n            else:\n                try:\n                    volume = res['volume']\n                except KeyError:\n                    print(res)\n            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)\n            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100\n            print('{: &lt;6} ${: &lt;5} {: &lt;9} / {: &lt; 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))\n\nHere's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.\n\nIf everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value &gt; 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.\n\n**The Results**\n\n    Data for Jan 4\n    RMO    $10M   455173

        "selftext": "**Hello everyone! This isn\u2019t my usual kind of post, but man, I can\u2019t stand to see how people just follow every freaking YouTuber out there blindly!** In this post, we are going to talk about why I believe Tom Nash may be a **fraud**, so please do have some patience and read the full post, as I will go through an in-depth research of his past and his claims.\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nLet\u2019s start by talking about who Tom Nash is &amp; says he is. He is a new &amp; trendy \u201cfinance &amp; stock market\u201d YouTuber which has recently passed 150K subscribers after exploding during this retail investor boom, but here is a short [video](https://imgur.com/yuNMUlv) from his YouTube describing himself.\n\nIn the video he is claiming he is a former \u201csenior financial analyst\u201d which is very hard to believe in my opinion after doing a lot of research about him.\n\nSo let\u2019s go through the **5 reasons**\ud83d\udca9 I believe he is lying about his past &amp; why you should never take anything any YouTuber out there says for granted and you should do your own research as well:\n\n**1)  Let\u2019s start with the biggest one, his valuation methods are flawed \u274c**\n\nEven though he has posted some videos that have panned out, it\u2019s very hard to differentiate good analysis from pure luck in this recent bull market, even monkeys could throw darts at stocks in the past 11 months and be right after the March sell-off.\n\nI was pretty curious of his valuation methods so I joined his channel membership and asked him a direct question, about his DCF valuation, to which he [responded](https://imgur.com/Zdtm2dI) bluntly that I am doing things wrong. I also sent him a direct link to a well-known financial institute, where we can see that the most common cash flow used for financial [modeling](https://imgur.com/MSJgiSk), which is the unlevered free cash flow, implies that you subtract any capital expenditures of the company, which contradicts the way he sees it and is plain wrong, it\u2019s like he uses 2nd grade math, if you subtract a negative number then your cash flow actually increases, which doesn\u2019t even make sense. How can something that costs you money be a positive on the free cash flow?\n\nI\u2019ll let you digest this as I will next show you some of his DCF valuations &amp; how he uses absurd numbers and changes the formulas as he pleases just to reach some insane valuations for companies just to be catchy.\n\nHere are a couple of short extracts from his Salesforce DCF calculations,\n\n[**Exibit A**](https://streamable.com/vu2agx) \\- everything seems legit until here, now he starts with the biggest mistake in this DCF\n\n[**Exibit B**](https://imgur.com/BWeAZw8) \\- I\u2019ll be blunt you can never, ever add the Capex number to a DCF valuation, that literally throws the hole calculations off, but let\u2019s continue\u2026\n\n[**Exibit C**](https://imgur.com/LgHKupD) \\- So, using a discount rate of 6% is also insane, even with the current low interest rates, you should at least discount the average [SP500](https://imgur.com/YTxt90T) return, or use the WACC or any other type of metric, which is much safer than picking out a single company, as the SP500 has proven over long-stretches to be a great performer.\n\nBut yeah guys, this isn\u2019t the first time he has done these kind of errors, you can see he is using most of these methods in many stock picks which are then spread out to thousands of new investors, who don\u2019t really have the knowledge to test what he is saying. I\u2019m just showing you here a couple of stocks like [Dynatrace](https://imgur.com/hAO37u8), [Opendoor](https://imgur.com/66rMYZe), [Alibaba](https://imgur.com/ikLetLL), [Peloton](https://imgur.com/WRoLdIL), [Salesforce](https://imgur.com/D9Ky3gl) as I showed in the previous video and even [Apple](https://imgur.com/g8k7ZxA) that have been analyzed and spread to the public this way.\n\nThe other big issue with his valuations is that he is using insane long-term growth rates, as he used a 5% growth rate for [Peloton](https://imgur.com/EV2WB9Y) to reach a higher valuation, so can you imagine? If Peloton grows at a 5% rate in perpetuity it means they should more than double the inflation [rate](https://imgur.com/xaN3Dxw) every year and is way higher than any GDP [growth](https://imgur.com/Jkk01c9) the US has seen since 1984.\n\nHe is also [implying](https://imgur.com/Wkd2AV8) that Peloton has no debt on it\u2019s balance sheet, which is 100% false, as you can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/rsB0fJg), he used the cash, cash equivalents &amp; marketable securities to calculate the short term assets while completely ignoring the over $700M in accounts payable no to mention the other current liabilities which would add up to almost exactly the $1.4B in assets he added to his calculations.\n\nBut who knows guys? Maybe he is the real deal, as he has made some [correct](https://imgur.com/v3ZYhSU) DCF implications for some stocks like [Fortinet](https://imgur.com/kCTo7jC) and [FuboTV](https://imgur.com/vojljFt), by actually subtracting the Capex finally, though he doesn\u2019t do this in every analysis, not even in the most recent ones while also keeping that big long-term growth rate at 5%, when I myself never use a bigger one than 4%.\n\nJust for an [example](https://imgur.com/tnWSWVa) I took his CRM numbers and popped them up in my spreadsheets, and even given his methods I couldn\u2019t quite get to the same results without manually editing numbers, as those implications resulted in a 7% undervaluation for the stock, while only adjusting the Capex to be a negative on the cashflows and not touching anything else that might be wrong in this DCF, [resulted](https://imgur.com/5vxgKqI) in a 10% overvaluation for the stock.\n\nSo, I think if he really was a 10+ years wall street analyst I don\u2019t think he could have made these obvious mistakes.\n\n**2) So, Is Tom Nash whom he says he is or is he lying about his past? \u274c**\n\n[HERE](https://imgur.com/wbJ8Csh) is the channel intro for his YouTube (Which I can't even see anymore, but i was lucky to download it a couple of days ago)\n\nAs you Can see, I don\u2019t doubt that he actually went to Michigan or that he got and MBA, but I do doubt that all of his Successful \u201cSenior\u201d Financial analyst &amp; consulting Career can be described with only a couple of weak-ass photos of him at an NBA game, or him casually at some kind of a course program as that is exactly what it looks like with the other guys in the back-left of the photo.\n\nAlso, are we to believe all of this great financial career ended with him just taking out his fake plant from his office, while also smiling as he threw away at least a decent salary for a gamble on YouTube, which is very hard to do, especially when you are starting, as YouTube doesn\u2019t really help the small guys.\n\nHis YouTube journey seemed to have [started](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) on the path of exposing guru\u2019s and not financial advice, as he also says in the video, so how did he turn to do financial analysis on YouTube? Seems pretty convenient that he just became an expert in stock analysis as YouTube videos on such things were booming.\n\nYou can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/Vq4ov7x), he didn\u2019t make a single stock analysis for the most part of 2020, which seems pretty off, as now most of his videos are on stock analysis, and while his channel was created in 2017, he conveniently deleted all the previous videos, which is another weird move to do.\n\nI also went on a deep internet dive and did a lot of searching about him and I found this video [podcast](https://imgur.com/09mBKRU) of him.\n\nHis main intro in this podcast is that he works as a consultant indeed, from Israel, and also the consultancy job isn\u2019t for a financial company, it\u2019s rather to help people on YouTube grow, so let's look at some extracts from the video:\n\n[**Exibit I**](https://streamable.com/xrbv3o) \\- We can see the main part of the talk is nothing about anything related to his financial past, let\u2019s continue\n\n[**Exibit II**](https://imgur.com/Ziftnpi) \\- It seems he started with a gaming channel, not even a fake guru channel, and I also found something about that FB [GROUP](https://imgur.com/Xdt4H1i) which isn\u2019t active anymore and all of the videos he made for that have also been deleted as you can see in this [post](https://imgur.com/FyKSrIq) from way back in 2018 as he was [teaching](https://imgur.com/T5lbbH2) how to make money on YouTube well through 2019, and was even giving out free workshop [experiences](https://imgur.com/K89Yk3S)  as he was pumping out creator [content](https://imgur.com/z196rMB) which is miles apart from financial analysis (BTW, he is using the same freaking photo in his old banner &amp; logo as his current one, just changing the green screen background), just look at [his](https://imgur.com/JUnuYDE) old YouTube banner (YouTube tips &amp; tutorials)\n\n[**Exibit III**](https://imgur.com/kZddAl3) \\- Yeah, it seems he also did some video on how to promote on Reddit, and what comes next guys is literally mind blowing, how much more can this dude lie &amp; hide?\n\n[**Exibit IV**](https://streamable.com/ji6ne2) \\-  Well\u2026 Nothing to hide then\u2026 He even had a Fiverr account which was called tomernash you can see clearly [HERE](https://imgur.com/topDW52), that is his username, and when I went out to check it out right now, he is [using](https://imgur.com/HVqNkwv) a fake picture &amp; and still might live in Israel, not the US, and on top of this he might not actually even be from Russia, which he has been saying over &amp; over again on his channel. You can [SEE](https://imgur.com/18Yiimf) he reiterates he is a certified YouTube consultant with no mention of his financial skills or certifications.\n\nAnd even more, you see what picture he uses as a logo yeah? Well, I did a reverse google search and found the other guy also has a YouTube [channel](https://imgur.com/DWpofDb) about kinetic cycling.\n\nMaybe he was one of his clients that he reached a deal to use his picture, wtf, the more I dig in the more I am amazed of the lengths this man has gone to reach fame on YouTube.\n\n[**Exibit V**](https://streamable.com/sdtd7d) \\- So\u2026 A financial analyst with no sheets, no paper, no nothing, great stuff for a senior financial analyst, I literally can\u2019t take more of this so let\u2019s move to the next reasons\n\n**3) Getting in front of the lie? \u274c**\n\nI believe that\u2019s what he was trying to do to, by making a [VIDEO](https://imgur.com/CeH7ePh) on this very subject in mid-2020 and popping up higher in the search rankings before his channel boomed.\n\nIn the video he clarifies that Tom Nash isn\u2019t his real name, but he also restated that he was working for a big consultancy firm as recent as this summer, and that he does shit tons of stuff which is very hard to believe, as usually this big consultancy firms have different departments for different things that he mentioned in the video. You can still find that video on his channel if you are interested\n\nBut, by the way, how was he working on that job while also doing hundreds of Fiverr jobs as a YouTube consultant?\n\nHe also claims to not offering any courses, e-books or other stuff like this, which is false as i showed in the previous reasons with his past YouTube courses &amp; other stuff, and as you will see in the next reasons, something smells really bad out here.\n\n**4) Claims about his past \u274c**\n\nI also took a deeper dive into more of his past, as you can see in [his](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) previous channel cover and info, he had only about 4K subscribers as he was doing guru video reviews on YouTube, but all of a sudden, he [became](https://imgur.com/r6X2yHg) a senior financial analyst from wall street that was living in Israel &amp; doing Fiverr gigs, I don\u2019t know what to say but it seems pretty fishy to me.\n\nI also checked his LinkedIn [page](https://imgur.com/Xpbq7Im), and all of his skills &amp; endorsements seem to be related to his YouTube skills and nothing about finance or the stock market.\n\nBut I also found his [profile](https://imgur.com/9FxHnCb) on Quora, where he wasn\u2019t that active but still, well back in [2017](https://imgur.com/EUPer8h) he was posting things about gaming &amp; YouTube while supposedly still working on Wall Street as a financial analyst, and it\u2019s interesting that there is no [mention](https://imgur.com/kcpxh2X) of him following anything related to stocks, finance, economy, accounting, statistics or anything other related to the stock market.\n\nSo yeah guys, I guess when you make a new type of video and it boosts your channel from just [10K](https://imgur.com/GEvQ7yB) subscribers all the way up to [150K](https://imgur.com/3F0D4rI) subscribers, you are willing to push the limits and lie about your past just to keep everything going, as YouTube is a really good way to make money right now.\n\n**5) The Transformation \u274c**\n\nHe has had even more channels in the past not only this one, which he has transformed overnight from a YouTube Channel [Reviewer](https://imgur.com/JUnuYDE) to a Guru [Reviewer](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) and finally to a financial [analyst](https://imgur.com/oCIBljZ) , as He created a second &amp; third YouTube account called [GearlyReviews](https://imgur.com/9vAPlu3) where he reviews electronics and [EuroBall](https://imgur.com/G130Wgr) where he only posted 2 videos.\n\nI also searched him through his Reddit [posts](https://imgur.com/zmsRhbB) and only could find things related to marketing &amp; social media, nothing about finance yet again.\n\n# So, my personal opinion which I doubt to be wrong guys, if there is a case of a dubious &amp; fishy person out there, he is one of them!\n\nI believe that he has never worked as a senior financial analyst and especially not a stock market, asset or any other type of equity analyst.\n\nMost of his stock [picks](https://imgur.com/uOgFNkQ) are small-caps that are highly volatile or a couple of recent high flyers which are very catchy to any YouTube audience.\n\nThere are many things wrong about the picture he has painted about himself even though he has gone through a lot to try and erase his past. The fact that there are no mentions of things from the wall street or consulting firm, bad stock analysis and methods, fishy and dubious moves of his YouTube channels and especially fishy things about him being a consultant &amp; analyst in early 2020 while he was already doing YouTube and other stuff back in 2017-2018 really makes me not want to buy his story.\n\nFolks, be careful out there, you can find a lot of YouTubers out there who make more money from their advice giving on YouTube, Patreon or other kind of subscriptions and courses, compared to the actual money they are making or have ever made in the stock market.\n\nSo yeah guys, I don\u2019t want to make a final judgment on this guy, but you should consider everything I have showed about him and all the problems with his past &amp; his financial methods &amp; just remember as always **in a bull market everyone is an expert &amp; genius**, while in a bear market you can\u2019t find any of these people as they all flee.\n\nThank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m relatively new in option trading, started 3 months ago. Even newbies can make a lot of money in a bull market, true for me. I started with $5k, the account was \\~ $10k around early February. I was ecstatic and felt like the market goddess in bed with me. Somehow I managed to convince myself to cash out $3k, that\u2019s a good decision. \n\nThen correction started last week. Nearly all my positions are calls, so the portfolio was not pretty. I thought that was bad, then this week started. Lost 25% of my portfolio on Monday, then another 25% today, so far.... Holy fuck. \n\nHere are my holdings (ranked by current market value):\n\n$GS210319 C$320, =$790, up 30%\n\n$AAPL210521 C$130, =$703, down 29%, \n\n$CRM210319 C$250, =$500, down 36%\n\n$TIGR210319 C$30, =$390, down 32%\n\n$KO210319 C$50, =$340, up 20%\n\n$BABA210319 C$270, =$250, down 80%\n\n$NIO210319 C$58, =$243, down 65%\n\n$EDIT210319 C$60, =$227, down 70%\n\n$PLTR210319 C$30, = $138, down 60%\n\n$ICLN210319 C$29, x2 =10, down 95%. \n\nMy question is: do I even bother cutting losses on some positions, given uncertainty how deep market will dive, and I still have 3\\~ 4 weeks of time on most contracts. \n\nHere is my thinking:\n\n$GS, KO, actually making money, hold until growth stop\n\n$AAPL, won\u2019t expire until May, plenty of time, hold.\n\n$EDIT, probably rock bottom, i like the stock, willing to lose everything, hold.\n\n$PLTR, unpredictable, but probably will bounce back quickly, probably will hold. \n\nCan\u2019t decide with others. Especially with $CRM (earning this week) and $BABA. \n\nPlease feel free to comment/judge/advise on any or all positions. Any feedback is welcome. \n\nLastly, I fully understand my risks. Even this account is wiped out, won\u2019t lose sleep over it.\n\nThanks for reading. Love you all.",

        "selftext": "Friday 26 February 2021\n\n*Live Updates*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background:**\n\n* My discount bot to help Reddit. It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.\n* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.\n* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.\n* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.\n* There are a lot of SPY500/\"boomer\" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.\n* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.\n* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement\n* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only\n* This is a one man bot.\n\n**Bot Overview**:\n\nIt's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.\n\n**Key:**\n\n* Penny stocks are very risky.\n* Pharma companies are very risky.\n* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.\n* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.\n* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).\n* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.\n* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.\n* Take the \"Calls\" as very discounted, and \"Potentially A Call\" as somewhat discounted.\n* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.\n* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.\n* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**At Close of Thursday**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Batch 1:**\n\n* BA\tBoeing Co\t216.45\n* UAL\tUnited Airlines Holdings Inc\t51.78\n* ADBE\tAdobe Inc\t459.16\n* ANSS\tANSYS, Inc.\t338.46\n* ADSK\tAutodesk, Inc.\t284.03\n* PAYC\tPaycom Software Inc\t368.31\n* CRM\t[salesforce.com](https://salesforce.com), inc.\t231.08\n* SNPS\tSynopsys, Inc.\t244.09\n* TSLA\tTesla Inc\t682.22\n* FBHS\tFortune Brands Home &amp; Security Inc\t83.48\n* BBY\tBest Buy Co Inc\t102.94\n* PYPL\tPaypal Holdings Inc\t253.94\n* CTAS\tCintas Corporation\t328.05\n* CPRT\tCopart, Inc.\t106.92\n* HSIC\tHenry Schein, Inc.\t61.89\n* RMD\tResMed Inc.\t194.98\n* WELL\tWelltower Inc\t70.28\n* DHI\tD.

        "selftext": "Hello! Wanted to share my thoughts on Palantir ahead of its earnings next Monday. Warning: long post ahead and TLDR at the bottom. Would love to know all your thoughts as well.\n\n**What Does Palantir Do?**\n\n* In one sentence, Palantir creates **operating systems** that integrates vast amounts of data from an organization\u2019s various data silos and allows users to build applications that drive better decision making\n* If that's confusing, no worries. The way I like to think of Palantir's software is that if Batman purchased the software from a company today for his supercomputer which aggregates data from thousands of sources and allows him to make intelligent decisions, that software would be from Palantir\n* The company has three main software platforms: **Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo**\n* **Gotham (government side)**\n   * Gotham is Palantir\u2019s software offering primarily for defense and intelligence sectors, AKA governments\n   * Gotham is an end-to-end operating system that collects data from hundreds to millions of different sources and combines them onto one platform so users can manage operations\n   * Gotham is quickly becoming the de facto data solution across many US federal agencies and\u00a0rumor has it that it was the software that helped track down Osama Bin Laden in 2011\n* **Foundry (commercial side)**\n   * Next up is Foundry, a platform that is geared towards the 6,000 businesses around the world with over $500 million in revenue\n   * Similar to Gotham, Foundry transforms the ways organizations operate by creating a central operating system for their data\n   * For example, one of Palantir\u2019s customers is Skywise, an\u00a0aviation platform that has become the central operating\u00a0system for the airline industry\n* **Apollo (underlying infrastructure)**\n   * Apollo is the last piece of the Palantir puzzle, and you can think of it as the underlying infrastructure that Gotham and Foundry lie upon\n   * Apollo is a relatively new platform that Palantir introduced in order to more efficiently update the software that runs Gotham and Foundry, increasing the number of upgrades Palantir can manage across installations from an average of 20,000 per week in Q2 2019 to more than 41,000 per week in Q2 2020\n* The company has estimated its **total addressable market as $119 billion,** of which $63 billion is for the government side while $56 billion is for commercial side\n\n**The Palantir Business Model**\n\n* Known as **Forward Deployed Engineers or FDEs,** Palantir leverages their technical talent as support and sales as well and they are often sent to the front lines of the battlefield for Gotham or company for Foundry\n   * I believe that this in particular is what helped Palantir create a competitive moat in the government sector\n* While the FDEs are a differentiator, Palantir has also started to build out a **more traditional salesforce** in order to better target customers and explain the company\u2019s value proposition but this salesforce currently only accounts for 3% of the company\u2019s total headcount\n* Using both FDEs and a traditional salesforce, Palantir\u2019s business model employs a 3 step process: acquire, expand, and scale\n* **Acquire**\n   * In the acquire step, Palantir provides a potential customer with a short-term pilot program at Palantir\u2019s expense and therefore operate at a loss\n* **Expand**\n   * In the expand phase, Palantir seeks to understand the customer\u2019s key challenges and ensure that its software delivers results\n* **Scale**\n   * The scale phase is where Palantir thrives. At this point, the customer is essentially\u00a0using Palantir\u2019s software for its operations and Palantir can also\u00a0upsell to the customer by continually\u00a0offering new services with minimal extra cost\n* To give you a sense of the numbers for each phase,\u00a0In 2019, Palantir generated a total of $742.6 million in revenue, of which **$0.6 million** came from customers in the **Acquire** phase, **$176.3 million** from the **Expand** phase, and **$565.7** million from the **Scale** phase\n\n**The Bull Case**\n\n* **Section 2377**\n   * In 2016, Palantir sued the US Army in what\u2019s known as Decision 2377\n   * To go into the history a little bit, in 1994, the Federal Streamlining Acquisition Act (FASA) was passed, which required that the federal government consider and acquire readily available, proven commercial services like Palantir\u2019s rather than custom-developed solutions built by the government which has a reputation for spending inefficiently\n   * This rule was largely ignored until Palantir sued and won in court, and this was extremely important because it allowed Palantir to compete and win deals across all federal agencies, which greatly helps the company realize its total addressable market. Since then, Palantir's revenue from the US Army and US government has skyrocketed\n* **Sticky, Best-in-Class Product**\n   * Simply put, there is nothing that offers what Palantir is offering. Its technology is way beyond most of its competitors in terms of offering a premium operating system\n   * Palantir\u2019s Gotham and Foundry often take more than a year to get fully up and running and the more it\u2019s used, the more data in the system and the more time that has been spent by customers training employees on how to use the system\n   * Palantir\u2019s platforms becomes incredibly expensive to switch out of not just in terms of money but also time, with customers saying replacing the system could take anywhere from 6 to 18 months\n   * To further prove this point, Palantir\u2019s top 20 customers have been with the company for an average of 7 years and as of October 2020, 93% of revenue was generated by existing customers\n   * In addition to this, in the latest quarterly earnings, Palantir was selected out of 999 bids by the US Army for a 2-year $91 million contract to build AI and machine learning capabilities\n* **Positive Secular Trends and Growing, Achievable TAM**\n   * I think everyone at this point realizes that companies are going digital transformations and Palantir has spent $1.5 billion in the past 11 years creating innovative software that becomes increasingly powerful each day\n   * The company is at the right place at the right time with a total addressable market expected to\u00a0grow into the few hundreds of billions of dollars in the next 5 years\n   * And with just about $1 billion dollars in revenue over the past 12 months, Palantir has less than 1% market share and has plenty of room for growth\n   * But perhaps most importantly, Palantir is creating a much more efficient business model with an improving tech product that will help the company achieve its TAM  \n\n      * In the latest earnings call, management said that it plans to triple its salesforce headcount due to its recent success\n      * And among other improvements, the Apollo platform has helped the\u00a0company greatly reduce the costs and time required to get a customer up and running\n   * Being able to better target customers and onboard them quickly while providing a best-in-class and sticky data platform points to a bright future for Palantir\n\n**The Bear Case**\n\n* **Double-Edged Business Model**\n   * While Palantir\u2019s differentiated services and business model is one of the company\u2019s key strengths, there are also several downsides as well\n   * First, due to the custom-built solutions Palantir offers, the company undergoes a costly and complicated minimum 6 month sales cycle that can often amount to nothing\n   * Second, even if a customer jumps on board, contracts are cancelable with a typical notice of 3-6 months\n   * Third, the deep history it has with customers results in a very top-heavy concentration\n      * As of the third quarter of 2020, the top 20 customers represented 61% of the company\u2019s revenue, which notably is down from 73% from the year prior\n   * Lastly, the deal-by-deal nature of Palantir\u2019s business model means that the sources of revenue are lumpy and hard to predict, which can be a cause of\u00a0concern for investors\n* **Biden Administration and Negative Headline Risk**\n   * First, Peter Thiel was an outspoken supporter of Trump, who increased defense spending 5% a year while Obama decreased spending 3% a year.\n      * While I don\u2019t think this will be a long-term issue, a Biden presidency does represent a potential decrease in defense budgets which could hinder Palantir\u2019s growth with Gotham\n      * However, it is important to note that management during its latest earnings call did address this issue, stating that it has worked with many administrations across the world and doesn\u2019t foresee this to be a problem\n   * Second, Palantir has been targeted by the media several times for giving the government too much power and the political and social environment in which the tide seems to be turning against tech could present Palantir with headaches in the future\n      * This risk is also further exacerbated by the fact that Palantir is 49.9999% owned by its co-founders, who are outspoken and strongly opinionated. Clear corporate governance risk.\n* **Tough Competition in Commercial Space**\n   * In my opinion the largest obstacle Palantir faces is its ability to execute in the commercial space\n   * Palantir offers an expensive, premium, custom-built end-to-end solution for clients, which is great for the government but not exactly what most businesses are looking for\n   * Instead, most large scale businesses have already invested heavily into their own systems and want to buy best-in-class piecemeal solutions from different tech companies\n   * Several notable businesses left Palantir from 2019 to 2020, including JP Morgan, Coca Cola, and American Express, and this decreased the customer count from 133 to 125\n   * However, one important thing to note is that in the latest earnings call, Palantir\u2019s management openly addressed this issue and the company has already started to provide solutions that are modular, which means customers can take the individual solutions they want rather than adopting the entire Foundry system\n      * This also allows the\u00a0company to offer different price points which may allow Palantir to be\u00a0more competitive in the market\n      * Recent news of bringing on BP and IBM as clients could also be a sign that its Foundry business may be ready for mass adoption\n* **Lock-up Expiration**\n   * Because this is a short-term risk, I\u2019m adding this as a bonus bearish reason\n   * Palantir went public through a direct listing on September 30, 2020, during which up to 20% of shares were available to trade\n   * The remaining 80% is available to trade starting February 19th when the lockup expires and this could lead to a flooding of shares being sold and at the very least, volatility caused by the uncertainty\n\n**Financials and Valuation**\n\n* **Starting off with the income statement,** the important things to note is that from 2018 to 2019, the company has grown revenue by about 25% while maintaining roughly the same amount in operating expenses, which speaks to the improved operational efficiency of the\u00a0company\n   * The company has guided to $1.07 billion for the full year of 2020, which represents a 44% year over year increase and for a\u00a0company with 1 billion in revenue, increasing revenue\u00a0growth is a great sign\n   * Comparing Q3 2020 to Q3 2019, the company was able to increase average\u00a0revenue per customer by 38% and grew commercial revenue by 35% and\u00a0government revenue by 68%\n   * With all this\u00a0said, one piece of concern in Palantir\u2019s income statement is its net losses. The company has not been able to turn a profit in its entire history, but it did report positive adjusted operating income in its latest quarter when adjusted for stock based compensation\n* **Moving onto its latest cash flow statement,** what you mainly need to know is\u00a0that the company has recently had a huge stock based compensation expense this past year due to the direct listing, so if you were to add that back, the company is essentially\u00a0near break-even\n   * However, the company\u2019s free cash flow (operating cash flow minus your capital expenditures) is negative, so the company still is clearly losing money although much less than even a year prior\n* **Lastly, Palantir has a great balance sheet**\n   * With $1.8 billion in cash and only $200mm in debt, the company is in a great position to fuel its future growth\n* **Regarding the company\u2019s valuation,** while the company is growing nicely at 44% from 2019-2020, and is expected to grow 31% from 2020-2021 based on street estimates, it currently trades around a 45x NTM sales multiple depending on the day, which makes it one of the most expensive companies on the market\n   * The key question here is do you want to pay an extremely high premium for a company that does have a best-in-class software or wait for a better entry point?\n\n**What I\u2019m Doing**\n\n* Personally, I can't justify Palantir's valuation, which may sound a little old-school but I think there are better opportunities out there\n* However, in the long-run I am bullish on the company and would buy on any major dips in the 20s (and teens if it somehow falls down to that)\n* I'm also closely monitoring what happens after earnings (2/16) and next week the lock-up expires on 2/19 so it'll be interesting to see what happens to the stock then\n\n**TLDR:** Palantir has a best-in-class, sticky data platform that it offers to both the government side (where it's pretty much a monopoly) and businesses (which is picking up steam with tweaks to the business model and a growing salesforce). Growing healthy top-line but unprofitable and trading at a higher valuation than almost all other software companies. I am holding off on buying for now but would welcome major dips as great buying opportunities. What do you think?",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to the final trading day of February. Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/26/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-26-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Stocks try to recover from Thursday\u2019s tech rout\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures were choppy as tech stocks tried to recover from Thursday\u2019s rout that dragged the Nasdaq down 3.5% for its worst single-day performance since October. Tesla fell slightly again in Friday\u2019s premarket, a day after sinking 8% in a brutal week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday sank 559 points, or 1.8%, from a record closing high the previous session. The Dow had its worst day in nearly a month and so did the S&amp;P 500, which lost almost 2.5%. The culprit behind the selloff was the rapid rise in bond yields.\n\n&gt; * All three stock benchmarks were tracking for weekly losses. Ahead of Friday\u2019s trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was clinging to a gain for February, which started off strong. The Nasdaq was down nearly 7% from its Feb. 12 record closing high. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 both remain solidly in the green for the month. However, the S&amp;P 500 was off almost 2.7% from its last record closing high, also on Feb. 12.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. 10-year Treasury yield retreats slightly from one-year high\n\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield retreated Friday morning, but remained above 1.4%, after surging to 1.6% in the previous session to its highest level since February 2020 and more than 0.5% higher since the end of January. The spike in the 10-year yield, which is used as a benchmark for mortgage rates and auto loans, has been driven by expectations of improving economic conditions as coronavirus vaccines are rolled out, as well as fears of higher inflation.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. House to pass Covid bill; Senate official says no minimum wage\n\n&gt; * Inflation worries are being stoked on the thought that the $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus bill \u2014 which is seen passing the House on Friday \u2014 on top of accelerating growth could overheat the economy. Democrats on Capitol Hill are trying to push their relief measure, including a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour, through without GOP support. However, a key nonpartisan official, the Senate parliamentarian, ruled Democrats cannot include the minimum wage increase in the bill. The decision means the Senate will likely pass a different version of the bill than the House, and representatives will have to approve the plan a second time.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. FDA panel to vote on J&amp;J\u2019s single-shot Covid vaccine\n\n&gt; * A key FDA vaccine advisory panel is set to vote Friday on whether to recommend approval of Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s Covid-19 single-shot for emergency use, which would help pave the way to for a third preventive treatment in the U.S. While the full FDA doesn\u2019t have to follow the vaccine committee\u2019s recommendation, it often does. During similar requests by Pfizer and Moderna for vaccines, the FDA authorized those companies\u2019 two-shot regimes a day after the panel of outside medical advisors backed emergency use authorization.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. DoorDash stock falls after company drops first results since IPO\n\n&gt; * As more and more Americans are vaccinated and the economy continues to open up more fully, companies like DoorDash, which has benefited from the stay-at-home trade, could get hurt. In its first report as a public company, the food delivery service old shareholders it expects some of the tailwinds it experienced from stay-at-home orders across the U.S. will turn around once the country gets the virus under control. Shares sank 10% in Friday premarket. Even with that drop, DoorDash would still be up nearly 50% from its $102 per share offer price back in December. While DoorDash late Thursday reported $970 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, which beat estimates, it also reported an adjusted per-share loss of $2.67.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/nQ4OULP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fSUwJLJ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/CLJNnMp7/econcal3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/L8XVtdHp/econcal1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.postimg.cc/66cRYHb5/ipos1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/9Mn4Hk6G/eram01.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/AqrZ1zR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/x1Vhf1Yd/Screenshot-2021-02-25-at-4-26-19-PM.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/5NCDWFhG/Screenshot-2021-02-25-at-4-26-56-PM.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/DfDRNcML/Screenshot-2021-02-25-at-4-27-32-PM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/iVbXewC.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/dVbYwpGv/divical1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/GhSRSH24/divical2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/13nSxsnJ/divical3.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.postimg.cc/dt0vB8qM/divical4.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* RKT\nvDKNG\n* QQQ\n* CDXC\n* BYND\n* SPY\n* ARKK\n* CRM\n* NNDM\n* GS\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/26/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-foot-locker-beyond-meat-doordash-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Foot Locker (FL)** \u2013 Foot Locker shares tanked 12.1% in premarket trading after quarterly revenue came in below Street forecasts and comparable-store sales unexpectedly declined.

        "selftext": "Positions: 100 shares avg. $120\n\nAfter you're finished calling me a boomer hear me out, listen in. We're all familiar with Walmart: the brick and mortar store with over 11k locations across the country. They've got affordable shit, so why is it any different than other retailers?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**1. They have a P/S ratio of less than 1.** \n\nThis is the price:sales ratio. As I write this, the price of Walmart (i.e. mkt cap) is 376.89B. The sales (i.e. revenue) for the LAST 3 YEARS has been over 500B, with last year at 559B. This gives us a p/s of ~0.67. Compare it to the top 5  DJI stocks by portfolio %: \n\n\n\nTicker | 2018 revenue (bn) | 2019 revenue (bn) | 2020 revenue (bn) | Price ($bn) | P/S\n------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|---\nWMT | 500 | 514 | 524 | 376.89 | 0.67\nUNH | 226 | 242 | 257 | 315.21 | 1.23\nGS | 36 | 35 | 41 | 114.33 | 2.76\nHD | 101 | 108 | 110 | 279.88 | 2.54\nCRM | 10.5 | 13.3 | 17.1 | 220.69 | 12.91\nMSFT | 110 | 126 | 143 | 1769.03 | 12.37\n\n*Things to note: Obviously the reason why CRM and MSFT's caps are so large is speculation; That's the price people think it'll be worth eventually. To account for growth, you can also include a growth metric, such as the growth exponent over the last n number of years: The larger the exponent the faster the company is growing, and you'll clearly see CRM and MSFT's growth exponent much higher than the rest on the list. That being said, Walmart has been growing, and is continuing to grow through this year, and i believe for the foreseeable future as well.* \n\nLooking at the rest especially Home Depot, you'll see that it's P/S is almost 4x that of Walmart. If we compare it to other contemporary retailers such as KR, TGT, and COST, you'll also see that only KR has a P/S less than WMT, which means, not only is far cheaper than the top 5 DJI, but also cheaper than competitors. (I understand KR is the largest grocery store in the USA, and it honestly should be worth more, but idk how they do on the innovation front)\n\n**2. E-Commerce**\n\nWalmart's e-commerce business has been doing nothing but growing. They are amazon's biggest competitor in the e-commerce business, especially with owning FlipKart - India's largest online retailer.  The Y:Y growth for flipkart from fy19 to fy20 was 12%, which will continue to grow as India becomes one of the worlds largest markets for consumer products. This sector will only continue to grow into the future, and is one where walmart has a stronghold. They also acquired Jet.com (and eventually rebranded it to Walmart) which was an e-commerce platform in the States.\n\n**3. Emerging Markets**\n\nI touched on this earlier with India, but one can argue it is no longer an emerging market. Well, Walmart also owns Massmart, which is Africa's second largest distributor for consumer goods. They have retailers in every continent except Australia/Oceania.\n\nOutside of emerging geo-markets, they also announced the creation of a Fin-tech startup to make a play in that sector, and have always made a conscious effort to innovate their services and products via Walmart Labs (https://careers.walmart.com/technology/technology-software-development/walmart-labs).\n\n\n**TLDR: Walmart is priced like a value stock, but makes the plays of a growth stock. Super undervalued compared to competitors. They make way more money than they're worth, and are continuing to grow. They are no longer boomer, and I believe they should be worth, at the minimum, 500b.**\n\nMy PT is $300, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it exceed that.\n\n\nSomeone give me a bear argument please, I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts. Also call me out if I'm a fucking idiot lmao",

Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I\u2019m playing.* \n\n**UPDATE: DOCU CEO** speaking at Morgan Stanly TMT conference Monday AM. [This 300c 3/5 came through last week](https://i.imgur.com/dD2cqVp.jpg). Suicidal strike, but I like the sentiment. \n\n****\n\nWhen the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.\n\n**Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can\u2019t afford it, don\u2019t play it.** There are opportunities every day. \n\nAnyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.\n\n****\n\n**1.\tThe SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**\n\nOn Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an \u201cinvestor day\u201d**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.\n\nI hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.\n\nThen, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**\n\nIt was time to get to work.\n\n****\n\n**2.\tThe investigation**\n\nI wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.\n\n1) [SNAP](https://investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https://investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https://investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.\n\n2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.\n\n*All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump. \n\n*NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No \"investor day\" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*\n\nThese companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said \"WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT\".\n\n****\n\n**3.\tDefining RAMBO**\n\nAs I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**\n\nI also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https://esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present \ud83d\ude2c \ud83d\ude09.\n\n**Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I\u2019ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**\n\n****\n\n**4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO** \n\n**What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**\n\n**My theory is that the current ER environment\u2014where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference. \n\n**5. So what am I saying?**\n\nI'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.\n\n**Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I\u2019ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**\n\n[EPD](https://i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \n\nDipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.\n\nThe real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https://www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.\n\nYou know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.\n\nAs always pick a good entry point.\n\n[BIDU](https://i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \n\n**EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn\u2019t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright \n\nYeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:\n\n&gt;BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (\"Baidu\" or the \"Company\"), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the \"EGM\") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China.\nA proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (\"Share Subdivision\") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.\n\nYes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.\n\n[CRM](https://i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude2c \n\nCRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https://investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).  I'll play it a little safer, a little longer, but I'm in for fishing the bottom here.\n\n[ZNGA](https://i.imgur.com/cTLGZLk.jpg) \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude2c \n\nWhale came through with a conservative bet, but I'll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol (not really, but yeah kinda).  [They're speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th, 8:25 AM PST](https://investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-present-morgan-stanley-technology-media-telecom-conference)\n\n[NVDA](https://i.imgur.com/TFrRmTn.jpg) \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \n\nI'm as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are, but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4/12 and calls are starting to trickle in.  Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.\n\n**Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I\u2019m a bandwagon hopper \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble\n\n****\n\n**TLDR**:\nCheck the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.\n\nI like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special dates",

        "selftext": "GAN Due Diligence\n\n**What is GAN?**\n\nGAN (\u201cGame Account Network\u201d) is a NASDAQ-listed B2B SaaS company providing product services to land-based casino operators that help lower customer churn and drive increased visits by consumers. Though the company may not be well known to US-based residents, the company has been operating for nearly 20 years in Europe and has global headquarters based in London. More recently, the company has targeted the United States as a growth area as individual states start to create regulated environments in which they allow online, real-money casinos to operate. Many states have started to legalize and regulate online gambling, the first being New Jersey in 2016, in which GAN has a partnership with Betfair. GAN now seeks to accelerate this growth in more states with additional partnerships and expanded product offerings. \n\n**Product Offerings**\n\nGAN offers 6 total products, 4 of which will be covered below as they account for 90.2% of revenue (as of Q3\u201920) and have the clearest growth prospects. \n\n**Simulated Gaming**:  Simulated gaming allows users to play traditional casino games online, without the chance of winning real money. For casino operators, Simulated Gaming allows the operator to create an environment which users can play games in a market where real money gaming is not yet legal. While users may not have a chance to win money, casino operators can still entice users to play through special offers that drive them to their physical casino (e.g. play for X hours online and get a free night). Additionally, Simulated Gaming and Real Money Gaming run off the same back-end platform, meaning that any user data acquired during the simulated-phase is extremely valuable once the switch is \u201cturned on\u201d to allow for real bets to be placed. \n\n**Real Money Gaming**: Real money gaming is exactly as it sounds: Users deposit money and play games online with the chance of winning real money in return. GAN provides many of the same games you see inside casinos without the user having to be physically present. Real money gaming is still barred in most states, and like physical land-based casinos, online casinos are highly regulated, in which GAN\u2019s software complies with all local regulations. \n\n**GameSTACK**: GameSTACK is the back-end software that ties everything together. Think of a highly specialized CRM system that serves as the technical hub of the player\u2019s online gaming presence. Starting with the basics, the software tracks every time a user plays a game and every bet the user makes within the game, allowing operators of GameSTACK a rich pool of data to mine from. Additionally, the software includes a patented feature called iBridge (GAN recently licensed this IP to a client for $3MM) which allows players of online casinos to be linked back to land-based casinos loyalty programs. With the iBridge technology, land-based casino operators have high visibility to loyalty members online and offline playstyles, and can tailor personalized content, messages, and promotions to its users. \n\n**Tying the product offerings together**: GAN will typically enter a market with a land-based casino and offer GameSTACK and Simulated Gaming in anticipation of real money gaming becoming legal in the state at a later point. This works well for both GAN and the casino operator \u2013 GAN has a new client on their platform (sticky) and the casino operator can push messages and promotions to their users in the simulated gaming environment. For example, if a user is playing simulated gaming in a state where online gaming is not yet legal, the user may receive a promotion for a free night stay at the casino based on their play history. In addition, once online gaming becomes legal in the state, it just needs to be \u201cturned on\u201d. This means the casino can use the rich data pool that has been building during Simulated Gaming and tailor messages to push users to play online with real money or drive them to the physical casino. \n\n**Other product offerings**: GAN offers two other products that are not covered in detail. 1) Game Distribution/Publishing \u2013 GAN provides a service where it creates online versions of existing games for the license holder. Those games can also be distributed into the online casino world where GAN\u2019s software operates. 2) RGS (Remote Game Server) \u2013 RGS allows developers who want complete control of their global distribution the ability to set up a unique instance of GameSTACK. With the private instance of GameSTACK, the developer can operate proprietary content in regulated and social markets while maintaining control of distribution and pricing. \n\n**How Does GAN Make Money?**\n\nGAN has a revenue share model, meaning they take a small slice from every transaction that occurs on their platform. This \u2018take rate\u2019 varies between customers but generally lies somewhere between 5% - 7%. Think of GAN software as the toll booth, taking a little nugget each time someone places a bet. The better GAN\u2019s customers do, the better GAN does.  \n\n**What\u2019s the Outlook?**\n\nOkay \u2013 So GAN has a unique product offering in a market that is increasing in size as additional states pass betting/gaming legislation. (GAN estimates by the end of 2021 50% of all states will have passed sports betting legislation.) What has been making waves recently that gets investors excited about GAN? \n\n1) CoolBet \u2013 Did you notice how in the product description there was no talk about a major aspect all casinos have, sports betting? That\u2019s because until very recently, GAN didn\u2019t have a sports betting product that integrated into their software suite. In Q3 of 2020 GAN signed an agreement to acquire CoolBet, which closed the first week of 2021. If you\u2019re not familiar with CoolBet, they provide a sportsbook similar to DraftKings or Fanduel. In Quarter 3, CoolBet had a trailing twelve month (TTM) revenue of $28 million and a CAGR of 46%. CoolBet\u2019s revenue alone will nearly double GAN\u2019s overall revenue. \n\n2) Wynn Agreement \u2013 GAN signed a 10 year agreement with Wynn Resorts in Michigan to power their online sports book and casino, known as WynnBET ([https://mi.wynnbet.com/](https://mi.wynnbet.com/)). Given the successful rollout, it seems likely that Wynn would continue to use GAN to power WynnBET in other states as legislation allows. \n\n3) Fast Growth in Michigan \u2013 When Michigan flipped the switch and allowed online casinos to go live on January 22, over the first 5 days Michigan had 17x the number of active player days compared to New Jersey. This quick rollout is a sign that GAN is gaining momentum and finetuning their marketing to ensure maximum revenue from day one. \n\n**Is Now a Good Time to Buy?**\n\nNormally, this is the spot where I would present some common fundamental ratios, perhaps project future earnings, etc. There are two things that make this difficult for GAN:\n\n1) The company has been listed for less than a year. There isn\u2019t a ton of data fully integrated into brokerage firms yet.  \n\n2) GAN and its competitors don\u2019t make money. That\u2019s right, GAN, Scientific Gaming, Draft Kings, Golden Nugget Online Gaming, and many other competitors do not make any money. That being said, some fundamental ratios, such as Price/Book (12.06) and Price/Sales (30.94) are in line with competitors or lower. Given DraftKing\u2019s Price/Sales is around 80, GAN may still have plenty of room to run. And, for what it\u2019s worth, the company also loses less per share ($-0.14) than SGMS ($-1.23) and DKNG ($-0.98).   \n   \n \n\nGiven the company doesn\u2019t make money yet, this is definitely a speculative play. However, knowing that we should see many more states legalizing online gambling and sports betting over the next two years, and there being a larger public interest in online gaming and sports betting, I\u2019m wagering on accelerated growth. Current position: 5 shares, buying more after earnings call on March 25. \n\n**TL;DR:** GAN makes backend software that allows casino operators to extend their physical casinos online. Players deposit real money to play online and the casino has access to user data and can push promotions to drive incremental revenue. GAN provides a full software suite (simulated gaming, real-money gaming, sportsbook) and takes a share (5% - 7%) from each bet made on their platform. Recent reason for optimism: GAN acquired CoolBet (sportsbook) which roughly doubles their revenue and signed a 10 year agreement with Wynn Resorts. Price target: The $Moon.",

        "selftext": " Hi all, this is my second DD, so would appreciate critical feedback!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-- **Share Facts --**\n\n* **Fastly, ticker FSLY**\n* **Earnings date:** Just released, next earnings date May-5th (IIRC, don\u2019t quote me on this one)\n* **Market Cap:** $9.16 B\n* **Fastly stock price movement:** Down to $80, from $110-$115 last week. Despite being in line with analyst expectations, their guidance for growth is less than expected, and maybe the incoming lawsuit is causing concerns for some (more on that later, and why I think the lawsuit is inconsequential - more on this in the risk section).  \n\n   * Despite the recent drop, the stock price is up roughly 350% YoY\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**-- My position --**\n\n* On Monday 22nd, I will do a Bull Spread expiry April-16th, $90/$95, 10x contract. Based on Friday\u2019s close, cost of entry per contract is $129, or $1,290 total. Max profit is $3,710. I\u2019m further financing this bull spread with 2x CSP, 1x at $70 strike and 1x at $60 strike, for a total premium of $528.  \n\n   * Final position: Bull Spread with cost of entry of $762. Max profit of $4,238. Max loss of $762 + potentially assigned at $70 and $60 - If that were to happen, I\u2019d sell CC on the stock, although if my timing turns out to be wrong and the market disagrees for too long with me, I might exit my position, I\u2019m not opposed to that idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-- **The DD --**\n\n**What does Fastly do?**\n\nFastly is in the Internet Infrastructure industry, and is first and foremost built with developers in mind, and their winning approach has quickly given them important market share over the last few years. They are a global Content Delivery Network (CDN). They have built a better approach at speeding up the internet based on location of data centers, but also through optimized hardware and enhanced security protocols. CDN and Fastly\u2019s offerings are increasingly vital in the cloud era, as speed and security matters.\n\nTo put things in perspective, they have 2020 annual revenues of roughly $291 million, versus a total addressable market that Fastly sees as being $35 billion.\n\n**Recent acquisitions:**\n\nThey have acquired Signal Sciences for $775M in cash and stock, back in H2 2020. This acquisition is a strategic one to expand Fastly\u2019s security portfolio.\n\n* **Signal Sciences:** Directly from Fastly\u2019s press conference: \u201cThe transaction combines Signal Sciences\u2019 powerful web application and API security solutions with Fastly\u2019s edge cloud platform and existing security offerings to form a unified suite of modern security tools. This robust new security portfolio, designed for the way developers work, unlocks innovation at the edge and removes silos between developers, operations, and security teams to shorten development cycles and protect websites and web applications alike.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Straight from February 17th earnings call:**\n\n**Q4 2020:**\n\n* Revenues of $83 million (net of $2 million deferred revenue writedown), which represents a 40% YoY growth.  \n\n   * **Estimates were at a growth of $82 million, so slightly beat expectations**\n* Gross margin of 59.2%, up from 56.7% in the same quarter last rear.  \n\n   * Non-GAAP gross margin (excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets) is 63.7%, up from 57.6% in the same quarter last year\n* Cash position of $216 million (blend of cash, restricted cash and investments)  \n\n   * They used approximately $200 million cash to acquire Signal Sciences earlier in the year, a non-recurring item that had a significant impact on cash position. Despite that, they are cash-rich, which gives them a strong ability to further invest in growth\n* Net retention rate of 115%, which is pretty phenomenal. This means that net revenue from existing customers increased by 15%\n* Customer growth: 37 new customers to content delivery (1.81% - Not fantastic), and 11 new enterprise customers (3.51% - enterprise clients are the highest-spending category of clients)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Annual:**\n\n* Revenues of $291 million, which represents a 45% YoY growth\n* Gross margin of 58.7%, up from 55.9% for 2019  \n\n   * Non-GAAP gross margin is 60.9%, up from 56.6% for 2019\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2021 Outlook:**\n\n* For Q1 2021, they expect revenues in the range of $83 million to $86 million, non-GAAP losses ranging from $14 million to $10 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share ranging from $0.13 to $0.9\n* For the full year 2021, they expect revenues in the range of $375 million to $385 million (28.87% to 32.30% growth), non-GAAP losses ranging from $50 million to $40 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share ranging from $0.44 to $0.35\n\nMargin-wise, we can see an improvement not only for the year, but also for the latest quarter. They are tracking in the right direction, especially considering the quarterly growth is higher than the yearly growth (non-GAAP growth of 10.59% for the quarter, versus 7.60% for the year)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What now?**\n\nSure, they are not profitable yet. Big whoop, they are still young-ish, and still in growth mode. That being said, if growth begins to slow, we should expect them to slowly transition into a profitable company. Margins are improving, so hopefully this will happen over the next few years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What are the risks?**\n\n* Back in October 2020 Fastly dropped by about 25% on announcement that they were getting a reduction in business from its largest customer, TikTok (about 12% of revenues back then). So that projected loss of revenue from this specific client is already priced in. As a result, they had a decreased revenue guidance of 3.5% to 8.0%. Considering the stock had been on a meteoric rise (about 580% growth YoY prior to that October 2020 announcement), I think a 25% pullback was entirely natural.\n* What happened on Friday, February 19 2021 is related to this; when Fastly made that announcement and the stock dropped by 25%, a bunch of vulture law firms started class action lawsuits against Fastly for failing to disclose it properly, as any law firm lacking self respect would do. The investigation has now been initiated. What are the potential consequences of this, I have no clue. Hence why it\u2019s a risk.  \n\n   * I\u2019m not personally too worried about this, because class action lawsuits against companies always happen the moment a share drops significantly (it recently happened with Slack when they issued guidance that was less than what analysts expected, and this didn\u2019t stop Salesforce from buying them). Also, personally my play is a short-term one of two months, and I do not see too much of a short-term impact from this. See the press release [here](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/fastly-investigation-initiated-former-louisiana-035000107.html).\n* It\u2019s a competitive market, so if you are in this for the long run, you need to keep track of Fastly\u2019s continued ability to innovate, to win new clients, and to have strong retention rate (which right now is at 115%). Margins are improving, but pricing battles could eat into them\n* As growth slows, it's obviously important to monitor for a transition to profitability. If you see slowing growth, and stagnant margins, then it would be cause for concerns\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** Fast growing company, has not disappointed in terms of results. While we cannot expect the same kind of growth, this is not a growth play for me - Rather, I see this as a play on what I believe is an extreme market reaction to a slightly lower growth guidance than expected, combined with the TikTok-related lawsuit. This is not a long call kind of play for me, but more of a bull spread to minimize my cost of entry in case the market disagrees with me for too long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer: NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE. I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL. Investing is risky, no matter how bullish you are, and you should invest solely based on your personal risk tolerance and your own personal due diligence, not solely because you read a random stranger's due diligence on Reddit**",

        "selftext": " \n\nThis would be a pretty long read so I put TLDR in the top.\n\n**TLDR:** Criteo has massive upside potential from its New Solutions, suggesting 25-200% upside from this business alone **(TP $42-$96)**.\n\nCriteo is a personalized retargeting company that works with internet retailers to serve personalized online display advertisements to consumers who have previously visited the advertiser's website. The aim is to help drive potential customers back to the advertiser's website. The company currently operates in a total of 30 markets around the world and is headquartered in Paris, France. **The company employs 2700 employees which makes it the biggest advertisement tech company in terms of personnel size, ahead of The Trade Desk of 1200 employees**.\n\nI believe the company is very undervalued due to **the market underappreciating Criteo\u2019s massive potential in grabbing the latest trend in advertisement tech industry and overestimating Criteo\u2019s reliance on third party cookies for their retargeting business**, hence valuing them as a dying company. Criteo is currently valued at $2B or **3x TTM gross profit** \u2013 I use gross profit because of acquisition cost (TAC) eat up most of ad tech revenues and make it apple to apple with competitors **(TTD 55x, MGNI 50x, ACUIF 20x, PUBM 30x).** I believe Criteo deserves higher multiple as the company will likely pull off a turnaround in rapidly growing areas. Criteo has the financial capability to invest in high growth areas with its very healthy balance sheet ($530mill cash, including revolving credit of up to $960mill) and solid margin/cash flow generation from its retargeting business.\n\nBefore I talk about the potential of Criteo, I would like to take you through why Criteo had been punished in the past and had not performed well in 2020 compared their adtech peers:\n\n**Past Concerns:**\n\n**Fraudulent Allegation:** There was an allegation to the company by SteelHouse, a competitor, that they had fraudulent ads and charged their customers on transactions that might not come from Criteo\u2019s service back in 2016.\n\n**Intelligent Tracking Prevention:** Criteo was reliant on third party cookies to perform its service. Back in 2017, Apple started rolling out new Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) technology for its iOS platform and Safari Web browser.\n\n**Travel and Leisure Pullback:** During Covid, Criteo was hit by the spending reduction from travel/leisure retaileers, which likely will continue until 1H 2021. This situation made Criteo\u2019s growth in new areas not reflected in the overall performance. \n\n**Privacy Issue:** Privacy issue is becoming more prevalent around the world especially in Europe and Apple making user tracking even harder with the roll out of iOS 14. \n\nEven though the reasons above are pretty justified during their period, Criteo has come a long way to not only tackle the problems but also strengthened their inner capabilities to compete for the higher growth segment of internet advertisement. Criteo has **extensive shoppers\u2019 data and deep client base** that it could leverage to turn Criteo into a juggernaut in any segment of advertisement tech industry. Just to give some context of **how extensive Criteo\u2019s access to retailers and shoppers:**\n\n**Competitive Advantage**\n\n**Access to Retailers and Publishers:** Criteo has exclusive access to large retailers (Costco, Best Buy, Target, ASDA, etc - internet platform of large offline retailers outside Amazon/other ecommerce) and premium access to 5,000 publishers (NBC, WSJ, Forbes, etc - news outlets, magazines) around the world.\n\n**High Retention Rate:** Criteo is currently working with over 21,000 clients, including some of the largest ecommerce companies around the world. The company continued to enjoy over 90% retention rate among its clients, highlighting the trust that Criteo keeps even with the growing privacy concerns.\n\n**Shopper\u2019s Data:** Criteo aggregates $2.5B daily online sales across 4B SKU, **the largest commerce dataset among independent ad tech**. To put $2.5B daily transaction into perspective, it\u2019s bigger than Amazon\u2019s (online) and Walmart\u2019s (offline) daily revenue. This ecosystem helps Criteo to add more value to their individual retailer clients that has much smaller transaction data, creating a sticky network effect with the clients.\n\n**Non-Cookie Identifier:** Criteo could match up to 2.5B internet users with non-cookie identifiers which would be incredibly useful in a cookie-less world that we are heading into. To put 2.5B into perspective, that\u2019s almost the same number of users of Facebook. **Criteo is leading the next generation of identifier technology as it partners with The Trade Desk in developing UID 2.0**, open sourced identity framework dedicated to digital advertising and respectful users\u2019 privacy.\n\nWith the above competitive advantage, the company is aggressively pursuing other growth areas outside retargeting which also expands Criteo\u2019s Target Addressable Market (TAM). Advertisement Tech industry is poised to enjoy higher growth because of the following reasons:\n\n**Industry Trends**\n\n**Ecommerce Boom:** According to GroupM, global retail ecommerce (excluding food and delivery services) amounted to close to **$4 trillion in 2020 or 17% of global retail sales** in 2020 and is forecast **to represent 25% by 2024, or $7 trillion**. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the boom of ecommerce, and saw brands and retailers rapidly transform their ecommerce presence, and gain share from ecommerce giants. With lockdown restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, **U.S. online product searches on retailers' websites in the open Internet increased by 21 percentage points to close to 30% of total shares**, while the share of searches on Amazon properties declined from 66% to 43%. **The additional activities in open internet commerce is incredibly beneficial for Criteo.**\n\n**Digital Marketing Shift:** Taking advantage of this surge in ecommerce, brands accelerate the shift of their trade marketing budgets to online. Digital trade marketing already exceeded $23 billion in global spend in 2020, after **growing by an average 82% each year since 2016.**\n\n**Dependence on Adtech Players:** In today's highly competitive environment, commerce companies and consumer brands increasingly focus on profitably reaching, engaging and converting consumers. They increasingly look at diversifying their significant reliance on walled-garden digital advertising partners. On the other hand, consumers' shopping journeys have become increasingly fragmented between various websites, apps, devices, and physical stores. Consumers' time is increasingly spent online, creating a new environment for advertising, such as Connected TV. **The ability for publishers, retailers, brands and agencies to identify users, given restrictions in some environments, to create and monetize audiences, and to drive sales and customer loyalty, today relies on having the right technology partner**, able to activate the right data in an efficient way and to measure results in a transparent way across channels.\n\nCriteo\u2019s management estimates that commerces\u2019 digital marketing and monetization services spending on the open internet that could captured by Criteo\u2019s current product offering (mostly Criteo\u2019s New Solutions outside Retargeting) represents **$61B opportunity.** Note that this opportunity is growing incredibly fast, while Criteo has only captured very small slice due to Criteo\u2019s product is very new to the market. **With Criteo\u2019s scale and capabilities, the company could capture much bigger portion of total spending.**\n\nCriteo is currently focusing on its New Solutions, which is growing at 30-100% per annum (currently represent 20% of Criteo\u2019s total ex-TAC revenue, $120m per annum). **If Criteo\u2019s New Solutions enjoy industry\u2019s multiples, it could be valued between $2.5B-$6B, suggesting 25%-200% higher than current Criteo\u2019s valuations**. Note that the rest of industry doesn\u2019t have the same scale as Criteo, except The Trade Desk.\n\n**Criteo\u2019s New Solutions**\n\n**Retail Media** **(53% Growth in 2020):** Criteo Retail Media is a particularly differentiated offering in the marketplace and offers significant growth opportunities for the company. Criteo will continue to roll out the Retail Media Platform to new markets and move all Retail Media campaigns to the platform, **making the digital stores of large retailers a key advertising channel to generate high gross margin revenue from consumer brands**. In addition, Criteo intends to grow the number of retailers they work with in the U.S. and Europe, deepen their share of wallets with existing retailer and brand customers, accelerate their geographic expansion in Europe and enter new markets in the APAC region, grow their offsite advertising capabilities for brands across our premium publisher network on the open Internet, potentially enter Retail Media for retailer marketplaces, bring more commerce insights to brands as a key value-added service and provide brands with an integrated view on the Retail Media spend on Walled Garden retailers.\n\n**Brand awareness:** Criteo is extending its offering to allow for more brand awareness campaigns for both brands and retailers on the open Internet, including in video formats and through the Connected TV channel. CTV is very new to Criteo, hence the impact might not be seen yet. **Considering Criteo\u2019s scale, I believe Criteo could be a juggernaut in this space**.\n\n**Audience Targeting** **(32% Growth in 2020)\\*\\*\\*\\*:** Criteo already addresses customer acquisition as a marketing objective and intend to continue growing it, along with similar use cases building on audiences based on its shopper data. In addition, **it is investing resources in enhancing the efficacy and impact of cohort advertising on its ecosystem and help shape the end solution which will replace third-party cookies in the Google Chrome browser environment**.\n\n**Contextual advertising:** Criteo is also developing new solutions for contextual advertising to accompany its clients in the fast-changing identity landscape. Its approach to contextual advertising is different from what currently exists in the market as it is using first-party data to add a commerce \u201csignature\u201d to the content consumers are reading and watching across the Open Internet. **This enables Criteo to go beyond traditional contextual inferences of interest and intent to indicate what combinations of content are actually driving purchases**.\n\n**Omnichannel (118% Growth in 2020):** Within Criteo Marketing Solutions, it\u2019s also growing its Omnichannel capabilities. A large portion of its commerce client base operates physical stores and still generates a significant percentage of their sales from these stores. **While retailers extract massive amounts of sales data from their physical stores, they often lack the sophisticated technology necessary to activate this dataset for sales generation, both online and offline.** As a result, retailers are increasingly interested in omnichannel advertising solutions that allow them to target their customers everywhere and bridge the gap between online and offline. Omnichannel is one of the fastest-growing opportunities for Criteo. **Criteo will further expand its solutions for omnichannel advertising, including by feeding its clients' offline CRM data into Criteo\u2019s Identity Graph, in order to further grow the match rate of offline consumers with their online profile**.\n\n**The performance of Criteo\u2019s New Solutions in achieving higher that industry average growth in 2020 proves the company\u2019s capability to succeed in high growth areas.** On top of the above areas, Criteo continues to invest in newer solutions to continue adding values to its clients and expand its competitive moat such as **social/search advertisement, AI-powered insights and analytics for retailers, 1P media network.**\n\n**Risks**\n\n**Privacy Issue:** Even though Criteo is working on UID 2.0 with The Trade Desk, this might not work as well as users\u2019 cookies hence might not be accepted by the wider industry. **Personally, I\u2019m very optimistic with UID 2.0 as it would be the best in class in the industry.**\n\n**Retargeting Phasing Out:** Criteo still enjoys most of its revenue from retargeting advertisement. Retargeting has been growing very slowly and tend to decline due to privacy issues for the past few years. **I would think UID 2.0 could revive this segment, the return of leisure/travel industry could also provide more cash flows for the company.**\n\n**Technology:** Criteo being new to high growth areas might give them some headwinds from competitors who are already in the space. **To me, Criteo has the financial capability to compete in the high growth space from its healthy balance sheet/stable cash flows from retargeting. The high growth achieved in the New Solutions business should be a solid proof**.\n\n**Catalyst**\n\nThere are rumors that Criteo might be an acquisition target due to its attractive valuations and its access to wealth of data that is an envy in the industry. There\u2019s no clear details of who would be the potential acquirer, I would presume it would be TTD/Shopify who has big enough scale to gulp the firm.\n\nCriteo also has buyback program of up to $100 mill in 2021 (5% of current market cap), up from $30 mill last year.\n\nGotham City Research gives TP of $60-120 (80%-260% upside), note that the same firm gave a short recommendation back in 2017 with TP of $12.5. \n\nIn this environment where market is paying huge premiums for growth, I think Criteo is offering substantial value at a discount. I personally hold shares and some call options in the company as I believe Criteo offers attractive risk/return opportunity.\n\nPlease feel free to criticize and leave your thoughts, it's very much appreciated.",

One is with a leading innovator that is also one of the largest municipal water districts in the United States. The need for PFAS removal is becoming a high priority for many water districts globally and the current need for remediation is estimated at about $60B\n* BioLargo\u2019s first successful product launched in 2016, CupriDyne Clean, for VOC\u2019s and unrivaled odor control, is being adopted by some of the biggest municipal and publicly owned companies in the world\n* FDA registered Clyraguard, has been proven at a leading government National Infectious Disease Lab to completely inactivate SARS-CoV-2. It features unprecedented safety for disinfecting PPE while remaining safe on skin.\n* Clyraguard is [available](https://www.amazon.com/Clyraguard-Personal-Protection-Spray-mineral-based/dp/B08JNFJ38F/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=JZWQMUZGCA0K&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=clyraguard%2Bhospital-grade%2C%2Bfda-registered%2C%2Bppe%2Bdisinfectant%2Bspray&amp;psc=1&amp;qid=1608239102&amp;source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyWVlSOTdBS1k5QzVTJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNDg4OTE4MUY1REJTVERNVldVNyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwODkyNTg4MTZQTTNYSDQ0Qk5TJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&amp;sprefix=clyragu%2Caps%2C286&amp;sr=8-1-spons) on Amazon and other distribution channels and early sales are just beginning (NOTE FROM MODERATOR - PUT ON HOLD WHILE WORKING ON LABEL EXPANSION)\n* BioLargo also developed disruptive solutions for the giant water treatment industry, stormwater, and food processing industries and the company reports it is getting ready to deliver its first AOS Water Treatment System valued at $500,000 and has a major commercial pilot underway with a leading municipality in Montreal\n* BioLargo\u2019s growth and sales trajectory are pointing to positive net cash flow in well under one year\n* Positive net cash flow would immediately reduce or eliminate the need for raising additional operating capital from convertible lenders that has a history of depressing the share price. We believe the supply of shares that have been sold into the market from convertible note sellers has created a remarkable buying opportunity today\n* With Pros heavily outweighing the Cons, BioResearchAlert finds BioLargo shares highly attractive and undervalued. Perhaps most importantly we find that investment timing couldn\u2019t be better than now because the company\u2019s sales are growing at a pace that is very close to achieving positive net cash flow that will work to reduce the supply of shares and increase buying. All factors are converging and pointing to substantially higher prices in the near term and for the long haul\n\nSavvy investors know from experience that one of the biggest investment challenges is timing. Almost every publicly traded company has a story so good that it entices many investors, but the two most obvious questions that always seem to pop up are; First, will they succeed? And second, WHEN? Experienced investors know only too well the importance of timing. After all, the amount of time spent in any investment is directly related to the real Return On Investment or \u201cROI\u201d. And ROI is always measured in units of time - typically one year.\n\nA deep dive into BioLargo, Inc. (BLGO: OTCQB) demonstrates a company that has spent several long and challenging years, and approximately $25 million building the company while developing technologies that are finally now ready for prime-time commercialization.\n\nFast forward to today. Their first successful commercial product is called CupriDyne Clean that in 2016 was introduced to the Waste Handling and Cannabis industries. Competing odor control products work by masking problematic odors with an overpowering scent of lemon or cherry or some other acceptable smell. Odor masking does not eliminate the source of the problem, but CupriDyne Clean actually breaks down the odor causing compounds for complete elimination. When witnessed in person it\u2019s simply amazing.\n\nThis recent short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link&amp;v=ReI9CB0eluE) presentation at the most recent LD Micro Investor Conference is a definite must for serious investors. It highlights BioLargo\u2019s impressive progress and how close they are to busting out on their way to becoming a unicorn with their first $1 billion market capitalization.\n\nThe following illustrations, charts, and product descriptions were presented at this conference:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/26wk9mqo7qj61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b90e432766d37997da8635874e00423bdf89f94\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g91peiur7qj61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a2a1a541720370772c9dbad8b922d2ae1bb333f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4d4zvz0w7qj61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eff6d1eb3ba645385a309a16deaa2673557ebe72\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b68g5bxx7qj61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b45a5f96f9a91c25e6263efca30f2b163314cec\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/41wynjpz7qj61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46feb8259eae0b7417f5b91771a3914c8506dbb4\n\n**Investment Pros**\n\nManagement has proven they are committed and has navigated an incredible journey to develop unrivaled proprietary products for very large markets. Their financials are improving and their timing to market ranges from now to the very short-term horizon.\n\n**Investment Cons**\n\nThe company will have to pick partners very carefully, uplist to the larger NASDAQ market, and once they generate positive cash flow, they will require additional capital to accelerate their growth trajectory.\n\nESG or Green Tech Investments\n\nBioLarge is an outstanding ESG company and #ESG or #GreenTech Investments are becoming an integral part of a preponderance of institutional and individual investors. Following is a partial list of ESG tickers: \u00a0EW, EQIX, POD, EME, CDNS, NRC, NED, MSFT, HAS, OC, HD, MLHR, ORA, TXN, BFAM, CRM, AMAT, KEYS, WST, DECK, IDXX, CPB, CBRE, PWR, ES, PG, RMD, A, AXTA, GOOG, MKC, VRTX, TNDM, KSU, SRE, GIS, AMGN, TNET, GWW, TROW, ADBE, BWXT, MMC, PEAK, ACM, PEP, INTU, CMI, WAT, MEI, AMPE, GAXY, INO, SRNE, MRNA, HTBX, IBIO, VXRT, VBIV, ONTX, TNXP, CODX, NVAX, VIR, APT\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe believe BioLargo\u2019s share price of $.14 per share and market cap of $30 million represents an exceptionally well-timed investment opportunity. With the company decisively shifting gears from R&amp;D to launching disruptive products to fill large market needs and convertible debt financing coming to a close, we foresee rising share prices beginning very shortly and continuing for years to come. BioLargo is a very impressive company that after a long and challenging development cycle is now poised to see shares trading at strikingly higher prices beginning in the near future.\n\nDennis Calvert, BioLargo\u2019s CEO says, *\u201cIf you want the prize, you have to do the hard work. BioLargo is a company that has done the hard work and is about to get the prize.\u201d*",

        "selftext": "Mohawk Group is quietly becoming a leading consumer products company that currently sells mostly on the Amazon platform. With 11 brands and over 1000+ product SKU\u2019s, Mohawk is on pace for a record 2021 of projected $370m in annual sales. The company uses data from multiple sources, including Amazon, where most of its sales come from, along with other third party sources. Their strategy is straightforward: find categories where there is no clear leader, improve the product by addressing pain points in negative reviews, and automate marketing and logistics to become the leading seller within the category. The goal is to do this across categories, **internationally and even on other marketplace platforms.** They are already successful with product lists on Shopify and Walmart, in addition to Amazon.\n\nWHAT THEY WANT TO DO: Mohawk\u2019s goal is to find annuity like categories/products that require limited annual refining. For example, a mini fridge between now and a couple of years from now will likely need minimal version changes.\n\nWHAT THEY DO NOT WANT TO DO: Mohawk wants to stay clear of short term trending categories or products that expose them to product listing displacement. For example, portable headphones like AirPods change every 6 months. That is not what they want.\n\nSO HOW\n\nThe answer is AI Mohawk eCommerce Engine, or \"AIMEE\". This internal software solution unifies idea generation, inventory, automated marketing, warehousing, and logistics. Most single sellers use single point solutions for all these essential business functions with little interoperability (Jungle Scout or Helium 10). For example, can you successfully automate marketing and pricing if your marketing engine does not know how much inventory is in stock? It seems unmanageable at scale and therefore single point software solutions limit product expansion. This is why API's were prioritized by companies like Salesforce with their acquisition of MuleSoft to aggregate data.\n\nAIMEE is utilized in 3 ways.\n\n**First is product discovery and creation.** And it works. See it: type \"countertop refrigerator\" or \"dehumidifier\" into Amazon, and you can see Mohawk's hOmeLabs brand on the top labeled as \"bestseller\" with editorial recommendations and thousands of reviews above 4.5 star average. Note - this is **digital real estate moat**. Each product carries its own moat. Digital version of physical real estate.\n\nThey have plans of 8-12 product launches each month. They have targets of $1-1.5m in annual sales for products, with a contribution margin target north of 10-15% now. **Approximately 80% of the company\u2019s products became profitable within three months of launch**. The company defines such profitability by a positive \u201ccontribution margin\u201d which accounts for all variable costs associated with a product, such as manufacturing and marketing but not fixed costs.\n\n**The second is automation capabilities**, which bring inherent efficiency to the business. MWK has been able to keep its headcount nearly flat while maintaining high revenue growth - as of FY19, they had 144 workers (61 employees and 83 independent contractors). That's $792000 revenue per worker in FY19; and then for FY20, they guide 185 million revenue with only 150 workers ([https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EpR8AGRXIAIRBli?format=jpg&amp;name=medium](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EpR8AGRXIAIRBli?format=jpg&amp;name=medium)), which yields $1.23 million per worker!\n\n**Third, AIMEE allows Mohawk to discover acquisition targets based on category killers.** Management knows they can't compete within all categories, and instead, they can acquire these category leading products at an enterprise accretive 2-4x EBITDA today.\n\nThis accretive acquisition success is continually confirmed even as of this week:\n\n&gt;Feb 2, 2021 Alliance Global Partners analyst Brian Kinstlinger raised the firm's price target on Mohawk Group and reiterates a Buy rating on the shares following the company's acquisition of Healing Solutions. The \"solid\" acquisition validates Mohawk's strategy, Kinstlinger tells investors in a research note. The analyst sees Mohawk as a \"rare business that can buy companies on the cheap and easily integrate, while creating instant shareholder value given its relatively high valuation (like an arbitrage).\"\n\nOther growth potentials: **Platform as a Service, or PaaS.** Mohawk could provide AIMEE as an end to end software solution for product discovery to support functionality, along with an on ramp to multi party warehousing and logistics. We can think about potential users, and potential revenue per user. Single point solutions like Jungle Scout generate \\~$300-400 in average revenue per user, while Amazon\u2019s marketplace supports over 3 million sellers worldwide. This space could resemble what Snowflake and other multi-cloud vendors are doing in cloud, creating a platform on top of platforms. If Mohawk were to enter this in the future, expect the stock to be valued like SaaS and its forward price to sales ratio should explode even higher.\n\n**VALUATION**\n\nManagement guides conservatively and constantly raises outlook, and analysts will be raising price targets continually:\n\n&gt;Feb 2, 2021 For full year 2021, the Company expects net revenue to be in the range of $340M to $370M, **up from** $290M to $320M, reflecting the addition of the Healing Solutions business. The Company is establishing a net income estimate for the year ended December 31, 2021, which it expects to be in a range of $1M to $5M due primarily to quarterly interest expense, net and stock-based compensation expense. The Company is also establishing an Adjusted EBITDA estimate for the year ended December 31, 2021, which it expects to be in the range of $28M to $32M.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Feb 3, 2021 Roth Capital analyst Matt Koranda raised the firm's price target on Mohawk Group to $37 from $16 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst notes that Mohawk has announced the acquisition of Healing Solutions and increased/introduced 2021 revenue/adjusted EBITDA guidance, **which both appear highly conservative.**\n\nCurrent Mohawk market cap as of writing: $831 million at $31.8 per share\n\nRevenue growth rate: expected to be &gt;50% (FY20 guided to 185M, FY21 current guidance at 370M). They have a revenue CAGR of 79% since 2016 (Mohawk reported revenues of $73.3 million in 2018, up 101% from 2017, with the top-line doubling each year since 2015)\n\n3Q 2020 results showed operating income increased to $0.1 million compared to an operating loss of $(14.1) million in the third quarter of 2019.\n\nContribution margin improved to 19.1% from 8.0% in the third quarter of 2019.\n\nCurrent NTM EV/Sales: 1.8x\n\nI firmly believe the stock should be valued **at least** 5x NTM EV/Sales by the end of 2021, if they continue to execute. This is based on management's conservative guidance, continued insane growth rate, increasing margins, massive TAM, future international growth potential, future potential SaaS opportunities. MWK can be viewed as blend of CPG and a software/machine learning company where comps for latter trade at even higher multiples.\n\nI would therefore not be surprised if share prices hit $120 at the end of this year ($3 billion market cap valuation)\n\nOTHER POSITIVES:\n\nStrong company culture. Cofounder Yaniv Sarig. Strong visionary. CEO interview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFDAbkirUg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFDAbkirUg)\n\nGlassdoor reviews are positive and average 4 stars.\n\nLots of insider buying on the open market when it dipped hard in the summer 2020 and the stock is heavily insider owned.\n\nMore institutions buying in: [https://fintel.io/so/us/mwk](https://fintel.io/so/us/mwk)\n\n**RISKS:**\n\n\\-Some consider Amazon Basics as a competing risk, but I wouldn't think so. $295 billion of products were sold on Amazon in 2020. That's expected to grow to $500 billion in the next five years. Amazon cannot be the best in every subcategory on its *massive* marketplace, and Amazon would prefer sellers put their own capital at risk. **Jeff Bezos knows this (see link below), and himself said he wants third party sellers to succeed.** He wants the marketplace to grow which in the long run makes Amazon more money over customer's spending lifetime, than trying to take short term gain by elbowing sellers off the marketplace platform. He knows he can't win every category. As of December 2020, the amount of Amazon Basics products in the top 10 of their categories fell to near February 2018 levels. This figure peaked to nearly 500 in July of 2019 and has trended lower ever since to 346 products.\n\n\\-Small cap, which means volatility. Volume is still low, only \\~1.3 million shares get traded even on big news days. This means if you are a very emotional investor, you might panic sell - I would expect frequent dips to occur that are unrelated to the fundamentals of the company.\n\n\\-Geopolitical risks: any major escalation in a china trade war or black swan event (another pandemic or such) that disrupts supply chains would be a huge negative.\n\n\\-To fund more acquisitions they need to raise more capital. I expect share dilution to occur later this year with secondary offerings.\n\nBezos letter [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312519103013/d727605dex991.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312519103013/d727605dex991.htm)\n\nAvory research memo (much of the above post was taken from here): [https://docsend.com/view/hmvxfxyrfgdyq547](https://docsend.com/view/hmvxfxyrfgdyq547)\n\nMohawk's investor presentation as of Feb 2021:\n\n[https://ir.mohawkgp.com/static-files/b5122a4a-139b-4645-820b-f61e36286a5b](https://ir.mohawkgp.com/static-files/b5122a4a-139b-4645-820b-f61e36286a5b)\n\nAlso: a tweet today from one of their cofounders\n\n[https://twitter.com/asherdelug/status/1357443269941166084?s=21](https://twitter.com/asherdelug/status/1357443269941166084?s=21)\n\n&gt;$MWK as of today a billion dollar co.

        "selftext": "Hello Apes,  \nThis is one of my first posts and am going to try to make this a weekly thing to help you apes and autists out. \n\nHedgefunds and asset management firms have these analysts preparing all these market forecasts all the time. I feel like us apes could come together to defeat the hedgies by putting all our thoughts together and getting a sense of how the market might look like in the near future. So we can get tendies! Who wants tendies? I want tendies!\n\nPlease note this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. I am just an ape. This is purely for education purpose. Please consult a financial advisor not me.\n\nYou all must be wondering, what the hell is going on in the market lately? Why are stonks down? Where are my tendies?\n\nWell Apes, apparently there are these things called bonds. JPOW sells these things at auctions and people buy them! Can you believe it? People actually buy things other than stonks.\n\nLately these bond traders have been very worried that things are getting back to normal! There's $1.9 trillion on its way and that means tendies! Tendies for everyone! And that means prices of things might go up. And if that happens then Fed might have to raise interest rates to keep the prices from getting out of control!\n\nThese genuis bond traders have ultra paper hands and they were expecting rates to rise in 2023. But they are afriad they might go up in 2022! Oh lawd! Have mercy.\n\nIf interest rates go up. It means stonks go down! Witchcraft! These bond traders are scared and pooping their pants. No one is buying, which is driving the prices of some of these bonds down. means yields are rising! Rising yields oh no!  Everyone is panicking and cashing out.\n\nSo bond traders are all looking at JPOW like what you gonna do. You gonna keep running that printer or stop? JPOW is like. Whatever YOLO. But bond traders are not convinced. They feel like JPOW like a cheating boyfriend is lying and will probably backstab them and raise rates.\n\nSo bond traders don't wknow what to do. They are panicking. Scared and running around like chickens without heads. All this fear is spreading into the stock market and people are selling their stocks.\n\nStocks are down! Stocks are down! Stocks are down!\n\nSo what's ahead? Well Feb's job report is out on FRIDAY. If the numbers look good Thats Bad! Good means bad because it means things are getting back to normal. No! Bond traders don't want things to get back to normal. If numbers are bad Thats good! Because that means less risk of higher rates.\n\nGood is bad and bad is Good!  What in the world is going on?!?\n\nWell - All you need to know is JPOW is speaking on Thursday. Everyone will be watching. If he says something stupid... Stonks will go down. So lets hope he doesn't say anything stupid. Job reports out on Friday. If report is good then more red! \n\nAlso - Expect some more red if bond traders panic a bit more and drag the stocks down. If there is fear in the market then fewer insitutions will buy stuff. Apes are still buying. So keep buying and keep holding those diamond hands. Don't paper hand! Hold Strong! Let the insitution paper hand. If we keep holding. The market will stabilize in the next week or so. If we buy that means more tendies.\n\nAll the best Apes. Just remember, expect turbulence ahead. But it will pass in a week or so. As soon as those stimulus cheques hit the streets, there will be tendies! Glorious tendies.\n\nApes:  \nWhat is Queen Cathie doing:   \nInvestors took out $1 billion out of her funds last week. People are pancking. Queen Cathie is staying calm and Diamond Handing (Bought): Palantir, Twitter, Square, Paypal, Signify Health, Baidu, JD, Tesla, Spotify. \n\nShe is Paper-Handing (Sold): Apple, FB, Snap, Alibaba, Salesforce, Amazon, Alphabet, Roku\n\nvs.\n\nHedgies:   \nPaul Singer: \"Crash is coming! Can't wait to say I told you so!\"  \n\n\nLet's see who wins in the next couple of weeks. If you thougth last week was volatile. Just wait till you see whats in store for the next couple of weeks!\n\nApes Strong -  If you disagree or have any questions, feel free to msg me or leave a comment. Thanks!",

        "selftext": " I've been watching the laggard stocks that are strong yet slow moving.\n\nHere is my previous post on Raytheon a couple months ago back in October. It took about a month, but it did hit the $75 price target and has been hovering from $70-$72 price range since. Had 25% gains easy. More with options.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jago9f/long\\_term\\_hold\\_raytheon\\_25\\_upside/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jago9f/long_term_hold_raytheon_25_upside/)\n\nOn to Lockheed. Disclaimer - I have $22k in Lockheed. Considering selling the 20k I have in CRM and putting into LMT. \n\nMedian Price Target : $421.50\n\nAverage Price Target: $429.89\n\nCurrent Price: $336+-\n\nPotential Upside: 28%+\n\nLooking at the charts, it's plainly a large defense company laggard. No significant news coming out of the defense department lately - which is overall a good thing for the world, imo. However, that leaves opportunity to make money on the stock when the news does come.\n\nHere's some rudimentary TA: Notice the momentum (weekly) at the bottom, and my exit point. I expect another 1-4 months before hitting my exit.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/OWao3tt](https://imgur.com/a/OWao3tt)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could write a long winded DD about Space Force, growing tensions with China and the issues the US has with their growing military, their acquisition of AeroJet RocketDyne (Raytheon is pissed and filed with the DOJ because of it), the Russian hacks, etc. However, I'm lazy and I think the price targets, TA, logic, and life experience are good enough for me.\n\nCheers.",

        "selftext": "Hello! Wanted to share some diligence I did on Palantir ahead of its earnings next Tuesday. Warning: long post ahead and TLDR at the bottom.\n\n**What Does Palantir Do?**\n\n* In one sentence, Palantir creates **operating systems** that integrates vast amounts of data from an organization\u2019s various data silos and allows users to build applications that drive better decision making\n* If that's confusing, no worries. The way I like to think of Palantir's software is that if Batman purchased the software from a company today for his supercomputer which aggregates data from thousands of sources and allows him to make intelligent decisions, that software would be from Palantir\n* The company has three main software platforms: **Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo**\n* **Gotham (government side)**\n   * Gotham is Palantir\u2019s software offering primarily for defense and intelligence sectors, AKA governments\n   * Gotham is an end-to-end operating system that collects data from hundreds to millions of different sources and combines them onto one platform so users can manage operations\n   * Gotham is quickly becoming the de facto data solution across many US federal agencies and\u00a0rumor has it that it was the software that helped track down Osama Bin Laden in 2011\n* **Foundry (commercial side)**\n   * Next up is Foundry, a platform that is geared towards the 6,000 businesses around the world with over $500 million in revenue\n   * Similar to Gotham, Foundry transforms the ways organizations operate by creating a central operating system for their data\n   * For example, one of Palantir\u2019s customers is Skywise, an\u00a0aviation platform that has become the central operating\u00a0system for the airline industry\n* **Apollo (underlying infrastructure)**\n   * Apollo is the last piece of the Palantir puzzle, and you can think of it as the underlying infrastructure that Gotham and Foundry lie upon\n   * Apollo is a relatively new platform that Palantir introduced in order to more efficiently update the software that runs Gotham and Foundry, increasing the number of upgrades Palantir can manage across installations from an average of 20,000 per week in Q2 2019 to more than 41,000 per week in Q2 2020\n* The company has estimated its **total addressable market as $119 billion,** of which $63 billion is for the government side while $56 billion is for commercial side\n\n**The Palantir Business Model**\n\n* Known as **Forward Deployed Engineers or FDEs,** Palantir leverages their technical talent as support and sales as well and they are often sent to the front lines of the battlefield for Gotham or company for Foundry\n   * I believe that this in particular is what helped Palantir create a competitive moat in the government sector\n* While the FDEs are a differentiator, Palantir has also started to build out a **more traditional salesforce** in order to better target customers and explain the company\u2019s value proposition but this salesforce currently only accounts for 3% of the company\u2019s total headcount\n* Using both FDEs and a traditional salesforce, Palantir\u2019s business model employs a 3 step process: acquire, expand, and scale\n* **Acquire**\n   * In the acquire step, Palantir provides a potential customer with a short-term pilot program at Palantir\u2019s expense and therefore operate at a loss\n* **Expand**\n   * In the expand phase, Palantir seeks to understand the customer\u2019s key challenges and ensure that its software delivers results\n* **Scale**\n   * The scale phase is where Palantir thrives. At this point, the customer is essentially\u00a0using Palantir\u2019s software for its operations and Palantir can also\u00a0upsell to the customer by continually\u00a0offering new services with minimal extra cost\n* To give you a sense of the numbers for each phase,\u00a0In 2019, Palantir generated a total of $742.6 million in revenue, of which **$0.6 million** came from customers in the **Acquire** phase, **$176.3 million** from the **Expand** phase, and **$565.7** million from the **Scale** phase\n\n**The Bull Case**\n\n* **Section 2377**\n   * In 2016, Palantir sued the US Army in what\u2019s known as Decision 2377\n   * To go into the history a little bit, in 1994, the Federal Streamlining Acquisition Act (FASA) was passed, which required that the federal government consider and acquire readily available, proven commercial services like Palantir\u2019s rather than custom-developed solutions built by the government which has a reputation for spending inefficiently\n   * This rule was largely ignored until Palantir sued and won in court, and this was extremely important because it allowed Palantir to compete and win deals across all federal agencies, which greatly helps the company realize its total addressable market. Since then, Palantir's revenue from the US Army and US government has skyrocketed\n* **Sticky, Best-in-Class Product**\n   * Simply put, there is nothing that offers what Palantir is offering. Its technology is way beyond most of its competitors in terms of offering a premium operating system\n   * Palantir\u2019s Gotham and Foundry often take more than a year to get fully up and running and the more it\u2019s used, the more data in the system and the more time that has been spent by customers training employees on how to use the system\n   * Palantir\u2019s platforms becomes incredibly expensive to switch out of not just in terms of money but also time, with customers saying replacing the system could take anywhere from 6 to 18 months\n   * To further prove this point, Palantir\u2019s top 20 customers have been with the company for an average of 7 years and as of October 2020, 93% of revenue was generated by existing customers\n   * In addition to this, in the latest quarterly earnings, Palantir was selected out of 999 bids by the US Army for a 2-year $91 million contract to build AI and machine learning capabilities\n* **Positive Secular Trends and Growing, Achievable TAM**\n   * I think everyone at this point realizes that companies are going digital transformations and Palantir has spent $1.5 billion in the past 11 years creating innovative software that becomes increasingly powerful each day\n   * The company is at the right place at the right time with a total addressable market expected to\u00a0grow into the few hundreds of billions of dollars in the next 5 years\n   * And with just about $1 billion dollars in revenue over the past 12 months, Palantir has less than 1% market share and has plenty of room for growth\n   * But perhaps most importantly, Palantir is creating a much more efficient business model with an improving tech product that will help the company achieve its TAM\n      * In the latest earnings call, management said that it plans to triple its salesforce headcount due to its recent success\n      * And among other improvements, the Apollo platform has helped the\u00a0company greatly reduce the costs and time required to get a customer up and running\n   * Being able to better target customers and onboard them quickly while providing a best-in-class and sticky data platform points to a bright future for Palantir\n\n**The Bear Case**\n\n* **Double-Edged Business Model**\n   * While Palantir\u2019s differentiated services and business model is one of the company\u2019s key strengths, there are also several downsides as well\n   * First, due to the custom-built solutions Palantir offers, the company undergoes a costly and complicated minimum 6 month sales cycle that can often amount to nothing\n   * Second, even if a customer jumps on board, contracts are cancelable with a typical notice of 3-6 months\n   * Third, the deep history it has with customers results in a very top-heavy concentration\n      * As of the third quarter of 2020, the top 20 customers represented 61% of the company\u2019s revenue, which notably is down from 73% from the year prior\n   * Lastly, the deal-by-deal nature of Palantir\u2019s business model means that the sources of revenue are lumpy and hard to predict, which can be a cause of\u00a0concern for investors\n* **Biden Administration and Negative Headline Risk**\n   * First, Peter Thiel was an outspoken supporter of Trump, who increased defense spending 5% a year while Obama decreased spending 3% a year.\n      * While I don\u2019t think this will be a long-term issue, a Biden presidency does represent a potential decrease in defense budgets which could hinder Palantir\u2019s growth with Gotham\n      * However, it is important to note that management during its latest earnings call did address this issue, stating that it has worked with many administrations across the world and doesn\u2019t foresee this to be a problem\n   * Second, Palantir has been targeted by the media several times for giving the government too much power and the political and social environment in which the tide seems to be turning against tech could present Palantir with headaches in the future\n      * This risk is also further exacerbated by the fact that Palantir is 49.9999% owned by its co-founders, who are outspoken and strongly opinionated. Clear corporate governance risk.\n* **Tough Competition in Commercial Space**\n   * In my opinion the largest obstacle Palantir faces is its ability to execute in the commercial space\n   * Palantir offers an expensive, premium, custom-built end-to-end solution for clients, which is great for the government but not exactly what most businesses are looking for\n   * Instead, most large scale businesses have already invested heavily into their own systems and want to buy best-in-class piecemeal solutions from different tech companies\n   * Several notable businesses left Palantir from 2019 to 2020, including JP Morgan, Coca Cola, and American Express, and this decreased the customer count from 133 to 125\n   * However, one important thing to note is that in the latest earnings call, Palantir\u2019s management openly addressed this issue and the company has already started to provide solutions that are modular, which means customers can take the individual solutions they want rather than adopting the entire Foundry system\n      * This also allows the\u00a0company to offer different price points which may allow Palantir to be\u00a0more competitive in the market\n      * Recent news of bringing on BP and IBM as clients could also be a sign that its Foundry business may be ready for mass adoption\n* **Lock-up Expiration**\n   * Because this is a short-term risk, I\u2019m adding this as a bonus bearish reason\n   * Palantir went public through a direct listing on September 30, 2020, during which up to 20% of shares were available to trade\n   * The remaining 80% is available to trade starting February 19th when the lockup expires and this could lead to a flooding of shares being sold and at the very least, volatility caused by the uncertainty\n\n**Financials and Valuation**\n\n* **Starting off with the income statement,** the important things to note is that from 2018 to 2019, the company has grown revenue by about 25% while maintaining roughly the same amount in operating expenses, which speaks to the improved operational efficiency of the\u00a0company\n   * The company has guided to $1.07 billion for the full year of 2020, which represents a 44% year over year increase and for a\u00a0company with 1 billion in revenue, increasing revenue\u00a0growth is a great sign\n   * Comparing Q3 2020 to Q3 2019, the company was able to increase average\u00a0revenue per customer by 38% and grew commercial revenue by 35% and\u00a0government revenue by 68%\n   * With all this\u00a0said, one piece of concern in Palantir\u2019s income statement is its net losses. The company has not been able to turn a profit in its entire history, but it did report positive adjusted operating income in its latest quarter when adjusted for stock based compensation\n* **Moving onto its latest cash flow statement,** what you mainly need to know is\u00a0that the company has recently had a huge stock based compensation expense this past year due to the direct listing, so if you were to add that back, the company is essentially\u00a0near break-even\n   * However, the company\u2019s free cash flow (operating cash flow minus your capital expenditures) is negative, so the company still is clearly losing money although much less than even a year prior\n* **Lastly, Palantir has a great balance sheet**\n   * With $1.8 billion in cash and only $200mm in debt, the company is in a great position to fuel its future growth\n* **Regarding the company\u2019s valuation,** while the company is growing nicely at 44% from 2019-2020, and is expected to grow 31% from 2020-2021 based on street estimates, it currently trades around a 45x NTM sales multiple depending on the day, which makes it one of the most expensive companies on the market\n   * The key question here is do you want to pay an extremely high premium for a company that does have a best-in-class software or wait for a better entry point?\n\n**What I\u2019m Doing**\n\n* Personally, I can't justify Palantir's valuation, which may sound a little old-school but I think there are better opportunities out there\n* However, in the long-run I am bullish on the company and would buy on any major dips in the 20s (and teens if it somehow falls down to that)\n* I'm also closely monitoring what happens after earnings (2/16) and next week the lock-up expires on 2/19 so it'll be interesting to see what happens to the stock then\n\n**TLDR:** Palantir has a best-in-class, sticky data platform that it offers to both the government side (where it's pretty much a monopoly) and businesses (which is picking up steam with tweaks to the business model and a growing salesforce). Growing healthy top-line but unprofitable and trading at a higher valuation than almost all other software companies. I am holding off on buying for now but would welcome major dips as great buying opportunities.",

        "selftext": " **Boardwalktech Software Corp (BWLK.V)**\n\nMy friend asked me to take a look at [Boardwalk](https://www.boardwalktech.com/) before he bought into their recently closed $10M private placement (upsized from $8M because of all the demand from sophisticated investors). As I researched I got more excited, so I did a write up for my buddy and then bought a position in the open market. Sharing what I wrote him for those that might be interested. Of course you\u2019ll have to make your own investment decision, this is not advice, just what I learned reading through their SEDAR filings.\n\nMy opinion is that BWLK has rock solid fundamentals that underpin a long-term investment, but what I really got excited about is the multitude of catalysts that any day could rocket the stock price many multiples higher. Here are the 6 reasons I bought BWLK and am holding for a 10 bagger:\n\n**1. Proven Product**\n\nBoardwalk\u2019s patented DLT software is a simple value-add for companies of every size (B2B offering). What does a simple value-add mean? It makes it easy for companies to pull the trigger on purchasing it because there is a clear value proposition. And who do they sell too? Cash strapped Fortune 500 companies, who are sitting on a record level of cash ($1T+) and don\u2019t know what to do with it (buy Bitcoin?). \n\nBoardwalk keeps [closing deals](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/boardwalktech-announces-contract-with-a-major-consumer-products-company-858248748.html) (+another one on the 16th w/Fortune 500 company) and has a deep pipeline for 2021, so I\u2019m thinking solid revenue growth every quarter this year at their 85%+ gross margins. BWLK is investing a bunch of cash from the recent $10M upsized private placement into their salesforce, so I expect them to rattle off a ton of big deals with household type names (they already work with Coca-Cola, Apple, Qualcomm, etc). SEDAR is down this morning but I think they are cash flow positive and close to profitability, which is crazy for a fast growing tech company at this stage.\n\n**2. SaaS Multiples**\n\nBoardwalk has been investing heavily in shifting their product from a traditional B2B sales model to a software-as-a-service model (SaaS). They are going to blow their market size wide open when potential customers (businesses of ANY size) can simply go to their website and sign-up for and start using their product in 10 minutes on a subscription basis. This increased customer base and ease of purchase is going to provide tons of growth opportunities in the future. That is why venture-backed SaaS revenue multiples are \\~10-15 times annual recurring revenue (ARR). If BWLK starts closing these deals and the SaaS model picks up steam, ARR could reach $10-15M pretty quick, implying a company valuation of $100-150M or more at private co multiples. After yesterday\u2019s close, Boardwalk\u2019s market cap was still &lt;$50M. The thing is, this company is already publicly traded and has liquidity! Once people realize that Boardwalk\u2019s real long-term growth driver is a SaaS delivery model, I could see this thing going 3-10x.\n\n**High Management Holdings**\n\nVCs don\u2019t invest in ideas, they invest in people. Boardwalk is an early-stage company run by proven operators who have successfully grown and exited multiple tech companies. These guys are not messing around and have an impressive track record. They also have skin in the game, management still owns a big chunk of the company even though it is publicly traded and could cash out any day. With all the exits under their belts, I don\u2019t think they are in it for the money. They are in it to build a great product. There are whole investing strategies based on simply investing in heavily management owned companies - because who knows better where the business is going than the people inside running it? Boardwalk has that. And, it means a limited amount of the float is actually being traded. So, as soon as this thing starts running it could explode upwards because there are so few sellers.\n\n**A Blockchain Angle**\n\nBoardwalk\u2019s underlying solution is a decentralized ledger technology that provides a single source of truth for companies dealing with high volumes of data coming from different places. Presumably, the actors within any given company should be able to trust accuracy of data pushed/pulled because everyone is working towards the same end (i.e. for their company). So, most applications of their DLT technology would not need to be implemented on a true blockchain (i.e. a DLT trustlessly verified by cryptographic hashing of independent parties). \n\nHowever, Boardwalk is well positioned to offer their Fortune 500 clients blockchain solutions used in industry consortium, for example. Maybe 5 oil companies wanted to be able to share all of their pipeline sensor data with each other so that they could use the data set to improve their respective processes - maybe they would want to decentralize the ability to alter that ledger so that one company couldn't go in and erroneously alter their sensor data to throw off their competitors. \n\nSo, blockchain may be an angle that Boardwalk explores, especially with the hype around blockchain right now and cryptocurrency prices. I\u2019m not sure exactly how they would monetize it as a business other than their current biz model, but my feeling based on the retail trading frenzy these days is that if at some point BWLK puts out a press release even mentioning the word blockchain, this thing could blow up.  And I\u2019d take upside for any reason.\n\n**Price Action**\n\nI started building a position in this a month ago so I\u2019ve been watching the level II pretty much every day. Frankly, no one is selling this. There is a solid (albeit small $ vallue) line up on the bid all day, every day. But the ask is so thin and spread out, it is clear to me that there aren\u2019t many traders in this stock and rather people invested for the long-term vision of Boardwalk to become a powerhouse in and of itself, or be acquired. This was apparent yesterday on a 20% price increase - there was simply no one on the ask so the price can get hot quick. Also, the $10M in new money is locked up until after April so that also keeps the float contained. I believe that BWLK also has the right to wipe some old warrants off the table if they trade &gt;$1.00 for a certain period of time (maybe consecutive days), so that should also clean up the cap table a bit if things continue on this path.",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to the final trading day of February. Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/26/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-26-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Stocks try to recover from Thursday\u2019s tech rout\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures were choppy as tech stocks tried to recover from Thursday\u2019s rout that dragged the Nasdaq down 3.5% for its worst single-day performance since October. Tesla fell slightly again in Friday\u2019s premarket, a day after sinking 8% in a brutal week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday sank 559 points, or 1.8%, from a record closing high the previous session. The Dow had its worst day in nearly a month and so did the S&amp;P 500, which lost almost 2.5%. The culprit behind the selloff was the rapid rise in bond yields.\n\n&gt; * All three stock benchmarks were tracking for weekly losses. Ahead of Friday\u2019s trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was clinging to a gain for February, which started off strong. The Nasdaq was down nearly 7% from its Feb. 12 record closing high. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 both remain solidly in the green for the month. However, the S&amp;P 500 was off almost 2.7% from its last record closing high, also on Feb. 12.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. 10-year Treasury yield retreats slightly from one-year high\n\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield retreated Friday morning, but remained above 1.4%, after surging to 1.6% in the previous session to its highest level since February 2020 and more than 0.5% higher since the end of January. The spike in the 10-year yield, which is used as a benchmark for mortgage rates and auto loans, has been driven by expectations of improving economic conditions as coronavirus vaccines are rolled out, as well as fears of higher inflation.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. House to pass Covid bill; Senate official says no minimum wage\n\n&gt; * Inflation worries are being stoked on the thought that the $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus bill \u2014 which is seen passing the House on Friday \u2014 on top of accelerating growth could overheat the economy. Democrats on Capitol Hill are trying to push their relief measure, including a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour, through without GOP support. However, a key nonpartisan official, the Senate parliamentarian, ruled Democrats cannot include the minimum wage increase in the bill. The decision means the Senate will likely pass a different version of the bill than the House, and representatives will have to approve the plan a second time.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. FDA panel to vote on J&amp;J\u2019s single-shot Covid vaccine\n\n&gt; * A key FDA vaccine advisory panel is set to vote Friday on whether to recommend approval of Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s Covid-19 single-shot for emergency use, which would help pave the way to for a third preventive treatment in the U.S. While the full FDA doesn\u2019t have to follow the vaccine committee\u2019s recommendation, it often does. During similar requests by Pfizer and Moderna for vaccines, the FDA authorized those companies\u2019 two-shot regimes a day after the panel of outside medical advisors backed emergency use authorization.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. DoorDash stock falls after company drops first results since IPO\n\n&gt; * As more and more Americans are vaccinated and the economy continues to open up more fully, companies like DoorDash, which has benefited from the stay-at-home trade, could get hurt. In its first report as a public company, the food delivery service old shareholders it expects some of the tailwinds it experienced from stay-at-home orders across the U.S. will turn around once the country gets the virus under control. Shares sank 10% in Friday premarket. Even with that drop, DoorDash would still be up nearly 50% from its $102 per share offer price back in December. While DoorDash late Thursday reported $970 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, which beat estimates, it also reported an adjusted per-share loss of $2.67.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/nQ4OULP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fSUwJLJ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/CLJNnMp7/econcal3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/L8XVtdHp/econcal1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.postimg.cc/66cRYHb5/ipos1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/9Mn4Hk6G/eram01.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/AqrZ1zR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/x1Vhf1Yd/Screenshot-2021-02-25-at-4-26-19-PM.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/5NCDWFhG/Screenshot-2021-02-25-at-4-26-56-PM.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/DfDRNcML/Screenshot-2021-02-25-at-4-27-32-PM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/iVbXewC.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/dVbYwpGv/divical1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/GhSRSH24/divical2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/13nSxsnJ/divical3.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.postimg.cc/dt0vB8qM/divical4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/26/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-foot-locker-beyond-meat-doordash-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Foot Locker (FL)** \u2013 Foot Locker shares tanked 12.1% in premarket trading after quarterly revenue came in below Street forecasts and comparable-store sales unexpectedly declined.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 22nd, 2021.\n\n# **Stronger economic data could power stocks that thrive in a rebound in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/stronger-economic-data-could-power-stocks-that-thrive-in-a-rebound-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; A decline in new Covid infections, along with improving economic data and stimulus hopes, could boost stocks that flourish in a resurging economy in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, expectations for a strong economic rebound helped boost interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; While the broader stock market was choppy, sectors that do well in a rebound \u2013 financials, airlines and industrials \u2013 stood out as leaders. This is known as the reflation trade.\n*****\n&gt; Those stocks gained at the expense of growth and technology, down 2%. Strategists expect that reflation trade to continue as signs suggest that the economy could make a sharp comeback.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.7% on the week to 3,906, while the Dow was up a tiny 0.1% at 31,494. The Nasdaq was off 1.57% for the week, to 13,874, with the decline in tech. Apple, for instance, gave up 4% on the week.\n*****\n&gt; The big event in the week ahead is testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who delivers his semi-annual testimony on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; He is expected to discuss the increase in interest rates, as well as concerns that inflation could begin to take off.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to acknowledge that the data is improving and the virus situation is improving quite materially,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America. \u201cIt is going to be hard for him to sound as dovish as he has been.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Powell is expected to continue to emphasize that the Fed will keep rates low for a long time and maintain its easy policies to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; # Improving forecasts\n&gt; Economists this past week ratcheted up tracking forecasts for first quarter gross domestic product, fueled in part by an unexpectedly sharp jump of 5.3% in January retail sales.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman upped first-quarter growth to 6%, and Morgan Stanley said it was tracking at 7.5% for the first quarter. Economists linked the surprise gain in retail sales to stimulus checks sent to individuals under the last $900 billion stimulus program approved by Congress in late December.\n*****\n&gt; The Biden administration has proposed another $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. That could come before the House of Representatives in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; \u2033[Powell\u2019s] going to stick to the script. The script is lawmakers need to continue to provide support for the economy. He\u2019s going to be supportive of the administration\u2019s effort to get a big package through,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n*****\n&gt; # Key data during the week\n&gt; Earnings continue to be important. There are more than 60 companies reporting, including Home Depot, Macy\u2019s and TJX.\n*****\n&gt; Key economic reports dropping next week include durable goods on Thursday, along with personal income and spending data on Friday\n*****\n&gt; The Friday report includes the personal consumption expenditure price index, which the Fed monitors. The market is on the lookout for signs of rising inflation.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the boom is going to start sooner than most people think,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.\n*****\n&gt; He said the stronger economy is helping drive Treasury yields higher, with the 10-year hitting a one-year high of 1.36% on Friday. Keon said the vaccine rollout is helping the outlook, as is the slowing spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think people were expecting a second-half boom, but I think the second quarter is going to be very strong, as people change their behavior,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe caution when it comes to savings and not going out, that\u2019s going to go away sooner than we think,\u201d Keon said. \u201cRight now, you might see a 10% GDP number in the second or third quarter.

Starting with a look at dividend stocks, the iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) rose 1.35% today for its best day since January 6th when DVY rose nearly 4%. As shown below, DVY has recently been on a tear.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-DVY.png))**\n\n&gt; Along with the dividend ETF (DVY), the iShares S&amp;P 500 Value ETF (IVE) rose 0.31%, reaching a new 52-week high intraday. That compares to the growth counterpart, the iShares S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), which saw a bearish engulfing on its 0.65% decline. Today was the widest outperformance for value (IVE) over growth (IVW) since mid-January. As shown below, while both are still trending nicely higher long-term, the value ETF is at new highs while growth is closer to its 50-day moving average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**\n\n&gt; Value's outperformance today only applied to large caps, though. While small caps have fallen over the past several sessions, the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) and Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) both rebounded nicely today with identical gains of 2.08%. In the case of small-cap growth (IWO), the recent declines have been more severe meaning today's strong performance still leaves it further below its highs than small-cap value (IWN).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-R2K.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-R2K.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Industrial Metals Shining Bright\n\n&gt; While precious metals like gold have been facing their fair share of selling recently alongside rates, elsewhere in the metals markets, industrial metals have been surging. Year to date, industrial metals\u2014as proxied by the Bloomberg Industrial Metals total return index\u2014are up 11.43% while their precious metals counterpart is down by over 4%. With a fairly flat January, most of those gains have come from this month alone. As shown below, so far this month the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index has risen 11.41% for its strongest performance through the first 14 trading days of a month since September of 2012. Going back to the start of the index in early 1991, the only other months with stronger performance were March of 2008 (11.42) and April of 2006 (14.94).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Again, whereas industrial metals are flying, precious metals have been trending lower since the summer. In the chart below, we show the relative strength of the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index versus the precious metal counterpart index over the past five years. Times that the line is rising indicates outperformance of industrial metals and vice versa. Precious metals had been outperforming since mid-2018, but the relative strength line bottomed out back in August of last year. From then through the late fall, industrial metals outperformed, and after some consolidation from November through the end of January, industrials are once again outperforming in a big way.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-3.png))**\n\n&gt; Delving deeper, tin, copper, and nickel have been leading in those gains. As shown in the charts below, both year to date and over the past year, these three metals have risen the most with tin in the number one spot in both respects.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-2.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-4a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One Year Later: 3 Lessons Learned Since the Market Peak\n\n&gt; \u201cBulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.\u201d Old Wall Street saying.\n\n&gt; Today marks one year since the market began to price in the effects that COVID-19 would have on the world. The old market adage \u201cstairs up, elevator down\u201d certainly rang true over the coming weeks, as the S&amp;P 500 recorded the fastest bear market (closing 20% below a previous all-time high) in history, accomplishing that feat in a mere 16 days.\n\n&gt; The stock market is a peculiar mechanism however, and despite the turmoil the world has experienced since the outbreak of the pandemic, the S&amp;P 500 marched forward to set new all-time highs less than 6 months later on August 18 and hasn\u2019t looked back. So after such a wild year since the market peaked on this day in 2020, what have we learned?\n\n&gt; **1. Markets are forward looking.** While it\u2019s difficult to pin down a date when we can expect our lives to completely return to normal, the stock market is already pricing in the normalization of daily life, even if that remains uncertain. Economic conditions around the world have been improving relative to how they were at the beginning of the pandemic. While pockets of weakness remain, the market is more concerned with where the economic conditions will be, not where they are currently.\n\n&gt; **2. Sector performance is dynamic.** Investing in \u201cstay at home\u201d themed growth and technology stocks whose earnings were viewed to be relatively well insulated by the effects of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns provided both downside protection during the March volatility as well as outperformance after the market bottomed. However, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, conventional early-cycle leadership from financials and energy stocks has emerged over the past three months:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.19.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; **3. Remember your timeline.** Everyone would love to be able to pull their money at the exact top, avoid all major market corrections and reinvest at the bottom, but unfortunately, there is no holy grail timing mechanism and market volatility is the cost of admission for stock investing. \u201cIt\u2019s our jobs as investors to focus on our long-term goals,\u201d noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cDrawdowns and bear markets are part of the path to get there, and limiting the latest shiny object from affecting our decisions is key to any investment strategy.\u201d If an investor pulled their money from the market during last year\u2019s volatility, there have been a plethora of reasons to be hesitant to reinvest it, and the subsequent bounce from the lows happened in a flash, meaning they may have bought back in at a higher price than they originally sold.\n\n&gt; Thankfully, bear markets and extreme volatility like we experienced last year are rare, but they provide a unique learning opportunity for investors. No one truly knows what the future holds for the stock market, so making sure we learn from the past is crucial for long-term success as investors.

The sharp increase in new COVID-19 cases led to additional curbs on activity to contain the virus, triggering a rise in weekly jobless claims, and many feared we might have a double-dip recession.\n\n&gt; Sensing a need to act, Congress passed a fifth relief bill at the end of December, including additional direct payments to households. The lame-duck injection of fiscal stimulus to the US economy was just what it needed. Following a weak retail sales number in December\u2014ordinarily one of the strongest months for retail sales\u2014consumer spending rebounded firmly in January, rising 5.3% month over month according to the US Census Bureau\u2014the most in seven months\u2014and greater than all of the estimates in the Bloomberg economist survey.\n\n&gt; Looking under the hood makes the headline number even more remarkable. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the largest month over month increases came in categories associated with discretionary spending, including a 23.5% surge in spending at department stores:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blog-2.18.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cFiscal stimulus was just what the doctor ordered for the US consumer in January,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe boom in spending on discretionary categories could become a trend if a wave of pent-up demand gets unleashed on the economy in 2021.\u201d\n\n&gt; Clearly, direct payments to households had a major effect on January\u2019s retail sales, so does this mean that February sales will disappoint? Not exactly. Direct payments to households totaled roughly $166 billion, but the increase in January sales was only $29 billion and the savings rate remains high. Of course, not all of that money was spent on retail items, but there may be some gas left in the tank for February retail sales, particularly by individuals who didn\u2019t receive their payments until later in the month or who will be receiving a credit on their federal tax returns.\n\n&gt; Earlier this month, we raised our gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the US from 4\u20134.5% to 5\u20135.5%. Yesterday\u2019s retail sales number puts us on a solid path toward achieving that target\u2014and may even raise the prospects of exceeding it. The first quarter of 2021 is expected to be the weakest of the year, so the January surge in retail sales removes much of the risk of the US economy stumbling out of the gates as we begin 2021.\n\n&gt; However, a strong start to the year may embolden the call for a smaller price tag for President Biden\u2019s fiscal stimulus proposal. Despite this, we ultimately believe a stimulus package north of $1 trillion is likely, which should prime the US economy for continued growth in 2021 as the battle against COVID-19 improves.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Tech Leading in New Highs\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been reversing from its record highs over the past couple of sessions, but on an individual stock basis there are still a large number of names that have reached new 52-week highs. As shown in the charts from our Daily Sector Snapshot below, through yesterday's close, a net percentage of just over 15% of the S&amp;P 500 reached new 52-week highs. That is the strongest reading in new highs since January 12th. Outside of several days at the start of 2021, the only other days of the pandemic era with as high if not higher readings were September 2nd, October 9th, and November 9th. Most of the sectors are also seeing their number of new highs rise to strong levels. In addition to the S&amp;P 500, yesterday's reading for Communication Services, Financials, Materials, and Tech all were in the top decile of all days since at least 1990. In the case of Materials, while new highs have been trending higher and yesterday's reading was historically strong, it was still well off the record highs from earlier this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH.png))**\n\n&gt; On the other hand, perhaps the most impressive sector in terms of net new highs has been Technology. Yesterday, 35.53% of the sector's stocks reached a new 52-week high. Not only is that the highest reading with respect to the other sectors, but that high reading also stands in the top 0.5% of all days for the sector since at least 1990. In other words, there have only been 38 other days since 1990 that the Tech sector saw as strong of a reading in net new highs as yesterday. The most recent of those was November 9th when 43.84% of the sector touched a new 52-week high. Overall, in the context of more broadly positive breadth with strong readings in new highs for other sectors, Tech's large number of new highs is an added plus for the broader market given the massive 28.08% weight of the sector.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH-Tech.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Cap Growth Taking the Lead\n\n&gt; One of the topics we covered in last Friday's Bespoke Report was the outperformance of small caps over the past year. Even on a much shorter time horizon, that outperformance has been evident. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, in the five days ending last Friday and on a year to date basis, both Small Cap Growth (IJR) and Small Cap Value (IJS) have been two of the top-performing ETFs in our US Styles screen while large-cap counterparts have also been higher but with more modest gains. With a particular focus on growth stocks, while the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Growth (IJT) ETF was up the most of these ETFs last week with a 3.96% gain, the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) was the second-worst performer after 'only' rising 1.05%. That continued a trend that has been in place YTD with the performance spread between the two ETFs topping ten percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-TA.png))**\n\n&gt; We are coming up on the one-year anniversary of the last highs on February 19th, 2020 just before the COVID crash. For most of the past year since then, large-cap growth (IVW) had actually been outperforming small-cap growth (IJT), but since the new year began, small-cap growth has jumped ahead. Now, the S&amp;P Small Cap Growth ETF (IJT) is up 35.31% since the 2/19/20 high compared to a 28.16% gain for the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). As shown in the second chart below, IJT had been catching up on IVW for some time now though. The relative strength line of IJT versus IVW had been in a downtrend for most of the past five years meaning large-cap growth had been generally outperforming the small-cap counterpart. Since the lows last March, the line trended sideways meaning neither one saw significant outperformance, but come the fall, the line has taken off in favor of small caps. With more outperformance in the past week and a half, that line has turned sharply higher once again reaching the highest level since December of 2019 last week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-Small-vs-large-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Is A/D Line Signally Late-February Weakness?\n\n&gt; Back on January 21 in our February Almanac post our Market Probability Chart highlighted the pattern of late-February seasonal weakness. A disappointing jobless claims number today appears to be the straw the sent the market lower. In this chart of the NASDAQ 100 Index (NDX) I have overlaid the NASDAQ Composite Advance/Decline Line. The NASDAQ A/D Line peaked and flattened out about six trading days ago and is now heading lower.\n\n&gt; This coincides with the seasonal pattern of late-February weakness. However, we expect recent support to hold above 13,000. Should that level be breached major support exists around the old September doji high of 12,240. Considering how far the market has come in the face of some formidable economic and pandemic obstacles and how frothy sentiment had become, a little consolidation and pullback is to be expected.\n\n&gt; We may see some further weakness into month-end and into March, but with vaccine rollout gaining some traction, more stimulus likely and a supportive Fed we do not expect any major selloff at this juncture.\n\n&gt;

        "selftext": "Salesforce recently announced that it will be rolling out a program for \"Flex\" scheduling. Stating that employees can work from home indefinitely, even after the pandemic passes. I believe Google as made this announcement as well a few months back. I'm sure other companies will follow suite as well. \n\nIt seems as though this pandemic has opened the eyes of upper management to the fact that WFH is possible, with minimal losses to productivity. What I suspect this will lead to in the future is a downsizing of corporate/business offices. Why pay for all the space when half your staff doesn't come in to the office anyway? Couple this with cloud computing/hosting, there is an increasing lack of need for physical office space over the next 5-10 years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Other considerations**\n\nWhile this business sector is downsizing it's real estate footprint, so too is the retail market. As companies struggle to compete with Amazon and online selling, it is becoming hard to justify keeping a physical stock on hand, in display, in multiple stores across the nation and world. Couple this with infrastructure and logistics of shipping to and from warehouses, liquidated unsold product, you name it. \n\nSo the question I pose to you is this: When businesses in general reduce their real estate footprint, what happens to that physical land? And is there a way to invest in it's restructuring? There are plenty of shopping plazas across the US that lay barren, as all the shops have closed up. The landlords on that property are now running at a loss with no tenants. Shopping malls are closing, and have been for quite a few years. I believe that the corporate real estate world will start to follow in coming years. I don't believe it will be a complete desolation, but a definite downsizing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Where to park your money**\n\nThe only thing I would think would take their place is housing. Things like apartment buildings mostly. I have noticed an uptrend in a very specific kind of apartment complex becoming popular. A sort of 'mini downtown/city center' high-end luxury apartment. They will build about 3-4 stories tall, and leave the bottom floor available for business such as dry cleaners, small restaurants, or coffee shops. Although these are far from any city center, and act as a standalone building. It's actually quite weird. \n\nI am asking you all your opinions on the coming real estate market in these various business sectors. Do you know of any groups/companies/ETFs that could potentially stand to benefit and grow because of it? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you",

        "selftext": "In an era of convenience and at-home service, we\u2019ve seen many at-home services thrive in the software realm such as streaming, or telehealth but little did anybody expect consumer spending for what can best be described as luxury goods climb. Among this rush of consumer spending we may have completely forgotten a very minor but substantial subcategory of goods, which is healthcare that is a luxury (what I mean here is health-related goods, which inherently tend to be high profit margin but also have the benefit of being largely unregulated and fully privatized). I\u2019m referring specifically to the orthodontics industry, which has seen an unprecedented change in usage. The orthodontics industry has seen tremendous growth in general due to a change in living standards globally, where before a generally cosmetic issue such as the straightness of teeth has now become a social norm. This generally profitable industry has now become one of the largest adopters of 3D-printing and modeling technology, and as we\u2019ve seen this is actually a normal industry trend; early or developing technologies are mostly implemented in high-margin, high-growth industries that have a significant margin of safety. The main company that\u2019s in this hyper-specific industry I keep bringing up is Align Technologies ($ALGN), this company is the maker of Invisalign and the popular iTero oral scanner. Align dominates dental technology inside and outside of the doctor\u2019s offices. Approximately 84% of Align\u2019s business still comes from Invisalign however, and that\u2019s probably a good thing as Invisalign is their flagship product that has years of research behind it which makes it inherently a high-margin good because each Invisalign update is just a minor successive improvement. Basically the logic for the revenues follows the \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d mentality, and because Align has tied in orthodontists into their ecosystem, they\u2019ve virtually tied in customers for *multiple* business lifetimes. And despite these strong orthodontist contracts, Invisalign is actually primarily sold through a salesforce, directly to consumers. This is primarily due to the fact that their customer base extends beyond just people who see an orthodontist, which is a minority of the population in many places. However, Align has a potential market size that extends beyond just orthodontic patients, because on top of approximately 60% of the world needing help with alignment, there\u2019s a large market share still in traditional orthodontic gear that could easily be won over: \u201cOf the 12 million annual orthodontic cases started, we estimate that approximately 75% or 8.4 million could be treated using our Invisalign clear aligners. In addition, approximately 300 million people with malocclusion could benefit from straightening their teeth''. A lot of these orthodontic procedures are seen as luxury goods in the developing world, but as living standards and innovation expand, we can expect dental alignment to be as common a luxury as makeup or other cosmetic goods. Due to Align\u2019s ***clear*** product superiority, we can expect a massive exodus from traditional braces towards invisible aligners, and this estimate of the possible market share capture would be pretty fair to assume. As of now, only about \u2153 of Align\u2019s customers are from Asian markets, where a huge potential consumer population lies. The orthodontics industry as a whole as varying amounts of estimated CAGRs, from 8-13% depending on the source. For any given industry, above 10% CAGR is great. For Align, in the past quarter alone their revenues increased 28% and their revenue has increased by 22% from 2018 to 2019. A lot of this growth comes from simply having a better product than traditional braces, as consumers prefer having a lighter, easier to remove, and better looking product. In terms of their competitive advantage as a product, Invisalign is basically unmatched. There are new companies popping up in this segment but they\u2019re too small to take advantage of as they\u2019re not even public. The best public comparison that\u2019s as hyper focused as ALGN is $XRAY, or Dentsply Sirona, but they lack any competitive advantage whatsoever in terms of providing direct-to-consumer goods. Dentsply is also not even profitable, while Align enjoys a *net profit* margin of 68% (this means after every good is sold, every employee is paid, and every interest payment is made, Align will keep 68% of the money they made on selling their Invisalign *and iTero* products). \n\nOn top of this, we see revenue growth of over 25% year on year, which is outstanding for such a product. As more consumers strive towards wanting dental perfection as a norm, convenience and technology will be #1 on the list for them. Align provides this, and they have managed to consumerize and technologize orthodontics. This makes them the only eligible candidate within healthcare that has the growth prospect of any other consumer product such as Apple and the iPhone. The moat of having orthodontist connections and a 20 year old product line demonstrates that the growth seen here will be sustainable for generations to come. \n\nOn top of this, Align has seen zero issues in liquidity with a significant increase in Free Cash Flow in the past 4 years. Align also has a spectacular 39% Return on Assets, and 57% return on equity. All of this spectacular profitability is accompanied by a (relatively) low valuation. Considering it\u2019s a tech company with revenue growth matching that of many other growth stocks with inflated valuations, the fact that it\u2019s profitable alone is a good reason to buy, but a P/E ratio of 27 also makes it quite tempting. The stock price has grown over 120% in the past year, which is an indicator that bullish sentiment is still overwhelmingly present. On top of this ALGN has seen very low volatility in terms of price movement as well, it has basically been a straight line of appreciation so those with a smaller appetite for risk would love to have this one in their portfolio.\n\nInvisalign suggestion rates show us that the usage of Align\u2019s flagship product has yet to reach its full potential. \n\nOn top of this, Invisalign is aggressively expanding overseas: \n\n\u201cWe continue to expand our Invisalign customer base through the training of new doctors. In 2019, we trained 22,270 new Invisalign doctors of which 9,765 were trained in the Americas region and 12,505 in the International region.\u201d  \n\nAnd the cherry on top will be an administration change that will take the US out of a trade war with China: \u201cOn a year-over-year basis, our International Invisalign volume increased 34.0% driven primarily by increased adoption as well as expansion of our customer base in both the EMEA and APAC regions. *However, beginning in the second quarter of 2019, we experienced slower growth rates than prior periods in China primarily due to the US-China trade war and resulting economic uncertainty which caused headwind for consumer demand especially for consumption of luxury goods and considered purchases.\u201d*\n\nAs COVID eventually goes away and so do tariffs, that already strong growth should see yet *another* boost. Here\u2019s the final line: \n\n***We expect our utilization rates to gradually improve as a result of advancements in product and technology, which continue to strengthen our doctors\u2019 clinical confidence in the use of Invisalign clear aligners. In addition, since the teenage and younger market makes up 75% of the approximately 12 million total orthodontic case starts each year, and as we continue to drive adoption of teenage and younger patients through sales and marketing programs, we expect our utilization rates to improve.***\n\nClear product advantage, sustainable growth, and a bargain industry with only overall growth in sight makes Align a worthy long-term investment.",

The surge in retail sales coincides with the IRS reporting that all of the $600 direct payments signed into law by the former President had been distributed. Under President Biden\u2019s stimulus plan, he aims to send an additional $1,400, upping the total amount sent directly to Americans during the pandemic to more than $360 billion.\n\nAs stocks continue to hover near record levels, some analysts are warning that the market may need a correction in order to recharge for a higher move. In a note to clients, analysts at Bank of America said, \u201cWe expect a buyable 5-10% Q1 correction as the big 'unknowns' coincide with exuberant positioning, record equity supply, and \u2018as good as it gets' earnings revisions.\u201d We agree, at the moment, the market seems slightly overextended, a pullback in the near-term could recharge the market for a move higher soon.\n\nOn Tuesday reported more than 59,500 new Covid-19 cases -- a far cry from the more than 300,000 cases reported on January 8.

Facebook said of the government\u2019s decision \"It has left us facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia. With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter,\" the company said in a statement Wednesday from William Easton, Facebook's managing director, for Australia and New Zealand.\n* \\*Please note current stock prices are written in the morning and could be different due to intraday movement.\n* Boyd Gaming (BYD) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $56 to $65 at Buy.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the final trading day of February. Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/26/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-26-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Stocks try to recover from Thursday\u2019s tech rout\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures were choppy as tech stocks tried to recover from Thursday\u2019s rout that dragged the Nasdaq down 3.5% for its worst single-day performance since October. Tesla fell slightly again in Friday\u2019s premarket, a day after sinking 8% in a brutal week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday sank 559 points, or 1.8%, from a record closing high the previous session. The Dow had its worst day in nearly a month and so did the S&amp;P 500, which lost almost 2.5%. The culprit behind the selloff was the rapid rise in bond yields.\n\n&gt; * All three stock benchmarks were tracking for weekly losses. Ahead of Friday\u2019s trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was clinging to a gain for February, which started off strong. The Nasdaq was down nearly 7% from its Feb. 12 record closing high. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 both remain solidly in the green for the month. However, the S&amp;P 500 was off almost 2.7% from its last record closing high, also on Feb. 12.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. 10-year Treasury yield retreats slightly from one-year high\n\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield retreated Friday morning, but remained above 1.4%, after surging to 1.6% in the previous session to its highest level since February 2020 and more than 0.5% higher since the end of January. The spike in the 10-year yield, which is used as a benchmark for mortgage rates and auto loans, has been driven by expectations of improving economic conditions as coronavirus vaccines are rolled out, as well as fears of higher inflation.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. House to pass Covid bill; Senate official says no minimum wage\n\n&gt; * Inflation worries are being stoked on the thought that the $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus bill \u2014 which is seen passing the House on Friday \u2014 on top of accelerating growth could overheat the economy. Democrats on Capitol Hill are trying to push their relief measure, including a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour, through without GOP support. However, a key nonpartisan official, the Senate parliamentarian, ruled Democrats cannot include the minimum wage increase in the bill. The decision means the Senate will likely pass a different version of the bill than the House, and representatives will have to approve the plan a second time.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. FDA panel to vote on J&amp;J\u2019s single-shot Covid vaccine\n\n&gt; * A key FDA vaccine advisory panel is set to vote Friday on whether to recommend approval of Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s Covid-19 single-shot for emergency use, which would help pave the way to for a third preventive treatment in the U.S. While the full FDA doesn\u2019t have to follow the vaccine committee\u2019s recommendation, it often does. During similar requests by Pfizer and Moderna for vaccines, the FDA authorized those companies\u2019 two-shot regimes a day after the panel of outside medical advisors backed emergency use authorization.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. DoorDash stock falls after company drops first results since IPO\n\n&gt; * As more and more Americans are vaccinated and the economy continues to open up more fully, companies like DoorDash, which has benefited from the stay-at-home trade, could get hurt. In its first report as a public company, the food delivery service old shareholders it expects some of the tailwinds it experienced from stay-at-home orders across the U.S. will turn around once the country gets the virus under control. Shares sank 10% in Friday premarket. Even with that drop, DoorDash would still be up nearly 50% from its $102 per share offer price back in December. While DoorDash late Thursday reported $970 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, which beat estimates, it also reported an adjusted per-share loss of $2.67.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/nQ4OULP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fSUwJLJ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/CLJNnMp7/econcal3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/L8XVtdHp/econcal1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.postimg.cc/66cRYHb5/ipos1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/9Mn4Hk6G/eram01.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/AqrZ1zR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/x1Vhf1Yd/Screenshot-2021-02-25-at-4-26-19-PM.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/5NCDWFhG/Screenshot-2021-02-25-at-4-26-56-PM.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/DfDRNcML/Screenshot-2021-02-25-at-4-27-32-PM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/iVbXewC.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/dVbYwpGv/divical1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/GhSRSH24/divical2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/13nSxsnJ/divical3.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.postimg.cc/dt0vB8qM/divical4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/26/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-foot-locker-beyond-meat-doordash-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Foot Locker (FL)** \u2013 Foot Locker shares tanked 12.1% in premarket trading after quarterly revenue came in below Street forecasts and comparable-store sales unexpectedly declined.

        "selftext": " \n\nTL;DR - Used a SaaS tool paid by my employer to call Carole Baskin, and many other upper level executives. ZoomInfo IPO'd last year, are approaching earnings, and look like there is promising growth to come as more people become aware of it. See positions/concerns at the bottom.\n\nSaaS companies are a dime a dozen nowadays. That being said, I may have stumbled onto something great, so I'll try to keep this somewhat short, given that there are probably a million or so others who have thought the same thing. I don't really want to be \"that guy\", harping about a new stock every other week.\n\nI'm in my undergrad for an economics degree, and currently work in business development at a cybersecurity firm. In fact, I'm on the clock right now, writing this on my work computer. Not so smart, I know. Hear me out - most of my job is contacting upper level executives to network, and essentially gain new business. Pretty fucking boring. My company started using this new SaaS called ZoomInfo late last year (before they IPOd).\n\nZoomInfo, essentially is a database of information, that can be used to market and sell to professionals. On face value, this doesn't really seem like anything that would revolutionize the market, but here's what I will say, their product is *good* and *very effective*. The amount of personal &amp; private information available in their database is astonishing. Here are my examples of how good it really is:\n\nLast year, I wanted to dig around and see how good ZI really was, I decided to look up Carole Baskin, to see if I was able to find her. Got a hit, and a good one too. Full page, corporate number, office number, *and cell phone* number. Not to mention her business email, and *personal email*. I decided, fuck it, let's give ol' Carole a ring on her cell. She answers - I pussy out and say I had the wrong number. Regardless, I then realized how powerful this tool was.\n\nI have also been able to find personal information of **Michael Burry, Tim Cook, Matt Friend, Satya Nadella.** Some of these are *very* powerful people, that some random guy, at some random company, now has access to. That seems like a big deal for me, especially when we live in an age of information, and that information is now very accessible and easy to find.\n\nStory time is over - let's look at some numbers.\n\nMKT CAP: 21bn - Rev: .42bn - Earnings: .01bn\n\nFree cash flow - roughly $100 million\n\nZoomInfo IPO'd last year, was initially set to open at $21 a share, but opened at $42 instead. Dropped a bit for a few months, but made a somewhat volatile climb to $55 as of today.\n\n***Here are my concerns:***\n\nThe CEO and few other insiders have sold a majority of their shares from what I have been able to gather. When looking through the holdings, most of the stock is held by institutional investors.\n\nPersonal bias towards the stock - I get to use the tool regularly, and see it's effectiveness. However most people don't. Just being overlooked can be a headwind.\n\nEarnings seem kind of low, but looking at Salesforce, the numbers in the industry seem to be more volatile. There isn't really enough data here for me to look at, hence why each earnings report released will be important.\n\n***Here is why I am taking a position:***\n\nThe product is Grade-A. The ability to find personal information with this service is terrifying. See story above.\n\nThe product is *expensive*. I don't have the prices nailed down, but my sources say it's somewhere north of $30,000 for a commercial annual subscription. I'm pretty certain that's what my company paid.\n\nGood growth opportunity, given the right moves are made. We live in an age of information, and this is exactly what a sales/marketing department needs to be successful. Ton of good information waiting to be used.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAll in all, bought 50 shares at $50. Who knows where this might go. Next salesforce? Too early to say. Keep an eye on this one.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 22nd, 2021.\n\n# **Stronger economic data could power stocks that thrive in a rebound in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/stronger-economic-data-could-power-stocks-that-thrive-in-a-rebound-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; A decline in new Covid infections, along with improving economic data and stimulus hopes, could boost stocks that flourish in a resurging economy in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, expectations for a strong economic rebound helped boost interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; While the broader stock market was choppy, sectors that do well in a rebound \u2013 financials, airlines and industrials \u2013 stood out as leaders. This is known as the reflation trade.\n*****\n&gt; Those stocks gained at the expense of growth and technology, down 2%. Strategists expect that reflation trade to continue as signs suggest that the economy could make a sharp comeback.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.7% on the week to 3,906, while the Dow was up a tiny 0.1% at 31,494. The Nasdaq was off 1.57% for the week, to 13,874, with the decline in tech. Apple, for instance, gave up 4% on the week.\n*****\n&gt; The big event in the week ahead is testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who delivers his semi-annual testimony on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; He is expected to discuss the increase in interest rates, as well as concerns that inflation could begin to take off.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to acknowledge that the data is improving and the virus situation is improving quite materially,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America. \u201cIt is going to be hard for him to sound as dovish as he has been.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Powell is expected to continue to emphasize that the Fed will keep rates low for a long time and maintain its easy policies to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; # Improving forecasts\n&gt; Economists this past week ratcheted up tracking forecasts for first quarter gross domestic product, fueled in part by an unexpectedly sharp jump of 5.3% in January retail sales.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman upped first-quarter growth to 6%, and Morgan Stanley said it was tracking at 7.5% for the first quarter. Economists linked the surprise gain in retail sales to stimulus checks sent to individuals under the last $900 billion stimulus program approved by Congress in late December.\n*****\n&gt; The Biden administration has proposed another $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. That could come before the House of Representatives in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; \u2033[Powell\u2019s] going to stick to the script. The script is lawmakers need to continue to provide support for the economy. He\u2019s going to be supportive of the administration\u2019s effort to get a big package through,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n*****\n&gt; # Key data during the week\n&gt; Earnings continue to be important. There are more than 60 companies reporting, including Home Depot, Macy\u2019s and TJX.\n*****\n&gt; Key economic reports dropping next week include durable goods on Thursday, along with personal income and spending data on Friday\n*****\n&gt; The Friday report includes the personal consumption expenditure price index, which the Fed monitors. The market is on the lookout for signs of rising inflation.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the boom is going to start sooner than most people think,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.\n*****\n&gt; He said the stronger economy is helping drive Treasury yields higher, with the 10-year hitting a one-year high of 1.36% on Friday. Keon said the vaccine rollout is helping the outlook, as is the slowing spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think people were expecting a second-half boom, but I think the second quarter is going to be very strong, as people change their behavior,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe caution when it comes to savings and not going out, that\u2019s going to go away sooner than we think,\u201d Keon said. \u201cRight now, you might see a 10% GDP number in the second or third quarter. That\u2019s also due to the fact we\u2019re likely to get a big stimulus package.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said investors are underestimating the surge in economic activity that should start in March and pick up steam in the second and third quarter as more people resume dining out and other activities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the world is going to look very different than it has over the past 12 months. We\u2019re still bullish. We\u2019re still overweight stocks,\u201d Keon said.\n*****\n&gt; He said a flood of money could hit the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe size of the U.S. economy last year was about $21 trillion,\u201d Keon added. \u201cHouseholds now have excess savings of about $1.5 trillion and the stimulus package probably will be in the vicinity of $1.2, $1.6 trillion.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the service sector should start to see a benefit that has been lifting the goods making side of the economy. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see an incredible boom.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KHikwKA.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qGZEgZB.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/E5ZhAnt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/TIhMYEf.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Y65lpFs.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EY3NC9X.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wmMRYoi.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VasEMj8.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uOalt0h.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/SMspx2i.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RP7xVdo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Value Outperforming Growth But Only for Large Caps\n\n&gt; While the S&amp;P 500 traded lower today, value stocks had a strong finish to the week. Starting with a look at dividend stocks, the iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) rose 1.35% today for its best day since January 6th when DVY rose nearly 4%. As shown below, DVY has recently been on a tear.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-DVY.png))**\n\n&gt; Along with the dividend ETF (DVY), the iShares S&amp;P 500 Value ETF (IVE) rose 0.31%, reaching a new 52-week high intraday. That compares to the growth counterpart, the iShares S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), which saw a bearish engulfing on its 0.65% decline. Today was the widest outperformance for value (IVE) over growth (IVW) since mid-January. As shown below, while both are still trending nicely higher long-term, the value ETF is at new highs while growth is closer to its 50-day moving average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**\n\n&gt; Value's outperformance today only applied to large caps, though. While small caps have fallen over the past several sessions, the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) and Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) both rebounded nicely today with identical gains of 2.08%. In the case of small-cap growth (IWO), the recent declines have been more severe meaning today's strong performance still leaves it further below its highs than small-cap value (IWN).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-R2K.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-R2K.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Industrial Metals Shining Bright\n\n&gt; While precious metals like gold have been facing their fair share of selling recently alongside rates, elsewhere in the metals markets, industrial metals have been surging. Year to date, industrial metals\u2014as proxied by the Bloomberg Industrial Metals total return index\u2014are up 11.43% while their precious metals counterpart is down by over 4%. With a fairly flat January, most of those gains have come from this month alone. As shown below, so far this month the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index has risen 11.41% for its strongest performance through the first 14 trading days of a month since September of 2012. Going back to the start of the index in early 1991, the only other months with stronger performance were March of 2008 (11.42) and April of 2006 (14.94).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Again, whereas industrial metals are flying, precious metals have been trending lower since the summer. In the chart below, we show the relative strength of the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index versus the precious metal counterpart index over the past five years. Times that the line is rising indicates outperformance of industrial metals and vice versa. Precious metals had been outperforming since mid-2018, but the relative strength line bottomed out back in August of last year. From then through the late fall, industrial metals outperformed, and after some consolidation from November through the end of January, industrials are once again outperforming in a big way.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-3.png))**\n\n&gt; Delving deeper, tin, copper, and nickel have been leading in those gains. As shown in the charts below, both year to date and over the past year, these three metals have risen the most with tin in the number one spot in both respects.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-2.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-4a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One Year Later: 3 Lessons Learned Since the Market Peak\n\n&gt; \u201cBulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.\u201d Old Wall Street saying.\n\n&gt; Today marks one year since the market began to price in the effects that COVID-19 would have on the world. The old market adage \u201cstairs up, elevator down\u201d certainly rang true over the coming weeks, as the S&amp;P 500 recorded the fastest bear market (closing 20% below a previous all-time high) in history, accomplishing that feat in a mere 16 days.\n\n&gt; The stock market is a peculiar mechanism however, and despite the turmoil the world has experienced since the outbreak of the pandemic, the S&amp;P 500 marched forward to set new all-time highs less than 6 months later on August 18 and hasn\u2019t looked back. So after such a wild year since the market peaked on this day in 2020, what have we learned?\n\n&gt; **1. Markets are forward looking.** While it\u2019s difficult to pin down a date when we can expect our lives to completely return to normal, the stock market is already pricing in the normalization of daily life, even if that remains uncertain. Economic conditions around the world have been improving relative to how they were at the beginning of the pandemic. While pockets of weakness remain, the market is more concerned with where the economic conditions will be, not where they are currently.\n\n&gt; **2. Sector performance is dynamic.** Investing in \u201cstay at home\u201d themed growth and technology stocks whose earnings were viewed to be relatively well insulated by the effects of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns provided both downside protection during the March volatility as well as outperformance after the market bottomed. However, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, conventional early-cycle leadership from financials and energy stocks has emerged over the past three months:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.19.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; **3. Remember your timeline.** Everyone would love to be able to pull their money at the exact top, avoid all major market corrections and reinvest at the bottom, but unfortunately, there is no holy grail timing mechanism and market volatility is the cost of admission for stock investing. \u201cIt\u2019s our jobs as investors to focus on our long-term goals,\u201d noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cDrawdowns and bear markets are part of the path to get there, and limiting the latest shiny object from affecting our decisions is key to any investment strategy.\u201d If an investor pulled their money from the market during last year\u2019s volatility, there have been a plethora of reasons to be hesitant to reinvest it, and the subsequent bounce from the lows happened in a flash, meaning they may have bought back in at a higher price than they originally sold.\n\n&gt; Thankfully, bear markets and extreme volatility like we experienced last year are rare, but they provide a unique learning opportunity for investors. No one truly knows what the future holds for the stock market, so making sure we learn from the past is crucial for long-term success as investors.

The sharp increase in new COVID-19 cases led to additional curbs on activity to contain the virus, triggering a rise in weekly jobless claims, and many feared we might have a double-dip recession.\n\n&gt; Sensing a need to act, Congress passed a fifth relief bill at the end of December, including additional direct payments to households. The lame-duck injection of fiscal stimulus to the US economy was just what it needed. Following a weak retail sales number in December\u2014ordinarily one of the strongest months for retail sales\u2014consumer spending rebounded firmly in January, rising 5.3% month over month according to the US Census Bureau\u2014the most in seven months\u2014and greater than all of the estimates in the Bloomberg economist survey.\n\n&gt; Looking under the hood makes the headline number even more remarkable. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the largest month over month increases came in categories associated with discretionary spending, including a 23.5% surge in spending at department stores:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blog-2.18.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cFiscal stimulus was just what the doctor ordered for the US consumer in January,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe boom in spending on discretionary categories could become a trend if a wave of pent-up demand gets unleashed on the economy in 2021.\u201d\n\n&gt; Clearly, direct payments to households had a major effect on January\u2019s retail sales, so does this mean that February sales will disappoint? Not exactly. Direct payments to households totaled roughly $166 billion, but the increase in January sales was only $29 billion and the savings rate remains high. Of course, not all of that money was spent on retail items, but there may be some gas left in the tank for February retail sales, particularly by individuals who didn\u2019t receive their payments until later in the month or who will be receiving a credit on their federal tax returns.\n\n&gt; Earlier this month, we raised our gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the US from 4\u20134.5% to 5\u20135.5%. Yesterday\u2019s retail sales number puts us on a solid path toward achieving that target\u2014and may even raise the prospects of exceeding it. The first quarter of 2021 is expected to be the weakest of the year, so the January surge in retail sales removes much of the risk of the US economy stumbling out of the gates as we begin 2021.\n\n&gt; However, a strong start to the year may embolden the call for a smaller price tag for President Biden\u2019s fiscal stimulus proposal. Despite this, we ultimately believe a stimulus package north of $1 trillion is likely, which should prime the US economy for continued growth in 2021 as the battle against COVID-19 improves.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Tech Leading in New Highs\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been reversing from its record highs over the past couple of sessions, but on an individual stock basis there are still a large number of names that have reached new 52-week highs. As shown in the charts from our Daily Sector Snapshot below, through yesterday's close, a net percentage of just over 15% of the S&amp;P 500 reached new 52-week highs. That is the strongest reading in new highs since January 12th. Outside of several days at the start of 2021, the only other days of the pandemic era with as high if not higher readings were September 2nd, October 9th, and November 9th. Most of the sectors are also seeing their number of new highs rise to strong levels. In addition to the S&amp;P 500, yesterday's reading for Communication Services, Financials, Materials, and Tech all were in the top decile of all days since at least 1990. In the case of Materials, while new highs have been trending higher and yesterday's reading was historically strong, it was still well off the record highs from earlier this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH.png))**\n\n&gt; On the other hand, perhaps the most impressive sector in terms of net new highs has been Technology. Yesterday, 35.53% of the sector's stocks reached a new 52-week high. Not only is that the highest reading with respect to the other sectors, but that high reading also stands in the top 0.5% of all days for the sector since at least 1990. In other words, there have only been 38 other days since 1990 that the Tech sector saw as strong of a reading in net new highs as yesterday. The most recent of those was November 9th when 43.84% of the sector touched a new 52-week high. Overall, in the context of more broadly positive breadth with strong readings in new highs for other sectors, Tech's large number of new highs is an added plus for the broader market given the massive 28.08% weight of the sector.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH-Tech.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Cap Growth Taking the Lead\n\n&gt; One of the topics we covered in last Friday's Bespoke Report was the outperformance of small caps over the past year. Even on a much shorter time horizon, that outperformance has been evident. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, in the five days ending last Friday and on a year to date basis, both Small Cap Growth (IJR) and Small Cap Value (IJS) have been two of the top-performing ETFs in our US Styles screen while large-cap counterparts have also been higher but with more modest gains. With a particular focus on growth stocks, while the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Growth (IJT) ETF was up the most of these ETFs last week with a 3.96% gain, the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) was the second-worst performer after 'only' rising 1.05%. That continued a trend that has been in place YTD with the performance spread between the two ETFs topping ten percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-TA.png))**\n\n&gt; We are coming up on the one-year anniversary of the last highs on February 19th, 2020 just before the COVID crash. For most of the past year since then, large-cap growth (IVW) had actually been outperforming small-cap growth (IJT), but since the new year began, small-cap growth has jumped ahead. Now, the S&amp;P Small Cap Growth ETF (IJT) is up 35.31% since the 2/19/20 high compared to a 28.16% gain for the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). As shown in the second chart below, IJT had been catching up on IVW for some time now though. The relative strength line of IJT versus IVW had been in a downtrend for most of the past five years meaning large-cap growth had been generally outperforming the small-cap counterpart. Since the lows last March, the line trended sideways meaning neither one saw significant outperformance, but come the fall, the line has taken off in favor of small caps. With more outperformance in the past week and a half, that line has turned sharply higher once again reaching the highest level since December of 2019 last week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-Small-vs-large-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Is A/D Line Signally Late-February Weakness?\n\n&gt; Back on January 21 in our February Almanac post our Market Probability Chart highlighted the pattern of late-February seasonal weakness. A disappointing jobless claims number today appears to be the straw the sent the market lower. In this chart of the NASDAQ 100 Index (NDX) I have overlaid the NASDAQ Composite Advance/Decline Line. The NASDAQ A/D Line peaked and flattened out about six trading days ago and is now heading lower.\n\n&gt; This coincides with the seasonal pattern of late-February weakness. However, we expect recent support to hold above 13,000. Should that level be breached major support exists around the old September doji high of 12,240. Considering how far the market has come in the face of some formidable economic and pandemic obstacles and how frothy sentiment had become, a little consolidation and pullback is to be expected.\n\n&gt; We may see some further weakness into month-end and into March, but with vaccine rollout gaining some traction, more stimulus likely and a supportive Fed we do not expect any major selloff at this juncture.\n\n&gt;

They have a more developed product, more customers, and more revenue in the year of potential weed legalization.\n\nAkerna (KERN): the most resilient cannabis sector play? Leading software to the sector and governments...\n\n**Intro**\n\nSecond time at posting a detailed DD thread, this time on Akerna (KERN). The other day I posted about High Tide (HITI / HITIF) on r/pennystocks but it got removed after about 5 hours and mods haven\u2019t explained why. \n\nHope this is OK here, but mods please feel free to edit as appropriate, if not.\n\nI have modified this DD from a YouTube video script I did about a week ago, so forgive the fact that some of the figures are slightly out of date. That being said, the thesis still stands and even at current levels I believe it represents a compelling investment opportunity. If you want to check out the video, its here: link removed\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Overview**\n\n* In the simplest terms, it\u2019s an enterprise software company with a specific focus on the cannabis sector. Its proposition is a seed to shelf tracking software and technology with digital tags. They have a number of products which are essential for compliance, inventory tracking, ERP, CRM, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hwhqbxh9rtg61.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9536131330192169a37fb88b53b0c2cdcc86c193\n\n* It has customers across stakeholder base and is used by regulators, government bodies, state-licensed cannabis retailers, growers, etc.\n* It integrates effectively with other key platforms \u2013 medical record platforms, banking platforms, etc.\n* HQ\u2019d in Colorado and has a market cap of around $135m. It\u2019s a small company generating ARR of just over $14m and not yet profitable at an EBITDA level. It\u2019s important to note that it is burning cash currently; the implications of this is outlined in further detail in this post.\n* Currently has a presence in the US and Canada but the software available in other languages and well positioned as other markets open up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Investment merits**\n\n**High growth market**\n\n* The cannabis market is forecast to deliver very strong growth in the coming years, driven by both organic growth in currently legalized and regulated markets, and legalization of cannabis in new markets (both in the US and globally)\n* North American cannabis market (Canada and US) is forecast to grow by 30% a year to 2027 (source: research and markets)\n* Legalization and regulation of cannabis in new markets is also highly likely. This is catalyzed by the fact that government debt has increased significantly as part of the response to the COVID-19 health crisis. This needs to be repaid somehow, and increasing tax rates on existing taxes is an unpopular political move. Finding new tax revenues is a more palatable way of increasing tax revenues for governments. This is especially important in countries where elections are upcoming.\n* As a software company, rapid international expansion can be delivered more easily than other cannabis sector players with less scalable models (e.g. brick and mortar retail, production) and where there is a necessity for physical presence\n* Akerna also is relevant for the broader cannabis sector too, being relevant for CBD / hemp related products too\n\n**High recurring revenues**\n\n* By a function of it being a SaaS business, the company has a large recurring revenue base. Its customers are charged on a fixed fee basis and has demonstrated strong historical growth in this (44% in FY20). I personally like the resilience which recurring revenues provide and so like seeing this in companies which I invest into\n* The business has generated some revenues generated from consulting services, but this is a smaller component; this has also been the part of the business which has been more impacted by COVID-19.\n\n**Mission critical demand**\n\n* Its customers need the software to ensure compliance with regulation and laws\n* Failure to comply can be a big issue and result in large fines or legal action\n* Given the low cost of the software, relative to the financial penalties, this is not something which companies look to avoid. Its customers are heavily reliant on Akerna\u2019s offering\n\n**Sticky customers**\n\n* While Akerna does not yet report the customer retention rates \u2013 we know similar businesses have sticky customers and so we can be confident that this is the case here too\n* Once implemented by customers, its systems are entrenched in the customers workflow and once they are in, they are in. Customers typically do not voluntarily go without them and there is not enough of a cost saving versus the headache and risk of it going wrong, to justify switching out\n* Also important as during a downturn, customers are not going to look here to save costs\n* This also underpins some of the first mover advantage in the sector. You only really lose customers when they go bankrupt or when they get acquired\n* Reputation and word of mouth is also essential here and Akerna references very positively. It is especially credentialised through its government division and agency contracts and other customers see this as very positive\n\n**No commodity price exposure**\n\n* With many players in the broader cannabis sector, you have to accept some exposure to fluctuations in the pricing of cannabis, which is a function of supply and demand\n* Akerna does not have this exposure to pricing volatility given its revenue model as previously discussed\n* Fixed price subscription revenue model means there is no volatility in this respect, neither to the top line, nor the cost base\n\n**Limited competition**\n\n* Not true to say that there is no competition but the competition can be predominantly split into two key buckets\n\n1. Cannabis-related specific software: (e.g. BioTeckTHC, acquired by Helix Technologies, Cova Software, Flowhub, etc). Akerna seems to differentiate on the strength of its compliance and legal regulatory capabilities and this is validated by its government-related customers\n2. Generalist software: Competition with a non-sector specific software for SMEs. Given the complex regulatory framework, competition Akerna faces is predominantly from the other sector specific software players.\n\n* Given the high growth market dynamics and the sticky customers, the key is for Akerna to be marketing aggressively to win as many customers as possible\n* Continued product development is also important to ensure competitive advantage is maintained\n* This whole area is something which is a continued area of DD for me\n\n**Unique access to data which can be monetized for massive additional upside**\n\n* Massively summarized from the video, however, they have unique access to supply chain data which could be monetized effectively and generate strong levels of recurring revenues\n* Other established sectors with complex supply chains have a trusted party with such unique access to data (e.g. alcohol, lithium, different foods, etc.) and the opportunity here is enormous\n* Nascent industries like this are a perfect opportunity to develop this proposition more\n\n**Strong M&amp;A track record**\n\n* Proven ability to make acquisitions to drive incremental growth and enhance product proposition. 2 acquisitions made during 2020 have been integrated effectively. These were funded by equity, which means dilution, but more on this later in the post\n\n**Reputable institutions in the shareholder base**\n\n* Reputable institutional investors within the shareholder base is always a good sign \u2013 Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard. Thomson Reuters also categorizes the shares held by institutional investors as ones with a low turnover, implying they are long term investors, versus the high turnover institutional investors who are predominantly hedge funds with shorter term investment horizons\n* Only 1 broker currently covering Akerna, which is Alliance Global Partners. Currently have a target price of $10.50. Personally think there is more upside to this, but let\u2019s discuss that later\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q7je5afbrtg61.png?width=331&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5eb3efd1e4b7cfb0c020ba180f5e47b63624cff4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m1hxwovbrtg61.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e561530e4c117f2fbfa8a8756ed076e41aae4c9f\n\n**Government contracts: the positives**\n\n* Winning such customers is indicative of having passed a high bar for approval, which is a stamp of approval for other customers\n* Government contracts are also typically longer term contracts in general and you have good confidence over the creditworthiness of your customer\u2026.\n* Does have negatives / risks associated with it which we will address shortly\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Investment risks and potential mitigants**\n\n**Scale**\n\n* Inherent risk as a result of the size of the company \u2013 it\u2019s small, its new, there is some execution risk. The key here is for them to deliver growth \u2013 the strategy is all about capturing market share and growing as fast as possible\n* To deliver that growth, they have to continue investing \u2013 this means the company is not going to turn EBITDA positive anytime soon. This is not in itself an issue, just need to be aware of this\n* Small size also means that it is more susceptible to a shock \u2013 the loss of a big customer has more of an impact on the financials, than the loss of the same customer would in a larger company\n* There isn\u2019t really a mitigant here, but it\u2019s something you have to accept when investing into smaller companies\n\n**Cash burn and financing**\n\n* Can\u2019t escape the fact that a growing company of this size, that is investing in growth, will be burning cash\n* We know this will need to be financed somehow and we have a good visibility over the cash requirements over the next 12 months; there is not an immediate need for more funding, unless something like an M&amp;A opportunity arises\n* Strong likelihood that the business will need to raise more capital in the form of an equity raise and this means more dilution for shareholders\n* This is mitigated by knowing the cash burn rate and that there is at least 12 months headroom on the cash burn rate (erring very much on the side of conservatism). Akerna currently has a lot of cash ($14.3m) on its balance sheet and continued growth will help generate more cash to cover fixed costs. It also places a strong focus on its costs base and has historically implemented cost reduction programmes, which is good to see\n\n**Dilution**\n\n* Strong likelihood of further dilution from here, not just to support growth but also potential future acquisitions\n* During 2020, it made 2 acquisitions, both of which were funded with equity, issuing shares which had a dilutive effect\n* This is mitigated by the expectation that the acquisition being funded is accretive to value and creates incremental shareholder value\n\n**Regulatory changes could limit growth**\n\n* Risk that changes in the regulatory landscape (i.e. federal legalization set-backs) could impact the growth potential of the business. While delivering the growth is not dependent on federal legalization, it would definitely help.\n* Risk mitigated by the fact that existing markets which are currently legalized and regulated have lots of growth potential so Akerna can still deliver its growth potential without the need for entry into new markets. Any new states or countries legalizing and regulating cannabis is just incremental upside\n* Strong likelihood, as outlined earlier, that the incremental debt burdens incurred as part of the COVID-19 response will catalyze a greater receptiveness of governments globally to legalise, regulate and tax cannabis\n\n**Valuation**\n\n* Risk that the current valuation is too rich and that there is not enough upside here. Currently it is trading at around 7.5x EV / forward sales which is a high multiple. Additionally, there is currently a lot of hype around cannabis related stocks and there is the risk that this is inflating the valuation of such stocks.\n* This is mitigated by Akerna delivering its growth plan:\n\n1. Assuming it hits its forecast plan, on an EV / FY+2 Sales or FY+3 Sales basis versus the key enterprise software peers, there is significant upside in valuation\n2. Regression analysis derived from the correlation between sales growth and sales valuation multiple also indicates that the market values sales growth significantly and would imply a premium valuation multiple for KERN (this analysis I can share, but is a lot more technical finance / geeky, so have left it out, to avoid boring everyone to death, for now)\n\n* Ultimately, when investing in the cannabis sector, have to get comfortable with the \u2018hype\u2019 and the possibility this disappears and drags sector valuations down with it\n\n**Current capital structure**\n\n* The business is currently financed with convertible notes, while this is not so much a risk, rather just something that investors need to be aware of\n* These notes have financial obligations as part of the financing, but also a dilutive effect as a result of to the conversion of the note into shares at maturity\n* Such financing is very common for companies of this scale and nascency and it is already priced into the valuation\n\n**Government contracts: the negatives**\n\n* Typically, contracts for government bodies and agencies have to be formally put out for tender at end of contract. There is the risk that it is not re-won and it having a significant, detrimental impact on the financials\n* Such contracts also typically have longer periods of liability for the supplier\n* This is mitigated by the fact that the business will have grown significantly by the time the contract is up for re-tender, and so will have a smaller negative impact on the business if it is lost (i.e. customer concentration will have decreased). Additionally the cost of implementation acts as another hurdle for Akerna being displaced by one of its competitors, as this cost would not be re-incurred\n* Furthermore, it will be best placed to win the re-tender; given existing working relationship and knowledge, unless the requirements had changed significantly, it would be Akerna\u2019s to lose\n\n**TLDR**\n\n*Akerna is a leading provider of enterprise software to the cannabis sector, generating strong recurring revenues from a sticky customer base who demonstrate limited propensity to switch and which is underpinned by mission critical demand. The company has a strong differentiation versus its competition. Akerna is positioned favorably to deliver on the exciting growth tailwinds in the market \u2013 doing so is essential in justifying its current valuation and the argument that this stock is currently undervalued.*\n\n*NB \u2013 some of the market figures are slightly outdated here, but the proposition remains unchanged*\n\nDisclosure: 33 12/17 $17.5c",

        "selftext": "**Intro**\n\nSecond time at posting a detailed DD thread, this time on Akerna (KERN). The other day I posted about High Tide (HITI / HITIF) on r/pennystocks but it got removed after about 5 hours and mods haven\u2019t explained why. \n\nHope this is OK here, but mods please feel free to edit as appropriate, if not.\n\nI have modified this DD from a YouTube video script I did about a week ago, so forgive the fact that some of the figures are slightly out of date. That being said, the thesis still stands and even at current levels I believe it represents a compelling investment opportunity. If you want to check out the video, its here: [https://youtu.be/7QrzxH0NGB4](https://youtu.be/7QrzxH0NGB4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Overview**\n\n* In the simplest terms, it\u2019s an enterprise software company with a specific focus on the cannabis sector. Its proposition is a seed to shelf tracking software and technology with digital tags. They have a number of products which are essential for compliance, inventory tracking, ERP, CRM, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img hwhqbxh9rtg61...*\n\n* It has customers across stakeholder base and is used by regulators, government bodies, state-licensed cannabis retailers, growers, etc.\n* It integrates effectively with other key platforms \u2013 medical record platforms, banking platforms, etc.\n* HQ\u2019d in Colorado and has a market cap of around $135m. It\u2019s a small company generating ARR of just over $14m and not yet profitable at an EBITDA level. It\u2019s important to note that it is burning cash currently; the implications of this is outlined in further detail in this post.\n* Currently has a presence in the US and Canada but the software available in other languages and well positioned as other markets open up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Investment merits**\n\n**High growth market**\n\n* The cannabis market is forecast to deliver very strong growth in the coming years, driven by both organic growth in currently legalized and regulated markets, and legalization of cannabis in new markets (both in the US and globally)\n* North American cannabis market (Canada and US) is forecast to grow by 30% a year to 2027 (source: research and markets)\n* Legalization and regulation of cannabis in new markets is also highly likely. This is catalyzed by the fact that government debt has increased significantly as part of the response to the COVID-19 health crisis. This needs to be repaid somehow, and increasing tax rates on existing taxes is an unpopular political move. Finding new tax revenues is a more palatable way of increasing tax revenues for governments. This is especially important in countries where elections are upcoming.\n* As a software company, rapid international expansion can be delivered more easily than other cannabis sector players with less scalable models (e.g. brick and mortar retail, production) and where there is a necessity for physical presence\n* Akerna also is relevant for the broader cannabis sector too, being relevant for CBD / hemp related products too\n\n**High recurring revenues**\n\n* By a function of it being a SaaS business, the company has a large recurring revenue base. Its customers are charged on a fixed fee basis and has demonstrated strong historical growth in this (44% in FY20). I personally like the resilience which recurring revenues provide and so like seeing this in companies which I invest into\n* The business has generated some revenues generated from consulting services, but this is a smaller component; this has also been the part of the business which has been more impacted by COVID-19.\n\n**Mission critical demand**\n\n* Its customers need the software to ensure compliance with regulation and laws\n* Failure to comply can be a big issue and result in large fines or legal action\n* Given the low cost of the software, relative to the financial penalties, this is not something which companies look to avoid. Its customers are heavily reliant on Akerna\u2019s offering\n\n**Sticky customers**\n\n* While Akerna does not yet report the customer retention rates \u2013 we know similar businesses have sticky customers and so we can be confident that this is the case here too\n* Once implemented by customers, its systems are entrenched in the customers workflow and once they are in, they are in. Customers typically do not voluntarily go without them and there is not enough of a cost saving versus the headache and risk of it going wrong, to justify switching out\n* Also important as during a downturn, customers are not going to look here to save costs\n* This also underpins some of the first mover advantage in the sector. You only really lose customers when they go bankrupt or when they get acquired\n* Reputation and word of mouth is also essential here and Akerna references very positively. It is especially credentialised through its government division and agency contracts and other customers see this as very positive\n\n**No commodity price exposure**\n\n* With many players in the broader cannabis sector, you have to accept some exposure to fluctuations in the pricing of cannabis, which is a function of supply and demand\n* Akerna does not have this exposure to pricing volatility given its revenue model as previously discussed\n* Fixed price subscription revenue model means there is no volatility in this respect, neither to the top line, nor the cost base\n\n**Limited competition**\n\n* Not true to say that there is no competition but the competition can be predominantly split into two key buckets\n\n1. Cannabis-related specific software: (e.g. BioTeckTHC, acquired by Helix Technologies, Cova Software, Flowhub, etc). Akerna seems to differentiate on the strength of its compliance and legal regulatory capabilities and this is validated by its government-related customers\n2. Generalist software: Competition with a non-sector specific software for SMEs. Given the complex regulatory framework, competition Akerna faces is predominantly from the other sector specific software players.\n\n* Given the high growth market dynamics and the sticky customers, the key is for Akerna to be marketing aggressively to win as many customers as possible\n* Continued product development is also important to ensure competitive advantage is maintained\n* This whole area is something which is a continued area of DD for me\n\n**Unique access to data which can be monetized for massive additional upside**\n\n* Massively summarized from the video, however, they have unique access to supply chain data which could be monetized effectively and generate strong levels of recurring revenues\n* Other established sectors with complex supply chains have a trusted party with such unique access to data (e.g. alcohol, lithium, different foods, etc.) and the opportunity here is enormous\n* Nascent industries like this are a perfect opportunity to develop this proposition more\n\n**Strong M&amp;A track record**\n\n* Proven ability to make acquisitions to drive incremental growth and enhance product proposition. 2 acquisitions made during 2020 have been integrated effectively.

        "selftext": "**Full disclosure: This isn't a gambling or short-term DD and my positions aren't in options for this play, but considering the massive inflow of new members I suppose that at least some of them are fundamental value investors who want sustainable growth and stocks not volatile derivatives. I'll also err on the side of assuming all of you have savings investment accounts along with your gambling ones so this is for those of you have any semblance of risk averse-ness**\n\nIn an era of convenience and at-home service, we\u2019ve seen many at-home services thrive in the software realm such as streaming, or telehealth but little did anybody expect consumer spending for what can best be described as luxury goods climb. Among this rush of consumer spending we may have completely forgotten a very minor but substantial subcategory of goods, which is healthcare that is a luxury (what I mean here is health-related goods, which inherently tend to be high profit margin but also have the benefit of being largely unregulated and fully privatized). I\u2019m referring specifically to the orthodontics industry, which has seen an unprecedented change in usage. The orthodontics industry has seen tremendous growth in general due to a change in living standards globally, where before a generally cosmetic issue such as the straightness of teeth has now become a social norm. This generally profitable industry has now become one of the largest adopters of 3D-printing and modeling technology, and as we\u2019ve seen this is actually a normal industry trend; early or developing technologies are mostly implemented in high-margin, high-growth industries that have a significant margin of safety. The main company that\u2019s in this hyper-specific industry I keep bringing up is Align Technologies ($ALGN), this company is the maker of Invisalign and the popular iTero oral scanner. Align dominates dental technology inside and outside of the doctor\u2019s offices. Approximately 84% of Align\u2019s business still comes from Invisalign however, and that\u2019s probably a good thing as Invisalign is their flagship product that has years of research behind it which makes it inherently a high-margin good because each Invisalign update is just a minor successive improvement. Basically the logic for the revenues follows the \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d mentality, and because Align has tied in orthodontists into their ecosystem, they\u2019ve virtually tied in customers for *multiple* business lifetimes. And despite these strong orthodontist contracts, Invisalign is actually primarily sold through a salesforce, directly to consumers. This is primarily due to the fact that their customer base extends beyond just people who see an orthodontist, which is a minority of the population in many places. However, Align has a potential market size that extends beyond just orthodontic patients, because on top of approximately 60% of the world needing help with alignment, there\u2019s a large market share still in traditional orthodontic gear that could easily be won over: \u201cOf the 12 million annual orthodontic cases started, we estimate that approximately 75% or 8.4 million could be treated using our Invisalign clear aligners. In addition, approximately 300 million people with malocclusion could benefit from straightening their teeth''. A lot of these orthodontic procedures are seen as luxury goods in the developing world, but as living standards and innovation expand, we can expect dental alignment to be as common a luxury as makeup or other cosmetic goods. Due to Align\u2019s ***clear*** product superiority, we can expect a massive exodus from traditional braces towards invisible aligners, and this estimate of the possible market share capture would be pretty fair to assume. As of now, only about \u2153 of Align\u2019s customers are from Asian markets, where a huge potential consumer population lies. The orthodontics industry as a whole as varying amounts of estimated CAGRs, from 8-13% depending on the source. For any given industry, above 10% CAGR is great. For Align, in the past quarter alone their revenues increased 28% and their revenue has increased by 22% from 2018 to 2019. A lot of this growth comes from simply having a better product than traditional braces, as consumers prefer having a lighter, easier to remove, and better looking product. In terms of their competitive advantage as a product, Invisalign is basically unmatched. There are new companies popping up in this segment but they\u2019re too small to take advantage of as they\u2019re not even public. The best public comparison that\u2019s as hyper focused as ALGN is $XRAY, or Dentsply Sirona, but they lack any competitive advantage whatsoever in terms of providing direct-to-consumer goods. Dentsply is also not even profitable, while Align enjoys a *net profit* margin of 68% (this means after every good is sold, every employee is paid, and every interest payment is made, Align will keep 68% of the money they made on selling their Invisalign *and iTero* products).\n\nOn top of this, we see revenue growth of over 25% year on year, which is outstanding for such a product. As more consumers strive towards wanting dental perfection as a norm, convenience and technology will be #1 on the list for them. Align provides this, and they have managed to consumerize and technologize orthodontics. This makes them the only eligible candidate within healthcare that has the growth prospect of any other consumer product such as Apple and the iPhone. The moat of having orthodontist connections and a 20 year old product line demonstrates that the growth seen here will be sustainable for generations to come.\n\nOn top of this, Align has seen zero issues in liquidity with a significant increase in Free Cash Flow in the past 4 years. Align also has a spectacular 39% Return on Assets, and 57% return on equity. All of this spectacular profitability is accompanied by a (relatively) low valuation. Considering it\u2019s a tech company with revenue growth matching that of many other growth stocks with inflated valuations, the fact that it\u2019s profitable alone is a good reason to buy, but a P/E ratio of 27 also makes it quite tempting. The stock price has grown over 120% in the past year, which is an indicator that bullish sentiment is still overwhelmingly present. On top of this ALGN has seen very low volatility in terms of price movement as well, it has basically been a straight line of appreciation so those with a smaller appetite for risk would love to have this one in their portfolio.\n\nInvisalign suggestion rates show us that the usage of Align\u2019s flagship product has yet to reach its full potential.\n\nOn top of this, Invisalign is aggressively expanding overseas:\n\n\u201cWe continue to expand our Invisalign customer base through the training of new doctors. In 2019, we trained 22,270 new Invisalign doctors of which 9,765 were trained in the Americas region and 12,505 in the International region.\u201d\n\nAnd the cherry on top will be an administration change that will take the US out of a trade war with China: \u201cOn a year-over-year basis, our International Invisalign volume increased 34.0% driven primarily by increased adoption as well as expansion of our customer base in both the EMEA and APAC regions. *However, beginning in the second quarter of 2019, we experienced slower growth rates than prior periods in China primarily due to the US-China trade war and resulting economic uncertainty which caused headwind for consumer demand especially for consumption of luxury goods and considered purchases.\u201d*\n\nAs COVID eventually goes away and so do tariffs, that already strong growth should see yet *another* boost. Here\u2019s the final line:\n\n***We expect our utilization rates to gradually improve as a result of advancements in product and technology, which continue to strengthen our doctors\u2019 clinical confidence in the use of Invisalign clear aligners. In addition, since the teenage and younger market makes up 75% of the approximately 12 million total orthodontic case starts each year, and as we continue to drive adoption of teenage and younger patients through sales and marketing programs, we expect our utilization rates to improve.***\n\nClear product advantage, sustainable growth, and a bargain industry with only overall growth in sight makes Align a worthy long-term investment.",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the final trading day of February. Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/26/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-26-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Stocks try to recover from Thursday\u2019s tech rout\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures were choppy as tech stocks tried to recover from Thursday\u2019s rout that dragged the Nasdaq down 3.5% for its worst single-day performance since October. Tesla fell slightly again in Friday\u2019s premarket, a day after sinking 8% in a brutal week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday sank 559 points, or 1.8%, from a record closing high the previous session. The Dow had its worst day in nearly a month and so did the S&amp;P 500, which lost almost 2.5%. The culprit behind the selloff was the rapid rise in bond yields.\n\n&gt; * All three stock benchmarks were tracking for weekly losses. Ahead of Friday\u2019s trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was clinging to a gain for February, which started off strong. The Nasdaq was down nearly 7% from its Feb. 12 record closing high. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 both remain solidly in the green for the month. However, the S&amp;P 500 was off almost 2.7% from its last record closing high, also on Feb. 12.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. 10-year Treasury yield retreats slightly from one-year high\n\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield retreated Friday morning, but remained above 1.4%, after surging to 1.6% in the previous session to its highest level since February 2020 and more than 0.5% higher since the end of January. The spike in the 10-year yield, which is used as a benchmark for mortgage rates and auto loans, has been driven by expectations of improving economic conditions as coronavirus vaccines are rolled out, as well as fears of higher inflation.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. House to pass Covid bill; Senate official says no minimum wage\n\n&gt; * Inflation worries are being stoked on the thought that the $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus bill \u2014 which is seen passing the House on Friday \u2014 on top of accelerating growth could overheat the economy. Democrats on Capitol Hill are trying to push their relief measure, including a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour, through without GOP support. However, a key nonpartisan official, the Senate parliamentarian, ruled Democrats cannot include the minimum wage increase in the bill. The decision means the Senate will likely pass a different version of the bill than the House, and representatives will have to approve the plan a second time.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. FDA panel to vote on J&amp;J\u2019s single-shot Covid vaccine\n\n&gt; * A key FDA vaccine advisory panel is set to vote Friday on whether to recommend approval of Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s Covid-19 single-shot for emergency use, which would help pave the way to for a third preventive treatment in the U.S. While the full FDA doesn\u2019t have to follow the vaccine committee\u2019s recommendation, it often does. During similar requests by Pfizer and Moderna for vaccines, the FDA authorized those companies\u2019 two-shot regimes a day after the panel of outside medical advisors backed emergency use authorization.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. DoorDash stock falls after company drops first results since IPO\n\n&gt; * As more and more Americans are vaccinated and the economy continues to open up more fully, companies like DoorDash, which has benefited from the stay-at-home trade, could get hurt. In its first report as a public company, the food delivery service old shareholders it expects some of the tailwinds it experienced from stay-at-home orders across the U.S. will turn around once the country gets the virus under control. Shares sank 10% in Friday premarket. Even with that drop, DoorDash would still be up nearly 50% from its $102 per share offer price back in December. While DoorDash late Thursday reported $970 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, which beat estimates, it also reported an adjusted per-share loss of $2.67.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/nQ4OULP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fSUwJLJ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/CLJNnMp7/econcal3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/L8XVtdHp/econcal1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.postimg.cc/66cRYHb5/ipos1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/9Mn4Hk6G/eram01.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/AqrZ1zR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/x1Vhf1Yd/Screenshot-2021-02-25-at-4-26-19-PM.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/5NCDWFhG/Screenshot-2021-02-25-at-4-26-56-PM.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/DfDRNcML/Screenshot-2021-02-25-at-4-27-32-PM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/iVbXewC.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/dVbYwpGv/divical1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/GhSRSH24/divical2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/13nSxsnJ/divical3.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.postimg.cc/dt0vB8qM/divical4.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* RKT\nvDKNG\n* QQQ\n* CDXC\n* BYND\n* SPY\n* ARKK\n* CRM\n* NNDM\n* GS\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/26/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-foot-locker-beyond-meat-doordash-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Foot Locker (FL)** \u2013 Foot Locker shares tanked 12.1% in premarket trading after quarterly revenue came in below Street forecasts and comparable-store sales unexpectedly declined.

        "selftext": "# Why we are still in the early stages of the SaaS opportunity:\n\nIn April 2020, ecommerce spending exploded globally. In 8 short weeks, US ecommerce spending as a % of total retail sales grew from 16% to 27%. For the 10 years previous, ecommerce penetration had been growing at a modest 1% or so per year. Ecommerce sales essentially grew by ***10 years in 8 weeks.***\n\nWhile it remains to be seen how much of the growth will be maintain post-pandemic, one things is for certain - the world isn\u2019t going back to the way it was before. Ecommerce now needs to be a core aspect of every retail companies strategy. Ecommerce companies like Shopify and Amazon have seen their TAM grow massively and their valuations have grown to reflect this.\n\nWhat if I told you something very similar is happening right now in SaaS?\n\n## Enterprise SaaS spending\n\nAmazingly, in 2020, cloud/SaaS spending is still only 9.1% of total global IT spend.\n\nBut this is changing rapidly. [A Gartner report](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-10-20-gartner-says-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-4-percent-in-2021) expects worldwide s***pending on public cloud services to grow by 18.4% in 2021***. The same report expects cloud spending to be 14.2% of global IT spend by 2024.\n\nIn some areas of the world, this shift to cloud is happening at a far faster rate. A [Flexera report](https://info.flexera.com/SLO-REPORT-State-of-Tech-Spend) (which focused on companies in N.America and Europe with over 2000 employees) shows that ***cloud spending grew from 25% to 30%*** of total IT spend in 2020, outstripping on-premises software for the first time ever. SaaS spending is growing particularly fast. 56% of companies said that they have seen their SaaS spending grow in 2020.\n\nMuch of this growth has been accelerated by the pandemic:\n\n&gt;\u201cMoving forward, digital transformation will not be subject to the same ROI justification it was pre-pandemic as the mandate for IT becomes business survival, rather than growth.\u201d\n\nMuch in the same way that the pandemic has made ecommerce a core part of any retail company\u2019s strategy, the pandemic has made cloud/SaaS a core part of every company\u2019s plans. Remote/distributed working is a key trend that is here to stay. Employees need to be able to be access their work from wherever they are. Therefore, on-premise software just doesn\u2019t cut it anymore.\n\n&gt;\u201cThe pandemic validated cloud\u2019s value proposition,\u201d said\u00a0Sid Nag, research vice president at Gartner. - \u201cThe ability to use on-demand, scalable cloud models to achieve cost efficiency and business continuity is providing the impetus for organisations to rapidly accelerate their digital business transformation plans. The increased use of public cloud services has reinforced cloud adoption to be the \u2018new normal,\u2019 now more than ever.\u201d\n\n## More Apps\n\nAt the same time that IT spend on cloud &amp; SaaS is increasing dramatically, the total number of apps that an individual business uses is growing too.\n\n[The Okta \u201cbusiness at work\u201d report](https://www.okta.com/businesses-at-work/2021/) shows that the average number of business apps used by an Okta customer has increased by about 22% in 4 years. Up from 72 apps to 88 on average. Companies with over 2000 employees use ***an average of 175 business apps each!***\n\nInterestingly, companies are increasingly \u201cdouble-dipping\u201d when it comes to \u201cbest of breed\u201d apps and software bundles. 78% of of companies who use Microsoft Office 365 have also adopted one or more of best of breed apps that Microsoft competes with. Companies are increasingly willing to pay for both Microsoft Office (which has Microsoft Teams) and apps like Slack and Zoom.\n\n&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s clear our customers are prioritizing functionality and employee needs over bundling\u201d\n\n## What does this mean for investors?\n\nThe accelerated trend towards more cloud/SaaS software will create lots of opportunities for investors. Here are the 4 most important takeaways:\n\n1. **The total addressable market for enterprise SaaS in general is growing rapidly:** As cloud spending grows from 9% to 15% to 30% of IT spend, the market opportunity for cloud providers will grow with it. Companies like ServiceNow, Salesforce and Microsoft will gain big as they enable large-scale digital transformation. *The only thing better than a massive market is a massive market that is growing fast.*\n2. **The potential market cap for SaaS companies is way bigger than you think:** 15 years ago, business software was mostly reserved for large companies. The TAM for Oracle was relatively small since they only sold software to very large companies. But today, SaaS companies can sell to businesses of all sizes. Companies like Asana and Zoom can sell to both small businesses and Fortune 100 companies. Combine this with a growing appetite for cloud and an expanding number of apps per business and the potential size of these companies is way bigger than expected. 15 years ago, nobody would have dreamed that a company like Docusign would have a market cap of over $42 billion.\n3. **SaaS is not a winner-takes-all market:** As we saw before, many customers are willing to pay for point solutions and software bundles that operate in the same space. Enterprise SaaS is not a winner-takes-all market. Large incumbents and point solutions will continue to grow. There is room for both Zoom and Microsoft Teams.\n4. **We are still early in SaaS:** While cloud has been around for over 20 years, we are still really only in the beginning of the cloud transformation. Global cloud spending is still only 9.1% of total IT spend. This percentage will get a lot, lot higher.",

        "selftext": "In an era of convenience and at-home service, we\u2019ve seen many at-home services thrive in the software realm such as streaming, or telehealth but little did anybody expect consumer spending for what can best be described as luxury goods climb. Among this rush of consumer spending we may have completely forgotten a very minor but substantial subcategory of goods, which is healthcare that is a luxury (what I mean here is health-related goods, which inherently tend to be high profit margin but also have the benefit of being largely unregulated and fully privatized). I\u2019m referring specifically to the orthodontics industry, which has seen an unprecedented change in usage. The orthodontics industry has seen tremendous growth in general due to a change in living standards globally, where before a generally cosmetic issue such as the straightness of teeth has now become a social norm. This generally profitable industry has now become one of the largest adopters of 3D-printing and modeling technology, and as we\u2019ve seen this is actually a normal industry trend; early or developing technologies are mostly implemented in high-margin, high-growth industries that have a significant margin of safety. The main company that\u2019s in this hyper-specific industry I keep bringing up is Align Technologies ($ALGN), this company is the maker of Invisalign and the popular iTero oral scanner. Align dominates dental technology inside and outside of the doctor\u2019s offices. Approximately 84% of Align\u2019s business still comes from Invisalign however, and that\u2019s probably a good thing as Invisalign is their flagship product that has years of research behind it which makes it inherently a high-margin good because each Invisalign update is just a minor successive improvement. Basically the logic for the revenues follows the \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d mentality, and because Align has tied in orthodontists into their ecosystem, they\u2019ve virtually tied in customers for *multiple* business lifetimes. And despite these strong orthodontist contracts, Invisalign is actually primarily sold through a salesforce, directly to consumers. This is primarily due to the fact that their customer base extends beyond just people who see an orthodontist, which is a minority of the population in many places. However, Align has a potential market size that extends beyond just orthodontic patients, because on top of approximately 60% of the world needing help with alignment, there\u2019s a large market share still in traditional orthodontic gear that could easily be won over: \u201cOf the 12 million annual orthodontic cases started, we estimate that approximately 75% or 8.4 million could be treated using our Invisalign clear aligners. In addition, approximately 300 million people with malocclusion could benefit from straightening their teeth''. A lot of these orthodontic procedures are seen as luxury goods in the developing world, but as living standards and innovation expand, we can expect dental alignment to be as common a luxury as makeup or other cosmetic goods. Due to Align\u2019s ***clear*** product superiority, we can expect a massive exodus from traditional braces towards invisible aligners, and this estimate of the possible market share capture would be pretty fair to assume. As of now, only about \u2153 of Align\u2019s customers are from Asian markets, where a huge potential consumer population lies. The orthodontics industry as a whole as varying amounts of estimated CAGRs, from 8-13% depending on the source. For any given industry, above 10% CAGR is great. For Align, in the past quarter alone their revenues increased 28% and their revenue has increased by 22% from 2018 to 2019. A lot of this growth comes from simply having a better product than traditional braces, as consumers prefer having a lighter, easier to remove, and better looking product. In terms of their competitive advantage as a product, Invisalign is basically unmatched. There are new companies popping up in this segment but they\u2019re too small to take advantage of as they\u2019re not even public. The best public comparison that\u2019s as hyper focused as ALGN is $XRAY, or Dentsply Sirona, but they lack any competitive advantage whatsoever in terms of providing direct-to-consumer goods. Dentsply is also not even profitable, while Align enjoys a *net profit* margin of 68% (this means after every good is sold, every employee is paid, and every interest payment is made, Align will keep 68% of the money they made on selling their Invisalign *and iTero* products). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn top of this, we see revenue growth of over 25% year on year, which is outstanding for such a product. As more consumers strive towards wanting dental perfection as a norm, convenience and technology will be #1 on the list for them. Align provides this, and they have managed to consumerize and technologize orthodontics. This makes them the only eligible candidate within healthcare that has the growth prospect of any other consumer product such as Apple and the iPhone. The moat of having orthodontist connections and a 20 year old product line demonstrates that the growth seen here will be sustainable for generations to come. \n\nOn top of this, Align has seen zero issues in liquidity with a significant increase in Free Cash Flow in the past 4 years. Align also has a spectacular 39% Return on Assets, and 57% return on equity. All of this spectacular profitability is accompanied by a (relatively) low valuation. Considering it\u2019s a tech company with revenue growth matching that of many other growth stocks with inflated valuations, the fact that it\u2019s profitable alone is a good reason to buy, but a P/E ratio of 27 also makes it quite tempting. The stock price has grown over 120% in the past year, which is an indicator that bullish sentiment is still overwhelmingly present. On top of this ALGN has seen very low volatility in terms of price movement as well, it has basically been a straight line of appreciation so those with a smaller appetite for risk would love to have this one in their portfolio.\n\nInvisalign suggestion rates show us that the usage of Align\u2019s flagship product has yet to reach its full potential. \n\nOn top of this, Invisalign is aggressively expanding overseas: \n\n\u201cWe continue to expand our Invisalign customer base through the training of new doctors. In 2019, we trained 22,270 new Invisalign doctors of which 9,765 were trained in the Americas region and 12,505 in the International region.\u201d  \n\nAnd the cherry on top will be an administration change that will take the US out of a trade war with China: \u201cOn a year-over-year basis, our International Invisalign volume increased 34.0% driven primarily by increased adoption as well as expansion of our customer base in both the EMEA and APAC regions. *However, beginning in the second quarter of 2019, we experienced slower growth rates than prior periods in China primarily due to the US-China trade war and resulting economic uncertainty which caused headwind for consumer demand especially for consumption of luxury goods and considered purchases.\u201d*\n\nAs COVID eventually goes away and so do tariffs, that already strong growth should see yet *another* boost. Here\u2019s the final line: \n\n***We expect our utilization rates to gradually improve as a result of advancements in product and technology, which continue to strengthen our doctors\u2019 clinical confidence in the use of Invisalign clear aligners. In addition, since the teenage and younger market makes up 75% of the approximately 12 million total orthodontic case starts each year, and as we continue to drive adoption of teenage and younger patients through sales and marketing programs, we expect our utilization rates to improve.***\n\nClear product advantage, sustainable growth, and a bargain industry with only overall growth in sight makes Align a worthy long-term investment.",

        "selftext": "These days it seems that the Majority of people really do not even know what Due Diligence is. A common Misconception- is that People should be more trusted and believed, if they speak well when representing a position. Many of us Assume that if the person sounds so Intelligent- that we certainly should believe them. There is nothing wrong with Questioning a persons claim of Due Diligence. However- the more important part is \" How does that Information affect the Worth of the Stock ??   For Example \" Lets say the xyz Bubble Gum Factory is Expanding into 10 more Countries and Investing $5 Billion in new Factories. Lets say they Hired the Best Bubble Gum Salesforce ever and have the Market Cornered.. They have convinced you that 80% of the Worlds Bubblegum would be sold by this xyz company.. WOW-- Thats huge.. Gotta have this Stock .... You buy the Stock... You lose your money.. You are lost as to why ? Maybe the Market Cap was just too high.. But Wait--- A Large Cap is Supposed to be safer !!  Is It ???  Or does it Indicate too much excitement and Investments into it and it did not represent a Fair Value at purchase time.. Market Capitalization is the Money Stock Holders Invested. It has nothing to do with Financials of the Company. If 80% of the World supply of Bubblegum is worth $300 Million a Year and the company is Netting 40% Profit that means its worth $120 Million a year. If you have valued the company at 12 Billion and it Nets 120 Million a year you would have a Price to Earnings of 100, THATS RIDICULOUS.. Yet that is what is happening in some of the Biggest companies that Exceed 3 Trillion Market Cap. I agree Electric Cars and Green Energy and Marijuana and Blockchain ALL have Big Growth ahead... However-- there still is a need for Valuation of Stocks. With Established Stocks with Past Earnings that is easy. When we are looking to future Income we can only Guesstimate Value.. Due Diligence requires we answer these questions rather than just pushing a Stock because we hope others will lift us out of our Rut from Bad Investment.. Do you Value the Stock ? Or do you just throw a Dart and then try to Convince others its a BullsEye ??\n https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/lldqyh/sharing_legit_article_about_a_pennystock/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3",

        "selftext": "I've been following the stock market since around 2017. It was only small trades of a couple hundred dollars and I've learned a lot since then. Got sucked into the crypto craze, invested almost a thousand in DPW, and lost it all. After that experience, I realized I wanted to set up a decent portfolio instead of playing hype stocks. \n\nI am 25 years old, recently paid off all my credit cards last month, and just recently started creating a portfolio on TD. Currently have \\~$45k student loan debt and car loan. I have been matching my employers 401k contribution for almost 3 years now, but wanted to squeeze a little more gains out of my money since savings accounts are a joke. My end goal is to save up for a down payment on a house in the next few years. Here are my investments:\n\n**401k:**  \nS&amp;P Large Cap: 35%  \nS&amp;P Mid Cap: 20%  \nS&amp;P Small Cap: 20%  \nS&amp;P International: 25%\n\nI remember Jim Cramer years ago saying someone under 30 should be investing in equities and not bonds so this was my approach for my 401k. Will adjust my contributions to include bonds when I hit 30.\n\n**Time for the fun part, TD Account and reason for investing in these:**  \nMy approach to these holdings is mostly investing in stocks I use on the regular or stocks I just like. Looking to buy and hold 3+ years.  \nBA - a stable company that recently took a hit due to COVID and the 737 Max.  \nUBER - strong demand when economy reopens. People will need to get rides to work and go out  \nABNB - I love the platform and use it when going on vacations. I think hotels are a thing of the past, and you get more bang for your buck getting an entire house than a small room with a kitchenette (if you're lucky)  \nPETS - I myself adopted a kitten during COVID and I think a lot of people have adopted pets this past year. More demand for medications for newly adopted pets.  \nVITL - I like the chart technicals and it's been a good investment so far for me. Little higher risk, but didn't throw much at it.   \nCFFI - Fundamentals look great, lots of growth potential and I think as interest rates rise the financial sector will see growth.  \nBRK/B - P/E looks low and can't go wrong betting with Warren Buffet  \nCRM - I use this every day at work and I don't think that will change. Salesforce has a great product and I think demand for it will grow as more businesses are opting for permanent work from home.  \nINTC - Stock was down over the past 12 months as compared to other tech stocks that have soared. All my computers use Intel chips, so investing in something I use every day.  \nNXST - P/E looked low and strong revenue growth. I like the financials  \nDIS - I remember Jim Cramer saying a couple years back that Disney is always a buy, and he was right. I think as parks reopen there will be growth.  \nPDM - Decent EPS growth throughout the years, seems like a solid Real Estate sector play.\n\nPHOT and FNMA have been in my portfolio for years now, just holding the bag at this point.\n\nWhen I have a bit more saved up, was looking to add BIO and VWAGY. BIO for the healthcare play and VWAGY because I drive a Volkswagen. Also, I read somewhere no other car company has invested more into EV than Volkswagen. TSLA just seems way overbought and the P/E for VWAGY is relatively low compared to other EV plays.\n\nLet me know what you think! Thank you for taking the time reading this and appreciate any suggestions.",

        "selftext": "Sold my Salesforce (CRM) today, basically broke even. Not happy, but unwilling to take the risk on CRM with all the headwinds swirling around the market right now. Why do I not like CRM anymore?\n\nThe biggest reason is they said to expect higher sales on flat margins thru 2022. With a PE of 56, and interest rates rising, that's not a winning game plan in my book. Add to that the Slack acquisition for 27 billion, with annual CRM 2020 revenue of just 21 billion. Even if they can digest that acquisition, the next thing they have to do is to knock off MSFT to dominate the corporate teamwork market. Good luck with that.\n\nIt is certainly possible for CRM to hit a grand slam and win the game in 2021, I just think there are easier games to play right now.\n\nWhat do you think of CRM right now?",

(OTCQB:BTCY) (\"Biotricity\" or the \"Company\"), a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company, is pleased to provide unaudited, preliminary financial results for its fiscal 2021 third quarter, which ended December 31, 2020. Full financial results will be posted on EDGAR on February 16, 2021. Biotricity's Q3 results continued a trend of both sequential and year over year revenue growth, with revenue setting a new quarterly record in the fiscal third quarter.\n\nFor fiscal Q3 2021, management is reporting the following highlights:\n\nRevenue of $1 million (USD) - a milestone for Company in its quarterly results\n\nYear-over-year quarterly revenue increased 162%\n\nSequential quarter-over-quarter revenue increase 34.5%\n\n\"We achieved significant growth during a period of restricted travel due to Covid, so we are even more optimistic about our growth potential as the business environment unlocks,\" stated Waqaas Al-Siddiq, CEO of Biotricity. \"Our sequential quarterly growth really illustrates the importance of our technology and model, where we are enabling a cardiologist while improving patient care. Monthly sequential growth is a sure sign that our platform is on target, and we are on track to continue our strong sequential and year over year growth.\"\n\n\"During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company experienced a gross margin of 49.2% compared to 43.6% in the preceding quarter,\" said Biotricity's CFO, John Ayanoglou. \"This improvement is consistent with our prior forecast that the cost of devices sold and other technology associated fees will become a lower percentage of revenues as sales volumes expand. We had significant product development activity during the quarter, including an FDA filing, so our net loss of $0.11 per share was higher than the net loss of $0.085 cents per share in Q2.\"\n\nIn the current quarter (fiscal Q4 2021) and for the remainder of calendar 2021, the Company is guiding to continued triple-digit revenue growth on a year over year basis. With added resources from a convertible debt financing completed in January 2021, Biotricity is currently interviewing additional sales personnel as part of a planned geographic expansion into additional states. The Company filed a 510(K) seeking FDA approval for its new Biotres Holter product on December 31, 2020 and expects the review process to run approximately four months.\n\nDr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq added, \"We are coming out of the gate at a full sprint in 2021, with salesforce expansion and work underway on new products that will enable us to target a much larger segment of the cardiologist patient population. We spent years developing best-in-class technology coupled with a compelling technology as a service model. We are pleased with our results and look forward to further progress in upcoming quarters.\"",

Basically the logic for the revenues follows the \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d mentality, and because Align has tied in orthodontists into their ecosystem, they\u2019ve virtually tied in customers for *multiple* business lifetimes. And despite these strong orthodontist contracts, Invisalign is actually primarily sold through a salesforce, directly to consumers. This is primarily due to the fact that their customer base extends beyond just people who see an orthodontist, which is a minority of the population in many places. However, Align has a potential market size that extends beyond just orthodontic patients, because on top of approximately 60% of the world needing help with alignment, there\u2019s a large market share still in traditional orthodontic gear that could easily be won over: \u201cOf the 12 million annual orthodontic cases started, we estimate that approximately 75% or 8.4 million could be treated using our Invisalign clear aligners. In addition, approximately 300 million people with malocclusion could benefit from straightening their teeth''. A lot of these orthodontic procedures are seen as luxury goods in the developing world, but as living standards and innovation expand, we can expect dental alignment to be as common a luxury as makeup or other cosmetic goods. Due to Align\u2019s ***clear*** product superiority, we can expect a massive exodus from traditional braces towards invisible aligners, and this estimate of the possible market share capture would be pretty fair to assume. As of now, only about \u2153 of Align\u2019s customers are from Asian markets, where a huge potential consumer population lies. The orthodontics industry as a whole as varying amounts of estimated CAGRs, from 8-13% depending on the source. For any given industry, above 10% CAGR is great. For Align, in the past quarter alone their revenues increased 28% and their revenue has increased by 22% from 2018 to 2019. A lot of this growth comes from simply having a better product than traditional braces, as consumers prefer having a lighter, easier to remove, and better looking product. In terms of their competitive advantage as a product, Invisalign is basically unmatched. There are new companies popping up in this segment but they\u2019re too small to take advantage of as they\u2019re not even public. The best public comparison that\u2019s as hyper focused as ALGN is $XRAY, or Dentsply Sirona, but they lack any competitive advantage whatsoever in terms of providing direct-to-consumer goods. Dentsply is also not even profitable, while Align enjoys a *net profit* margin of 68% (this means after every good is sold, every employee is paid, and every interest payment is made, Align will keep 68% of the money they made on selling their Invisalign *and iTero* products). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn top of this, we see revenue growth of over 25% year on year, which is outstanding for such a product. As more consumers strive towards wanting dental perfection as a norm, convenience and technology will be #1 on the list for them. Align provides this, and they have managed to consumerize and technologize orthodontics. This makes them the only eligible candidate within healthcare that has the growth prospect of any other consumer product such as Apple and the iPhone. The moat of having orthodontist connections and a 20 year old product line demonstrates that the growth seen here will be sustainable for generations to come. \n\nOn top of this, Align has seen zero issues in liquidity with a significant increase in Free Cash Flow in the past 4 years. Align also has a spectacular 39% Return on Assets, and 57% return on equity. All of this spectacular profitability is accompanied by a (relatively) low valuation. Considering it\u2019s a tech company with revenue growth matching that of many other growth stocks with inflated valuations, the fact that it\u2019s profitable alone is a good reason to buy, but a P/E ratio of 27 also makes it quite tempting. The stock price has grown over 120% in the past year, which is an indicator that bullish sentiment is still overwhelmingly present. On top of this ALGN has seen very low volatility in terms of price movement as well, it has basically been a straight line of appreciation so those with a smaller appetite for risk would love to have this one in their portfolio.\n\nInvisalign suggestion rates show us that the usage of Align\u2019s flagship product has yet to reach its full potential. \n\nOn top of this, Invisalign is aggressively expanding overseas: \n\n\u201cWe continue to expand our Invisalign customer base through the training of new doctors. In 2019, we trained 22,270 new Invisalign doctors of which 9,765 were trained in the Americas region and 12,505 in the International region.\u201d  \n\nAnd the cherry on top will be an administration change that will take the US out of a trade war with China: \u201cOn a year-over-year basis, our International Invisalign volume increased 34.0% driven primarily by increased adoption as well as expansion of our customer base in both the EMEA and APAC regions. *However, beginning in the second quarter of 2019, we experienced slower growth rates than prior periods in China primarily due to the US-China trade war and resulting economic uncertainty which caused headwind for consumer demand especially for consumption of luxury goods and considered purchases.\u201d*\n\nAs COVID eventually goes away and so do tariffs, that already strong growth should see yet *another* boost. Here\u2019s the final line: \n\n***We expect our utilization rates to gradually improve as a result of advancements in product and technology, which continue to strengthen our doctors\u2019 clinical confidence in the use of Invisalign clear aligners. In addition, since the teenage and younger market makes up 75% of the approximately 12 million total orthodontic case starts each year, and as we continue to drive adoption of teenage and younger patients through sales and marketing programs, we expect our utilization rates to improve.***\n\nClear product advantage, sustainable growth, and a bargain industry with only overall growth in sight makes Align a worthy long-term investment. \n\n[https://dogsofdalalstreet.medium.com/align-technologies-due-diligence-monopolizing-consumer-health-tech-79506941635d](https://dogsofdalalstreet.medium.com/align-technologies-due-diligence-monopolizing-consumer-health-tech-79506941635d)",

        "selftext": "In an era of convenience and at-home service, we\u2019ve seen many at-home services thrive in the software realm such as streaming, or telehealth but little did anybody expect consumer spending for what can best be described as luxury goods climb. Among this rush of consumer spending we may have completely forgotten a very minor but substantial subcategory of goods, which is healthcare that is a luxury (what I mean here is health-related goods, which inherently tend to be high profit margin but also have the benefit of being largely unregulated and fully privatized). I\u2019m referring specifically to the orthodontics industry, which has seen an unprecedented change in usage. The orthodontics industry has seen tremendous growth in general due to a change in living standards globally, where before a generally cosmetic issue such as the straightness of teeth has now become a social norm. This generally profitable industry has now become one of the largest adopters of 3D-printing and modeling technology, and as we\u2019ve seen this is actually a normal industry trend; early or developing technologies are mostly implemented in high-margin, high-growth industries that have a significant margin of safety. The main company that\u2019s in this hyper-specific industry I keep bringing up is Align Technologies ($ALGN), this company is the maker of Invisalign and the popular iTero oral scanner.

        "selftext": "Office REITS, like Retail, have taken a huge hit during the pandemic. While I think it will take much longer for Retail to cover, I think even with the whole wfh, Office is here to stay.\n\nBullish points:\n\n* **Peer Surveys.** In my organization's internal surveys, and also speaking with  peers , many have said they would want to go back to work at least 1-2 times a week, and not to have a permanent wfh. Staying at home 5 days a week is to mentally stressful.\n* **More Office Space Needed, Not less**. With increased hygienic measures going forward, Office would require **more** space going forward, not less, as desks would be spaced out more. I have already seen that happen in my company as floors have been redone to allow for more spacing, not less. Also, desk hotelling likely less popular going forward due to hygiene concerns, so everyone would have their own individual desk, prompting more space.\n* **Office Spaces being renewed**. Many large institutions are continuing to renew office space (most recently, Scotiabank in downtown Toronto). Rent collection in offices, with their long term contracts, are actually still high.\n* **Big companies retracting permanent wfh.** Google, had recently said there will be no permanent wfh, and plans return Sept 2021. Some Apple employees already back in office (10-15%)\n* **New office openings.** Netflix, planning to open new office in Canada\n\nBearish points:\n\n* Few big tech firms considering permanent wfh (Salesforce, Twitter, Spotify etc..)\n* Pandemic will likely not end in 2021 due to delay of vaccine rollouts\n* Companies could decide having no offices is more cost efficient and productive. \n\nCurious to hear your thoughts on whether the Office space will eventually recover from this.",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow autists,\n\nI know there are PLTR DD posts all the time, but many miss out on important details that must be addressed and many of you retards don't know what the company does even though you put your life savings on the stock. \n\nPalantir is a growth stock that is going to overtake the market harder then when your wife's boyfriend comes over and takes your spot on the bed for the night. Everything shows this is a quality company with **strong growth potential in the enterprise market, big service provider to the government, and is a great artificial intelligence with a growing market as a leading provider**. There are many doubters of PLTR which can only be attributed to the fact they hate money. Did I mention tons of intuitional investors such as Cathie Wood entered a large position in PLTR and everything she touches turns into tendies? Hop on the fucking train.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mo6imrozl4j61.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70416eca0b19050cfa2ca5a362a0fac70ce36c3f\n\n\"**What the fuck exactly is PLTR?\"**\n\n**I am glad you asked!**\n\nPalantir Technologies is a  software company that specializes in big data analytics. The company is known for three projects in particular: **Palantir Gotham, Palantir Metropolis, and Palantir Foundry.** \n\n**Palantir Gotham** is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the United States Intelligence Community (USIC) and United States Department of Defense. In the past, Gotham was used by fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, a former US federal agency which operated from 2009 to 2015. Gotham was also used by cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor, a Canadian public-private venture which operated from 2003 to 2012. **Palantir Metropolis** is used by hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms. **Palantir Foundry** is used by corporate clients such as Morgan Stanley, Merck KGaA, Airbus, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. \n\nSee how diverse the company is in multiple industries? Plus the Navy uses Palantir for their nuclear submarines now which tells you how quality the product is and the government is loyal to their suppliers. **And will pay big money which makes call holders and share holders fucking wealthy rich while gay bears get fucked harder then someone who thought spy 200 puts were a good idea.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\"Why Palatir? There's a fuck ton of software companies for me to yolo...\"**\n\nFirst let me start off I am not a software engineer or hardcore computer guy, but I have read many accounts by people who know more then me in this sector that this company is legit. \n\n**Strong** **Government Contracts** \\- Palantir claims it will\u00a0become the \"default operating system for data across the U.S. government.\" Its Gotham platform, which mainly serves government clients, already helps the U.S. military, FBI, CIA, and other government agencies make data-driven decisions.\n\nPalantir's revenue from government customers rose 73% year over year to $420.3 million, or 55% of its top line, in the first nine months of 2020. During the third quarter, it secured a new AI contract with the U.S. Army.\n\nLast December the U.S. Army renewed the second year of a four-year analytics partnership (which provided for one base year and three optional years) with Palantir. That same month, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which already uses some of Gotham's tools, awarded Palantir a new three-year contract to track the development of new drugs.\n\nIn January, the U.S. Army hired Palantir to modernize its ground stations. This contract, which will start with a prototype and expand over four phases, could be worth up to $250 million.\n\nThese contracts all indicate Gotham is sticky, and will allow Palantir to deploy additional services to boost its average revenue per customer and widen its moat against its potential challengers.\n\n**Growth in the commercial non-government sector**\n\n Palantir also helps enterprise customers process data with its Foundry platform. The Wall Street bears often claim Foundry faces too much competition in the enterprise analytics market, but Palantir's enterprise revenue still rose 30% year over year to $320.3 million, or 45% of its top line, in the first nine months of 2020.\n\nDuring the third quarter, Foundry signed a new contract with the National Institutes of Health, renewed a contract with a big aerospace customer, and pulled a \"major\" consumer goods company away from an unnamed rival.\n\nLast December, it signed a new two-year Foundry contract with the U.K. National Health Service (NHS) to track COVID-19 infections. Throughout January and February, it expanded its Foundry deals with **Fujitsu** and **BP**  while signing new contracts with **PG&amp;E**, **Rio Tinto**, and **IBM**\n\nThese deals indicate Foundry's tools can be applied to a wide range of industries -- including energy management services for PG&amp;E and BP, optimizing mining operations for Rio Tinto, or optimizing AI tools for IBM \\-- and will likely keep growing after Gotham's growth slows down.\n\n**Artificial intelligence is a booming market, and I'm not talking about boomers themselves**\n\n The global AI market could still grow at a compound annual growth rate of 42.2% between 2020 and 2027, according to\u00a0Grand View Research\n\nThat secular trend will light a fire under companies like Palantir that process large amounts of data into actionable strategies. Those tailwinds could help Palantir generate high double-digit sales growth over the next decade, and help its stock grow into its premium valuation. **You cannot tell me with a single brain cell that investing in the AI market is something you're gonna regret in the future.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Attention it is receiving from retail and hedge funds**\n\nThe stock has all of wall street's eyes on it, it's popular on our daily discussion, and CNBC talks about it all the time. Then you have funds like ARK buying into it. A stock like that does not fade away into the sunset to never be seen again. **It is a momentum buy.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n At $28 per share, Palantir is valued at about $52.3 billion, or 28 times next year's sales. That's still a high price-to-sales ratio for a company that aims to generate about 30% sales growth next year.\n\nBut Palantir could also be sandbagging its guidance. Last September, it forecast 42% sales growth for 2020, but it actually topped that estimate by five percentage points. If it raises its full-year forecast over the next few quarters, its stock could actually be even cheaper relative to its sales.\n\nThis stock has tons of room to grow and is in an emerging market. \n\nPalantir's government-hardened reputation and aggressive tools for pulling data from disparate sources are arguably giving it a competitive edge against competitors such as **CRM** and **AYX.**\n\nThey had a great earnings and reported Q4 results that included a nice top-line beat.\n\nThis is going to the moon and you don't want to miss out on a quality company with meme potential \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: \n\nHella Shares\n\n28.50 April 1st calls\n\nWill be getting leaps \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Literally cannot go tits up.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR - Used a SaaS tool paid by my employer to call Carole Baskin, and many other upper level executives. ZoomInfo IPO'd last year, are approaching earnings, and look like there is promising growth to come as more people become aware of it. See positions/concerns at the bottom.\n\nSaaS companies are a dime a dozen nowadays. That being said, I may have stumbled onto something great, so I'll try to keep this somewhat short, given that there are probably a million or so others who have thought the same thing. I don't really want to be \"that guy\", harping about a new stock every other week. \n\nI'm in my undergrad for an economics degree, and currently work in business development at a cybersecurity firm. In fact, I'm on the clock right now, writing this on my work computer. Not so smart, I know. Hear me out - most of my job is contacting upper level executives to network, and essentially gain new business. Pretty fucking boring. My company started using this new SaaS called ZoomInfo late last year (before they IPOd). \n\nZoomInfo, essentially is a database of information, that can be used to market and sell to professionals. On face value, this doesn't really seem like anything that would revolutionize the market, but here's what I will say, their product is *good* and *very effective*. The amount of personal  &amp; private information available in their database is astonishing. Here are my examples of how good it really is:\n\nLast year, I wanted to dig around and see how good ZI really was, I decided to look up Carole Baskin, to see if I was able to find her. Got a hit, and a good one too. Full page, corporate number, office number, *and cell phone* number. Not to mention her business email, and *personal email*. I decided, fuck it, let's give ol' Carole a ring on her cell. She answers - I pussy out and say I had the wrong number. Regardless, I then realized how powerful this tool was. \n\nI have also been able to find personal information of **Michael Burry, Tim Cook, Matt Friend,  Satya Nadella.** Some of these are *very* powerful people, that some random guy, at some random company, now has access to. That seems like a big deal for me, especially when we live in an age of information, and that information is now very accessible and easy to find. \n\nStory time is over - let's look at some numbers.\n\nMKT CAP: 21bn   -    Rev: .42bn   -    Earnings: .01bn\n\nFree cash flow - roughly  $100 million\n\nZoomInfo IPO'd last year, was initially set to open at $21 a share, but opened at $42 instead. Dropped a bit for a few months, but made a somewhat volatile climb to $55 as of today. \n\n***Here are my concerns:***\n\nThe CEO and few other insiders have sold a majority of their shares from what I have been able to gather. When looking through the holdings, most of the stock is held by institutional investors. \n\nPersonal bias towards the stock - I get to use the tool regularly, and see it's effectiveness. However most people don't. Just being overlooked can be a headwind.\n\nEarnings seem kind of low, but looking at Salesforce, the numbers in the industry seem to be more volatile. There isn't really enough data here for me to look at, hence why each earnings report released will be important. \n\n***Here is why I am taking a position:***\n\nThe product is Grade-A. The ability to find personal information with this service is terrifying. See story above.\n\nThe product is *expensive*. I don't have the prices nailed down, but my sources say it's somewhere north of $30,000 for a commercial annual subscription. I'm pretty certain that's what my company paid. \n\nGood growth opportunity, given the right moves are made. We live in an age of information, and this is exactly what a sales/marketing department needs to be successful. Ton of good information waiting to be used.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAll in all, bought 50 shares at $50. Who knows where this might go. Next salesforce? Too early to say. Keep an eye on this one.",

Our Regulatory Assist automation in Empower has been a big seller in our Data and Analytics space.

No, the momentum we have with our LOS system power is really exciting. We're probably going to sign two times to three times as many Empower clients in '21 as we did in 2020. So, again, when I talk about momentum, we've got great confidence in that area as well. I don't have an exact number on market share for eClosing. What I'd say is it's lower than the 13% that we talked about though for LOS. And so, lots of room for us to run. Like I said, the technology and the messaging and the integration is all resonating.\"\n* \\[Optimal Blue Contribution\\]\" it was about $32 million in the fourth quarter.

        "selftext": "TL;DR - Used a SaaS tool paid by my employer to call Carole Baskin, and many other upper level executives. ZoomInfo IPO'd last year, are approaching earnings, and look like there is promising growth to come as more people become aware of it. See positions/concerns at the bottom.\n\nSaaS companies are a dime a dozen nowadays. That being said, I may have stumbled onto something great, so I'll try to keep this somewhat short, given that there are probably a million or so others who have thought the same thing. I don't really want to be \"that guy\", harping about a new stock every other week. \n\nI'm in my undergrad for an economics degree, and currently work in business development at a cybersecurity firm. In fact, I'm on the clock right now, writing this on my work computer. Not so smart, I know. Hear me out - most of my job is contacting upper level executives to network, and essentially gain new business. Pretty fucking boring. My company started using this new SaaS called ZoomInfo late last year (before they IPOd). \n\nZoomInfo, essentially is a database of information, that can be used to market and sell to professionals. On face value, this doesn't really seem like anything that would revolutionize the market, but here's what I will say, their product is *good* and *very effective*. The amount of personal  &amp; private information available in their database is astonishing. Here are my examples of how good it really is:\n\nLast year, I wanted to dig around and see how good ZI really was, I decided to look up Carole Baskin, to see if I was able to find her. Got a hit, and a good one too. Full page, corporate number, office number, *and cell phone* number. Not to mention her business email, and *personal email*. I decided, fuck it, let's give ol' Carole a ring on her cell. She answers - I pussy out and say I had the wrong number. Regardless, I then realized how powerful this tool was. \n\nI have also been able to find personal information of **Michael Burry, Tim Cook, Matt Friend,  Satya Nadella.** Some of these are *very* powerful people, that some random guy, at some random company, now has access to. That seems like a big deal for me, especially when we live in an age of information, and that information is now very accessible and easy to find. \n\nStory time is over - let's look at some numbers.\n\nMKT CAP: 21bn   -    Rev: .42bn   -    Earnings: .01bn\n\nFree cash flow - roughly  $100 million\n\nZoomInfo IPO'd last year, was initially set to open at $21 a share, but opened at $42 instead. Dropped a bit for a few months, but made a somewhat volatile climb to $55 as of today. \n\n***Here are my concerns:***\n\nThe CEO and few other insiders have sold a majority of their shares from what I have been able to gather. When looking through the holdings, most of the stock is held by institutional investors. \n\nPersonal bias towards the stock - I get to use the tool regularly, and see it's effectiveness. However most people don't. Just being overlooked can be a headwind.\n\nEarnings seem kind of low, but looking at Salesforce, the numbers in the industry seem to be more volatile. There isn't really enough data here for me to look at, hence why each earnings report released will be important. \n\n***Here is why I am taking a position:***\n\nThe product is Grade-A. The ability to find personal information with this service is terrifying. See story above.\n\nThe product is *expensive*. I don't have the prices nailed down, but my sources say it's somewhere north of $30,000 for a commercial annual subscription. I'm pretty certain that's what my company paid. \n\nGood growth opportunity, given the right moves are made. We live in an age of information, and this is exactly what a sales/marketing department needs to be successful. Ton of good information waiting to be used.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAll in all, bought 50 shares at $50. Who knows where this might go. Next salesforce? Too early to say. Keep an eye on this one.",

While I\u2019ve responsibly diversified some of my PLTR tendies over the years, most of my net worth is still in shares of PLTR.\n\nSo of course I have self interest in other investors liking/buying the stock and my DDs are clearly/obviously/ridiculously biased and bullish on PLTR. I have read the SEC guidance on disclosures and that\u2019s why I\u00a0 clearly disclose my positions in my DDs to make sure you know I am not a financial advisor and that I am a former employee of PLTR and long shares of the stock. \n\nBut I\u2019m not shilling PLTR to try to create bagholders.  \n\nLike u/deepfuckingvalue believed/believes in the deep fucking value of GME, I believe in the deep fucking value of what Papa Karp and his merry band of Hobbits are building.\n\nBTW -  YOLOing your money on a stock with insanely high IV based on the meme-filled shitposting of a kool-aid drinking ex-employee is about the fuckingist stupid thing you can do. Seriously, do your own DD if you're considering investing in PLTR.\n\n**I enjoy posting on the internet**.  It sparks joy for me. From automotive forums to Reddit, I choose to spend some of my free time learning from, helping out , and laughing with strangers on the internet. I like calling out De Beers for strip mining the ocean. I like to check in on the Ariel Atom forum and the v8 swapped RX7 forum once in a blue moon even though I no longer own said cars. I like to like photos of your doggie being a gooood boy. \n\nSo me writing weighty tomes on WSB is just an extension of a hobby of mine, not a tin foil hat insider pump and dump. I'm also on vacation this week after my busiest season (Christmas -&gt; NYE -&gt; Valentines Day), so it's a coincidence that I finally carved out the free time to write a lot of words after a big week for all jewelers, not a conspiracy. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**#2) Why do insiders sell?**  \n\n\nBefore I get into the specifics of the PLTR lockup expiry, I want to talk through the high level motivations for unlocked insiders. \n\nOf course most insiders sell at least some of their position at lockup expiry.\n\n* They want to responsibly diversify out of a concentrated stock position. \n* They want to buy a house/car/watch/jewelry/week at the Brando\n* They want to get married, pay for IVF, put their children in private school, give their parents a big thank you gift\n* Their stock options expire soon.\n* They want to have a weekend of chemical stimulation and friendly companionship in Las Vegas. \n* They need to pay their colorologist to help them choose the specs of their first lambo so that they don't get mocked at their first Silicon Valley Cars and Coffee\n\nMost importantly, they (the VCs) need to pay out tendies to their LPs. I'm not an expert in VC exits, but my understanding is that various VCs handle this in a variety of ways. Some will just sell out and give cash to their LPs but others will give pro-rata shares in the investment to their LPs.  Obviously the former puts more downward pressure on the stock price. \n\nAnyone from the VC world have thoughts on how VCs with PLTR stock might play the lockout?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**#3) Why do insiders not sell?**  \n\n\n* They have a deep understanding of the value of company, and they like the stock enough to think it will outperform the market *(something something rocketship something something fueling up something something Pluto)*\n* They can get LTCG tax rates if they hold the shares for a few more months, if they exercised their options in the run up to IPO\n* They can wheel the stock while the IV is high (if an ex-insider, of course)\n* They have looked at the lockup dips of other stocks they consider comparable to their stock and like their stock enough to irresponsibly HODL.\n* They want a yacht and are willing to settle for a used 911 GT3 RS instead of the bespoke lambo so they let it ride.\n* They have FOMO that their stock will take off after they sell out and they'll be the cuck with a nice house and a lambo but still have to fly commercial with the poors \n* They can finally borrow against their stock at a really really ridiculously low interest rate and use that for liquidity  \n\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**#4) Why do insiders dump it all?**\n\n* They think the public market euphoria for their baby is unwarranted.\n* They are bearish on the skills of the executives at the company.\n* They don\u2019t like casinos and just want a boomer stock/bond blend with a bunch of dividends.\n* They want to bootstrap their own startup rather than be a cuck to early stage VCs\n* They hit their r/fatFIRE number and simply want the peace of mind that comes with fuck you money, fully diversified, instead of a concentrated stock position that creates stress and requires critical thinking.\n* They want to buy their kid a pet giraffe.\n* But most importantly, the VCs that invested in the stock may be overdue to send returns to their LPs so they exit their home run, even if they think it could grow into a grand slam.  \n\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**#5) Palantir's Unlock is Unprecedented**\n\nLet's review what we all know:\n\n1. Stonks go up.\n2. Except when lockups expire. Stonks go down when that happens.\n3. Buy the dip.\n4. Fuck Robinhood. \n5. Fuck shortsellers that crush companies and destroy jobs. \n\nNow let's dig in on truism #2: Prettymuch all IPOs in the history of ever completely lock out any insiders from selling any of their shares for 180 days. So good, bad, or ugly no-one can sell anything from the S-1 filing to the lockup expiration.\n\nPrettymuch all IPOs in the history of ever are about raising cash for the business (and printing money for their bankers), not liquidity for employees or tendies for retail traders.\n\nPalantir didn't need the cash (they have well over a billion dollars in the bank), so they told Wall Street to fuck off and DPOed instead. Palantir did something really smart in their DPO. Palantir let the insiders sell some (20%) but not all of their shares, and instituted a partial lockup on the remaining 80% of shares till the markets had digested a couple of quarters of earnings.\n\nSo people like me, if in a traditional IPO, would have missed PLTR mooning into the $40s, been salivating on our paper wealth, then would be bummed about the stock sliding back into the $20s, but sell a big chunk at lockup expiry anyway. In a traditional IPO, I would absolutely be one of the paper handers collectively driving the stock down into the $20s or teens. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStonks go down when lockups expire, sure as the sun rises tomorrow (except for that one day in California last year), and that dip certainly may happen to PLTR tomorrow anyway with the DPO. \n\nBut anecdotally, I believe the structure of the Palantir DPO reduces the desire to paper hands for people like me, as over the last few months I have been able to ladder sale \\~18.5% of my 20% at $10.00, $10.62, $10.95, $10.99, $11.15, $11.45, $11.95, $12.95, $13.95, $14.95, $15.00, $15.67, $15.95, $16.95, $17.65, $17.95, $18.95, $19.95, $20.20, $20.95, $22.30, $22.95, $23.95, $24.95, $25.95, $26.95, $27.95, $28.95, $31.39, $32.45, $32.51, $36.61, $37.00, $37.95, $39.00, and $39.75\n\nSo like DFV, I have banked enough of my profits to diamond hand through whatever dip happens tomorrow, and I am not itching to sell any more until Palantir is a \\~$100B company.  I plan on laddering my remaining shares up to a \\~$250B valuation, and don't really care how long as that might take to diversify my holdings.\n\nWhat if I'm wrong and Palantir retreats to a $20 or $40B company for the next few years? I'll take that risk, as bullish as I am on PLTR.\n\nSo what will happen tomorrow? Who the fuck knows. Karp could sell 50m shares, Soros could sell 20m shares, Cathie could sell her 4m shares, other VCs all dump all their shares, and PLTR is a falling knife all the way down to all time lows.\n\nOr, Cathie could continue to build her position, and other institutions could panic buy if PLTR starts moving up when it turns out that us Hobbits like the stock enough to HODL as *Hobbits Obviously Diamondhand Lockups...*\n\nSo what does my crystal ball say about the stock tomorrow? I think the stock will go one of two ways:\n\n1. Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Start, \n2. Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Select, Start, \n\nbut I am not a financial advisor.\n\nSeriously though, I have no fucking clue what will happen tomorrow, but I don't really care given the rest of my DD below, the nothingburger of the FAANG lockout expiries on the long term  share prices of the tech companies, and my steadfast belief that Palantir is part of the FAAPNG club.\n\nBTW - *I'll donate $10k to a charity of Jim Cramer's choosing if he says FAAPNG on CNBC, and bump it to $25k if there's a CNBC panel that debates if FAANG investors should be FAAPNG instead. Also, if anyone is stupid enough to make a ETF from a masturbation joke, I'll buy you dinner at French Laundry. But only if the ticker is FAAP.*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**#6) My Three Takeaways from the Earnings Call**  \n\n\n**I am impressed by the radically improved contribution margins in the Expand phase of Palantir's business** \\- buried on slide 45 is the fact that Palnatir's 2019 Contribution Margin of the Expand phase was **negative** 43%, but it flipped to **positive** 47% in 2020. \n\nTo me, this means that Palantir got a **\\*lot\\*** faster and cheaper at scaling deployments into the cash cows in the Scale phase. Combined with the IBM announcement, this substantial improvement to contribution margin in the middle phase of the Palantir pipeline bodes well as to the future scalability of Palantir\n\n**Employee Stock Compensation may hold down PLTR for years**.  Just like the Q3 earnings, the financials look mediocre as best when taken at face value, but they actually quite impressive when you understand what is Stock-Based Compensation, Related Employer Payroll Taxes.\n\nIt's a complete ghost expense that is largely irrelevant to evaluating a business. Here's a must read on it if you're evaluating PLTR or other recently IPOed companies.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/comments/ll646o/stock\\_based\\_compensation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/comments/ll646o/stock_based_compensation/)\n\n**Karp hates Wall Street too**.\n\n&gt;*When we went and did our DPO people thought we should IPO because that is the best and quickest way to transfer money to Wall Street. But we believe we should be focused on allowing the average person to participate and therefore absorb that risk. And now, as we've had a pretty sublime year based on any conventional metric and as you've seen the results*  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*And those of you who prefer a more short-term focus \\[I hope\\] that you choose companies that are more appropriate for you.*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**#&amp;) Why the BP contract renewal is a big f-ing deal to me**\n\nThe bears like to say that Palantir is over hyped, over priced, has no moat, etc. The bears like to say there are equivalent solutions out there that can be quickly built on open source software or bought for way cheaper from MSFT, CRM, SAP, Accenture, or 1000 other startups.\n\nIf the bears are right that Palantir's products are fungible, why did a massive energy company, coming off a really shitty year just bigly renew their Palantir contract for nine figures? \n\nIf the bears are right that Palantir's products are overpriced, why did an unnamed aerospace company, coming off a really shitty year for aviation, recently sign a $300m contract? \n\nGiven how badly COVID has crushed demand for oil and airplanes, wouldn't those companies buy a cheaper substitute good when their Palantir contract expires?\n\nThe bears are wrong: Palantir creates deep fucking value for it's clients and Foundry is unfuckwithable.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m still in.\n\n\\-So long and thanks for all the tendies.
