        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, March 2, 2021**\n\nStocks retreated on Tuesday, pulling back after rallying yesterday, underscoring how volatile the market is right now. Market participants continue to focus on the Treasury yields, a new coronavirus vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and additional stimulus from Washington. \n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury yield retreated to hover below 1.45% after spiking to a one-year high of 1.61% last week. The swift rise in interest rates last week spooked equity investors last week, with rates reflecting inflationary fears and impacting both corporate and consumer borrowing costs. Last week, during his testimony to Congress, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell tried to temper fears over higher rates and inflationary pressures. He said,  rising Treasury yields are a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we\u2019ll have a robust and ultimately complete \\[economic\\] recovery.\u201d Central Bank officials from the United Kingdom and Australia echoed Powell\u2019s sentiments and committed to maintaining accommodative fiscal policies. \n\nOver the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s (JNJ) single-dose coronavirus vaccine, making it the third vaccine approved in the US.  [The company has already begun shipping its COVID-19 vaccine ](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-u-s-cdc-advisory-committee-recommends-first-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-for-adults-18-and-older-in-u-s)and expects to deliver more than 100 million doses of the single-shot vaccines during the first half of 2021, including more than 20 million by the end of March. \n\nIn Washington D.C., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate is scheduled to begin debating the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that the House of Representatives recently passed this week, though he did not specify when a vote would be held. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Rocket Mortgage (RKT) soared over 70% today, sending the stock to record highs and continuing a dizzying rally in the last few days. Shares were even halted at one point today. In a note to clients, S3 Analytics said, \u201cRKT\u2019s stock price and short selling activity is reminiscent of another recent high flying meme stock \u2013 GameStop Inc (GME). Both stocks saw their share price spike due to high retail buying interest (predominantly due to significant social media activity) and an options based gamma squeeze. Both stocks also had/have relatively high short interest and high stock borrow rates which imply strong short-selling demand and limited stock borrow supply.\"\n* After posting strong earnings and rising more than 8% after-hours yesterday, Zoom\u2019s (ZM) stock price cratered today, with the stock going from 8% up to more than 9% down in today\u2019s session.\n* After posting disappointing earnings, NIO\u2019s stock also cratered today, falling more than 12% in today\u2019s session.\n* After the recent controversies, Alibaba (BABA) co-founder Jack MA is now the fourth richest person in China, falling from first place. \n* In a memo to employees, Ant Group\u2019s executive chairman Eric Jing said an IPO was still in the cards.\n* Vizio Holdings, a maker of smart TVs, has filed for an IPO. The company has sold 82.2 million televisions and 11.8 million sound bars since its founding in 2002, the prospectus said.\n* \\***Please note current stock prices were written in the morning pre-market and do not reflect intraday volatility.**\n* C3 AI (AI) target raised by Needham &amp; Co from $193 to $195 at Buy.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, March 4, 2021**\n\nStocks slumped Thursday once again, continuing the recent sellof. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) led the selloff, falling 1.64%. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 1.24% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 1.07%. At session lows, both the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 erased 2021\u2019s gains. \n\nThe moves lower came even after a new report on weekly unemployment claims came in better than expected, pointing to improving employment trends. \n\n* **Initial jobless claims:** 745,000 vs. 750,000 expected and a revised 736,000 during the prior week. \n* **Continuing claims:** 4.295 million vs. 4.300 million expected and 4.419 million during the prior week\n\nDuring a public appearance Thursday afternoon, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank will be \u201cpatient\u201d in keeping interest rates near zero, even if inflationary pressures start to rise. Powell cautioned that as the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, the Fed could see signs of rising prices amid surging consumer spending. But the Fed chairman noted that he does not expect higher inflation to turn into anything resembling the double-digit inflation of the 1970s. He said, \u201cIf we do see what we believe is likely a transitory increase in inflation, where longer-term inflation expectations are broadly stable at levels consistent with our framework and goals, I expect that we will be patient.\u201d\n\nAs Treasury yields continue to rise, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-growth names that led the markets in 2020. Technology stocks came under exceptional selling pressure as traders turned their focus to stocks poised to benefit more directly from an impending economic reopening. At the same time, the recent, rapid rise in Treasury yields has also deterred investors from growth stocks, with interest rates closely tied to borrowing costs for companies and consumers. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed to around 1.544% at the time of writing. \n\nIn other news, lawmakers in the Senate are set to begin debating President Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion stimulus, which was passed by the House of Representatives recently. Democrats are racing to push the legislation forward before the mid-March expiry of augmented Federal unemployment benefits. Republicans do not support the bill because of its size, but through a process called reconciliation, Democrats will be able to pass the bill without support from the other side of the aisle.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The decisions by Britain and the United States to suspend retaliatory tariffs will create space for negotiations on an ongoing dispute between Boeing (BA) and Airbus, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday. \n* President Biden said his administration expects to have enough COVID-19 vaccines for any adult that wants it by the end of May, pulling the targets two months closer than the previous government estimate.\n* U.S. mortgage rates extended their recent leg higher to break above 3% for the first time since July 2020, raising concerns that the housing market's breakneck growth last year may sharply lose momentum.\n* Square (SQ) announced it took a majority stake in music platform Tidal that is owned by rapper Jay-Z.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, March 4th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [What to watch today: Stock futures lower ahead of jobless claims, Powell speech](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/04/what-to-watch-stock-futures-lower-ahead-of-jobless-claims-powell-speech.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Stock futures are pointing to a lower open and a third day of losses for the major U.S. equity averages, as concerns over the level of Treasury yields continues to weigh on Wall Street sentiment. Dow futures implied a loss of more than 40 points, while S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq futures also were lower. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.3% Wednesday and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 2.7%. The 30-stock Dow declined 119 points, or 0.38%. (CNBC)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * 10-year Treasury yield eases, but holds above 1.45% ahead of Powell\u2019s speech (CNBC)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * The Dow and S&amp;P 500 have fallen in four of the past five sessions, and the Nasdaq is coming off its biggest two-day loss in six months. Investors are no doubt hoping to hear comforting words from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell when he addresses the Wall Street Journal Jobs Summit shortly after midday. Due to Monday\u2019s strong rally, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 remain higher for the week, and the Financials and Energy sectors are both up by well over 3% for the week.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Top investor John Rogers says to look outside of the S&amp;P 500 to find new opportunities (CNBC PRO)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * The Labor Department releases its weekly report on initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET, with economists looking for 750,000 new claims for the week ending Feb. 27. That would be up from the prior week\u2019s 730,000.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Revised fourth quarter productivity figures are also out at 8:30 a.m. ET, with consensus forecasts calling for productivity to have fallen 4.7% on an annual basis during the final three months of 2020. The prior estimate had come in at -4.8%.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * At 10:00 a.m. ET, January factory orders are likely to have jumped 2.3%, according to economists, following a 1.1% increase in December.\nSupermarket operator Kroger (KR) leads this morning\u2019s shortlist of corporate earnings releases, with BJ\u2019s Wholesale (BJ), Burlington Stores (BURL) and Ciena (CIEN) also set to release quarterly numbers. Costco (COST), Broadcom (AVGO), Gap (GPS), SmileDirectClub (SDC) and IMAX (IMAX) are among the companies scheduled to issue earnings releases after today\u2019s closing bell.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Top U.S. health officials are warning that highly transmissible variants are threatening the country\u2019s progress on reducing coronavirus cases. New infections dropped sharply after their January peak, but the trend has since stalled even as more Americans are vaccinated against Covid. \u201cSo much can turn in the next few weeks,\u201d CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday. \u201cHow this plays out is up to us.

Residents in Michigan and Indiana who are over 50 years old are now able to be vaccinated; in Connecticut and Arizona, the eligibility is now 55 and up. Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s (JNJ) recently cleared single-dose vaccine is being reserved for teachers in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, part of an increased push across the country to safely reopen schools. Nearly 52 million people in the U.S. have received at least one vaccine dose, representing more than 20% of the country\u2019s adult population. (Associated Press)\n\n&gt; * \u2018When will it end?\u2018: How a changing virus is reshaping scientists\u2019 views on Covid-19 (Reuters)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * House Democrats approved a wide-ranging piece of election-reform legislation Wednesday night, but the bill \u2014 which would restrict partisan gerrymandering and require states to have automatic voter registration, among other provisions \u2014 faces an unclear path in the Senate. House Resolution 1 passed mostly on partisan lines and would need to see support from 10 GOP senators to get past the filibuster. (Associated Press)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * House passes police reform act named for George Floyd (NBC News)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * The House canceled its session that had been scheduled for today, following a warning from Capitol Police that a militia group may be planning to attempt a breach of the building. In a statement almost two months after the Jan. 6 attack, Capitol Police said it \u201cis aware of and prepared for any potential threats towards members of Congress or towards the Capitol complex.\u201d It also said upgrades to security have been made. The Senate plans to meet as it debates the latest pandemic aid bill.

For example, the Arizona House of Representatives passed a bill Wednesday that implicitly targets both Apple and Alphabet-owned Google\u2019s (GOOGL) app stores and their policies around payment for developers.

The fast-casual burrito chain\u2019s move follows similar steps from Starbucks (SBUX) and McDonald\u2019s (MCD) and comes as individual investors and asset managers alike are placing a greater emphasis on environmental, societal and corporate governance (ESG) issues. For Chipotle, some of its environmental goals include raising its level of organic, local or regeneratively grown or raised food. (CNBC)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Walt Disney (DIS) plans to shutter 20% of its brick-and-mortar Disney Store locations, as the company boosts its focus on e-commerce operations. Disney said at least 60 of its locations in North America will close. Globally, there are about 300 Disney Stores. The Covid pandemic led to increased adoption of online shopping, with some saying the health crisis has accelerated the shift that was already in place. Disney did not say how the store closings will impact financial results. (CNBC)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Hedge fund Melvin Capital, which found itself at the center of the Reddit-sparked GameStop (GME) frenzy in January, saw a return of nearly 22% in February. Melvin had been short the video-game retailer before its stock took off as retail traders piled into the name, and the Gabe Plotkin-led fund ultimately declined 53% in January. (CNBC)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * A prototype rocket from Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX exploded Wednesday, not long after it landed for the first time following a test flight. It\u2019s not clear what caused the explosion, or whether it was intentional. On two previous test flights for the Starship prototype, in December and February, the rockets were unable to slow down enough and exploded on impact during an attempted landing. SpaceX, last valued at $74 billion, is working on the stainless steel Starship with the intention of launching people and cargo to the moon and Mars.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, March 4, 2021**\n\nStocks slumped Thursday once again, continuing the recent selloff. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) led the selloff, falling 1.64%. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 1.24% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 1.07%. At session lows, both the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 erased 2021\u2019s gains. \n\nThe moves lower came even after a new report on weekly unemployment claims came in better than expected, pointing to improving employment trends. \n\n* **Initial jobless claims:** 745,000 vs. 750,000 expected and a revised 736,000 during the prior week. \n* **Continuing claims:** 4.295 million vs. 4.300 million expected and 4.419 million during the prior week\n\nDuring a public appearance Thursday afternoon, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank will be \u201cpatient\u201d in keeping interest rates near zero, even if inflationary pressures start to rise. Powell cautioned that as the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, the Fed could see signs of rising prices amid surging consumer spending. But the Fed chairman noted that he does not expect higher inflation to turn into anything resembling the double-digit inflation of the 1970s. He said, \u201cIf we do see what we believe is likely a transitory increase in inflation, where longer-term inflation expectations are broadly stable at levels consistent with our framework and goals, I expect that we will be patient.\u201d\n\nAs Treasury yields continue to rise, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-growth names that led the markets in 2020. Technology stocks came under exceptional selling pressure as traders turned their focus to stocks poised to benefit more directly from an impending economic reopening. At the same time, the recent, rapid rise in Treasury yields has also deterred investors from growth stocks, with interest rates closely tied to borrowing costs for companies and consumers. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed to around 1.544% at the time of writing. \n\nIn other news, lawmakers in the Senate are set to begin debating President Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion stimulus, which was passed by the House of Representatives recently. Democrats are racing to push the legislation forward before the mid-March expiry of augmented Federal unemployment benefits. Republicans do not support the bill because of its size, but through a process called reconciliation, Democrats will be able to pass the bill without support from the other side of the aisle.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The decisions by Britain and the United States to suspend retaliatory tariffs will create space for negotiations on an ongoing dispute between Boeing (BA) and Airbus, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday. \n* President Biden said his administration expects to have enough COVID-19 vaccines for any adult that wants it by the end of May, pulling the targets two months closer than the previous government estimate.\n* U.S. mortgage rates extended their recent leg higher to break above 3% for the first time since July 2020, raising concerns that the housing market's breakneck growth last year may sharply lose momentum.\n* Square (SQ) announced it took a majority stake in music platform Tidal that is owned by rapper Jay-Z. Jay-Z will be added to the board of directors at Square. \n* **Please note that the stock price was written in the morning and does not account for intraday changes.**\n* Airbnb (ABNB) with a host of target raises just over the $200 mark.

        "selftext": "DISCLAIMER: Please do your own research - no investment is without risk, and may lose value.\n\nMarket Cap = 146M. Share price at close = $7.91\n\nSECTOR: Information Technology, INDUSTRY: Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals\n\nSummary: One Stop Systems, Inc. designs, manufactures, and markets custom **high-speed computing systems** for high-performance edge computing applications in the US and internationally. Its GPU expansion units add hundreds of computing cores and teraflops of computing performance to virtually any original equipment manufacturer server. OSS' flash storage arrays provide hundreds of terabytes of storage and **millions of input/output operations per second** (see applications, below). It also offers servers for PCI express-over-cable expansion; desktop expansion appliances in various configurations that add input/output flexibility to any user's desktop system; **PCIe expansions,** and ruggedized mobile high-performance compute devices to meet specialized requirements for devices deployed at the edge in **various environmental conditions**. One Stop Systems, Inc. was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Escondido, California. \n\nAPPLICATIONS \\- buckle in, exciting stuff.\n\nWith wide-ranging applications like AI, autonomous cars, and military technologies we don't even know exist yet (laser tech, threat detection, missile targeting), \"edge computing\" is sure to expand and meet growing demand for high-performance computing able to provide millions of actionable data points every second. In January 2021, OSS announced their 4th military contract via project \u201cOrange Gear,\u201d an AI system that enables U.S. Navy aircraft to conduct real-time AI-powered threat detection. Shooting down enemy assets, what guides the weapon? OSS enables the second-to-second calculations to achieve such precision. \n\nInteresting fact: OSS chief sales and marketing officer Jim Ison says they are going to \u201cexpand the support of wartime theater applications for [land, sea, air and space](http://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2021/01/05/2153506/0/en/OSS-Wins-Fourth-Program-with-Major-Military-Contractor.html).\u201d ***SPACE***. What an incredible hint of things to come! The final frontier, space exploration represents a vast yet untapped potential area of edge computing expansion. Heck, the previous administration just created a new *branch of the military* specifically for protecting America\u2019s interests above the stratosphere. Also consider that the USA, with a defense budget of $700 billion annually, will likely purchase American-made edge computing tech in-house, avoiding adversaries like China. OSS seems here to stay.\n\nWhile military contracts might not whet your appetite, consider autonomous driving. OSS\u2019 ingenious \u201cAI on the Fly\u201d enables in-vehicle \u201cruggedized\u201d autonomous driving. Here is a company rep, much smarter than myself, excited to provide more detail on [OSS' computing devices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAagBi_j4cA&amp;ab_channel=InsideHPCReport) in self-driving vehicles.\n\nSo what is a PCIe? The PCIe is the motherboard site that interfaces with a computer's graphics cards, hard drive adapter, SSDs, Wi-Fi, and Ethernet hardware connections. In June 2020, OSS introduced the [world\u2019s first](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/22/2051412/0/en/OSS-Introduces-World-s-First-PCIe-Gen-4-Expansion-System-for-NVIDIA-A100-PCIe-GPUs.html#:~:text=(Nasdaq%3A%20OSS)%2C%20a,20X%20over%20the%20previous%20generation) PCIe Gen4 Expansion System that fully supports NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, which can boost computing performance up to 20X over the previous generation. The OSS Gen4 Expansion System allows system developers to scale out almost any Gen4 server by adding up to eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The system is ideal for boosting the performance of compute-intensive applications like **AI training, AI inference, video analytics and XR rendering**. What is XR rendering? X is just a placeholder! Virtual, Mixed, or Augmented reality (VR, MR, or AR, respectively) experiences include those where users generate new forms of reality by bringing digital objects into the physical world and those that see the bringing physical world objects into the digital world. Yes, OSS also powers augmented reality applications.\n\nINDUSTRY - is there growth to \u201cEdge Computing\u201d as a field? \n\n[MarketsandMarkets](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/edge-computing-market-133384090.html#:~:text=Edge%20computing%20can%20be%20used,%2C%20healthcare%2C%20and%20many%20others) projects the global edge computing market to grow from **$3.6 billion in 2020 to $15.7 billion by 2025**, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 34.1% during the forecast period. Factors such as the growing adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) across industries; rising demand for low-latency processing and real-time, automated decision-making solutions; and a need for surmounting exponentially increasing data volumes and network traffic.\n\nPARTNERSHIPS\n\nOSS is diversified in its partnerships with the big boys - Apple, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Boeing, IBM, Lenovo, HP, and [many others](https://www.onestopsystems.com/partners).\n\nMEAT AND POTATOES - finances \n\nFollowing IPO in 2018, OSS already generates $60 million in revenue, increasing 45% YOY. \n\nHow about its market share? To find a company\u2019s size, or \u201cmarket cap,\u201d multiply the current share price by the number of shares. OSS clocks in with 16,620,000 shares x $7.91 = 131M. For a company with a 130M market cap, $60M in revenue represents very strong revenue (46%) to its size. For comparison\u2019s sake, NVDA market cap is 335B and generates 16.7B annually (5%). With 31% institutional ownership \u2013 and [increasing](https://fintel.io/so/us/oss) \u2013 this is certainly on the radar of the big players.\n\nA note about earnings per share (EPS) - OSS\u2019 earnings announcement is coming between March 19 and 25. Based on two analyst forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $0.04 with 12.17M revenue. Indeed, OSS has quickly transformed itself into a profitable enterprise with [consistent revenue beats](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OSS/earnings) to boot. \n\nBALANCE SHEET\n\nIn short, OSS has 40M in assets, 11M in liabilities and 2M total debt. \n\n*Processing img 0357jvc0uok61...*\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nFormerly the interim head, now-CEO [David Raun](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/25/2053412/0/en/OSS-Appoints-David-Raun-Technology-Industry-Veteran-as-President-CEO.html) has two decades of experience in the PCIe area, and led PLX Technology to record revenue and profits before getting acquired by Broadcom (AVGO).\n\nCOMPETITORS\n\nForget the stellar partnerships, what about the competition? Within the well-differentiated industry of Hardware, Storage, and Peripherals are 40 companies ranging from Apple to Ricoh. The direct competitor to watch for is Supermicro (SMCI). SMCI, however, makes no mention of cloud-readiness in its press release (coincidentally publicized merely hours after OSS, on the very same day - nervous, perhaps?). \n\nOn the other hand, the OSS 4UV can connect almost any Gen 4 server to eight A100 PCIe GPUs and two NICs, also offering a complete NVIDIA GPU **cloud-ready solution** with the OSS 4UV pre-installed in an OSS 2U-EOS-4a Gen 4 server.\n\nOFFERING\n\nPremarket Tuesday, March 2nd, OSS announced a 1.5M share offering to an institutional investor. Remarkably, OSS showed strength into the mid-morning, after opening at $7.56 it hit a high of $8.79 before succumbing to general market weakness and closing at $7.91, down 11% (see daily chart below). A green candle the day after an offering? Sounds like a great dip to buy. \n\nTECHNICALS\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tf412r4quok61.jpg?width=1522&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d061155dc969bb6663af3fd38c9d1014ed799264\n\nVolume has been readily coming in. A stock that previously traded around 40k volume is now averaging big volumes, over 1M+ daily. What happened? I think institutions are beginning to catch on. Currently above the 5, 20, and 50 moving averages, OSS bounced nicely off the 20 MA during a big intra-day rally (40%+) on March 1st, 2021 hitting a fresh 52-week high of $9.50 without apparent news. \n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nInvestors should ask the question, \"where could this company be in 2 to 3 years?\" With OSS, we have a case study in a profitable company meeting big revenue expectations relatively soon after IPO, invaluable partnerships, military contracts, and anticipatory growth in the industry and beyond.\n\nPOSITIONS: I am in for 1300 shares at $8.60.",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, March 2, 2021**\n\nStocks retreated on Tuesday, pulling back after rallying yesterday, underscoring how volatile the market is right now. Market participants continue to focus on the Treasury yields, a new coronavirus vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and additional stimulus from Washington. \n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury yield retreated to hover below 1.45% after spiking to a one-year high of 1.61% last week. The swift rise in interest rates last week spooked equity investors last week, with rates reflecting inflationary fears and impacting both corporate and consumer borrowing costs. Last week, during his testimony to Congress, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell tried to temper fears over higher rates and inflationary pressures. He said,  rising Treasury yields are a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we\u2019ll have a robust and ultimately complete \\[economic\\] recovery.\u201d Central Bank officials from the United Kingdom and Australia echoed Powell\u2019s sentiments and committed to maintaining accommodative fiscal policies. \n\nOver the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s (JNJ) single-dose coronavirus vaccine, making it the third vaccine approved in the US.  [The company has already begun shipping its COVID-19 vaccine ](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-u-s-cdc-advisory-committee-recommends-first-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-for-adults-18-and-older-in-u-s)and expects to deliver more than 100 million doses of the single-shot vaccines during the first half of 2021, including more than 20 million by the end of March. \n\nIn Washington D.C., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate is scheduled to begin debating the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that the House of Representatives recently passed this week, though he did not specify when a vote would be held. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Rocket Mortgage (RKT) soared over 70% today, sending the stock to record highs and continuing a dizzying rally in the last few days. Shares were even halted at one point today. In a note to clients, S3 Analytics said, \u201cRKT\u2019s stock price and short selling activity is reminiscent of another recent high flying meme stock \u2013 GameStop Inc (GME). Both stocks saw their share price spike due to high retail buying interest (predominantly due to significant social media activity) and an options based gamma squeeze. Both stocks also had/have relatively high short interest and high stock borrow rates which imply strong short-selling demand and limited stock borrow supply.\"\n* After posting strong earnings and rising more than 8% after-hours yesterday, Zoom\u2019s (ZM) stock price cratered today, with the stock going from 8% up to more than 9% down in today\u2019s session.\n* After posting disappointing earnings, NIO\u2019s stock also cratered today, falling more than 12% in today\u2019s session.\n* After the recent controversies, Alibaba (BABA) co-founder Jack MA is now the fourth richest person in China, falling from first place. \n* In a memo to employees, Ant Group\u2019s executive chairman Eric Jing said an IPO was still in the cards.\n* Vizio Holdings, a maker of smart TVs, has filed for an IPO. The company has sold 82.2 million televisions and 11.8 million sound bars since its founding in 2002, the prospectus said.\n* \\***Please note current stock prices were written in the morning pre-market and do not reflect intraday volatility.**\n* C3 AI (AI) target raised by Needham &amp; Co from $193 to $195 at Buy.

Dow futures implied a loss of more than 40 points, while S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq futures also were lower. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.3% Wednesday and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 2.7%. The 30-stock Dow declined 119 points, or 0.38%.

Investors are no doubt hoping to hear comforting words from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell when he addresses the Wall Street Journal Jobs Summit shortly after midday. Due to Monday\u2019s strong rally, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 remain higher for the week, and the Financials and Energy sectors are both up by well over 3% for the week.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Top investor John Rogers says to look outside of the S&amp;P 500 to find new opportunities (CNBC PRO)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * The Labor Department releases its weekly report on initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET, with economists looking for 750,000 new claims for the week ending Feb. 27. That would be up from the prior week\u2019s 730,000.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Revised fourth quarter productivity figures are also out at 8:30 a.m. ET, with consensus forecasts calling for productivity to have fallen 4.7% on an annual basis during the final three months of 2020. The prior estimate had come in at -4.8%.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * At 10:00 a.m. ET, January factory orders are likely to have jumped 2.3%, according to economists, following a 1.1% increase in December.\nSupermarket operator Kroger (KR) leads this morning\u2019s shortlist of corporate earnings releases, with BJ\u2019s Wholesale (BJ), Burlington Stores (BURL) and Ciena (CIEN) also set to release quarterly numbers. Costco (COST), Broadcom (AVGO), Gap (GPS), SmileDirectClub (SDC) and IMAX (IMAX) are among the companies scheduled to issue earnings releases after today\u2019s closing bell.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Top U.S. health officials are warning that highly transmissible variants are threatening the country\u2019s progress on reducing coronavirus cases. New infections dropped sharply after their January peak, but the trend has since stalled even as more Americans are vaccinated against Covid. \u201cSo much can turn in the next few weeks,\u201d CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday. \u201cHow this plays out is up to us.

House Resolution 1 passed mostly on partisan lines and would need to see support from 10 GOP senators to get past the filibuster. (Associated Press)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * House passes police reform act named for George Floyd (NBC News)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * The House canceled its session that had been scheduled for today, following a warning from Capitol Police that a militia group may be planning to attempt a breach of the building. In a statement almost two months after the Jan. 6 attack, Capitol Police said it \u201cis aware of and prepared for any potential threats towards members of Congress or towards the Capitol complex.\u201d It also said upgrades to security have been made.

The fast-casual burrito chain\u2019s move follows similar steps from Starbucks (SBUX) and McDonald\u2019s (MCD) and comes as individual investors and asset managers alike are placing a greater emphasis on environmental, societal and corporate governance (ESG) issues. For Chipotle, some of its environmental goals include raising its level of organic, local or regeneratively grown or raised food. (CNBC)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Walt Disney (DIS) plans to shutter 20% of its brick-and-mortar Disney Store locations, as the company boosts its focus on e-commerce operations. Disney said at least 60 of its locations in North America will close. Globally, there are about 300 Disney Stores. The Covid pandemic led to increased adoption of online shopping, with some saying the health crisis has accelerated the shift that was already in place. Disney did not say how the store closings will impact financial results. (CNBC)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Hedge fund Melvin Capital, which found itself at the center of the Reddit-sparked GameStop (GME) frenzy in January, saw a return of nearly 22% in February. Melvin had been short the video-game retailer before its stock took off as retail traders piled into the name, and the Gabe Plotkin-led fund ultimately declined 53% in January. (CNBC)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * A prototype rocket from Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX exploded Wednesday, not long after it landed for the first time following a test flight. It\u2019s not clear what caused the explosion, or whether it was intentional. On two previous test flights for the Starship prototype, in December and February, the rockets were unable to slow down enough and exploded on impact during an attempted landing. SpaceX, last valued at $74 billion, is working on the stainless steel Starship with the intention of launching people and cargo to the moon and Mars.

        "selftext": "* It's a seesaw market day as all indices attempts to find a clear direction after one of the best bull day in almost 9 months. Alas, after running up 5%+ on Monday, Tim Apple pare gains while Andy Amazon stayed relatively flat until power hour where big tech took a big dump. AAPL closed the day down -2% to $125 while AMZN closed down -1.64%, losing $3,100 yet again. Similar situation with FB at -2.23% and MSFta t -1.30%. With pressure from big bois and all sectors, QQQ/SPY sell off continued into closing hours.\n\n* **RKT** is back on WSB menu after a long hiatus where it never fucking breaks the $22/$23 channel. Things changed yesterday as the largest mortgage lender in the US reported stellar Q4 numbers, with EPS at $1.14 vs consensus of $0.87. For once theta gang does NOT win on RKT even with an implied move of 18%+. Coupled with the special dividend announcement of $1.11 per share, short sellers are being extra squeezed today as shares ran as high as $36+ during intraday high. Despite floating around up 18% to 20% for the day, RKT started sky rocketing as it broke out the channel at 12:47 PM. After touching intraday high of +60%, RKT continued volatite trade with multiple halts as all OTM weeklies goes deep ITM. RKT closed the day up 71% with the rocket continuing in AH. Surely a new round of WSBer going into an \"old\" meme stock won't result in a new group of bagholders!? \n\n* **GME** continues to trade in a new channel with wild swing days as gamma exposure settles from MMs selling Feb options last week. F to the bro that bought way too many $800c 2/26 FDs last week. During intraday high GME was up \"modestly\" at +8% to $133 but gains faded towards end of day to close red at -1.84% to $118. The all-to-important Q4 earnings loom later this month on Wednesday March 24. \n\n* **ZM** reported earnings yesterday and while shares soar 9% AH, the gains didn't translate in open session today as shares fade and sold off towards end of day to close -9% at $372. Q4 EPS was $1.22 vs $0.79 consensus, and they project Q1 EPS of ~$0.97 vs consensus of $0.72 along with full year 2022 of ~$3.65, above consensus of $2.96. Price target was raised to $420 from $390 at Morgan Stanley while Piper Sandler upgrades the video conference company from neutral to overweight, with a PT of $541 (lol wtf). \n\n* **ARK Invest ETFs** traded flat today reflecting many of Cathie's holdings performances as of late (until power dump hour). Sent by Market Jebus himself, Cathie Woods has been dealing with a number of negative news round as chatters floats about of funds targetting her holdings as an attempt to push ARKK, ARKW and others down thanks to recent growth name weakness and a push on redemption - to which Cathie responded in bewildment that her ETF has plenty of liquidity and redemption is never an issue. With selling pressure from ROKU and TSLA, ARKK closed down -2.48% to $133 while ARKW closed down -2.34% to $164.\n\n* **Notable upgrades and downgrades:** BYND, an old WSB meme, stock received an upgrade by Citi from Neutral to Buy. Shares close the day down -5% to $139. Cruise stocks receive an upgrade from Macquarie today with NCLH, RCL, CCL all upgraded to Outperform from Neutral today. On the downgrade side, PLUG took a hit from Barclays from Equal Weight to Underweight, while upping their PT to $29 (up from $21). The meme stock tok a dump today to close -7% to $48.73.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land (okay what isn't a meme stock these days), **AMC** close the day down -2.72% to $8.93. Steel gang (I know you're still out there) are finally slowly crawling back from the depths of theta hell, with **MT** up +3.71%, finally breaking out of $25 once again. **BB** closed down -3.76%, staying in the $10 ranges for now until the next catalyst arrives.\n\n* **Noteworthy ERs:** SNOW and OKTA reports today after market close. On Thursday before market opens: PRPL, and Michaels. After market close: COST, SDC, AVGO, GPS, and WORK. Heavily shorted Chinese education \"platform\" GSX reports Friday before market opens. Watch for TAL and EDU to move in sync with whatever GSX ends up reporting. (Both are good ER play candidate if you don't want to deal with the IV crush from GSX).\n\n* **Notable econ numbers:** ADP employment at 8:15 AM ET, EIA draw at 10:30 AM. Jobless claims report at the usual Thursday 8:30 AM followed by factory orders and EIA at 10:30 AM. Finally, Fri brings us the employment situation with nonfarm payroll numbers at 8:30 AM Friday.\n\n* The DOW closed down -0.46% or +144 pts, Nasdaq down -1.69% or -230 pts, SPX udown -0.81% or -31 pts, and RUT close down -1.93% or -43 pts. Our boi VIX is back in the spotlight again as its up 3.3% to 24+.\n\n* Yesterday's recap: none as its been awhile since I've written these.",
