        "selftext": "In spite of the \"SPACs are dead\" zeitgeist, thanks to the SPAC frenzy during the bubble SPAC teams in general undoubtedly have more high quality sponsors now than ever before. Bad price action, pessimistic sentiment and the arb trap are what they are, but more legit unicorn list companies have DA'd since the crash than the entire history of SPACs prior to that, and quality companies continue to DA at competitive multiples to competition. Many of these SPAC teams have significant reputations on the line and are expected to deliver high quality long term investments, regardless of short term trading action.\n\nSince I am predominantly a pre-DA warrants investor, when vetting SPAC teams I like to look for: \n\na.) past successful SPAC experience; \n\nb.) high level of specialized experience in the sector of focus (for example, FTPA/FTVI/HERA/SCLE's Betsy Cohen and ACQR's Steven McLaughlin are specialized experts at fintech and know the field like the back of their hand).

        "selftext": "Micron Technology(NASDAQ:MU) is the 4th largest distributor of semiconductors in the world leading in production of DRAM and NAND. Analysts predict a one year stock value median of $120  compared to current $82. My own calculation, which skews more conservative, has them at 118.12% with a 30.6 Margin of Safety. \n\nLooking at valuation, they consistently surprise EPS expectations. Last quarter they beat an expected 1.72 at 1.88 and have an expected EPS of 2.32 for Q3. Their PE of 22.63 is below the industry's 31.97x, has P/B of 2.17 compared to industry's 14.2x, P/S is 3.62 compared to Industry's 12.18, PEG Ratio is .36 compared to industry's .12. Altogether, a great start. \n\nFundamentally, looking at their financials they did take a big hit in 2019 because of the semiconductor supply shortage. Look up price of GPU from 2019 to today and you'll quickly see what I mean. This impacted their sales and earnings. In 2018 their high was 31B Revenue and 14B in earnings. With COVID and that stock shortage already there, 2020 earnings had tumbled to 21.43 B and a meager 2.69B. If you go to quarterlies though, they're currently smashing it. They're last quarterly was simply phenomenal. Revenue of 7.42 B, and earnings of 1.74B. Year to Year and Year to quarterly is just fantastic from where they were. Next year they're predicting an EBIDA growth of 20%. Very ambitious estimate and while definitely not sustainable for 5 year period, a one year 20% EBIDA prediction is still very good.\n\nMany things in their favor is they're buying back shares. They're starting to buy back shares. Its not much, but last quarter saw the first decrease in ordinary share number and increase in treasury shares. This is course change from previous quarters of a slight dilution they've had. Its not as intense as Intel's buyback, but it shows management's belief that they're undervalued. They also just announced a dividend. Its small, 10 cents a share, but you don't do that unless you're confident. It also gets on the radar of intuitions that require a dividend. They're domestic so there is no concentration on foreign crackdowns. In fact, in 2019 Huawei was 14% of their business and the USA restriction already had that hit. \n\nSome hits against them are that there are other competitors. Multiple companies have the cash to to invest in hyper expansion like Intel and Ti. Since the start of the shortage, MU has had decreased earnings and revenue seeing shrinkage of about 28% from their 2018 high. Until recently, they weren't  that cash flow positive and have been taking on more debt to power expansion. This may effect DCF calculations. Its more held by institutions than insiders so while the board has an obligation to share holders, it won't keep them up at night. I\n\nSome insight to the semiconductors as a whole. US Gov passed a bill a couple months back approving funding for domestic semicondutor chip development of 50B. So they're not prone to the infrastructure bill may or may not passing, they already have increased federal funding. Also, DRAM and NAND are respectively dynamic memory and logic gates necessary for computers to function. DRAM is expected to increase 16% in sales and NAND is expected to go  up 30%. DRAM makes up a larger portion of sales for MU to NAND. However, none of these things are going away. These are core components of any development and are only looking to increase in demand.\n\nAnother competitor you might want to look at is Western Digital (WDC). They have similar fundamentals and potential for growth. However, Micron has better ratios at the moment  so that's why I chose to focus on it. Either one I think is a greatly undervalued stock with MU just being better.",

        "selftext": "I posted [my July earnings trading report](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/ov71vv/my_july_earnings_report/) last month, and many of you were kind enough to share your thoughts with me.\n\nTLDR: My July results were almost a scratch, $93 into a positive column, and I was undecided if trading earnings is a worthwhile thing.\n\nFast forward to the end of August\u2026 I couldn\u2019t keep away from earnings, just love trading them.\n\nHere are my August stats:\n\n* 21 earnings trades (short condors and strangles, all small positions, average BPu $532.85 per position)\n* 19 wins and 2 losses. A win rate - 90%. Better than July\u2019s 77%. A little experience helps!\n* My wins brought in $567.68\n* Losses took away $104.00\n* Net profit $463.68.\n\nWins: ABNB, BBY, CRM, CSCO, DASH, GPS, HPQ, INTU, M, MRVL, NVDA, PTON, SNOW, SPLK, TGT, TJX, ULTA, URBN, WDC\n\nLosses: LOW, JWN\n\nThe wins are great - no doubt. But it is the losses that are really interesting and have a high learning value. My losses show my indecision between two lines of thought: to defend a losing trade or to exit ASAP to minimize the loss. I have seen convincing arguments for both approaches, and am not yet sure where I stand on this.\n\nI managed my losing LOW trade fairly well in the beginning, brought it from several hundred down to around $30 loss. I could have brought it to a win, but I made a mistake - misread where I was standing and exited for a small loss. I learned how to read the position correctly and did another losing trade right - turned it into a win.\n\nI decided to take a loss on JWN because my overall win rate for August was around 93% and I thought I could afford a small loss. But now I think it could\u2019ve been managed and perhaps turned. But we\u2019ll never know if it could and if I had the skill to do it.\n\nWhere do you stand on this question? Do you defend? Or take a loss and move on to the next trade?",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, August 5, 2021**\n\nAfter closing mixed yesterday, stocks firmly rose today as market participants digested more corporate earnings reports and the Weekly Unemployment Report, which showed improvement. Tomorrow, the Department of Labor will release it\u2019s July Unemployment Report. This report is set to be a wild card, with analyst estimates ranging wildly from ADP estimating an addition of 330,000 jobs to Bloomberg economists estimate of 845,000 jobs added. We\u2019ll see tomorrow.\n\nThe three major indexes powered higher today, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) recording fresh intraday all-time highs. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.75% higher and is marginally below it\u2019s previous all-time high. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-cap stocks, closed 1.8% higher. \n\nADP, a leading payroll and human services software company, released its July 2021 Employment Report, which estimated that private employers added only 330,000 jobs in July, less than half the 690,000 gain expected by economists. While ADP\u2019s estimates aren\u2019t 100% accurate, it sets up a negative backdrop for the July Jobs Report set to be released tomorrow. As I said earlier, estimates between economists range wildly, so we\u2019ll just have to wait and see how the report unfolds. \n\nSo far, 59% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85% year-on-year, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 2009. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Weekly Unemployment Report came in roughly in-line with analyst expectations\n   * First time jobless claims: 385,000 vs 383,000 expected\n   * Continuing Claims 2.93 million vs 3 million\n* The rally in Robinhood (HOOD) stopped, with the stock dropping more than 27% today, very crazy movement in this stock the last few days. On the other hand, shares of \u201cmeme stocks\u201d advanced after falling a few days in a row. \n* Uber (UBER) posted a wider than expected loss for Q2. This bodes bad for the company since rival Lyft (LYFT) unexpectedly posted a profit last quarter.\n* Shares of Etsy (ETSY) sank 10% after the company posted slightly disappointed during earnings. \n* Shares of DataDog (DDOG) gapped up after the company smashed earnings estimates \n* Penn National Gaming (PENN) acquired Score Media (SCR), the largest sports media app in Canada and the third largest in the US for $2 billion in cash and stock. Jay Snowden, President and CEO said of the acquisition, \u201ctheScore\u2019s unique media platform and modern, state-of-the art technology is a powerful complement to the reach of Barstool Sports and its popular personalities and content. We are now uniquely positioned to seamlessly serve our customers with the most powerful ecosystem of sports, gaming and media in North America, ultimately creating a community that doesn\u2019t currently exist.\u201d I personally like this stock.\n* In a White House event, the Biden administration and auto makers committed to try and get EV sales to make up 50% of cars sold in the US by 2030, contingent on the government support for the transition.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* AbbVie (ABBV) target raised by Argus from $130 to $140 at Buy. Stock currently around $115.\n* AmerisourceBergen (ABC) target raised by Robert W Baird from $156 to $162 at Outperform. Stock currently around $122\n* Costco (COST) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target $480 at Overweight. Stock currently around $443\n* CVS target raised by Deutsche Bank from $95 to $101 at Buy.

WDC, +10.50% soared 11.7% in afternoon trading Wednesday, to pace the S&amp;P 500's SPX, +0.30% gainers, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the data storage company was in merger talks with Japan-based Kioxia Holdings Corp., in a deal that could be valued at more than $20 billion. Citing people familiar with the matter, the WSJ report said the long-running talks have heated up in the past few weeks, with a deal possible as early as the middle of September. Western Digital would use stock to pay for the deal, and the combined company would likely be run by David Goeckeler, its chief executive, the WSJ report said. The stock has now gained 22.5% year to date, while the SPDR Technology Select Sector ETF XLK, -0.17% has rallied 21.0% and the S&amp;P 500 has advanced 19.8%.\n\nThis is definitely a positive news for WDC and MU.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, August 5, 2021**\n\nAfter closing mixed yesterday, stocks firmly rose today as market participants digested more corporate earnings reports and the Weekly Unemployment Report, which showed improvement. Tomorrow, the Department of Labor will release it\u2019s July Unemployment Report. This report is set to be a wild card, with analyst estimates ranging wildly from ADP estimating an addition of 330,000 jobs to Bloomberg economists estimate of 845,000 jobs added. We\u2019ll see tomorrow.\n\nThe three major indexes powered higher today, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) recording fresh intraday all-time highs. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.75% higher and is marginally below it\u2019s previous all-time high. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-cap stocks, closed 1.8% higher. \n\nADP, a leading payroll and human services software company, released its July 2021 Employment Report, which estimated that private employers added only 330,000 jobs in July, less than half the 690,000 gain expected by economists. While ADP\u2019s estimates aren\u2019t 100% accurate, it sets up a negative backdrop for the July Jobs Report set to be released tomorrow. As I said earlier, estimates between economists range wildly, so we\u2019ll just have to wait and see how the report unfolds. \n\nSo far, 59% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85% year-on-year, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 2009. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Weekly Unemployment Report came in roughly in-line with analyst expectations\n   * First time jobless claims: 385,000 vs 383,000 expected\n   * Continuing Claims 2.93 million vs 3 million\n* The rally in Robinhood (HOOD) stopped, with the stock dropping more than 27% today, very crazy movement in this stock the last few days. On the other hand, shares of \u201cmeme stocks\u201d advanced after falling a few days in a row. \n* Uber (UBER) posted a wider than expected loss for Q2. This bodes bad for the company since rival Lyft (LYFT) unexpectedly posted a profit last quarter.\n* Shares of Etsy (ETSY) sank 10% after the company posted slightly disappointed during earnings. \n* Shares of DataDog (DDOG) gapped up after the company smashed earnings estimates \n* Penn National Gaming (PENN) acquired Score Media (SCR), the largest sports media app in Canada and the third largest in the US for $2 billion in cash and stock. Jay Snowden, President and CEO said of the acquisition, \u201ctheScore\u2019s unique media platform and modern, state-of-the art technology is a powerful complement to the reach of Barstool Sports and its popular personalities and content. We are now uniquely positioned to seamlessly serve our customers with the most powerful ecosystem of sports, gaming and media in North America, ultimately creating a community that doesn\u2019t currently exist.\u201d I personally like this stock.\n* In a White House event, the Biden administration and auto makers committed to try and get EV sales to make up 50% of cars sold in the US by 2030, contingent on the government support for the transition.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* AbbVie (ABBV) target raised by Argus from $130 to $140 at Buy.

TheStreet score**\n\nThe first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I\u2019m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.\n\nFrom thestreet.com:\n\n***A (Excellent)*** *\u2013 The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication \u2014 not a guarantee \u2014 we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*\n\nAnd about the methodology (source: https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html):\n\n*TheStreet Ratings\u2019 stock model projects a stock\u2019s total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*\n\n**2. Zacks Rank**\n\nIt is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we\u2019re avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company\u2019s shares. More from https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6:\n\n*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s +10.6% .*\n\n**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**\n\nWe\u2019re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.\n\nWjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:\n\n*\u201cA\u201d Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company\u2019s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company\u2019s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our \u201cA\u201d rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a \u201c****Strong Buy****\u201c.*\n\n*\u201cB\u201d rating:* ***Good.*** *The company\u2019s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our \u201cB\u201d rating is considered the equivalent of a \u201c****Buy****\u201c.*\n\n**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**\n\nIt is required that the Yahoo Finance stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.\n\n**5. Piotroski F-Score**\n\nThe Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company\u2019s financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski\u2019s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:\n\n*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*\n\nIt is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from https://www.gurufocus.com.\n\n**6. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**\n\nThe rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.\n\n*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*\n\n*A low score doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a bullish case for it.*\n\nPlease note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the reading. What do you think about this stock selection and the strategy? Feel free to leave a comment below.\n\n*Michael*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosures:\n\n* What you see here is my personal opinion, my own investments and should not be treated as investing advice\n* I\u2019m an amateur investor",
