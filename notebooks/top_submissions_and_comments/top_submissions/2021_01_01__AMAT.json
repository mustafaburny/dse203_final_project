        "selftext": "* The market opened slightly red but quickly reversed because JPow realized this was no way to start a New Year, with Chadsdaq and S&amp;P being propelled to green status thanks to Tim Apple and gang. DOW got further lifted by action from BA, GS, CVX, and INTC (who's really only being carried by MU). Small caps eclipsed SPX and IXIC today with RUT/IWM up as high as almost 2% during intraday high as value play starts looking more appealing. RUT closed up 1.7% and IWM closed up 1.61%.\n\n* \"I'm totes not dead.\" Says Jack Ma, according to a person familiar with the situation who's relaying the info to a CNBC  reporter on Ma's whereabouts. The beleaguered CEO who's in the crosshair of the CCP is keeping it easy and out of the limelight after running afoul of his overlords by talking up CCP's heavy handed action towards Ant Group. Who knew if your fucking financial empire touches the livelihood of 90% of the country there may be consequences if you don't toe the line. BABA closed the day up 5.51% to $240. Meanwhile, PDD touches new ATH and closed the day up 12.24% to $187 while JD is up 10.61% to $95.\n\n* The Chinese ADR/ADS sector gets a lift today partly thanks to NYSE's overnight about-face on delisting Chinese Telecoms. BILI hits new ATH and closed up 8.15% to $102.46 thanks to favorable reception from their secondary listing on the Heng Sheng\n\n* Semi sector is on a run today thanks to MU, with Citi upping, NAND and DRAM manufacturer from Sell all the way up to Buy with a PT of freaking $100 as we enter another cyclical season. RBC Capital also raised PT from $57 to $83, Deutsche Bank from $75 to $83. Will MU $90 be back in favor and no longer a meme strike? Find out later this week. F in the chat for MartyMoho. If only he bought fooking shares and ride through two more additional cyclical season and a global pandemic. Ez dub. MU closed up 4.33% to $77, LRCX closed up 3.46% to $494, and AMAT closed up 3% to $89. MU reports earnings this Thursday after market close.\n\n* GM pop 2% when news broke at 10:29 on positive US sales number from Q4, while shares were fading slightly as the market digest the news, eventually the positive momentum took over and shares closed the day up 2.84% to $41.66. ROKU pop to close up 5.44%, closing at $335 thanks to WFC analyst raising PT from $275 to $414 (yep) and keeping his overweight rating. \n\n* Today's big movers: FUBO was up as high as 21%, M-A-R-A was up as high 23% while B-N-G-O drilled more than -30% during intraday lows after an initial halt in the early mornings.

Meanwhile, Congress is set to confirm Biden's win over Trump, a procedural formality that generally receives little news coverage but not in the current timeline. Expect POTUS to rage over Pence on Twitter later tonight if the latter confirms Biden's Electoral College win. Look to weed and clean energy sector for pops if the Dems somehow wins both seat. No doubt many WSBer have already loaded up on FDs to showcase the sick gains porn tomorrow if the magic happens.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR is up more than 5% but those with OTM Jan 15 calls are likely having their ass handed to them by the greeks, while a similar story exist over at GME as the stock fades away morning gain to close the day up 0.70% as theta rampage $20c, $22c, and $23c (if your strike is even further out then RIP to you). MT and steel gang are faring better, with the stock retaking yesterday's high and closed up 2.84% to 24.63.

        "selftext": "What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher.

        "selftext": "I had posted something similar in a FIRE community but wanted to come to this reddit as I venture here more often.\n\nLook, I'm great at saving money.  I don't spend anything hardly but I'm an awful investor.  I over analyze and talk myself out of buying a stock. Basically I never pull the trigger.\n\nAge: 43\n\nAble to save about: 60K Annually (things can change but this is how it has averaged last few years)\n\nHave about 350K in cash.   Have about 200K in stocks and a Growth Fund with some of this being in ROTH and 401K.\n\nWhatever crappy stocks I bought in 2000 haven't done much. Finally making a profit in CSCO and AMAT but then there is the defunct Nortel and Nokia.  All I needed to had done was buy MSFT and Apple.   In 2008 or 2009  I actually had a 200 share buy order on MSFT at 20 a share and I called my broker and cancelled and bought GE at 17 instead. I did at least get JPM on the cheap back then.  So anyways these are just examples of my not so great trades.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there is this year where I look at NET at 35 and don't buy. I look at RTX and buy and get scared and sold and then it took off 14 points.  \n\nSo I'm bummed. No one to blame but myself.   I do not want to keep kicking myself and being down on myself.   Any advice. I feel with all the cash I have and the annual savings I can invest, I can maybe do pretty well.  Ideally living a modest lifestyle, I would love to FIRE in about 10 years.\n\nAny help or advice?  When I run my retirement compound interest numbers I used 4%. I would love to get 7 to 10% but I sense a possible lost decade ahead with all this printing of money and artificially inflating things.\n\nI was thinking of perhaps taking 25% and putting in a low cost Vanguard Fund.   Then maybe taking 10 stocks and putting in 10K each or maybe I should take 20 stocks and put 5K in each.\n\nSuch as MMM, MSFT, CAT, Merck, MCD, PAYPL, HD, Chevron, LMT, DIS, maybe an EXPEDIA and other high quality stocks. Maybe gamble with CRWD\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nor should I just put it all in a low cost fund and be done with it and call it a day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your advice.  I appreciate this community.",

        "selftext": "ASX: FLT\n\nBullish case: \n\nFlight centres biggest markets are (in order) Australia - America - UK. InAustralia we see no to little community transmissions and a planned rollout of vaccines early March. Without a vaccine there\u2019s been an increase of 200% in bookings in Australia through Flight centre online (and that\u2019s with borders starting to partially open up again) for December and throughout early 2021 with hotel and flights being fully booked out. Australia\u2019s market for flight centre is largely made up of corporate travel, however, that could change momentarily due to lockdown fatigued and people wanting to travel for leisure and go on a holiday (which mind you we already see a huge increase in demand for holidays) and corporate travel likely to come back even in small increments we could see a huge increase in revenue and profits in 2021\u2019s earnings (most likely beating expectations). An increase in profits is and a possible increase in profit margins due to operating cost decreasing and most likely staying at the same level until full operation. This is where it gets tricky though, they are well know for their walk in deals when customers come into the store, but since the recent closing of more than 100+ stores in Australia alone, Flight centre would have to heavily push for online consumption of their products. Which is why some people say Webjet is better placed, but flight centre has a lot of money due to their capital raising, and if they can use the money well and offer online deals, marketing campaigns and still keep open their remaining stores with in store deals. They will have multiple income streams from different infrastructures (unlike webjet). For example, boomers mostly don\u2019t know how to use the internet and would rather face to face because it feels more authentic while the younger generation don\u2019t care which one they use as long as they get discounted cheap prices for fully planned holidays that they themselves after lock down probably can\u2019t be stuffed planning themselves. Also there are quite a few vouchers by state governments incentivesing people to travel (not to sure how many or how much). \n\nThis also comes with Flight centre recently upgrading and improving their online ability to more efficiently help customers by upgrading to a K2 cloud operating system. \n\nhttps://www.google.com.au/amp/s/itbrief.com.au/amp/story/flight-centre-travel-group-updates-cx-and-operations-with-k2-cloud\n\n\nSo my price target in the next 6-12 months is $40, but this would mean People are willing to take the vaccine and corporate and leisure travel actually hit pre COVID level and even all time highs (which is doable but highly speculative)\n\n\n\nNOT FINACIAL ADVICE",

        "selftext": "Just wanted to get some thoughts on my current TFSA approach. \n\nI have split up of my TFSA account into \"dividend\" and \"risk\" stocks both contributing about 50% to the balance. The \"dividend\" stocks are: NPI, CM, BEP, BLX, HR, HMMJ. You can probably tell that this is already a fairly aggressive approach, but I think the 4 companies and the ETF and REIT are fairly solid picks. Also fairly heavy on renewable energy. I actively keep theses stocks balanced using dividends and contributions. Essentially, I keep buying CM and HR as their growth trails the other ones.\n\nMy \"risk\" stocks are PHO, FLT, CUB, PNG, GPV and GDNP. I got lucky with GPV as I got in at $1.97. I am not planning to take profits on these stocks unless this pool starts to dwarf my dividends stock, i.e. once the original 1:1 ratio between risk and dividend hits 2:1 I will re-balance and move profits from risk -&gt; dividend.\n\nThis approach has been working very well over the last 2 years and I saw some tremendous overall returns, but I am realistic and old enough to appreciate that this will these high returns cannot be sustained. Having said that, I do think an annual 25% increase should be possible (without contributions). I am already up %12+ this year. Out of principle I do not invest in any O&amp;G, mining or medical companies, mostly because I understand high tech companies much better, but also in parts out of conviction.\n\nI am expecting a correction on the renewable energy stocks at some point, but I believe that long term they alone should help me achieve my goals. \n\nSo, I guess the only questions I have is whether this approach is sane? Also, I am leaning towards weathering though any potential pull backs or even averaging down, especially on the renewables. Or does it make more sense to try and diversify now?",

It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.\n* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.\n* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.\n* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.\n* There are a lot of SPY500/\"boomer\" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.\n* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.\n* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement\n* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only\n* This is a one man bot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bot Overview**:\n\nIt's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits.

        "selftext": "DoorDash is currently sitting at $142 per share, down 22% from $182 when retail investors were able to buy at IPO. Only \\~10% of its 286M outstanding shares are available to trade due to its lockup period, giving it a float of 20M shares.\n\nHere's where things get interesting. If you take a look at page 91 of their S-1 filing ([Go to page 91 to confirm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm#rom752207_9) ), existing shareholders PRE-IPO purchased 284M shares at $8.73. Company employees who purchased shares at that price are salivating at a current 1,628% profit. Early lockup period expires 90 days after IPO, meaning that 90% of outstanding shares (284M shares once again) that currently can't be traded and were purchased at $8.73 will be released into the market available to trade. Regardless of what you think about valuation and possible future growth of DoorDash (which is already ridiculously overpriced and they had the worst IPO in history), any rational employee will dump their holdings immediately for that 10 bagger profit.\n\nNow considering present conditions, the price action is ridiculous. Looking at the level 2 data, there is almost no retail volume, and any trades made throughout the day are by MMs trying to keep this stock liquid. Volume from the past 2 days has already dropped by 50%. Literally NO ONE wants to buy this POS. The price is pinned at $140, with retail dips that are immediately bought up by manipulation. If you look at the 1 minute chart yesterday, it traded at literally $140 throughout the day and suddenly spiked to 146 in a manner of 3 minutes before slowly settling down to $142. This thing is manipulated as fuck, and as soon as MMs are exhausted it will crash regardless of the aforementioned S-1 filing.\n\nI have 175 contracts of 5/21 $80 puts. I'm betting $87k I can look back at this post in 5 months and pretend I'm reenacting The Big Short as Ryan Gosling. More than likely, I'll probably have to start driving for DoorDash and moonlight sucking weens behind the restaurants I just made a delivery from.\n\nLooking for any serious counterarguments on why this play might be retarded.",

A holding company which has five subsidiaries.\n\nThe subsidiaries are:\n\n\\- GOG sp. z o.o (Similar to Steam, it is a distributor of games).\n\n\\- CD PROJEKT Inc (Where all the game development happens)\n\n\\- CD PROJEKT Co. Ltd (Only for selling games in China)\n\n\\- Spokko sp. z o.o. (The mobile arm of CD projekt red)\n\n\\- CD PROJEKT RED STORE sp. z o.o. (A new store of merchandise launched by the company)\n\n**GOG -** Who have just released a 2.0 version called GOG Galaxy which subsequently entered its beta testing phase. The goal of the application is to enable players to integrate all their game shelves into a single library, to communicate with friends and to track their progress regardless of their preferred gaming platforms. Its functionality will span PC and console platforms, extending beyond the GOG.com user base. It's main selling points are that is uses the cloud, is DRM free and has a ton of old games such as Diablo, Destroy all humans etc on it's platform that Steam doesn't.\n\nSteam is the single biggest distributor of digital games for PC, it's been dominating the market for years and has way more games than GOG does due to this. Especially as a lot of publishers do not want to host their games DRM free which GOG requires. It's very difficult to predict the future of GOG because Steam is a private company so we don't have access to it's numbers.\n\nHowever the big benefit of GOG is that CD Projekt Red can sell and promote it's games directly through their own platform. The benefit being a much bigger margin on each game sold as 100% of the profit goes to CD Projekt red if a game is sold on GOG, whereas on Steam they take a 20% cut for the first $50m revenue of Cyberpunk. **One third** of all digital PC preorders for Cyberpunk 2077 sales were on GOG which is an incredible achievement by CD Projekt Red considering Steams dominance.\n\nThis is probably the reason why CD Projekt Red has such a huge operating margin from 30% to 50% in recent years. They are involved in the entire process of making and selling their games.\n\n***GWENT: The Witcher Card Game*** is the first multiplayer game developed by the CD PROJEKT Group. It has been a hugely successful and highly rated game (which is impressive considering it's their first mobile multiplayer game). The reason why this game is important for the future is because multiplayer is the key to the cash machine which is microtransactions which the card game has.\n\n**Cyberpunk** was released recently and had been in development for many years. It's sold very well but less than analysts expectations and there has been serious problems on console versions which led to sony removing cyberpunk 2077 from it's PS store for the time being. This caused the companies stock to plummet 37% recently.\n\nI'll get into the numbers at the bottom for my reverse DCF that I did.\n\n**Cyberpunk Online** multiplayer will definitely come at some point within the next couple of years. The reason being is that after GTA Onlines unbelievable success and constant revenue generation for Take Two then it makes sense to try and replicate this with Cyberpunk. This multiplayer will feature microtransactions and in my opinion is the way Cd Projekt red can really make the big $$ in the future. Microtransactions for cosmetic items like in game skins or packs (like fifa) are easy to implement and have huge operating margins as they take 0 CAPEX and virtually no time to implement due to being some simple code and designs. Here's a quote taken from their 2019 Annual Report for *Key Sources Of Revenue*:\n\n&gt;\u25a0 sales carried out through optional microtransactions in GWENT: The Witcher Card Game (incl. kegs and meteorite dust) via GOG, proprietors of console platforms (PlayStation, Xbox) and App Store (Apple)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are some huge risks with cd projekt red, here are the main ones:\n\n\\- Neither IP, The Wither or Cyberpunk 2077 is owned by CD Projekt since the two series are based on a series of novels and a tabletop RPG respectively. So they would need permission from these license holders (the creators I think) to be able to do other spin offs for them. While it is likely the permission will be given due to the huge successes it's not a certainty.\n\n\\- CD Projekt Red relies on a couple of block busters to make 80% of their revenue and earnings. The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 are the only revenue generates the company has (apart from GOG). If CD Projekt red messes up either of these huge IP's in the future (or like they just have with the console versions of Cyberpunk) then you can expect a huge and sudden stock price drop and potential damage to the company.\n\n\\- Because of the few but huge releases, CD Projekt Red has very volatile earnings and revenue making it very hard to predict, similar to Take Two Interactive. You can see in the following picture how sales drop a lot after release.\n\n**Co-Founders and Board History**\n\nCD PROJEKT has a very long tenure of the management board, all at least 10 years and 3/5 of them 20+ years. Insiders have a significant stake in CD Projekt red's stock, including the joint CEO's. This is great news for shareholders as the insiders have a big incentive to make the company work as they have big stakes in the company.\n\nCompany shareholding structure is made up of the following people:\n\n\\- **Marcin Iwinski** (Joint CEO &amp; Co-Founder) is **13%**\n\n\\- **Michal Kicinski** (Ex Joint CEO &amp; Co-Founder) is **11%**\n\n\\- **Piotr Nielubowicz** (VP, CFO) is **6%**\n\n\\- **Adam Kicinski** (President &amp; Joint CEO) is **3%**\n\nIncentives for management:\n\n&gt;Management goals are based 80% on net earnings and 20% on SP over the WIG index.\n\nThese are poor goals in my opinion. Net earnings can be enhanced by poor acquisitions and stock price is meaningless and should be ignored in incentives as it can produce short term motivations.\n\nManagement hit the majority of their goals for year 2019.Their goals going forward:\n\n&gt;Goals for 2020-2025 Aggregate Net Income: 8,300 PLN or 1,660 PLN a year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Optimistic goals for 2020-2025 Aggregate Net Income: 10,000 PLN or 2,000 PLN a year.\n\nThese goals seem too high in my opinion. Especially after their cyberpunk flop on consoles but it's still possible.\n\n**Competitors**\n\nCD PROJEKT is well known for its biggest sales on The Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 hype. However, there\u2019s a lot of gaming industries that compete with one another.\n\nThus comparing its competitors such as Take-Two Interactive, Electronic Arts (EA), Activision Blizzard has more diversified games and games produced more frequently compared to CD PROJEKT RED.\n\nCD Projekt Red's risk in terms of competitors is releasing a big game that clashes with another big game such as GTA 6. However all gaming companies have a good tailwind right now due to COVID restrictions and microtransactions are lifting all gaming companies margins. A rising tide lifts all boats.\n\n**Industry**\n\n&gt;**-** CAGR 2019-2024 Video games and e-sports growth expected to be 7% (source: PWC Global Entertainment &amp; Media Outlook 2020\u20132024).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- In 2019 the strongest strong growth was observed in the mobile and console segments. The former grew by 9.7%, reaching 68.2 billion USD, while the latter grew by 7.3%, reaching 45.3billion USD. The PC market reached a volume of 35.3 billion USD, having increased by 2.8%.The largest share of the global videogame market is currently held by mobile devices (46%), 80% of which are smartphone releases. Gaming consoles come in second at 30%, followed by the PC 24%. Mobile devices are projected to retain their top position, with their corresponding market volume increasing by 11.2% annually (on average) over the next three years. According to estimates, the volume of the global mobile game market will reach 93.6 billion USD by 2022 (it currently stands at 68.2 billion USD).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can see from the above as to why CD projekt red is branching out to smartphones and China.\n\n**Reverse DCF**  \n\n\nHere's the original post and reverse DCF because r/stocks does not allow images: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kofhq7/wsecdr\\_cd\\_projekt\\_red\\_analysis\\_is\\_it\\_undervalued/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kofhq7/wsecdr_cd_projekt_red_analysis_is_it_undervalued/)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIt's been extremely difficult to project CD Projekt Red and even after doing research I am still very unsure on a bunch of variables. In my opinion the markets assumptions of CD Projekt Red's growth and margins as shown above in the reverse DCF is perfectly acceptable to me. Therefore I would not buy their shares unless they dipped to around 210 zloty\\~ as I don't think they are undervalued yet. given the risks.\n\nPlease comment if you see anything wrong with my valuation. This was a very difficult one for me.\n\nThanks",

        "selftext": "**Current Positions: None**\n\n**Current ROI: 0%**\n\n**Projected ROI: 0%**\n\n**Trades: (pending)**\n\n*Processing img yl4zjvw9wq861...*\n\n# Introduction\n\n**Happy New Year!** **TL;DR- I am going to double a small account over a year, and you are going to watch.**\n\nThree months ago I wrote up a guide on consistently outperforming the S&amp;P500 using Theta Gang strategy. That guide got a lot of positive feedback, and I suggest those who missed it take a look. [How to CONSISTENTLY Outperform the S&amp;P500 using Theta Gang Strategy. A Comprehensive Guide to Wheeling ETFs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how_to_consistently_outperform_the_sp500_using/) And if you are truly retarded check out my recent Tips for Noobies. [Top 5 Tips Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4ztif/top_5_tips_every_noobie_trader_must_know/)\n\nI've since decided to put my skills to the test and will attempt to double a small $8000 account by the end of 2021 using similar strategies. This will mostly be an educational experience, and I will walk you through all my thought processes and my trades as I make them so hopefully the retards among you can learn a thing or two. And if I blow up the account, that will be entertaining as well, right?\n\nSome of the less experienced among you may think this is a simple feat. The more experienced among you will know achieving such consistently high returns will be an incredibly difficult feat. I put my odds of success somewhere around 20% to be honest. But it will be a good education for both of us. Really, I only need to achieve around 6% return every month to break 100% by the end of the year (after compounding), and put in those terms the task doesn't sound so daunting, does it?\n\nStill, I will be forced to make some very aggressive, downright risky plays in order to make this remotely possible. If my wheeling ETF guide was about a safe, conservative strategy, this guide will be the opposite. Keep that in mind if you are foolish enough to copy my trades. \n\nWish me luck... I will need it.\n\n# Basic Strategy\n\nI will not leave any tool off the table here. If I see an opportunity, I will take it. But for the majority of my trades I will be using a very simple strategy. Find high implied volatility stonks and sell options on them. I will typically be selling cash-secured puts since naked calls carry excess risk, which means I want to look for stocks I am generally bullish on long-term.\n\nUsing ToS I've set up some very basic filters to scan for promising stocks to trade:\n\n**1) Option Implied Volatility &gt;80% (for tendies)**\n\n**2) Stock Volume &gt;5,000,000 (for liquidity)**\n\n**3) Market Cap &gt;$1B (to comply with WSB rules)**\n\n**4) Stock Price &lt;$82 (collateral maximum)**\n\nScanning with these filters brings up a lot of familiar names: GME, PLTR, QS, NKLA, LAZR, FCEL, UVXY, ACB, XPEV, SPCE, and so on. In other words, the type of stonks retards like you are buying expensive options on...\n\n# Running the Numbers\n\nI will try to not get too technical and into the weeds with this experiment. I'll be using some very basic math to decide which options to sell. I highly recommend you play around with the numbers on options to really get an intuitive feel for how they work. For example, if I were to ask you what happens to the relative cost of premium ($/day) as DTE increases on an option, what would be your answer? If you don't know, just run some simple numbers to find out...\n\nSPY premium / DTE = $/day\n\n332 / 5 = 66.4\n\n440 / 10 = 44\n\n652 / 21 = 31\n\n1915 / 140 = 13.7\n\nAs you can see, premium cost per day decreases as time till expiration increases. (It's more complicated than that of course, but we are keeping it simple here). For that reason I will be doing something I generally don't advocate: Selling weeklies to squeeze a bit of extra juice out of my options. This also means I will be holding them all to expiration to deal with issues like higher gamma.\n\nHere is another simple equation I can use to give me a lot of information:\n\n**(Premium \\* 365) / (DTE \\* Strike) = Max ROI**\n\nBasically what I'm doing is estimating the returns from selling the same option for an entire year with a 100% success rate. Since I'm aiming for 100% ROI, any options I sell will need to be over 100 in this formula. Of course, I won't have a 100% success rate on my trades, so I should probably aim even higher to give myself some buffer, maybe around 120. Let's try it on some \\~ATM options to get a relative comparison of option value:\n\nSPY: 12.2\n\nPSTH: 48.1\n\nGME: 140.5\n\nPLTR: 111.1\n\nQS: 263.7\n\nUVXY: 134.2\n\nDon't put too much stock in these numbers. I'm just using them as a simple comparative tool for judging the profitability of different options.\n\nWe can glean even more information from the above number if we multiply it by the Prob. ITM% of course, to get something closer to an \"Expected Value\" for an option, which I will perhaps go into more detail on next month.\n\nFinally I'll be throwing around various other calculations as I go, $/day, ROI/month, premium/collateral, and so on. I will need to watch all of these and more to reach my goal.\n\n# My First Trade\n\nLooking at the stocks in my filter, there are two that really stand out to me: GME and PLTR. That's right, everyones favorite meme stocks!\n\nGameStop is interesting as a short-term play, and has very high IV. But I'm not confident in the company as a long-term play, and would hate to be assigned hundreds of shares of that shitty brick and mortar hellscape. Palantir, on the other hand, has serious growth potential long-term and I would not mind being assigned. It has also been hit hard recently and is at a more reasonable entry level, which also makes it a good choice. **Therefore, I will be trading PLTR as my first play.**\n\nI want to sell an OTM put to give myself some downside protection against a further drop, but not so far OTM that I can't break my 100% ROI goal. Let's plug some of the Jan. 15 options into my formula above to get a breakdown of the potential ROI.\n\n21 strike: 74.2\n\n22 strike: 108.4\n\n22.5 strike: 131.9\n\n23 strike: 155.5\n\nEither the 22 or 22.5 strikes are right near the sweet spot we are looking for in terms of return. Of course conditions will likely change on Monday and I may need to reassess, but at the moment my current play seems to be:\n\n**Sell to Open 3 contracts of PLTR 22p 1/15.**\n\nIf Monday opens red it will be even better for us, since we get in at a cheaper price with likely higher IV on top. So I for one am praying for a bloody Monday for Palantir (sorry bagholders).\n\nOf course after selling 3 contracts at 22 strike, we will only have used $6600 of our $8000 capital. I may need to look for one more smallish trade on a stock in the $14 range to take full advantage of our capital. If GME drops on Monday we could consider a far OTM play there, for instance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR- I am going to double a small account, and you are going to watch.**\n\nI will update this post as plays are made, and will create a new post each month as a recap. As always questions are welcome.",

        "selftext": "I got two goals here. One is for you to understand what Salesforce and SAP really do instead of just \"cloud\" and \"software\" and why Salesforce will become like SAP. The second is to tell you what to expect with CRM price and how to make tendies.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst you gotta understand what exactly SAP does and what happened with their stock. SAP is one of the largest software companies which focus on ERP. What the fuck is ERP you might ask? ERP is what other businesses use to track business resources. This ranges from everything such as planning and optimizing manufacturing capacity to dealing with payroll for employees. Basically companies don't want to create their own software for handling these wide range of tasks and pay SAP a shit load of money to do it for them. Where's the problem you might ask? Unless you are involved with one of these companies that use SAP, it's difficult to understand what the experience is like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db3b665c95ce5d62639a4dc0e5d9469a08510cbd\n\nBasically a company pays SAP to use their software for dealing with one of these areas of ERP. This generally works fine since SAP has used their business management software with a lot of companies for the same tasks. The issue is when one of these companies want to [customize the software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning#Disadvantages) to meet unique demands for the company. This re-engineering process to fit the ERP system for many tasks ends up costing more for a company and wasting a lot of time and money. Interestingly enough, you can ask almost any business about their experience with SAP and they will all say that they're unhappy even though they use their software. So what you might ask, wouldn't SAP still be generating tons of revenue? Well yes but more of these companies are moving away from this way of doing ERP as it is an inflexible approach. This is becoming replaced by more loosely connected systems utilizing cloud instead of having a one solves all solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=984&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c45c19bcdd0e10bd643286730aa3a2beeec0ae20\n\nLet's look at how their financial earnings and stock price have reflected this. In the past two years this stock has traded relatively sideways with some really bad drops. Around May to August their stock price went up 60% do to the hype around cloud companies benefiting from COVID. However it has obviously taken a really bad fall when October earnings were announced. They claimed that there was slower recovery than anticipated for many of its clients. However I suspect that many of these companies have been looking to shift away from SAP as the pandemic has shown the importance of the flexibility of these systems. By looking at their past quarters, you can see that their quarterly revenue has been flat around the 8 billion range and the company is clearly having a difficult time changing their business model. Other cloud companies are replacing their solutions as SAP's clients move away from their software even though SAP is trying to shift to [modern cloud technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP#Corporate_restructuring). Generally though companies have a hard time changing their business approach from the old way of doing things to the new way of doing things. \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow the important part. What the fuck does SAP's troubles have to do with Salesforce. As you may have guessed from the ticker Salesforce provides CRM or customer relationship management. [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) is a specific area in ERP dealing with customer services. For example a company may want a software for their call center or to automate a marketing effort. Salesforce provides software to do this along with analytics of this data so that these businesses can make informed decisions.\n\nAs you may have already guessed Salesforce is facing some similar problems that SAP deal with. When a company decides to expand their CRM software to deal with more parts of their business, the inflexibility and costs quickly become apparent. [For example, many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial basis and less than 40 percent of companies have high end-user adoption rates.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management#Criticism) Again if you are not familiar with software development and companies using these software vendors it is difficult to fully understand these troubles. I would strongly recommend researching the issues of customizing ERP or CRM software for a specific company if you are not convinced. While Salesforce tries to provide an all in one solution for their clients, customization becomes complicated and prices become costly. These customizations become difficult to do and take a lot of time, planning, and money. Companies are becoming more inclined to take a different approach for building these systems. In a lot of these cases it is easier for a business to build their own system in the cloud using products from companies such as Microsoft or Amazon for more customizability. \n\nAnother big issue is the concern over customer data with CRM systems. A company might opt to develop their own CRM systems where they can ensure that customer data is obeying customer privacy laws and allows them to have more control over private data. This can help build a better relationship with the customer. Privacy issues over customer data has obviously become a big issue in 2020.\n\nFurthermore, Salesforce has been trying to get into more areas with [recent acquisitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce). Similar to SAP, I suspect that Salesforce will crush over their own weight as they try to expand their company. One good example of this is their recent acquisition of Slack. Slack does not really fit any of Salesforce ecosystem and is really just an attempt to expand into a different area. Slack has a lot of competition from Microsoft teams and other companies which can do what Slack does but better. \n\nBusiness will start to move away from Salesforce similar to SAP. This is not to say that they be completely independent as Salesforce does make some parts of the businesses easier. However there seems to be a strong resemblance to SAP based on what I know from inside of a corporation using both SAP and Salesforce and the many issues they face when they try and customize their solutions.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo how can we use this information to print tendies? The expectation is that Salesforce will eventually slow their growth down while stock is overhyped due to being a cloud company and start to fall or go sideways like SAP. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vl629rb14p861.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4282ffef17bd83b9a62a7f196974d0113511b1d5\n\nBasically the idea is to try and play puts, especially around earnings. If Salesforce misses their guidance then it could the stock in a serious reversal especially for a cloud company with a lot of hype. The next earnings will be early March.\n\nYou can also try and play longer term puts but the stock is fairly volatile like SAP and I would only do this if you see the price go up significantly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; buy puts in march \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: long on GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "**TLDR:**\n\nTesla enters 2021 with huge tailwinds. Bullish for the first half of the year. More caution in the second half as competing EV products start entering the market at an accelerating pace. Biggest risk is the market discounting the effect of strong EV competition starting in 2021. Avoid shorting TSLA.\n\n# The 2021 TSLA trade plan\n\n## What moves the stock?\n\nKnowing that TSLA is decoupled from its business metrics, an inquisitive investor will wonder what drives the stock's price. The answer is partially uncovered by understanding who owns the stock. According to Macroaxis.com, as of December 30th, Institutions own 42.52% of Tesla's stock, the Public (i.e. Retail Investors) owns 37.46%, and Insiders own 20.02%.\n\n&gt;Institutional investors aren't selling\n\nTSLA's institutional investor base consists of large passive funds such as funds tracking the S&amp;P500 (which recently added TSLA) to more active hedge funds specializing in innovation and growth. Passive funds increase the buying pressure of TSLA while adding minimal selling pressure. Today, the majority of the workforce regularly contributes their salary to passive funds for retirement and said funds are unlikely to trim their holdings of a stock unless during an infrequent rebalancing event. The active funds that remain invested in TSLA tend to have celestial expectations for the company and are also unlikely to sell at this valuation. For example, billionaire fund manager Ron Baron believes that Tesla, currently at a $659 billion market cap, should be a $2 trillion dollar company. Another major fund manager, Cathie Wood, gives TSLA a 2024 price target of $7,000. Assuming minimal changes in total float, that equates to almost a $7 trillion dollar market cap!\n\nSo TSLA's institutional investor base are hardly sellers of TSLA and still believe there is significant room for the stock to run despite its incredible 2020 performance.\n\n&gt;Retail investors aren't selling\n\nWhat about TSLA's retail investor base? This question is easily answered. Over the years, TSLA has built a diehard fanbase that has equally high, if not higher, expectations of the company than some of the institutional investors. Some people believe the company's CEO, Elon Musk, has developed a cult-of-personality. Tesla's cult-like fanbase manifests online as a large number of YouTube channels and online forums dedicated to the company, and in a broader sense, Elon Musk. For example, the main Tesla subreddit, r/ teslamotors, has more than 901,000 subscribers at the time of writing.\n\n&gt;Insiders aren't selling\n\nOf the remaining 20% of TSLA stock, the majority is held by Elon Musk and he's certainly not eager to sell noticeable quantities of his holdings given the ensuing bad PR.\n\nSo if investors are hesitant to sell TSLA, TSLA is bound to appreciate aggressively every time there's good news and appreciate slowly in the absence of news as passive funds and its ardent fanbase continue to buy in. In other words, TSLA is a heavily news-driven stock with a heavy bias for upside.\n\nThis is exactly what we saw in 2020. TSLA entered the year having solved its Model 3 production problems while managing to maintain solvent. This act alone unceremoniously discarded a dark cloud over the company on whether it'll manage to produce cars at scale before its heavy debt-burden catches up with the company's treasury. With that, the path was clear for a string of good news to catapult the stock to grandiose heights. They included the opening of the Shanghai factory, the 5-for-1 stock split, the S&amp;P500 inclusion, and record sales and deliveries in the third quarter. Even good news from the tangentially-related company SpaceX, who Elon Musk is also the CEO of, has been positive for TSLA.\n\n# The Plan and Headwinds\n\nTesla will enter 2021 with boosted by tailwinds from its 2020 success. If Tesla maintains its current pace of execution, ceteris paribus (fancy business major speak for \"all other things being equal\"), its stock price is expected to continue to appreciate and befuddle its critics. Tesla is finally able to produce Model 3's at scale, has a foothold in the Chinese market, and is readying to launch the Cybertruck to a red-hot North American pickup truck market. In addition, like Pavlov's dogs, 2020 has conditioned investors to not bet against TSLA with the stock shrugging off multiple negative news events like the COVID-19 pandemic, the expected post-S&amp;P500 inclusion sell-off (which never happened), and the Apple EV announcement.\n\n**In 2021, it's recommended to continue to avoid shorting Tesla, no matter how tempting.**\n\nWith that said, there are significant headwinds facing Tesla that any long positions should be aware of. Tesla currently has an 81.66% market share of the US EV market. The biggest risk going into 2021 and beyond is the significant ramp up in EV and battery technology competition from legacy auto manufacturers. Tesla's stock price has only emboldened the executive teams of these companies to pour significant resources into their EV businesses. GM, Volkswagen, and Ford are leading the pack. GM has invested $27 billion into its EV business and is planning to launch 30 EVs by 2025. Two EVs have already been announced: the Cadillac Lyriq and the Hummer EV, with both receiving an overwhelmingly positive public response. GM has also developed an in-house battery technology called Ultium that's the central pillar for its 2025 plan. A step above GM, Volkswagen is investing $41 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 70 EVs by 2030. It's also aggressively investing in battery technology. For example, Volkswagen has a large stake in QuantumScape, a company that claims to be developing a revolutionary solid-state battery technology. Last but not least, Ford is investing $11 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 40 EVs by 2022. Deliveries of its flagship EV, the well-received Mustang Mach-E, is already underway. An honorable mention goes to Apple, which plans to start production of its own EV in 2024.\n\nIf TSLA is a news-driven stock, a growing string of negative news about the company's shrinking North American and European market share should apply downward pressure on price. The worry is that investors are so exuberant about the stock's stellar 2020 performance that the effects of emergent, serious competition from legacy auto manufacturers are heavily discounted.\n\n**In 2021, although it remains very bullish for TSLA going into the first half of the year, it's recommended to avoid aggressively starting or adding more to an existing position in the latter half of the year. This is when the rate of competing EV products entering the North American and European markets is expected to accelerate. Prudent investors should watch how the public reacts to this large structural EV market change before making any moves.**\n\nI wrote about stock market DD here: [FinanceTLDR blog](https://www.financetldr.com)",

        "selftext": "This is my first DD so I hope it goes well.\n\nCC Neuberger Principal Holdings I (PCPL) has an agreement to merge with E2OPEN.\n\n**What is E2OPEN?**: E2OPEN is a cloud-based, artificial intelligence, on-demand SaaS platform company. E2OPEN is the largest cloud-based provider of networked supply chain applications. More than 70,000 partner companies and 200,000 users, many of the biggest companies in the world use the E2OPEN network today.\n\n**Who are E2OPEN's customers?**: Some of their customers include Google, Facebook, AMD, Nvidia, Intel, HP, IBM etc. [Complete list taken from the investor presentation.](https://i.imgur.com/FfcVX7o.png)\n\n**Who is leading the SPAC?**: The founder &amp; CEO of PLPC is Chinh Chu. A billionaire with 30+ years of investment experience, including 25 years at [Blackstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blackstone_Group). He has created 3 SPACs since 2016. The first SPAC, CF Corp, raised $1.2 billion and successfully merged with Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Life. The second SPAC, Collier Creek Holdings, raised $475 million and successfully merged with a company in the consumer sector. And now we have his most recent, third SPAC, PCPL. It has raised $414 million and will merge with E2OPEN. This man was also in charge of taking Dun &amp; Bradstreet private in a large $7.2 billion deal. Before joining Blackstone in 1990, this man also worked in the Mergers &amp; Acquisitions Deparment at Salomon Brothers. His experience is undeniable. \n\n**Backstory**: E2OPEN used to be a public company. Their stock price went as high as $28. They were bought by a private company and were taken off the market in 2015. Ever since they were taken private, E2OPEN was able to grow from $80M in revenue 5 years ago to $335M in 2020. They have acquired a handful of companies and continue to do so. E2OPEN's revenue is about four times what it was in 2015. The percent of revenue that is subscription-based, which is always a key metric for a SaaS company, was 80% in fiscal 2020 and is expected to grow in 2021. It also stands to benefit as companies automate their supply chains further in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**The potential negatives:** Their estimated revenue for next year is about +10%. There was an additional funding from instutions through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) of $175M which will be used to pay down existing debt. E2OPEN traded publicly before they were acquired by another company. Their stock price went as high as $28 but also went as low as $8. They were then acquired by Insight Venture Partners and have grown since. \n\n**The Merger**: SPAC shareholders will own 20% of the shares. The merger has a valuation of $2.57B. Upon closing of the transaction with E2OPEN, the ticker will change from 'PCPL' to 'ETWO'.\n\n**TL:DR:** A cloud-based SaaS platform company with customers from some of the biggest corporations in the world today, has a definitive agreement to merge with 'PCPL'. PCPL is run by a billionaire with an unbelievable resume that has already had two previous successful SPAC mergers and this is his third SPAC. The company's revenue has grown massively and their revenue today is about four times higher than it was in 2015. The percent of their revenue that is subscription-based is 80% and is expected to grow in the future. \n\n**Disclaimer:** I own 420 shares of PCPL. Invest at your own risk. As of this writing the price of PCPL is **$10,84.**",

The fundamental reason is that the extrinsic value is identical. \n\nSince everyone is following PLTR these days, let's use it as an example:  \n\n\\-----------------------\n\nSelling a $22 put = Buying 100 shares and selling a call at $22 (OTM CSP = ITM CC)\n\nBuying 100 shares and selling a call at $30 = Selling a $30 put at $30 (OTM CC = ITM CSP)\n\nGetting assigned a cash-secured put at $25, then selling a covered call at $25 = Rolling the $25 put out in time (CSP assignment, then selling a CC = put calendar) \n\nGetting assigned your covered call at $20, then selling a cash-secured put at $20 = Rolling the $20 call out in time (CC assignment, then selling a CSP = call calendar) \n\nBuying 100 shares and buying a put at $25 = Buying a call at $25 (Married put = Call) \n\nShorting 100 shares and buying a call at $25 = Buying a put at $25 (Married call = Put)\n\nBuying 100 shares, buying ATM put, selling OTM call = Buying ATM call, selling OTM call (Collar = Call debit spread) \n\nBuying 100 shares = selling a put, buying a call at the same strike (100 shares = Short put + long call) \n\n\\----------------------\n\nIn practice, these equivalencies have important caveats/exceptions\n\n\\- ITM options are less liquid\n\n\\- In normal skew situations, OTM puts are slightly more expensive than the ITM calls, benefitting put sellers\n\n\\- In reverse skew situations (highly specutive stocks), OTM calls are more expensive than the ITM put, benefitting call sellers\n\n\\- If a stock is hard to short, puts are more expensive across all strikes, benefitting put sellers\n\n\\- Some positions require more buying power then the equivalent position\n\n\\- Holding stock gives you dividends \n\n\\- Holding short calls elevates early assignment risk due to dividends \n\n\\- The more legs a trade has, the harder it is to fill\n\n\\----------------------\n\nExperienced traders - did I make any mistakes?

R. R. Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien)'s [Middle-earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth) [legendarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolkien%27s_legendarium). A *palant\u00edr* (from [Quenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya) *palan*, 'far; *tir*, 'watch over'[\\[T 1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palant%C3%ADr#cite_note-1)) is described as an indestructible [ball of crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_ball), used for communication and to see events in other parts of [Arda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arda_(Middle-earth)), whether past or future.' - Is this what Palantir will do in the future? See the past or future with their powerful programmes?\n\nMithril:\n\nThe scholar of English literature Charles A. Huttar writes that *mithril* was the only mineral that Tolkien invented. He notes that in Tolkien's underworld, whether the [caves at Helm's Deep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glittering_Caves_of_Aglarond) or the mines of Moria, \"beauty and terror \\[were\\] side by side\".[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithril#cite_note-Huttar_1975-12) Greed for *mithril* could unleash the terror of the [Balrog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balrog), by digging too far down into the dark realm, but at the same time, he writes, the metal was prized for both its beauty and its usefulness, yielding the best armour. He compares the Dwarves' greed for *mithril* with that of the Barrow-wights for treasure, and indeed that of the [dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon) in [*The Hobbit*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit) and [*Beowulf*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf) for gold. In his view, these symbolise the evil \"inherent in the mineral treasures hidden in the womb of Earth\",[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithril#cite_note-Huttar_1975-12) just as mining and metalwork are associated with [Satan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan) in [John Milton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton)'s [*Paradise Lost*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost) (I, 670-751). Huttar sums up with a reflection on Tolkien's moral vision in the story: just as the characters at every point have to decide for good or ill, so objects have the potential to be both good and evil: \"Mithril is both the greatest of treasures and a deadly bane. \n\nDoes Peter Thiel actually use the names that have meanings behind them on what the company is going to achieve or is it just some cool names chosen from the LOTR universe?\n\nAs we can see Mithril can be used for good and ill, will that be the case with Palantir? If it gets in the wrongs hands could that bring a deadly bane or if it gets into the good hands could that bring the greatest treasure?\n\nDoes that basically mean I am too retarded or are we going to the moon on this rocket  \ud83d\ude80 ?",

        "selftext": "Amazing to see this ticker still brought up on this thread at times. Let\u2019s dive into the countless red flags this company has produced in the last several months.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Bruce Bernstein. Currently on the board of directors for XSPA. Many allegations brought against him for fraud relating to the company.\n\nBernstein securities fraud [Bruce securities fraud case ](https://www.teribuhl.com/2019/03/11/ny-journalist-wins-lawsuit-to-unseal-court-docs-tied-to-bruce-bernstein-securities-fraud-case-xspa/)\n\n[SEC violations ](https://www.teribuhl.com/2018/09/19/rockmore-capitals-bruce-bernstein-ex-wife-outs-him-for-possible-sec-violations-in-xspa-deal/)\n\n[More allegations](https://www.scribd.com/document/408580774/Rockmore-Capital-Bruce-Bernstein-TRO-in-XpresSpa-fraud-suit-April-29-2019)\n\nReverse splits: XSPA performed a R/S in February of 2019, and June of 2020. That\u2019s right, two within two years. The recent R/S has watched their stock bleed from near $7-$8 levels, to the current SP of $1.23. A constant 6 months downtrend. 9.8/10 reverse splits NEVER work out for the companies performing them. \n\nBlatant lies from the CEO: Not going to touch on all of them since there\u2019s been so many. CEO stated in August there was no need for more offerings unless they \u201cwent gangbusters\u201d. 4 days later they issued a direct offering. Headed into 2021 they have 5 locations up and running. Gangbusters no doubt.\n\nHe then stated there was no need for another offering for 2020. What happened 2 weeks ago. You guessed it, another offering! They released their 8K announcing their partnership with United airlines (which by the way is only for flights heading to Hawaii and nothing more). Another offering after a $0.30 pop in SP. Shows you exactly how confident they are in their new business venture.\n\nWarrants: There are warrants at $5.25, $3.02, and now $1.70. After each offering the SP has never crossed the warrants exercisable price. Not once. For the higher warrants, the institutions likely dumped their shares at break even and shorted on the way down, using the warrants as their hedge. So much warrant saturation.\n\nShares remaining: Around 2 million shares remain to be distributed. Means not enough shares for offerings. They will likely have to vote on adding more shares to the float, thus diluting even more. What would happen after? Likely another R/S. Their third in 3 consecutive years. \n\nRevenue model: XSPA is paid strictly as a landlord. They do not make money per test administered. The MSA agreement was necessary since they aren\u2019t in the medical field. \n\nReporting revenue: XSPA cannot report their revenue until they have 2-3 (sometimes 4) consecutive quarters of contract income due to GAAP laws. This means they will not be able to report their income earned from testing next quarter. \n\nSabby/ intracoastel: There\u2019s no denying they have shorted this into oblivion. With no revenue to report in makes it an easy target. Many have suggested their recent buy in was \u201cfor the ride up\u201d what ride would that be? \n\nThe Spa business: Their spas failed to turn a profit for 63 straight consecutive quarters. Doing roughly 40-45 million per year in revenue. Let\u2019s assume for their new testing venture, they\u2019re paid 1 million in MSA fees per testing site. Right now that would be 5 million per quarter, 20 million per year. Far less then the failing spas were generating. \n\nI see people on here and Stocktwits holding out hope. If you\u2019re holding in the $3\u2019s, $4\u2019s, $5\u2019s and hell even $6\u2019s which I\u2019ve sadly seen. Please cut your losses. High $1\u2019s to mid $2\u2019s you could possibly break even on the random spike that happens to many penny stocks. Only saving grace would be for testing to be mandated before boarding any airplane regardless of destination.",

        "selftext": "In 2020, there was clearly a large divergence in the performance of different classes of REITs after COVID-19 hit.\n\n**Industrial REITs:** these recovered well after COVID hit, as industrial workplaces reopened and there was actually an increase in demand for warehouses and logistics facilities, to support e-commerce.  For example, from Jan 1 to Dec 31:\n\n* Granite (GRT) is up 18% \n* Summit Industrial (SMU) is up 13%\n* Dream Industrial (DIR) had no change\n* WPT Industrial (WIR) is down 3%\n\n**Residential REITs**: these are down from where they started 2020, but recovered most of their value.  In some places, occupancy rates dropped as workplaces and universities went online and as people lost jobs, causing some to move in with family to save on rent, while others accelerated plans to become homeowners to have more space to work from home. For example, from Jan 1 to Dec 31:\n\n* Canadian Apartments (CAR) is down 6%,\n* Killam (KMP) is down 10%\n* Minto (MI) is down 12%\n* InterRent (IIP) is down 12%\n* Boardwalk (BEI) is down 27%\n\n**Retail REITS**: these were often harder hit, as retail businesses saw reduced foot traffic, due to lockdowns, capacity limits, and people staying home to avoid exposure to the virus. E-commerce and deliveries surged as an alternative to in-person shopping, and it's not clear what the long-term impacts will be on brick-and-mortar stores.  For example, from Jan 1 to Dec 31:\n\n* Canadian Tire (CRT) is down 3%\n* Choice Properties (CHP) is down 6%\n* Slate Grocery (SGR) is down 14%\n* Plaza (PLZ) is down 21%\n* SmartCentres (SRU) is down 26%\n* RioCan (REI) is down 37%\n\n**Office REITS**: these seem to have been hit the hardest.  Many office-based workplaces sent their employees home to work remotely, and there are questions about whether that trend will persist, and whether companies will choose to cut back on their office space in the future, for the cost savings.  For example, from Jan 1 to Dec 31:\n\n* True North Commerical (TNT) is down 13%\n* Allied Properties (AP) is down 27%\n* Slate Office (SOT) is down 29%\n* Dream Office (D) is down 36%\n\nSo with all of that in mind, my question is: which category of REIT will perform best in 2021, in terms of rise or fall in share price?\n\nAnd as a bonus question: which individual REIT do you think will perform best in 2021?

Open and read these points before every trade you make.\n\n2. Buy options that are no less than 4 weeks from expiring. Ideally, they would have at least 8 weeks until expiration or longer.\n\n3. Buy calls or puts at the money or close to it. \n\n4. STOP JUMPING INTO STOCKS THAT YOU HAVE NOT MONITORED FOR AT LEAST 1-2 WEEKS.\n\na. This will give you an idea of what the stock is doing and the type of price action you are stepping into. \n\nb. If you miss out before entry, move on to another stock. They are plenty of stocks in the sea. \n\n5. Remember past events or trade outcomes will not determine how a new trade works out. If the stock is not going in the direction you thought it would GET OUT! Do not waste time wondering why and or going against what the price action is saying or doing. \n\n6. As much as you can, remove your emotions. Become a robot when it comes to trading. \n\n7. STOP CHASING THE MONEY YOU HAVE LOST!!!!!!!\n\n8. STOP ALLOWING YOURSELF TO HAVE DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR. Its okay to dream just not in stock trading. Take profits when you can. It is okay if you make 5-10% in a trade before pulling the trigger. Not every trade will turn out to be 100% or 1000% return. \n\n9. Pay attention when Cramer pounds the table about a stock. Buy long dated Calls.\n\n10. YOU NEED VOLUME for a stock to move. If the Volume is not there, move on or check again later.",

The company's cloud computing segment generates revenue from enterprise customers based on the duration and specific usage of the services.\u201d This is the fastest growing segment of their business, reaching a 60% YoY revenue growth \n\n**Entertainment:** it\u2019s a small part of their business and generates subscription-based revenue (8% YoY revenue growth)\n\nIn Q3 2020, 84% of their revenue can be attributed to commerce and the other 16% to cloud/entertainment/innovation initiatives and others (10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively)\n\nBeing such a large company, they touch many sectors, lots of which are expected to keep growing quickly in the future.\n\n**Management**\n\nWould love to hear your input on this one (i.e. I'm too lazy to look into the decisions they make and I don't know how I feel about Jack Ma)\n\n**Competition**\n\nTheir main competitor is Amazon, but other ones include eBay and Tencent holdings (the latter a Chinese tech company). Alibaba is very dominant in the Asian e-commerce markets. \n\n**Recent concerns**\n\nAt the time of this writing, the stock is down almost 27% from its late-October peak, a drop in price attributed to a recent antitrust investigation launched by the Chinese government for monopolistic behavior by essentially forcing sellers to chose only a single e-commerce platform. Additionally, Ant Group (their fintech sister company) had been denied an IPO a while back and keeps getting scrutiny from the government. The main risk here for Alibaba might be that they\u2019re forced to divest some parts of their business. Personally, I think monopolistic concerns could keep emerging in the future as the company keeps growing however, I believe that despite these concerns, they can still strive as a business. There's plenty of YouTube videos and financial articles that cover this so I recommend those for more details.\n\n**Quantitative assessment (USD)**\n\nMarket cap: $650B \n\nQ3 2020 revenue: $22,8M (up 30% YoY, with forward projected growth of 36%)\n\nA few metrics stacked up against competitors (for the readers interpretation):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xte5e455qq861.png?width=1357&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c1eb19bda6e576e1a2c8675fd7ca35f55a7baec\n\nThe recent drop in share price has BABA trading at a discount compared to its main competitor amazon. Growing revenues in all aspects of their business mentioned above is encouraging to see as well. \n\nAlibaba seems to offer great value in an expensive tech market (especially considering the low PE ratio despite growing their revenues pretty fast), the main question is: are the risks of Chinese government regulations that can be imposed on the company worth the opportunity? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI skimmed through the company pretty quickly and there's plenty of details in their fundamental business that I didn't talk about, I just tried to give a big picture view. I recommend also doing your own research on the risks with this company since government investigations seem complex and there's other risks such as the fact that you're actually buying a holding company legally domiciled in the Cayman Islands.  \n\n That Investopedia article I referred to: [How Alibaba Makes Money: core e-commerce, cloud computing, digital media and entertainment (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/121714/how-does-alibaba-make-money-simple-guide.asp) \n\nAlibaba q3 results presentation:  [Alibaba Group September Quarter 2020 Results](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/ir/presentations/pre201105.pdf) \n\nActual q3 financial results pdf: [Microsoft Word - Alibaba Group Announces September Quarter 2020 Results\\_vF](https://alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p201105.pdf) \n\nI would love to hear your thoughts on Alibaba\n\nAlso, happy new year!",

        "selftext": "Happy New Year everyone. Some of us would have had great year this year in the market and some not. However, we can all take the lessons learnt into this year to become better traders/investors.\n\nI didn't actually start until 2 months ago, and thanks to this community, I was able to pick a few winners (although had to sieve through a bunch of p&amp;ds and making mistakes along the way). Below are somethings I learnt (all circumstantial and isn't always the case) and hope it helps some of you. Feel free to disagree wit any of them and let me know what some of ur lessons learnt are!\n\n1) Gap ups at open are usually followed by sharp drops before stabilising. Depending on your style of trading this is a great way for you to flip. But for me, the opening 5 to 10 minutes is most often too volatile to make decisions. When I first begun, I used to see a company I like, see a massive spike up, try to follow the train, only to get burnt buying near the top before the inevitable drop a few minutes after.\n\n2) its fine to take profits even if it means missing out on more gains if that stock continues to skyrocket. This depends on your amount of DD and trust in what you put money in. Prime example for me was BNGO. Avg at 0.7, sold at 0.8. Sure if I've held, could have made much more, but in that time, I was able to use my profits to make even more on other stocks. I couldn't have know it would have continued to rocket. Another strategy is just put a stop loss, and let it ride.\n\n3) if you are lucky to have one of your investments return over 100% (which I think it's actually quite common with penny stocks although I might be naive in this thinking), it's safer to take out the initial investment and just let the profit ride. But if you really know and trust your investment, then the risk of leaving your initial investment is worth it. Prime example for me was ABML, hit 100% quite early but took out initial investment, looking back, I would have let it all ride out.\n\n4) There are some absolute gems of DDs in here by high level contributors (you know who you are) and this is my own personal opinion. If you are already seeing multiple posts about the same ticker flooding the page already, it's probably had its run. Sure, it might have more room to run and you can risk it and jump on a moving train. But for me, the most effective strategy has been looking at tickers mentions which are still relatively less hyped. This way I can get on and know that once it starts running, I can ride out the up and downs, because my average is so low. The problem with jumping on the moving trains are that, those with the low averages will keep trying to pump it, knowing they can survive the few intra or multiple day dumps, but for you guys who are asking for example if it's time to still jump in things like BNGO or CUVO, after it's already run a few multiple 100% days, you have to do it accepting you are taking a massive risk. Again, this isn't always the case. E.g ALPP, most people were scared to jump in at like 0.5 or 0.6 etc because it was already running like crazy, so they were waiting for a dip that never really came. This again goes back to trusting ur instincts about the company and do some DD.\n\n5) If you have faith in a company and a strategy, trust it even when there are massive dips. Over the last few days, ALPP has taking some beatings (still minor compared to how much it has run). When I first started, I would get scared at the slightest drops, and if I have seen how much ALPP can drop when it decides to dip, I would have been shitting bricks. What I learnt was patience can sometimes pay off. Massive dips are usually followed by people picking shares up at a discount. Although it might not go all the way back up to what it was at open, selling during a dip has always worked out bad for me. What I do now is wait until the dip is over and let people push it back up and stabilise before I make a decision. Having said that, if I had no faith in the company and was only in it for a quick buck, I would just sell as it starts to drop and take my profits. \n\nThat's it for now and would love to hear your lessons learnt and what you hope the achieve in 2021. For me is to actually learn how to read the charts, and know how to analyse fundamentals. But currently I don't feel the necessasity, especially with fundamentals, I think (maybe naively again) the markets are currently being more sensitive to hype and PR more than the actual fundamentals. For chart reading wise, I don't know any of the actual technicals but just been learning my own patterns I see through experience and being burnt.\n\nGood luck with your 2021!",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone Happy New year! This Doesn't look like I'm breaking any of the forum rules. I'm interested in sharing info in the motley fools Stock advisor and Rulebreakers stocks. I don't have enough capital to really benefit from having 3 of their services, so I figured there might be some other folks on the same boat. If it makes it easier, I'm willing to buy a new service and add it to my account and then split the cost of the service with you and then share the account but I understand that some people might not feel comfortable with that. Otherwise we can share some of their picks via Google drive links or whatsoever. I know the risks of doing this but I'm ok gambling with it.\n\nAnyhow I got the Everlasting stock service for 2 years ($99) and If anyone wants to split the other services I can get them for $45 for the stock advisor and $99 for the Rulebreakers. I get random discount emails for Stock advisor at $45 but I know I can get it for 99$ reliably for a year. I only feel comfortable sharing with 3-4 other people but I doubt there will be enough interest. If I get 3-4 people on this we can split all 3 services at a maximum $100-$75 each which is better than spending $300 individually.  Otherwise just sharing their picks sounds good to me!\n\nCheers!",

I have to contribute by law, but consider it a tax as I have no faith in it. My SO has about 100k usd in his pension fund, but as a gov employee does not have to contribute. His fund is better managed with small returns.\n\nI have life insurance, (whole, term and critical illness) combined at 360k usd.

At that point the election is in dispute and it falls to the House of Representatives to elect the President. Interestingly in this election each State delegation gets 1 vote - California gets one vote and so does South Dakota. Republicans control 26 of the State delegations in the current Cingress and 27 in the incoming Congress.\n\nSo TLDR If Biden dies before Jan 5, Trump can get elected President.\n\nIf Democrats win the Senate, we have a Trump Presidency with a Democrat house and Senate. \n\nGreat for stocks as the 2000 dollar checks get passed.",

I am willing to spend some time researching and like the bit more control over my asset allocation.\n\nHowever, it is a hassle not being able to set up automatic payments on etfs like I can on mutual fund or target day fund.\n\nI am currently  thinking of doing a hybrid to get the best of both worlds (half of money in target day fund, half in my own mutual fund choices, I.e. Sp 500, schwab 1000, bond index, real estate)..... Is this a good idea?",

        "selftext": "Trying to learn here, so I don\u2019t lose a bunch of money. \n\nI have a couple SPY leaps, that I was thinking about running a diagonal debit spread with. Two are 22 JAN 345C and one is 22 MAR 355C, so they\u2019re both well ITM (right? Would you consider that deep ITM?). So I\u2019m thinking about selling something like a mid FEB 385/390 C against each and collect the $2-300 premium on each, then roll them forward each month, and do it again. \n\nSeems to me I can collect $6-900 a month to lower the cost basis of my LEAPS/ earn a little income. \n\nAm I understanding this process right? \n\nAny recommendations on good videos/ articles on this play? I\u2019m having a hard time finding good videos that I feel I can trust. Every one is full of SmaSH tHAt SuBscRIBe BuTtOn, BRO! \n\nIf I understand correctly, most of my risk comes from having to buy back the contracts I sold, if they are about to go ITM when I need to roll them. OR if things tank big time and I want to exit my LEAPs, I have to buy back the sold contracts before I can sell the LEAPS, right? \n\nI wanted to try this method in a less risky position for myself before I used my expensive SPY leaps, so I sold a call against a $JETS 22 JAN $20 C, for like $40 with an expiration of early FEB, just to see what happens with it. I\u2019ll watch it for the month to get an idea of what happens, and hopefully combine that experience with any responses to this/ learning resources you guys recommend. \n\nThanks for any help and ideas.",

        "selftext": "So with LCA -&gt; GNOG in particular I remember back in the summer months there was talks about how Tilman wouldn\u2019t actually be able to talk about golden nugget due to the SEC imposed quiet period. And when I looked up the quiet period, it said that you can\u2019t hype up a stock until 40 days after it has began trading. \n\nSo would that mean that GNOG and other newly merged stocks aren\u2019t allowed to try to advertise heavily until 40 days after they merge? I think it would help us all develop a trading strategy knowing how this works. So if the quiet period means 40 days after the merger, it could make a lot of sense to start investing in companies a month after the merger dip to see quick money. \n\nIf someone could help me understand this, I will love you forever.
