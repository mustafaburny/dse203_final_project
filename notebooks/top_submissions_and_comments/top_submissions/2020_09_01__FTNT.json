        "selftext": "So I jumped in the market early this year. I've started with some ETFs and then moved to some growth and dividend stocks of companies or industries I'm interested in or knowledgeable about.

        "selftext": "Not sure when all the casual people will catch on, but Intel's big announcement(which was a shitty window dressed marketing power point presentation) came off as insecure, petty, and scared.  They mentioned AMDs name like 37 times, used the words \"our competitors\" 17 times, and called AMD \"imitators\"\n\nThey claimed to be above benchmarks because \"benchmarks dont show real world application\" and then proceeded to use a bunch of their own benchmarks in a real shady way...a bunch of misleading versions of their own benchmarks vs a rivals laptop they gimped up.\n\nFirst, they kept claiming the AMD they used was their \"top\" one, when there are 4 skus AMD makes better and they used a lower watt version. They cut the ram down by 20% on the AMD they tested just because too.\n\nIntel put this disclaimer on their site\n \n\" Software and workloads used in performance tests may have been optimized for performance only on Intel\u00ae microprocessors.\"\n\nYeah dude, and my PS4 runs a lot faster than Xbox One  I poured beer on, placed a bunch of magnets on, and then hit with a hammer a bunch of times. 3x faster, 2.77 more efficiency, 300% better vs the xbox I measured all the features as a vague 1.0.\n\n\nNVIDIA when they did their announcement never mentioned their rivals once. The benchmarks they showed were comparing their other products to the new one.\n\n Intel is scared. AMD, ARM, NVIDIA, AWS, are coming for big chunks of markets Intel gets its $$$$ from and their idea is to do the equivalent of \"alternate facts\" while coming off like someone obsessed with their ex.\n\nNow no one can predict the exact time all  the common people will see through Intel's bullshit, so I cant give you an exact date for you to do an FD on. Im very bullish and long on AMD.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are a couple things Intel's new thing(they cant even get their name right because all their shit is like the IG48800UX+ or the IS4800UGX or some alien shit) does well...you just have to go out of your way to find those things because Intel is too busy trash talking AMD and running their own sketchy benchmarks (while saying benchmarks are unrealistic in the same breath) instead of promoting these things as much as they should. Maybe also give your stuff names your own people can remember instead of naming it like two Star Wars droids combined into one? Cant wait for the Juno Lake IG88C3PO+ desktop with chips the size of a toaster.",

        "selftext": "I will start off my discsussion using a couple of examples where investors/analysts missed the big picture and the company/stock has proven that they're much more than that.\n\n**Microsoft**\n\n\nIn July 2013, Microsoft stock had the biggest drop of the century after reporting their earnings. The stock dropped because of investors disappointment in the Surface RT laptop. They ignored the biggest elephant in the room that is Windows Azure, now known as Microsoft Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing division and it has been the major growth driver for Microsoft. Of course, the CEO change from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella helped but Satya's vision was all about cloud computing and it was completely ignored by investors at that time. \n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2013/07/19/as-shares-fall-12-percent-microsoft-experiences-its-biggest-drop-since-2000/\n\n**Apple**\n\nBack in 2018, investors/analysts were focusing on iPhone X sales figures. Warren Buffett saw the big picture. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said long-term investors of Apple\u2019s stock shouldn\u2019t obsess with near-term iPhone sales. \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going to spend loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X are going to be sold in a three-month period totally misses the point,\u201d he stated. His big picture was looking at Apple as a brand and its ecosystem\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/30/warren-buffett-says-he-bought-just-a-little-more-apple-recently.html\n\nLook at where Microsoft and Apple stocks were then and where they are trading at now.\n\n\n**Intel**\n\nI'd like to use the same logic for Intel. It dropped 20% after the earnings call last quarter in July. The big picture  Intel's Investors/analysts are  missing is that they are ignoring this industry leader\u2019s methodical transition into higher growth businesses and focusing solely on solvable supply chain problems ( 10 nm/7 nm transistor density issues). I will not be discussing the fact that AMD/NVidia are using 7 nm process and that Intel isn't. Also, the fact that TSMC will be on 5 nm by the time Intel fixes the 10 nm/7 nm node problems. Those are problems I'm well aware of and they have been beaten to death already. There is nothing I can add to that. I will talk about that later on but in the end as not the focal points. What I'd like to talk about and focus on is the data-centric transformation and its MobilEye division.\n\n\n**Data Centric Transformation**\n\nIntel in 2019 pivoted from being a PC centric business to a data centric business. The TAM of this is 250 billion dollars. Revenue in this business group has grown from 42% of revenue in 2015 to 51% of revenue over the TTM. While many business transitions result in periods of low performance, as firms switch focus from declining to new businesses, Intel has managed to grow its revenue by 12% compounded annually over the past four years as it better positions itself for future growth.\n\nhttps://channelbuzz.ca/2019/04/intel-emphasizes-data-centric-transformation-of-company-at-new-xeon-launch-30025/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\n**Self driving business**\n\nIntel purchased MobilEye in 2015. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel . Mobileye has a plan to dominate self-driving. Self driving taxis and cars are a big growth business. MobilEye is in a great position to capitalize on this business. Mobileye says it shipped 17.4 million systems last year. Today, over 40 million cars have Mobileye technology installed, and its products have been selected for implementation in serial production of 313 car models from our 27 OEM partners by 2017 (compared to 36 car models across seven OEMs in 2010). Some of the partners include Volkswagen, BMW, Nissan, Ford. It also has partnered with NIO, a Chinese EV company which people have dubbed the Chinese Tesla.\n\nThe firm\u2019s acquisition of Mobileye strategically positions it to build out its driverless technology business as well. In just three years, Mobileye has experienced rapid growth, with revenue increasing from $210 million in 2017 to $879 million in 2019. Its share of automobile semiconductor sales increased from just 0.5% to 1.9% over the same time. If Mobileye continues taking market share in this fast-growing segment, Mobileye\u2019s could provide a meaningful contribution to Intel\u2019s operations, as it made up just over 1% of revenue in 2019. ResearchAndMarkets.com expects the autonomous/driverless market to grow 18% compounded annually from 2020 to 2025. Intel is positioned to grow with this new market.\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/ford-expands-partnership-with-mobileye-intels-autonomous-driving-business/\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18039216/volkswagen-intel-mobileye-self-driving-ride-hailing-israel-2019\n\nhttps://newsroom.intel.com/news/mobileye-nio-partner-bring-level-4-autonomous-vehicles-consumers-china-beyond/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\nhttps://www.engadget.com/mobileye-testing-autonomous-cars-germany-104521486.html\n\n\n**PC Business**\n\nThis is the side of Intel most people immediately associate Intel with. Intel\u2019s PC-centric business is not something to write-off. There is still a piece of the PC-centric market where Intel has an opportunity to grow: graphics processing units (GPU). Allied Market Research, expects the GPU market to grow from $19.8 billion in 2019 to nearly $201 billion in 2027 or by 34% compounded annually. For example, Intel is aggressively entering the discreet GPU business, which is about 80% of the current GPU market. The iGPU processors codenamed Tiger Lake just released September 2nd. Intel poached AMD's GPU guy Raja Koduri and nVidia's Tom Peterson. Intel hired engineers and marketing experts from Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA, the market leader in the space, to assemble a team to develop and rollout the firm\u2019s Intel Xe GPU.\n\nIntel is also releasing entry level processors. The entry-level processors will be targeted at budget-tier laptops and fanless mini desktops when they launch in early 2021. \n\nhttps://www.nextplatform.com/2020/09/02/intel-puts-its-xe-gpu-stakes-in-the-ground/\nhttps://wccftech.com/intel-jasper-lake-10nm-tremont-atom-cpus-leak-pentium-celeron-skus-2021/\n\n\n**7 nm/10 nm process**\n\nSince I have your attention until here - I'd like to say one final thing about this debacle. Lot of people assume that Intel's problems with this are due to complacency. Its not. Its due to Intel attempting to achieve and do something others have been unable to do, which is the exact opposite of complacency. Intel tried to use GAAFET for 7 nm when TSMC and Samsung warned Intel not to.  Intel was warned by TSMC and Samsung that the GAA-FET technique is too challenging to implement at this point in time, but Intel\u2019s pride and persistence led it to stubbornly try and tackle the GAA-FET problem, until it finally conceded this July.\n\nI agree Intel fucked up here but the point I'm trying to make is that this was not due to complacency as widely believed. Intel has a lot of management problems, hostile work environment etc but complacency is not one of them.  Intel never got complacent about its objectives, but it may have gotten complacent about its approaches, methods, and processes.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/i8qrx4/intel_exemployee_reveals_insider_details_on/\nhttps://www.dvhardware.net/article73530.html\n\n\n**Tl/DR; Post Summary / Post Script** : \n\nI'm perfecty aware that AMD and nVidia are eating Intel's lunch and have better more powerful CPUs/GPUs. However, Intel is much more than that and its other divisions are what will drive future growth. Analysts and investors are missing this big picture.",

Back in March after the COVID stock market crash I had $20K on the side and thought it was a good time to invest. \n\nThe problem was I had no experience in how to invest, I thought I should just pick a couple stocks I like, mostly tech stuff like Tesla, Intel, Apple and Microsoft and just put my $20K into those.\n\nAnyway, since I was new to investing and was scared of the whole COVID situation I used my bank's premium financial advice service and they convinced me to stay away from single stocks due to increased risk and volatility and invest into a diverse Mutual Funds portfolio instead in order to limit my risk during these uncertain times.\n\nSo being the fucking newbie I was, I agreed and invested all my $20k into 8 different ETFs, from Europe, Emerging Asia, Japan, Low Carbon to useless shit like LATAM.\n\nDuring all those months since March I'm just witnessing the stocks I originaly wanted to invest skyrocket to stupid values while my \"diverse mutual funds portfolio\" staying stale and even losing money in 3 out of 8 ETFs i invested in.\n\nIn a few words, if I just did what I felt like doing I would have at least doubled my money and instead I ended up following the \"expert's\" advice and barely made any profit so far.",

        "selftext": "Back in July, Barron\u2019s ran a story profiling the rise of Nvidia (NVDA) as the company moved past Intel (INTC) in market cap to become the most valuable US semiconductor company. The  article cited Nvidia\u2019s favorable exposure to data center, gaming, and  AI as major reasons why the company overtook top spot from Intel. Only  two months later, Nvidia is now worth $107bn more than Intel. In other  words, Nvidia is worth more than an AMD more than its Santa Clara rival.  Around the same time, AMD (AMD)  also began to see significant out-performance relative to Intel shares.  With continued momentum in the PC market on the back of its Ryzen  processors and increased success in data center with the EPYC product  line, AMD has risen 57% since the start of July. Over that period, Intel  declined 15%. \n\nIn contrast to Nvidia and AMD, Intel is disproportionately associated with  the PC. Yet even within the PC market, analyst commentary has been  overwhelmingly positive on AMD whereas doubts have surfaced over Intel\u2019s  ability to innovate and remain competitive. In the span of a week at  the end of July, Intel announced a major delay with its 7nm chips and  AMD beat Q2 earnings, raised guidance, and hit its highest PC market  share since 2013. However, the focus on Intel as a struggling PC player  has wrongly overlooked several important developments that set the company up for a near-term rebound in PC and [long-term revenue opportunities in the same higher growth end markets that have fueled premium valuations for both Nvidia and AMD](https://blackjacketco.com/f/new-brand-new-intel-growth-ahead-for-tiger-lake-edge-and-av).\u00a0\n\n1. Release of Tiger Lake processor, expanded efforts in graphics via  Xe architecture, and development of discrete GPUs for data center and  desktop\n2. Continued momentum in company shift to data-centric business first and PC business second\n3. Expanded Total Addressable Market (TAM) associated with edge computing and edge-enabled technologies\n4. Competitive positioning in autonomous vehicle technology\n\nIntel is currently priced for stagnant to declining revenues, further market share erosion, and lower  relative probability of success compared to Nvidia and AMD. Given recent  product releases and refreshes, as well as a strong strategic vision to  increase share in these higher growth end markets, Intel revenue is  more likely to accelerate and lead to significant multiple expansion in  the coming years.\u00a0\n\n* Assigning Intel CY23 PT of $125 per share\n* FY23 revenue projected at $100bn\n* FY23 net income projected at $34bn delivering 7.55 in EPS\n* Applying 16.55x P/E and 4.55 P/S\u00a0\n\nFor an in-depth and comprehensive breakdown on Intel's competitive positioning, see below:\n\n**Tiger Lake and Renewed PC Innovation**\u00a0\n\nYesterday  Intel finally revealed the highly anticipated Tiger Lake 11th  generation processors for ultra-thin high-performance laptops. Industry  reporting in previous months had speculated that the new system-on-chip  (SoC \u2013 incorporates different components like graphics and AI into one  integrated unit) would offer CPU performance advances and improvements  in graphics and AI. Intel even leaked some specs on Monday that seemed  to confirm some of the performance metrics. Although independent  industry studies are required to run Tiger Lake through its full paces,  the event demonstrated that not only can Intel still innovate, it is  more than premature to start counting the company out on PCs.\u00a0\n\nTiger  Lake clocks up to 20% higher frequencies compared to the 10th  generation Ice Lake family and can reach a single core turbo of 4.8 GHz.  During the presentation, Intel noted that the integrated Iris Xe  graphics perform better than 90% of PCs sold last year, on-board AI is  up to 5x more effective, and WiFi connectivity is up to 3x faster. In a  like-for-like comparison to AMD, Tiger Lake enabled 4x faster photo  upscaling, 2x faster video processing and exporting via Adobe Pro, and  20% faster performance in both Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. For  gaming, Intel conducted side-by-side tests using Gears Tactics. Laptops  running AMD 4800U with integrated graphics and a Nvidia MX350 discrete  graphics card (with Intel 10th Gen i7) performed worse than Tiger Lake.  Intel\u2019s test showed that Tiger Lake handled the game at up to 66% higher  frames per second versus the AMD and Nvidia-powered laptops.\u00a0\n\nBarring significant discrepancies found during independent reviews, Intel just  delivered performance on 10nm that is equivalent to what is possible on  7nm. With the simultaneous launch of the Evo brand to encompass the new  11th generation-powered ultra-thin high-performance laptop range, Intel  can begin building customer brand recognition and altering perceptions  that Intel has lost competitive footing in the PC market. With 50 PC  designs set to ship with Tiger Lake as soon as this fall, and at least  150 designs anticipated from partner OEMs, Intel may see a very  near-term recovery in its PC market share even despite the 7nm delay.\u00a0 \n\n**Transition to Data-Centric Business and Future at the Edge**\n\nMore  important to Intel\u2019s future is the multi-year shift towards  higher-growth end markets associated with cloud, edge, and data. Rather  than PCs, Intel sees its primary business as the Data-Centric reporting  segment that now comprises 52% of revenues. That figure is likely to  expand in coming quarters following 34% YoY growth in the most recent  earnings report. In FY19 Q2, the Data-Centric segment only accounted for  46% of revenues.\u00a0\n\nThat  Data-Centric segment includes: The Data Center Group (36.3% of total  Intel revenues); Non-Volatile Memory Storage Group (8.5%);  Internet-of-Things Group (3.4%); Programmable Solutions Group (2.6%);  and Mobileye (0.7%). The two largest contributors to the segment are  performing extremely well. The Data Center Group grew 43% YoY and saw  operating income climb 72%. The second largest business in the segment,  Non-Volatile Memory Storage, grew 76% YoY for record revenue on the back  of NAND demand growth and higher Average Selling Prices (ASPs).\u00a0\n\nBy  2024, Intel expects its TAM to reach $300bn. But $230bn of this is  attributed to the Data-Centric TAM. And Intel\u2019s own calculations may be  slightly conservative. In the company\u2019s analysis of its various end  markets, Intel only mentioned the edge compute market in general terms.  Yet that market alone is projected to surpass $100bn by 2030. As much as  public cloud adoption drove demand for server-related products over the  past five years, the edge could end up being a far more important  trend. That is because, in addition to further server demand, the edge  will enable billions of IoT devices to finally become widespread after  years of hype. With TAM growth associated with edge server CPU, GPU, and  storage, plus IoT and edge AI solutions, Intel can achieve growth into  the 2030s so long as the company can execute on its strategic vision. \u00a0\n\n*Edge Server*\u00a0\n\nAn S&amp;P Global study  in spring 2020 estimated that Intel has 90-95% share of the data center  CPU market despite recent share gains by AMD. While edge server  architectures and processes differ versus hyperscale cloud servers, this  figure is testament to the strength of Intel\u2019s relationships with the  leading cloud providers that are also among the early movers in the edge  computing space \u2013 namely Amazon with its Lambda@Edge platform,  Microsoft with Azure Functions, and Google with Google Cloud Functions. \u00a0\n\nFor  smaller edge providers especially, like Fastly, Akamai, or Cloudflare,  there will be particular emphasis on price-per-performance for server  components. Until recently, that dynamic favored AMD whose EPYC Rome  7742 processor rivals Intel\u2019s Xeon Platinum 8280 on performance yet  undercuts it on price by about 60%. The cost efficiency of EPYC led to  some important edge server design wins for AMD, including Cloudflare\u2019s  new GenX server that excluded Intel parts for the first time.\u00a0\n\nThe  latest Xeon processors had been on the market for a couple years,  though, and Intel refreshed the product line earlier this year in an  attempt to greatly reduce cost while maintaining performance. In its 24  February press release, Intel directly addressed the need to become more  competitive with AMD on price-per-performance noting that the Xeon  refresh: \u201c\u2026\\[reinforces\\] Intel\u2019s data center leadership by providing  greater performance and performance-per-dollar choices for\u2026customers  across cloud, network and edge.\u201d While Intel compromised on  compatibility with certain server designs, the result is 1.42x better  price-per-core-performance and a cost of $141 per-core for the Gold  6258R. The price tag puts Xeon in a much stronger position relative to  EPYC Rome 7742 which goes for $108 per-core.\u00a0\n\nDespite  early advantages in cost-per-performance for AMD, Intel still managed  to double its edge deployments year-over-year according to Forbes. And  its impressive partner list includes Lenovo, Red Hat, Advantech,  Caswell, Inventec, Lanner, Nexcom, World Wide Technology, Ericsson, ZTE,  Verizon, Vodafone, Nokia, and China Telecom, among others. With drastic  improvements in price-per-performance, Intel could very well see  additional customer wins in upcoming quarters.\u00a0\n\nBeyond  CPU, edge applications will see an increase in demand for integrated  and hybrid GPUs. Between advancements in Intel Xe graphics and its  development of discrete graphics cards, the company will become better  positioned to take advantage of the more than 33% CAGR projected for  GPUs from 2020 to 2027 \u2013 taking the market from just under $20bn in 2019  to over $200bn according to Deloitte.  Even if Nvidia and AMD maintain large leads over Intel in GPU market  share for edge servers, even a marginal portion of the market could be  meaningful to the Data Center Group which measured around $7bn in Q2.\u00a0\n\nIn  addition, edge servers present an unprecedented opportunity for NAND  solutions as well \u2013 specifically flash storage that utilizes the NVMe  (Non-Volatile Memory Express) protocol. Edge servers have strong need  for high-performance startup operations and extremely reliable storage.  That is because rapid startup times are critical for edge providers to  quickly launch computing instances and deliver the lowest possible  latency for their customers. Improvements in NVMe NAND greatly shrink  the physical storage footprint, reduce power and cooling costs, all the  while improving the overall speed, flexibility, and failure rates. And  Intel Optane and 3D NAND SSDs are exceptionally reliable for storage and  offer performance improvements over legacy storage solutions.\u00a0\n\n*IoT and AI*\n\nMuch  like edge servers, edge deployed IoT devices will similarly boost  demand for Intel processors. For workload intensive industrial IoT,  Intel has its Core processor. And the Intel Atom processor is  purpose-built for lower-power or embedded applications. Because IoT  devices will collect and process vast amounts of data, these  applications will also require significant amounts of flash memory \u2013  specifically NAND. On-device NAND SSD can increase data transfer speeds  while also integrating module-level security features, remote  management, and more flexible power configurations. Collectively,  improvements in NAND will lower total cost of ownership for these  machines. \u00a0\n\nThe edge will lead  to rapid growth for edge AI chipsets that enable IoT devices to deploy  machine learning at the edge without having to send data via internet  back to a centralized data center. Deloitte notes that around 300  million edge AI chips were sold in 2017, but this year could see more  than 750 million units hit the market. With compounded annual growth in  edge AI chipsets anticipated to outpace the broader semiconductor  industry by a considerable amount, ABI research predicts that these edge chips will surpass the market for cloud AI chips by 2025 \u2013 marking a massive shift.\u00a0\n\n**Mobileye and Autonomous Driving Technology**\u00a0\n\nIt  is interesting the extent to which mainstream conversations in media  and financial commentary largely exclude Intel\u2019s Mobileye and instead  focus on Tesla as the technology leader in autonomous vehicles and  Nvidia as the chipmaker best positioned to disrupt. Although Telsa  claims to offer autonomous modes for its vehicles, based on the 5-level  autonomous capability hierarchy \u2013 the industry standard established by  the Society of Automotive Engineers \u2013 the most advanced cars currently  on the market only operate at level 2+. Level 2+ falls between levels 2  (partial automation) and 3 (conditional automation). The hardware to  support full level 5 autonomy does exist in 2020, and the software  necessary to manage these systems is not too far behind. However, it  will likely take 5-7 years before manufacturing volumes reach levels to  drive down hardware prices, the necessary regulatory frameworks come  into place, and fully autonomous vehicles gain broad consumer  acceptance. \u00a0\n\nIn the  intermediary period, the progression towards level 5 autonomy will  continue to be gradual and incremental. Higher degrees of autonomy will  be achieved by increasingly sophisticated advanced driver assistance  systems (ADAS) that prove out the viability of these technologies and  underpin the manufacturing, regulatory, and consumer environment that  will facilitate the future arrival of self-driving cars. Beyond this, in  many cases the same technology at the center of levels 4 and 5 builds  on the existing foundations of ADAS capabilities. And the dominant  player in the ADAS market is not Tesla, Waymo, or Nvidia. It is  Mobileye.\u00a0\n\nMobileye\u2019s market  share has consistently stayed above 70% for years, even as competition  from other players has ramped up \u2013 Nvidia in particular. The Mobileye  solution is noteworthy, pairing its SoC \u2013 the EyeQ family \u2013 to support a  range of ADAS capabilities using only a single camera sensor. This  differs from the LiDAR and radar-based systems favored by Waymo, Uber,  GM-owned Cruise, and Nvidia. Tesla \u2013 who previously used Mobileye  technology until the two parted ways in 2016 \u2013 also leverages a  camera-based system. However, Tesla deploys ultrasonic sensors and  radars in combination with billions of miles of driver data.\u00a0\n\nMobileye\u2019s  commanding market share in ADAS means that its technology is used by  more than 300 models from 25 global automakers, resulting in 60 million  vehicles on the road worldwide. In contrast, Tesla currently has fewer  than 1 million vehicles on the road equipped with variants of its  autopilot technology. And Mobileye is already working with 4 major OEMs  to soon provide level 3 autonomous solutions. As part of its  arrangements with OEMs, Mobileye receives access to sensor data from  customer vehicles. At present, Mobileye is collecting 3.7 million miles  per day and growing as another 2 million vehicles from these OEMs are  set to join the data-sharing program over the next two years.\u00a0\n\nWhat  this translates to is a massive partner network with the world\u2019s  leading auto OEMs who will all have a vested interest in competing with  Tesla both in autonomous but also electric vehicles. This also means  that Mobileye has a significant advantage over Nvidia in getting its  ADAS and future autonomous solutions on vehicles. As Mobileye further  prioritizes its fully autonomous solutions, its leading competitive  positioning in ADAS, as well its strong relationships with OEMs, gives  the company a strategic advantage over its competitors as higher levels  of autonomous technologies go to market. This is evidenced by Mobileye\u2019s  strategic partnership with Tesla EV rival NIO to offer level 4 consumer  vehicles by 2022.\u00a0\n\nEven though  Mobileye made its name based on its single camera platform, the company  is separately developing what is called a full autonomous stack,  incorporating the necessary LiDAR, radar, non-camera sensors, GPS,  modems, and other hardware components that will run on its 5thgeneration  EyeQ processor. In the meantime, Mobileye recently demoed a  self-driving vehicle that navigated the congested streets of Jerusalem  using only 12 cameras and no LiDAR, radar, or non-camera sensors.\u00a0\n\nOn  the back of the hyperbolic move in Tesla shares YTD, numerous articles  have lauded the company\u2019s so-called multi-year advantages over rivals in  the space. Notably, in July Elon Musk stated that Tesla is \u201cvery close\u201d  to level 5 autonomy with no updates needed to hardware as the company\u2019s  Tesla Computer processor currently supports full autonomy. Mobileye\u2019s  EyeQ 5 also supports level 5 autonomy, however. And although the Tesla  Computer exceeds EyeQ 5 on tera operations per second (TOPS), EyeQ 5  offers footprint and power consumption advantages. Moreover, unlike most  other players in autonomous systems, Mobileye has opted for an open  architecture that enables OEMs to program their own software on top of  Mobileye hardware.\u00a0\n\nTesla has a  lead in data collected per mile at over 3 billion miles, but Mobileye is  catching up and its data repositories also exceed the billion-mile mark  on an annual run rate basis. To deepen the data sets available to  Mobileye, Intel also bought Israeli mobility-as-a-service company Moovit  for $900mn this year. Like Tesla, Mobileye is set to offer its  technology in the important robotaxi market that many in the industry  view as the precursor to consumer-adopted fully autonomous vehicles down  the line. Mobileye is launching pilot robotaxi fleets in Tel Aviv,  Paris, and Daegu City in 2022.\u00a0\n\nMobileye  still accounts for less than 1% of total Intel revenues despite  doubling sales since being acquired by Intel. Given the strength of  Mobileye\u2019s position in the ADAS market that is expected to grow to more  than $80bn by 2030, as well as the prospects in robotaxis and level 4/5  autonomous systems, Mobileye has strong potential to develop into a  major growth engine for Intel over the next 4-5 years.\u00a0\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIntel  shares are roughly flat since early 2018 despite revenues up almost 20%  from FY19 Q2 to FY20 Q2. The relative out-performance in Nvidia and AMD  shares over that time has furthered perceptions that Intel could fall  behind as the former two companies achieve sustained revenue growth tied  to more attractive end markets like data center, gaming, AI, and  autonomous vehicles.\u00a0\n\nHowever,  recent struggles with certain products and lost PC market share to AMD  have distracted investors from Intel\u2019s ongoing transition to a more data-centric business. With a $230bn TAM projected by 2024 for this  operating segment alone, Intel has multiple opportunities to likewise  drive revenue growth over the long-term.\u00a0\n\nGiven  the company\u2019s recent advancements with its 11th generation Tiger Lake SoC, continued progress in improving price-per-performance for edge  server components, and the vastly underrated leadership of Mobileye in  the ADAS and autonomous vehicle markets, Intel offers an extremely  compelling opportunity for investors seeking exposure to these  technology trends at a more reasonable valuation.\u00a0\n\n*You can find me on Twitter* [@BlackjacketCo](https://twitter.com/BlackjacketCo) *where I write about emerging technologies, industry news, and long-term market trends.

        "selftext": "In a market with massively inflated valuations across the board (especially so in the technology sector), it feels like a breath of fresh air to see Intel trading at a P/E of less than 10. What I can't quite figure out is *why*.\n\nI know about the 7nm chip delay. I know AMD's 7nm chips are already out. I know Intel has been losing ground to AMD in the desktop market for years now. Yet, the magnitude of these factors has been completely exaggerated by Mr. Market. Intel recently released its 11th generation of CPUs, the 10nm Tiger Lake series, and benchmarks have put their performance up to 30% higher than that of AMD's 7nm chips (that metric comes from the Intel Core i7-1165G7, which isn't even the flagship chip of this generation of processors). However, even if we assume that AMD's 7nm chips are going to finally establish them as the dominant company in the desktop market, so what?\n\nIt may seem odd for me to brush off that particular loss of market share for a company that built itself on desktop CPU sales, but hear me out. Desktop sales have been in decline for years now, with laptop sales almost doubling those of desktops in 2019, and Intel's market share in the laptop market is still over 80%. Intel's management no longer considers it critical to dominate an industry in decline, and I tend to agree with them.\n\nTo offset the loss in desktop market share, Intel has increased its market share in data servers (a rapidly growing sector) to well over 90%. With massive corporations like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google making fortunes off of cloud services, Intel is taking a \"picks and shovels\" approach to profiting off of this trend (during the California gold rush, finding gold wasn't the only way to strike it rich. Many made enormous profits by selling picks and shovels to the miners). When PCs were revolutionizing the world, Intel took this same approach, and in an era when PC sales growth is dwindling, Intel is being proactive about expanding into new high-growth markets.\n\nIntel's current fundamental position has drawn comparisons to that of Apple in 2016, and I agree with the analysis. In 2016, Apple was widely considered to be a company whose upside had run out. They were fighting stiff competition in a saturated, slow-growth market, and their yearly revenue growth had started to reflect that fact. The stock fell out of favor with the market, and at one point fell to a P/E below 10. Any of this sound familiar? It gets better. What the market had neglected to realize was that Apple was still diversifying its product line (the purchase of Beats Audio, the release of the Apple Watch and Apple AirPods, etc.), was still a high-margin earner (net profit margins of \\~21% in comparison to INTC's historical margins of \\~20% and current margins of \\~30%), was beginning to reward shareholders through dividends and massive stock buybacks (INTC pays a safe dividend yielding 2.7% at current prices and is in the process of executing $10 billion worth of share buybacks before the end of this year), was in a great balance sheet position (\\~60% debt/equity in comparison to INTC's \\~50%), and had fantastic ratios (\\~40% ROE compared to INTC's \\~30%).\n\nI'd list Intel's intrinsic value at about $85/share, giving the stock a 40%+ margin of safety at the time of this writing. INTC is currently my second-largest holding, and I'll likely buy more if the share price declines further.\n\nMy primary inspiration for writing this (and the source of lots of my information) was a Seeking Alpha article that I'm not allowed to leave a link to because the auto-mods will remove this post lol. It's titled \"Intel: A Market Leader At A Great Price\" and goes over a lot of the same points as I did, but it's still worth a read imo.\n\nTLDR: INTC's recent price decline is attributable more so to overreaction and irrationality on the market's part than to the company's fundamental situation, which is reminiscent of AAPL's in 2016.",

        "selftext": " This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my [blog](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=r%2Finvesting) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i73sw1/deep_dive_into_the_reasons_behind_why_intel_is/),  you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom  for Intel. However, the reality is that\u2019s not necessarily the case.  Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it\u2019s incredibly  important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated  circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been  overlooked in the past is packaging \u2013 essentially how you make the  calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside  world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of  fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies,  which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and  lets the chip communicate with the outside world \u2013 as well as within the  package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over  the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging,  not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the  falling benefits of moving to smaller processes \\[1\\], coupled with  rapidly increasing costs \u2013 a EUV machine to make advanced processes can  cost up to $125million \\[2\\], while the R&amp;D costs to make smaller  processes are also increasing \\[3\\].\n\nWhat is packaging?\n\nThe  best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of  architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker.  Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making  the \u2018workers\u2019 more productive in smaller spaces \u2013 first  hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we\u2019re now at  the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces  (cubicles) it\u2019s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the  traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the  traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building  and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go  about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking\\[4\\]. In the terminology of our  analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office  building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team  can work on a job that they\u2019re specialised in, or where you can cut  costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular  department that\u2019s not too important instead of being forced to use  identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a  \u2018monolithic\u2019 , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure  that communication flows easily and quickly between each different  office building.\n\n3D stacking is  like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer  chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing)  to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies  on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing  life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer  rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat)  escape.\n\nChiplets\n\nChiplets  are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they\u2019re  commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The  most common method, the one that\u2019s widely used right now (notably in  AMD\u2019s Zen 2 architecture), has an \u2018interposer\u2019 sitting underneath the  chips you want to connect.\\[5\\] This interposer acts as a conduit between  the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as  having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you  had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient  (PCB traces).  AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we\u2019ll discuss  later, but on a hardware level it\u2019s likely that they\u2019re using TSMC\u2019s  CoWoS \u2013 Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation,  the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips  (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). \\[6\\]The  second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are  exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete  floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead.  \\[7\\]While this approach is faster \u2013 each tunnel is dedicated to only  connecting two dies, so you won\u2019t have issues where data is trying to  get to lots of different places at once and getting \u2018stuck\u2019, as you  would with AMD\u2019s approach, it\u2019s harder to design products for \u2013 you have  to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete  foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really,  this is a simple continuation of the two companies\u2019 philosophies. AMD\u2019s  HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source  interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors.  Meanwhile, Intel\u2019s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to  be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made  it\u2019s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an  attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences  inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which  approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it\u2019s  evident that each company has chosen the approach that\u2019s best for it \u2013  Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers  working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product,  to get slightly better performance; while AMD\u2019s smaller size drives them  to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across  many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD\u2019s  own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between  different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the \u2018concrete  foundation\u2019 is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect  their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which  is impossible with Intel. \\[8\\] At the same time, it could also be used  by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive  impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. \u2013 just  like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the  massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing  costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market.\n\nChiplets  are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they\u2019re sort of here from Intel,  expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next  few years, and will be here to stay. The two \u2018teams\u2019 have differing  philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it\u2019ll be  fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can  improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear,  EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads,  while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for  the next two years at the very least.\n\n3D stacking\n\nIn  theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on  top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges  are sufficiently different that it\u2019s easier to discuss them separately.\n\n3D  stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite  the fact that Intel announced its\u2019 \u2018Foveros\u2019 stacking tech in 2019 \\[9\\],  Samsung announced their \u2018X-cube\u2019 packaging a few weeks ago \\[10\\], and  TSMC announcing their \u20183DFabric\u2019 family just a few days ago \\[11\\], the  reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained  earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the  heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made  by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large  amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D  stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like  mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking  forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book,  to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical  footprint.\\[12\\] Even \u2018true\u2019 3D stacking \u2013 where you build layers one on  top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have  been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn\u2019t far  behind.\\[13\\] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the  high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved  the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling  issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred  through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). \\[14\\] These  are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data.  Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the  connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can  technically stack any chips we want together right now \u2013 TSMC\u2019s SoIC is  slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), \\[11\\] the  issue is that cutting edge chips \u2013 especially x86 chips used in  datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat.  AMD Epyc\u2019s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power \u2013 an approximation of  how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, \\[15\\]while Intel\u2019s  Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. \\[16\\] When you consider the fact that all  this heat is coming off a piece of silicon &lt;500mm2, it\u2019s apparent  that it\u2019s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current  techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip  conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past  the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before  we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a  paradigm shift in design philosophies \u2013 either drastic improvements in  efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip  better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be  tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip,  making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as  is the case with current designs. \\[17\\] Obviously, this is completely  uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with  current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die  and reap the speed benefits between those two chips \u2013 for instance  Samsung\u2019s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of  a logic die. \\[10\\] We\u2019re likely to see a few years of this sort of  in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic  dies, before we reach the \u2018Holy Grail\u2019 of high-power logic on logic \u2013  and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to  various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip  horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away  that it\u2019s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the  intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the  opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the  reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive \u2013 even leading, in  the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall  leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly  effective, both in cost and performance.\n\nAfter  reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn\u2019t I going to tell you  why Intel\u2019s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the  opposite doesn\u2019t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel\u2019s future  is promising is threefold.\n\n1. Packaging  is in its\u2019 infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind  now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in  process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we\u2019re at the very  start of the diminishing returns graph, where it\u2019s easy to make big  strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering  prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in  lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has \u2018won\u2019 the  battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that  integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic,  unified approach to designing a chip proving useful.\n2. Intel  spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in  2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%).  \\[18\\]\\[19\\] Although Intel\u2019s operations are broader, with investments in  anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it\u2019s likely  that Intel\u2019s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of  competitors. In addition, Intel\u2019s engineers are colloquially known to be  some of the best in the business. It\u2019s current woes are largely a  function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based.\n3. Intel\u2019s  (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it  to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down  for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay  his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best  person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be  constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the  internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening  up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a  comeback \u2013 a terrifying thought for any competitors.\n\nIf these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak.\n\nSemiconductors  are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such  huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for  shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the  technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing  style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I\u2019m investing in,  and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical  aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as  well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly  throws at us.\n\nFeel free to contact me if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like me to look at, and thanks for taking the time to read!\n\n\\[1\\] [https://cartesianproduct.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/the-end-of-dennard-scaling/](https://cartesianproduct.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/the-end-of-dennard-scaling/)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.eetimes.com/euv-tool-costs-hit-120-million/](https://www.eetimes.com/euv-tool-costs-hit-120-million/)\n\n\\[3\\] [http://euvlsymposium.lbl.gov/pdf/2012/pres/G.%20Yeric.pdf](http://euvlsymposium.lbl.gov/pdf/2012/pres/G.%20Yeric.pdf)\n\n\\[4\\] [https://semiengineering.com/knowledge\\_centers/packaging/advanced-packaging/](https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/packaging/advanced-packaging/)\n\n\\[5\\] [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340843129\\_Chiplet\\_Heterogeneous\\_Integration\\_Technology-Status\\_and\\_Challenges](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340843129_Chiplet_Heterogeneous_Integration_Technology-Status_and_Challenges)\n\n\\[6\\] [https://www.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/services/cowos.htm](https://www.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/services/cowos.htm)\n\n\\[7\\] [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/emib.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/emib.html)\n\n\\[8\\] [https://www.amd.com/en/campaigns/hpc-solutions-webinar](https://www.amd.com/en/campaigns/hpc-solutions-webinar)\n\n\\[9\\] [https://www.eejournal.com/article/intel-foveros-3d-packaging/](https://www.eejournal.com/article/intel-foveros-3d-packaging/)\n\n\\[10\\] [https://news.samsung.com/global/tag/samsung-x-cube](https://news.samsung.com/global/tag/samsung-x-cube)\n\n\\[11\\]TSMC Technology Symposium 2020\n\n\\[12\\] [https://sst.semiconductor-digest.com/chipworks\\_real\\_chips\\_blog/2019/01/16/the-packaging-of-apples-a12x-is-weird/](https://sst.semiconductor-digest.com/chipworks_real_chips_blog/2019/01/16/the-packaging-of-apples-a12x-is-weird/)\n\n\\[13\\] [https://www.nvmdurance.com/history-of-3d-nand-flash-memory/](https://www.nvmdurance.com/history-of-3d-nand-flash-memory/)\n\n\\[14\\] [http://www.appliedmaterials.com/files/Applied\\_TSV\\_Primer.pdf](http://www.appliedmaterials.com/files/Applied_TSV_Primer.pdf)\n\n\\[15\\] [https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7742](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7742)\n\n\\[16\\] [https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/194146/intel-xeon-platinum-9282-processor-77m-cache-2-60-ghz.html](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/194146/intel-xeon-platinum-9282-processor-77m-cache-2-60-ghz.html)\n\n\\[17\\] [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02503-1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02503-1)\n\n\\[18\\] [https://www.intc.com/filings-reports/all-sec-filings/content/0000050863-20-000011/0000050863-20-000011.pdf](https://www.intc.com/filings-reports/all-sec-filings/content/0000050863-20-000011/0000050863-20-000011.pdf)\n\n\\[19\\] [https://www.tsmc.com/download/ir/annualReports/2019/english/index.html](https://www.tsmc.com/download/ir/annualReports/2019/english/index.html)\n\n\\[20\\] [https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-leadership-tech-team-changes-not-delayed-murthy-renduchintala-leaves](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-leadership-tech-team-changes-not-delayed-murthy-renduchintala-leaves)",

        "selftext": "So as most of you AMD fanbois know Intel don\u2019t got 7nm. Yes they\u2019re behind a generation but CPU performance improved by 15-20%. But honestly I could give a shit less. \n\nNormies don\u2019t look at that. Normies see the \u201cintel core\u201d sticker and they\u2019re sold. They have blind faith because they recognize the brand. To be honest if these companies weren\u2019t something I paid attention to I probably would have never even known that AMD is \u201cbeating\u201d Intel. Intel\u2019s core customers know that and that\u2019s why I don\u2019t think Intel is going to lose much more market share to AMD. Maybe they\u2019ll gain the super dedicated gamers and computer enthusiasts that care about that level of performance. But I don\u2019t think they represent the vast majority of tech consumers. The average tech consumer doesn\u2019t give a rats ass. They know Intel so they trust Intel. \n\nDon\u2019t believe me? \n\nAsk anyone that doesn\u2019t trade/ is a computer enthusiast if they know who INTEL is. Then ask them who AMD is. I\u2019m certain they\u2019ll only recognize one. \n\nAMD just doesn\u2019t have the same level of brand recognition. \n\nThe recent Tech \u201ccrash\u201d dragged intel back to a PE of 9. Meanwhile AMD is chilling at around 160. I find it hard to believe that somehow even though INTC has 10 times the revenue, and retains around 30% if that into NET income (where AMD is at was most recently at a wimpy 8%) that its valued far below AMD. Big fish have been eyeing it. Vanguard bit this quarter. \n\nOn top of that the recent acquisition of Mobileye should catch the attention of you Daddy Musk littles and NIO SIMPS (I don\u2019t blame you for throwing your life savings at them their cars do look sexy af) As you probably don\u2019t know the original version of TSLA autopilot ran on Mobileye. Daddy Musk got cocky and advertised the self driving system as being far more autonomous that it was which after a crash cause Mobileye to pull out of their deal with TSLA. If you ask TSLA it\u2019s because mobileye was unhappy with TSLA taking over some aspects of production. Either way that spells a smart business because they were either avoiding lawsuits or defending their right to their technology. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that they were Tesla\u2019s first choice and for good reason. \n\nMusk is now arguing against the use of a Lidar system saying that \u201canyone relying on Lidar is doomed\u201d, but Mobileye disagrees. So does Cornell. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/%3famp=1\n\nThe gist is a camera only system is bound to fail in certain environments and also performs worse in poor lighting. Ultimately if we\u2019re going to have fully self driving cars they\u2019re going to need to be able to function in all types of environments including the roads of India and China which is a task that Mobileye is already successfully undertaking. \n\nMobileye\u2019s customers include Nissan, Volkswagen, Cadillac, BMW and NIO. Most of which have agreed to share driving data with Mobileye, which puts them at a massive advantage compared to TSLA. Ultimately a camera only system is bound to eventually fail and in a society that is already skeptical about the safety of autonomous cars. \n\n\nAccording to the degenerates that call themselves analysts INTC has at most a 9% downside if it touches the historical low PEs of 7. But it also has a potential 100% upside. AMD on the other hand could drop all the way down to $8 and still have a higher price to earnings than Intel. But as you already know the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\n\nIntel has been more efficient with their money, they have real brand recognition that I highly doubt AMD will ever achieve. Oh and they\u2019re currently brining in like 10 times more tendies than AMD. They have a massive economic Moat while AMD barely has one. \n\nDon\u2019t trade on emotions trade on fact. And the fact is Intel has a bigger potential upside\n\nIntel isn\u2019t a fast mover, at these levels it still has a potential downside because the whole sector is shaky but that will only create better buying opportunities.\nIf it dips lower I\u2019m going I\u2019m going to add leaps on top of my existing position. \n\nDo your own DD-this isn\u2019t advice-but remember, I\u2019m right you\u2019re wrong; say hi to the wife for me.\n\nPositions: INTC 47.5 11/20C",

        "selftext": "Thanks for all the support, as this took a long time to write! [**Article Link Here**](https://medium.com/mastering-options/what-are-iron-condors-b25f05581c5d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nThis article serves to inform on how to to use Iron Condors effectively, and some advise and details to look out for when trading them.\n\nReading the entire article is crucial, as Iron Condors are pretty complex, and skipping a part may entail confusion. I would also recommend reading [this article on Put Credit Spread\u2019s](https://medium.com/mastering-options/put-credit-spreads-explained-for-beginners-abf93e48be48) before reading, as it will save you a lot of confusion.\n\nIron Condors are one of the most popular option\u2019s strategies, as they can use theta to generate profit\u2019s from small/flat stock movements. Knowing how to play Iron Condors is a great addition to an options-traders toolkit.\n\nIf you know the basics about options, feel free to skip to the \u201cOpening an Iron Condor\u201d Section.\n\n# Account Size\n\nIron Condors, like all options, use contracts which control 100 shares each. For this reason, it is important to not use your entire account for Iron Condors, as a sudden spike in the market or your stocks could warrant extreme losses. I always recommend:\n\n* \\&gt;60% of account size in investments like index funds, and the rest should be diversified into options strategies in diversified stocks.\n\nThe technical minimum account size that you would need to run iron condors is $50, but I would recommend having at least $500 in your account to test Iron Condors.\n\nA big reason why Iron Condors are so popular is because they have low collateral requirement, and extremely high max-profit\u2019s compared to other strategies.\n\n# Pick a Stock\n\nPicking a stock to buy/sell an Iron Condor makes the biggest difference in the outcome of your trade. Make sure that you:\n\n&gt;*Pick a stock that you think will trade flat, or have little movement until a certain date.*  \n*Pick a stock that is known to not be too volatile, as that will not mix well with Iron Condors.*\n\n## Some of my favorite stocks/etfs to run Iron Condor\u2019s are:\n\n* SPY (S&amp;P 500 Index ETF)\n* INTC (Intel)\n* F (Ford)\n\nAll of these securities have relatively low volatility, and are not exploding in growth currently. This makes it fair game for Iron Condors! Here are some examples of **bad stocks** to sell Iron Condors on:\n\n* TQQQ, TSLA, NKLA, KODK, or Penny Stocks.\n\n# Choosing to Buy or Sell\n\nAll options strategies rely on two people; the buyer and the seller. In this article, I will be explaining how to sell Iron Condors, because that is what I am experienced in.\n\nHowever, you must know that everytime you write (sell) an Iron Condor, someone else is buying it.\n\nWhen someone else buy\u2019s your Iron Condor, they are thinking the opposite of you. They think that the stock you are trading is going to have a breakout, and high volatility.\n\nIf you want to understand how buying Iron Condors work, you can follow along this article, but think in reverse. If the seller (us) loses money, then you (the buyer) will make money.\n\n# Opening the Iron Condor\n\nAs I do with all my options strategy write-ups, I will explain the basics, and then go on with an example Iron Condor play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Iron Condor Profit Graph](https://i.redd.it/avcthprl2sm51.gif)\n\n \n\nFrom the above profit graph, we can notice that:\n\n* Iron Condors have both max loss, and max profit\u2019s.\n* Iron Condors have 2 break evens, and 2 sides to their max loss.\n\n## The Basics\n\nIron Condors are (in essence) a Put Credit Spread combined with a Call Credit Spread. Put Credit Spread\u2019s bet on a stock not increasing, and a Put Credit Spread bet\u2019s on a stock not decreasing. This is why we want our stock to stay flat to make profit\u2019s.\n\nOTM = Out of the money  \n**To open an Iron Condor, you will need to:**\n\n* Sell an OTM Put, then buy an OTM Put (below the Short Put)\n* Sell an OTM Call, then buy an OTM Call (above the Short Call)\n\nWe will talk about break evens, profit &amp; loss, and collateral in the example below.\n\nCongratulations, you have just constructed an Iron Condor! If you are still confused, then follow along the example below, as it will go more in depth.\n\n# Example Iron Condor\n\n&gt;SPY is currently trading at $335. We think that it will trade flat till Sept. 18, with low volatility.\n\n**Let\u2019s say that we firmly believe that it will not exceed the $330-$338 range, and we only have $100 to spend on this Iron Condor.**\n\nThis is the perfect scenario to open an Iron Condor, and profit from the Theta (Time) decay that comes from selling options. We can do the following to open our Iron Condor:\n\n* Sell the SPY $330 Put @ 3.58 Credit (Strike at our lower range)\n* Buy the SPY $329 Put @ 3.22 Debit (Right under our lower range)\n* Sell the SPY $338 Call @ 2.50 Credit (Strike at our higher range)\n* Buy the SPY $339 Call @ 2.11 Debit (Right above our higher range)\n\n**Net Credit:** $75 *(Total Credit \u2014 Total Debit)*  \n**Collateral Required:** $100 *(Greater Difference between call strikes or put strikes x 100)*\n\n## Explanation\n\nOur example shows how an Iron Condor would look like.\n\nSince the options that we sold outweigh the options that we bought, we end up with a net credit of $75.\n\nOur Put Strikes and Call Strikes are $1 apart. If we multiply that by 100, our collateral requirement is $100.\n\nOur Put\u2019s resemble a Put Credit Spread, which bet\u2019s on SPY trading above $330. Our Call\u2019s resemble a Call Credit Spread, which bet\u2019s on SPY trading below $338.\n\nTo find the 2 break-even\u2019s on our Iron Condor, we can subtract/add the net credit received to our spreads.\n\nFor the Put\u2019s, 330\u20130.75 = 329.25. For the call\u2019s, 338+0.75 = 338.75. As you can see, our break-even\u2019s are $329.25 and $338.75.\n\nOur max loss can be calculated by our *collateral requirement \u2014 net credit.* Ours would be $100 \u2014 $75 = $25 max loss.\n\nThrough all these calculations, we can see that if our bet is correct, we can earn a 75% return on our collateral in 1 week. If we are incorrect, we will lose 25% of our collateral.\n\nNow that we have talked about our example, let\u2019s see how we can improve our Iron Condor strategies.\n\n## Managing Risk\n\nThere are many ways to lower risk on your Iron Condor\u2019s. Here are a few of the best ways to lower your risk:\n\n* Pick a more stable stock, and don\u2019t trade earning\u2019s or approvals.\n* Move your strike prices further out of the money. (this will lower your net credit)\n* Tighten the difference between your call strikes and put strikes.\n\nIf you want to create a more consistent strategy for playing Iron Condors, then it is important to find the perfect ratio of profit/risk.  \nMany people who play Iron Condors will only open a trade if the max profit is &gt;20% of the collateral.\n\n## Understanding Expiration\n\nAlthough the max loss or max profit may look appealing, it will almost always be better to close a trade before expiration.\n\nMany options traders prefer to close out of a trade once they have reached 50% max profit.\n\nIf you do not have enough money to buy 100 shares of the stock, then close out early, because there have been many occurences where only one leg of your trade get\u2019s assigned, and a brokerage will sell it at a large loss.\n\n## Picking Strike Prices\n\nSecond to picking a stock, picking your strikes is extremely important. A bad strike could easily reach max loss.\n\nMy favorite ways for finding the best strike prices to play is by doing technical analysis, checking for support and resistance, checking investor sentiment, and watching for any upcoming catalysts in the market.\n\n## Understanding Theta\n\n\u201cTheta\u201d is an options greek term which represents time decay. By default, theta will accelerate exponentially the closer a contract comes to expiration.\n\nThe Iron Condor\u2019s profit\u2019s are entirely due to Theta, because the intrinsic (actual) value of OTM contracts are $0.\n\nFor this reason, it is not advisable to open Iron Condor\u2019s with far away expirations, as the risk of an unexpected breakout trump\u2019s the low theta decay.\n\nIron Condor\u2019s are best played on weekly or monthly expiration\u2019s, as that is when Theta becomes a driving force in the price.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIron Condor\u2019s are an advanced option\u2019s strategy which incorporate both sides of credit spread\u2019s, and profit from low movement and low volatility.\n\nIn this article, you learned how to play Iron Condors, and how to lower risk and manage your active positions.\n\nThank you for reading, and I hope that you found value in this article.\n\n## Related Options Strategies:\n\n* [Iron Butterfly\u2019s](https://medium.com/mastering-options/what-are-iron-butterfly-options-aacebc8a6565)\n* [Wheel Strategy](https://medium.com/mastering-options/how-to-use-the-options-wheel-strategy-5013c9938f4b)\n* [LEAP\u2019s](https://medium.com/mastering-options/what-are-leap-options-3f8c68fc9980)\n* [Debit Spread\u2019s](https://medium.com/mastering-options/how-to-options-debit-spreads-38b03d5b41ad)",

        "selftext": " \n\n**Introduction:**  \nThis is a follow up to my original post that I made a few months ago as I promised, you can find it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbwcpv/amd\\_analysis\\_and\\_why\\_you\\_should\\_sell\\_big\\_blue/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbwcpv/amd_analysis_and_why_you_should_sell_big_blue/)  \nThe following post will assume that you already read my previous post  or have an understanding of how the semiconductors work. This will cover two primary subjects, number one, Intel VS AMD and their competitive advantages, including nodes, partnerships and foundries along with how I expect things to play out over the next few years.\n\n**Intel VS AMD**\n\n*The following documents Intel\u2019s most recent launch and the potential inconsistencies I found, please be aware that the reviewers are not at fault and should not be blamed for anything that is potentially foul play.*\n\n***Cascade Lake and a story of deception***\n\n[Intel 10900k](https://preview.redd.it/t9l7el4iudo51.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66b0fa720fcf9d783c5092a42a8ce8207d15d895)\n\nThe x86 CPU space has two companies currently competing in it. One is the master and one is subservient, but what happens when these roles get reversed and the master becomes the underdog? \n\nThe fight gets dirty.\n\nEver since the launch of the Zen architecture, AMD has been slowly gnawing away at Intel\u2019s market share, Zen 1 brought them back into the discussion, Zen+ consolidated their position and Zen 2 brought the fight to Intel\u2019s crown jewels. Intel in the years since Zen launched floundered with 10nm, and now 7nm while TSMC slowly ran away with their lead in manufacturing all the while AMD continued to innovate. This left Intel with two choices, buckle down and try to work the problem, or fight dirty. They chose the latter.\n\nIn 2018, well before Zen 2 launched, AdoredTV investigated Intel and their relation with reviewers and found that Intel was most likely seeding the tech press with golden samples. The scale of this was astonishing, almost all sites that he investigated had received exceptional samples. \n\nThis was in 2018, when Intel was still firmly in the lead when compared to AMD\u2019s Zen+ architecture. What about now? When AMD is on par or firmly in the lead with Zen 2?\n\nInspired by Adored\u2019s Conlake video, I chose to look into any potential foul play with their newest 10900k launch.\n\n***Methodology***\n\nIn order to ensure that Intel was fairly portrayed, I looked into as many publications that I could who published their all core overclocks along with their voltages set in the bios. All in all I found 17 publications that fulfilled the criteria.\n\nAfter I had collected the necessary data, I reached out to Silicon Lottery to ask about higher bins than what they published, that being 5.2 GHz, and 5.3 GHz.\n\nThey kindly responded to me and provided this information:\n\n*\u201cI can tell you that 1) we do not publish statistics until we reach a sample size of at least 100,*\n\n*and 2) there are a few 10900K that can fall within our theoretical 5.2GHz bin (we're talking about top \\~1% here), but a 5.3GHz bin is not possible for a 10900K under our tests.\u201d*\n\nFrom this statement we can safely assume that their theoretical 5.2 GHz bin would use 1.4 volts as each 100 MHz bump is matched by an increase of 0.025 volts, with their highest binned parts reaching 5.1 GHz at 1.375 volts.\n\nWith that out of the way let\u2019s move onto my findings.\n\n***Findings***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qlan4vkrtdo51.png?width=577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d17d3f53fb045dc3af44d0fda3e2ac85f01caa9\n\n*\\*Power draw from the wall was about equivalent to that of Guru3D, implying a voltage of 1.4 volts.*\n\n*\\*\\*JayzTwoCents did not mention the voltage used, but I felt it was important to mention him as his result was completely out of line when compared to other sites.*\n\nThe first important note that should be made is that for some of the sites, they started with a voltage of 1.35 and applied a multiplier without doing any further tuning, meaning some of these publications could have achieved a better overclocking result. Secondly, because of the nature of some reviews, I could not get as many sources as I originally intended, but 17 should suffice for our needs.\n\nWith that out of the way, we can look at a few numbers, the average clock speed achieved and the average voltage necestated.\n\n**Average all core overclock:**\n\n*5.164 GHz*\n\n**Average Voltage:**\n\n*1.341 Volts*\n\nAnd we can also determine the mean all core overclock and voltage, which will be important to ensure the results are not skewed by aberrant values such as with JayzTwoCents and Overclock 3D.\n\n**Mean all core overclock**\n\n*5.1 GHz*\n\n**Mean Voltage:**\n\n*1.332 Volts*\n\nAs we can see, both the average and the mean samples would be considered Golden samples by Silicon lottery, who have had less than 100 samples achieve similar results. It is clear that something is a little fishy here, so let\u2019s take a deeper look into the results.\n\nStarting with Guru3D, the first result that completely blew me away, 5.2 all core overclock with only 1.35 volts applied. When compared to Silicon Lottery of less than 1% of samples reaching 5.2 GHz under their testing with the assumed 1.4 volts. Even if we are generous and add an extra 0.025 volts to ensure long term stability, Guru3D\u2019s review sample far exceeds the theoretical requirements for a 5.2 GHz, golden sample bin. \n\nMoving onto the next stand out, Overclocker 3D, we see an absolutely astonishing result, 5.4 GHz with a voltage of 1.402. Silicon Lottery stated that they do not believe it is possible for a 10900k to reach 5.3 GHz all core, let alone 5.4 GHz. This sample is definitively a golden sample, in all likelihood, Silicon Lottery has never seen a part that can perform this well despite testing hundreds of chips. \n\nAll other chips are excellent samples as well, with the vast majority of them landing in golden sample territory or at worse, good samples.\n\nThat being said, there is one outlier, JayzTwoCents. I am not entirely sure what happened here, it is the only chip that did not make 5.0 GHz, and is the only chip that would not be considered a good bin. Perhaps some wires got crossed or he was sent a retail unit by accident.\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nMake of this what you will, but I feel that this is a clear demonstration that Intel is again seeding press with golden samples. This could have been done by them to quell the rumours that the 10900k would be a power hog or to potentially dull the edge of any potential reviews, but it is pretty clear that something is amiss. \n\nIt is also clear that Intel will continue to pull shenanigans until we call them out for it. I feel that the press should be a little more discerning or more skeptical of their results given what I have found and what Adored found in the past.\n\nFinally if you plan to buy an Intel product, please be aware that misleading information such as this is present and be aware of it.\n\n***Sources and Footnotes***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mse7izj9udo51.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd19e2f2deb5d2fa6f966e0026003e9dcce82bea\n\n**The future of Intel?**\n\nAs we can see, Intel is not shy about potentially deceiving press and consumers. That being said, I do not expect to see any legal consequences come of this as it is very difficult to ascertain if this did indeed happen.\n\nThat being said, the pain has just begun for Intel. The following will encompass a brief overview of some Intel products and the major issues they will be facing in the near future.\n\n***The death of a leading foundry***\n\nIn my last post, I said that Intel would not be highly competitive in 2022. While I admit, I was hoping to get the follow up post out much sooner, what I meant by this is Intel will not have 7nm until 2022 at the earliest. That being said, with Intel\u2019s most recent quarterly earnings, I have to readjust my personal road map for Intel, and I now believe they will be competitive again at earliest, 2023. There are a few reasons for this, and the following will be based upon leaks from Moore\u2019s Law is Dead, AdoredTV and RedGamingTech. All three have proven to be reliable sources, with Moore\u2019s Law is Dead predicting almost the exact performance of Intel Tiger Lake months in advance.\n\nCurrently, as we all are aware of, Intel is encountering massive difficulties with their 10nm and 7nm production. The issues are so prevalent that 10nm has been delayed for years, and 7nm will be delayed for just as long if not longer. Because of this they have been forced to delay product launches, back port architectures and increase power consumption massively to keep pace with AMD. \n\nThat being said, they cannot continue to increase power consumption in all sectors, for example, in note books, AMD recently launched their much anticipated Renoir APUs, which far exceed both press and my expectations. At the moment AMD\u2019s solutions are notably stronger in multithreaded tasks and graphics work loads when compared to Intel Cascade Lake and Intel Ice Lake. In fact, according to Hardware Unboxed, a reputable review channel, it is not uncommon to see AMD perform at twice the level as Intel when comparing low power solutions (15 watt TDP or lower). That being said, Intel Tiger Lake is a good improvement in terms of GPU performance, outclassing AMD by \\~20% in the 15 W form factor, while still being significantly weaker in multithreaded performance.\n\nThis shows that Intel absolutely needs 10nm yesterday, they cannot continue to increase power and lose efficiency, sooner or later they will find that even though their products consume twice the power, they are out classed in all aspects. That wall will be Zen 3.\n\n[AMD 3950x](https://preview.redd.it/a29o16umudo51.jpg?width=1344&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d12b43cb90019ef1bf776266e6b1234e7d38a99)\n\n***Zen 3***\n\nThis will be brief as not much has changed from my previous post, and I still fully expect AMD to take the gaming crown from Intel Cascade Lake. However, there are a few small updates that I must make. Intel Rocket Lake is expected to come out Q1 or Q2 of 2021, and it will have 8 cores at most. Though I am not sure why Intel would want to max their consumer platform at only 8 cores, and not maintain 10 cores, I suspect that 10 cores may consume too much power. However, it will have a 10-20% IPC bump, which *might* allow it to reclaim the gaming crown from Zen 3, though at the moment it could be a toss up depending on how well Zen 3 scales with frequency. \n\nFurthermore, I will clarify a few things: \n\n1. Zen 3 will have a unified cache, meaning that latency should be lower as packets do not have to cross over the infinity fabric.\n2. Zen 3\u2019s cores will have more access to L3 cache as it is unified, meaning it will have to access system memory less, thereby again improving latency.\n3. Zen 3 should have a small clock speed increase from an improved node, though I suspect it will be no more than 200 MHz\n4. Finally, Zen 3 should also have a higher f-clock, meaning it will have lower latency when accessing the system memory.\n\nAll in all, Zen 3 is a relatively iterative performance increase over Zen 2, with a 15-20% increase in single threaded performance being likely.\n\n***Big and Little cores Vs Zen 4***\n\nA few months ago, Moore\u2019s Law is Dead detailed Alder Lake and Sapphire Rapides; Intel\u2019s \u201cbig\u201d comeback. The following will be a summary of what he detailed, and I strongly recommend you watch his video to understand my reasoning to what will happen: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqErX7VkitI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqErX7VkitI)\n\nThe gist of it:\n\n1. Alder Lake will be on 10nm, and will utilize \u201cbig cores\u201d with high ipc, and \u201clittle cores\u201d with low ipc, and low power consumption.\n2. Alder Lake will come out late 2021 or early 2022.\n3. Sapphire Rapides will be Intel\u2019s big splash back into the data center, and will succeed Ice Lake server.\n4. Sapphire rapides will most likely have 56 cores.\n\nMy opinion:\n\nThough we have very little information on Zen 4, we know one thing for certain, it will be on 5nm TSMC. You may immediately see the issue, in my last post I said that 5nm was designed to compete with Intel 7nm, not 10nm. AMD will still have a node advantage. This along with what we know so far, Zen 4, will increase core counts substantially again, and it will be an advanced package solution, this shows that unless Alder Lake and Sapphire Rapids come out two quarters or more before Zen 4, it will not be competitive. \n\nThis is a major issue for Intel because as I detailed previously Intel\u2019s roadmap is massively behind schedule and I believe that all products that have yet to be announced, such as Alder Lake and Sapphire rapids will have been delayed by at least a few months. These delays will be further compounded by Intel\u2019s wording security problems forcing companies to either purchase more Intel products as a stop gap, or migrate over to AMD.\n\n***Data Center and the Cloud***\n\nIf you work in the server space, you know that security is paramount, and as I said in my last post, Intel has none of it. Now you may ask, why is Intel still selling massive amounts of CPUs to various OEMs such as Dell? Here is the reason as detailed by Mike Burzonne (who is supporting the Federal Trade Commission v Intel Corp. Dockets 9288 and 9341) on SeekingAlpha:\n\n\u201cAverage OEM price where I suspect deeper discounts are available for large volume bundles and hyperscale / cloud commercial.\n\nDesktop $283.79\n\nMobile $282.13\n\nXeon $715.04\u201d\n\nNow the astute may see the issue, Intel is selling these for much less than their suggested retail value. Essentially what these large OEMs are doing is, buy Xeons on the cheap, burning through them in about a year, then purchasing new ones. Obviously this is not sustainable, so they are potentially looking at AMD. \n\nMike Burzonne also believes that AMD ships about 50m units per year compared to the 400m of Intel, and from this the issue is clear, they do not have enough capacity to bring on these large OEMs in any meaningful way, plus the software stack is not entirely mature yet. \n\nNow if you look at the software stack, this is a very real head wind, but things are slowly changing, when Zen 3 is released, the Zen architecture will be just about 4 years old, which is typically when you start to see software maturity at around 5 years. This compounded with improved efficiency over Zen 2 should allow AMD to make a very convincing argument to not buy Xeons. Furthermore, we also know that AMD is ramping wafer orders from TSMC thus they should be able to increase shipments and bring large OEMs on board.\n\nThe way that Intel is going to combat this is by selling Xeons on the cheap while showing off what they have coming down the pipeline to incentivise companies to make do with their current products. The issue with this is they have proven time and time again that they do not have the ability to execute, as proven most recently by the 7nm delays.\n\n***Trouble with the FTC***\n\nThis will be very brief as I do not entirely understand the ins out outs of the suit, but the reason I specifically brought up Mike Burzonne was his involvement in an anticompetitive suit against Intel for monopolistic practices as summarized in my first post. Mike Burzonne believes that total damages could exceed 20b and a 2010 revision states 88B in damages.\n\nThe reason why the charges are so slow to move is Mike Burzonne believes that the FTC and the European Union are synchronizing to ensure that the charges are proper and cannot be easily dismissed, nor will there be lasting economic tensions as Intel is a US based cooperation.\n\nIf you wish to read more about the suit, here is the 2010 revision: [https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public\\_comments/proposed-consent-agreement-matter-intel-corporation-corporation-ftc-docket-no.9341-550006-00014%C2%A0/550006-00014-55228.pdf](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_comments/proposed-consent-agreement-matter-intel-corporation-corporation-ftc-docket-no.9341-550006-00014%C2%A0/550006-00014-55228.pdf)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6miicxssudo51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c10575c5850a57d5dcdcf7c54b0e570b282dba30\n\n**Conclusion/TLDR**\n\nAs I believe I highlighted very clearly, Intel is increasingly starting to turn to more shady tactics to paint themselves in the best light possible, such as with the Cascade Lake reviews, they are losing ground to AMD in efficiency and performance, they are losing server market share and they have a potential massive lawsuit on the horizon. \n\nAll of this should demonstrate that AMD has a golden opportunity to gain massive market share as Intel toils with 10nm and 7nm.\n\nOne final thing I should note, is that the FTC lawsuit is very much uncertain, and I would be wary of basing any decisions on it. \n\nFinally, I see AMD as worth 150B in the next few years as they eat Intel\u2019s lunch, cloud compute continues to grow rapidly, and their collaborations with Xbox and PS5 bear fruit.",

        "selftext": "Are you sad about missing out on the NVDA, AMD, and AAPL runups? The good news is that the company that provides essential semiconductor capabilities to these companies is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.) TSM contractually manufactures chipsets for 499 clients. By focusing solely on contracted production, TSM has the smallest (5nm) chip on the market and a 3nm chip on the horizon, creating an infrastructural economic moat insurmountable even for the aforementioned veteran firms, who struggle to produce 7nm chips by comparison. Recently blowing Intel out of the water, TSMC is years ahead of its competitors.\n\nTSMC is trading at a 26.67 P/E ratio, compared to NVDA's 91 P/E and AMD's 152 P/E ratio. One reason for this cheap valuation is that people think Taiwan may be invaded by mainland China. As a student of international relations specifically studying Cross-Strait relations, I can tell you this is a fallacy. Taiwan-United States relations have never been better, and the United States even has a bill that almost explicitly says The United States will protect Taiwan in the event of an attack. [https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/why-us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-after-bill-help-taiwan](https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/why-us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-after-bill-help-taiwan)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e5ez47gq9jm51.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c6e97224e63f2b8eec427fb924111f7f5adaacc\n\nAnother reason why people may be scared of TSMC's future is because of mainland China's desire to get into the semiconductor industry. Recently, however, rumors that TSMC employees have been poached to mainland China's were proven false. The company is dead in the water, leaving TSMC as the sole fab.

        "selftext": "I will start off my discsussion using a couple of examples where investors/analysts missed the big picture and the company/stock has proven that they're much more than that.\n\n**Microsoft**\n\n\nIn July 2013, Microsoft stock had the biggest drop of the century after reporting their earnings. The stock dropped because of investors disappointment in the Surface RT laptop. They ignored the biggest elephant in the room that is Windows Azure, now known as Microsoft Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing division and it has been the major growth driver for Microsoft. Of course, the CEO change from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella helped but Satya's vision was all about cloud computing and it was completely ignored by investors at that time. \n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2013/07/19/as-shares-fall-12-percent-microsoft-experiences-its-biggest-drop-since-2000/\n\n**Apple**\n\nBack in 2018, investors/analysts were focusing on iPhone X sales figures. Warren Buffett saw the big picture. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said long-term investors of Apple\u2019s stock shouldn\u2019t obsess with near-term iPhone sales. \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going to spend loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X are going to be sold in a three-month period totally misses the point,\u201d he stated. His big picture was looking at Apple as a brand and its ecosystem\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/30/warren-buffett-says-he-bought-just-a-little-more-apple-recently.html\n\nLook at where Microsoft and Apple stocks were then and where they are trading at now.\n\n\n**Intel**\n\nI'd like to use the same logic for Intel. It dropped 20% after the earnings call last quarter in July. The big picture  Intel's Investors/analysts are  missing is that they are ignoring this industry leader\u2019s methodical transition into higher growth businesses and focusing solely on solvable supply chain problems ( 10 nm/7 nm transistor density issues). I will not be discussing the fact that AMD/NVidia are using 7 nm process and that Intel isn't. Also, the fact that TSMC will be on 5 nm by the time Intel fixes the 10 nm/7 nm node problems. Those are problems I'm well aware of and they have been beaten to death already. There is nothing I can add to that. I will talk about that later on but in the end as not the focal points. What I'd like to talk about and focus on is the data-centric transformation and its MobilEye division.\n\n\n**Data Centric Transformation**\n\nIntel in 2019 pivoted from being a PC centric business to a data centric business. The TAM of this is 250 billion dollars. Revenue in this business group has grown from 42% of revenue in 2015 to 51% of revenue over the TTM. While many business transitions result in periods of low performance, as firms switch focus from declining to new businesses, Intel has managed to grow its revenue by 12% compounded annually over the past four years as it better positions itself for future growth.\n\nhttps://channelbuzz.ca/2019/04/intel-emphasizes-data-centric-transformation-of-company-at-new-xeon-launch-30025/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\n**Self driving business**\n\nIntel purchased MobilEye in 2015. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel . Mobileye has a plan to dominate self-driving. Self driving taxis and cars are a big growth business. MobilEye is in a great position to capitalize on this business. Mobileye says it shipped 17.4 million systems last year. Today, over 40 million cars have Mobileye technology installed, and our products have been selected for implementation in serial production of 313 car models from our 27 OEM partners by 2017 (compared to 36 car models across seven OEMs in 2010). Some of the partners include Volkswagen, BMW, Nissan, Ford. It also has partnered with NIO, a Chinese EV company which people have dubbed the Chinese Tesla.\n\nThe firm\u2019s acquisition of Mobileye strategically positions it to build out its driverless technology business as well. In just three years, Mobileye has experienced rapid growth, with revenue increasing from $210 million in 2017 to $879 million in 2019. Its share of automobile semiconductor sales increased from just 0.5% to 1.9% over the same time. If Mobileye continues taking market share in this fast-growing segment, Mobileye\u2019s could provide a meaningful contribution to Intel\u2019s operations, as it made up just over 1% of revenue in 2019. ResearchAndMarkets.com expects the autonomous/driverless market to grow 18% compounded annually from 2020 to 2025. Intel is positioned to grow with this new market.\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/ford-expands-partnership-with-mobileye-intels-autonomous-driving-business/\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18039216/volkswagen-intel-mobileye-self-driving-ride-hailing-israel-2019\n\nhttps://newsroom.intel.com/news/mobileye-nio-partner-bring-level-4-autonomous-vehicles-consumers-china-beyond/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\nhttps://www.engadget.com/mobileye-testing-autonomous-cars-germany-104521486.html\n\n\n**PC Business**\n\nThis is the side of Intel most people immediately associate Intel with. Intel\u2019s PC-centric business is not something to write-off. There is still a piece of the PC-centric market where Intel has an opportunity to grow: graphics processing units (GPU). Allied Market Research, expects the GPU market to grow from $19.8 billion in 2019 to nearly $201 billion in 2027 or by 34% compounded annually. For example, Intel is aggressively entering the discreet GPU business, which is about 80% of the current GPU market. The iGPU processors codenamed Tiger Lake just released September 2nd. Intel poached AMD's GPU guy Raja Koduri and nVidia's Tom Peterson. Intel hired engineers and marketing experts from Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA, the market leader in the space, to assemble a team to develop and rollout the firm\u2019s Intel Xe GPU.\n\nIntel is also releasing entry level processors. The entry-level processors will be targeted at budget-tier laptops and fanless mini desktops when they launch in early 2021. \n\nhttps://www.nextplatform.com/2020/09/02/intel-puts-its-xe-gpu-stakes-in-the-ground/\nhttps://wccftech.com/intel-jasper-lake-10nm-tremont-atom-cpus-leak-pentium-celeron-skus-2021/\n\n\n**7 nm/10 nm process**\n\nSince I have your attention until here - I'd like to say one final thing about this debacle. Lot of people assume that Intel's problems with this are due to complacency. Its not. Its due to Intel attempting to achieve and do something others have been unable to do, which is the exact opposite of complacency. Intel tried to use GAAFET for 7 nm when TSMC and Samsung warned Intel not to.  Intel was warned by TSMC and Samsung that the GAA-FET technique is too challenging to implement at this point in time, but Intel\u2019s pride and persistence led it to stubbornly try and tackle the GAA-FET problem, until it finally conceded this July.\n\nI agree Intel fucked up here but the point I'm trying to make is that this was not due to complacency as widely believed. Intel has a lot of management problems, hostile work environment etc but complacency is not one of them.  Intel never got complacent about its objectives, but it may have gotten complacent about its approaches, methods, and processes.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/i8qrx4/intel_exemployee_reveals_insider_details_on/\nhttps://www.dvhardware.net/article73530.html\n\n\n**Tl/DR; Post Summary / Post Script** : \n\nI'm perfecty aware that AMD and nVidia are eating Intel's lunch and have better more powerful CPUs/GPUs. However, Intel is much more than that and its other divisions are what will drive future growth. Analysts and investors are missing this big picture.",

What do you guys think of the portfolio overall?\n2. How risky is it to keep only tech stocks? It's kind of the only field I personally like so I figured it'd be better to pick companies I know and like\n\nThanks to any helpers!!",

        "selftext": "Hi all, let me start off by saying I don't care if I win money or lose money in this project; I just want to get it done because the class ends in November. It's a group project, and my other members are not participating at all, so I thought this subreddit could help out more. I've been giving them suggestions of stocks to buy, but to no avail. \n\nWe need to make two portfolios. Both have a limit of $1,000,000. We have to spend at least $900,000. The first portfolio is a buy and hold portfolio on paper. For this portfolio, we have to buy 5 stocks and our purchase price is 9/18 closing price. The second is a managed portfolio in which we can buy stocks, ETFs, trade options, short sell, and margin trade. We have to buy 5 stocks by tomorrow at 4pm for this portfolio and our purchase price is what we bought them at. For both portfolios, no one stock can be more than 25% of our portfolio. \n\nI'm pretty sure I'm going to be the one to end up making the trades tomorrow, so I'd appreciate some suggestions just to make it easier. So far I've thought about: NVIDIA, AMD, BYND, WMT, HD, DG, PENN, INTC, MSFT, AMZN, SHOP, ARKK, SPY. I'd also appreciate if you guys could suggest % weights for each stock in each portfolio. That's the part that is bothering me the most since I'm literally not receiving any feedback from my group members. \n\nPS; if you do give a suggestion, please separate it between the two different portfolios. \n\nThank you in advance!!!!",

        "selftext": "3000x series... super popular and highly praised. everyone wants it. 2000 series was terrible so lots of 1000 series owners have sit it out and cant wait to grab the new cards once its released mid September. \n\nnvidia gpus also focus on raytracing and DLSS. neither of which amd has good solution for (since nvidia is the pioneer in this). DLSS is witch craft, able to easily double the FPS in games. it simply makes no more sense to buy amd gpu any more. plus nvidia has better drivers, as always.\n\nand dont  forget the Samsung deal. nvidia's able to reduce price on 3000 series cards due to samsung offering very cheap price, rumor is half of what TSMC offers. this means much higher margins when it reports next earnings. the EPS gonna go through the roof. \n\ncloud gaming is booming. its a new industry that analysts expect to grow to 5 billion industry in just a few years. nvidia is including a 1 year free GFN subscription with 3000 series purchase by the way, in order to further kickstart the cloud gaming business. cloud gaming is bascially video game streaming, like netflix. so if netlifx get crazy valuation even though its only a pure play in streaming, why cant nvidia? \n\ndata center business is growing strong. it surpassed gaming revenue for the first time. the AI business will continue to be a secular trend. we're living increasingly in a digital world. think of all the surveilllence system, what do you think power them to do facial recognization? its the GPUs. china's been expanding its police state and will only require even more GPUs to do the tasks and the rest of the world will follow too. \n\nonce nvidia finish the ARM aquision, it will have CPU capabilities just like intel and amd. and ARM cpus has been growing stronger every year. nvidia, being a new player in the CPU space, gonna compete against intel data center business by releasing cheaper cpus. \n\nalso, nvidia has superb software. its CUDA ecosystem is industry standard. its very hard to break away from an ecosystem. CUDA is to AI what microsoft office is to office work. amd and intel are not gonna be able to take its place. \n\nnvidia market cap now is only 300 billion. 1 trillion is totally achievable within 1 year, honestly i wouldnt even be surprised if it achieves 700 billion before the end of 2020, especially with the QE environment we are in right now. it will be the first semiconductor company with 1 trillion valuation and it well deserves it.",

        "selftext": "Tdlr; both you smooth brained mouth breathers, but mostly AMD. Positions included. Bought about 6k of options on the dip, mostly AMD, hopefully this ages well. \n\n[positions](https://imgur.com/a/ICcKMqE)\n\n\nNone of this is financial advice go talk to a professional for financial advice. This is just the rambling of person who trades with their gut with little to no DD but uses common sense and market sentiment to make decisions. (Like gambling but sugar coated bs to make it sound better). Not doing  to bad though so ehh. Also diversity? That\u2019s for suckers, or people with yachts. \u26f5\ufe0f  take that attitude back to r/interesting.\n\n\nSo we all know AMD coming for that booty. However, let\u2019s not overlook a few things most people here miss. \n\nAMD\u2019s validation is supported by them continuing to execute. Otherwise it\u2019ll drop faster than you can say circuit breaker. (I think they will, even If they have a couple hiccups here and there) \n\nEveryone knows Intel is shit, and they are trying anything they can to buy time. They\u2019ve realized people will switch after running the market for basically ever. That\u2019s why they are changing gears on their production plans. Yes yes they are severely behind now, sorta. Intel\u2019s 10nm chips actually have more transistors than AMD\u2019s 7nm chips do, they just can\u2019t make then reliably, which doesn\u2019t help their chance of going to 7 anytime soon. However they have metric tons of cash at their disposal to try and address the problem. \n\nAll Intel needs to do is have a bit of good news and it\u2019ll pop. I think they recover some near term, especially as we approach earnings and people remember how dirt cheap it is, because AMD isn\u2019t going to take the market share over night. That\u2019s when I plan to start unwinding the 2021 plays. I\u2019ll hold the leaps for a while because I think Intel has a chance to right the ship, and recover some grown, but I think AMD will permanently eat 40-50% of the market. Too many Intel fan boys (think Apple fan boys, like my re re self, but worse, because they let the competition run the table on them. Intel has been more focused on its PR and looking good, rather than continuing to dominate). \n\nWith as much as they spend on R&amp;D they are seriously screwed because of their reputation towards employees and hiring practices *only my opinion disclaimer blah blah blah *. (Source: have plenty of friends who have, and currently work for Intel as engineers in production and other departments). They\u2019re more concerned with hiring people to meet their target numbers rather than the best candidates, because there\u2019s some people hired that I just shake my head at. They all hate their lives because of how much they get worked and their work life balance is just work, and they still can\u2019t make shit. Point being, they need to start hitting the right people not their targeted people. Burn out is real and people move on quickly from that place. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if Intel gets its shit together fast enough to stay on top of AMD (in the long run), but it\u2019s hard to bet against it completely with how much money they have at their disposal to make shit happen if they could just spend it better. Money talks, at the end the day. Bad rep or not, pay enough and people will come and suck it up. \n\nThat\u2019s why I have the leaps. They\u2019re too dirt cheap to not pick up a flyer or two. If the race heats up even a little between the two Intel\u2019s price will pop and its multiple should increase to at least 17 vs 9 or almost double.",

        "selftext": "I thought it would be cool to post my stock portfolio and overall strategy as a means to see what you think I am doing great, what I am doing bad and what I could possibly change for the better. Feel free to post your own strategy on the comments below or PM me and I can offer my insights as well. \n\nI have been investing about $20 dollars a day in my portfolio. I have been investing from $.25 cents to about a $1 per stock in my portfolio on a daily basis. \n\n**My main stock components: These are the companies I feel very good about for the most part and that I think have the greatest competitive advantages and opportunity.** \n\nWFC $1 per day - Wells Fargo is a well known bank that has been hit hard by COVID and will be hit harder given the relatively low interest rates for the next few years at least. However, in the long term they seem to have low debt overall, they often pay a good dividend in good times and I believe they will survive.\n\n**ASR/OMAB/COPA**\\- $2 dollars total - I believe airports have a wide competitive moat given the nature of their industry. They need to be used contrary to airlines that face more competition from competing airlines. All three of these airports are based either in Mexico and Latin America solely because I haven't done research on more airports. The first two have good fundamentals and have growing eps, book value, free cash flow and strong gross and operating margins. \n\n**DFS** $1 per day - Discover Financial Services- A well known credit card financial institution that seems to have good investments, growth opportunity and is striving to reach middle-Americans. \n\n**PFE (Pfzier)**\\- $.50 a day- the only pharmaceutical in my portfolio that is well known and seems more fairly valued than some of the others. They have been working for a cure/vaccine for COVID. \n\n**BTI-** $1 a day - One of the tobacco companies that seem to have better fundamentals than some of the others (maybe with the exception of Philip Morris?). They often pay a good dividend, have been stable, and have lower debt than some of the others. \n\n**STOR (STORE Capital)** $1. They are a reit that specializes in net-lease properties. I honestly am still learning more about reits in general and how to properly evaluate them. However, they definitely have good fundamentals, their CEO Christopher VOLK believes in value investing and is a big fan of Warren Buffet. He has been increasing EPS, Free Cash Flow, and has strong profit and operating margins. \n\n**BUD- $1** \\- I still need to do more overall research on this stock but the nature of the industry makes this have a natural moat. It seems to be well known and loved by natives and those who drink their beverage products. \n\n**VIAC $.75** \\- They are the owners of CBS, Nickelodeon, BET, Comedy Central, Showtime, international networks, and Simon &amp; Schuster book publisher. \n\n**INTC (Intel)** $.75 Probably the only tech stock in my portfolio. While all the other tech stocks have gone up wild INTC actually took a dip. Intel has a wide moat given its name recognition and many computers use Intel parts. I heard they are probably becoming more obsolete but price wise and business-wise I still think they are undervalued to fairly valued. They provide a decent dividend. \n\n**POR (Portland General Electric)** $.75- They also seem to have good, overall fundamentals, and a competitive advantage at least in the Pacific Coast as providers and distributors of energy. They made a recent mistake by overpaying for electricity trades in California but this seems like an easily fixible and avoidable mistake in the future. \n\n**SECOND Tier (Pure Value Plays) Invest about $.50 per day**\n\n**XRX (Xerox**) $50 a day- They were hit hard by COVID but still seem to have overall good valuation/fundamentals. They are losing their competitive strategy but I think they are still profitable and their products are not obscelete yet although people are going digitally. People still need to print and they are slowly going to head back to their offices. \n\n**MLR $50**  A much smaller company that focuses on providing tow truck and towing equipment manufacturing in Tennesse. Their products are naturally needed as cars get into accidents, have failures in the streets, or simply need to be transported for various reasons. Especially since Tennesse is spread out it seems that the tow-trucking industry is essential and many people will need their services. \n\n**NTR (Nutrien)** $.50 - They are a Canadian based fertilizer company. They are the larger producers of potash and the third-largest producer of nitrogen fertilizer in the world. They provide various agricultural products to farmers and other merchants. They seem to have decent to good fundamentals and also provide a decent dividend. \n\n**VEDL (Vedanta Limited) $.50** They are a precious metals operator in iron gold, aluminum, and various others to a lesser extent. They seem undervalued. They are trading for about $7 and their average stock price goes from $10-20. With the ever-increasing expansionary monetary and fiscal policies especially right now and low-interest rates I believe that the price of commodities will be going up. Instead of investing in commodities why not invest in precious metals manufacturing with good fundamentals? They also have a decent dividend at about 5-6%. \n\n**REITS (MAC, PK, EPR Properties, ESRT**) $.50 each or $2 total. Like I said they I still need to learn more about investing in reits but these seem like some of the most decent that have good current ratios, relatively low to modest debt and I believe they will survive (hopefully lol). \n\n**HNNA (Hennesy Advisors)** \\- $.25 They are starting to trade and fair value again. They are an active mutual fund company. In addition to trading at fair value they provide a big, overall dividend at about 5-6%. They have low valuations and very little to no debt. \n\n**Risk/Value Plays (Shorter-term investment stocks).** \n\n**MGM** \\- $.25With things starting to reopen again I believe that travel will begin to pick up. I plan on holding this stock for at least until next summer, if not a little longer. \n\n**BMA** $.25 I overpaid for this stock pre-COVID but I think they are decent. The main problem is the economic situation of Argentina with hyperinflation. Nonetheless, I am hoping that within the next 5-10 years their situation improves. The company itself seems to have good fundamentals and while they suspended their dividend they usually pay about 10% or more in good times. \n\n**SAVE** \\- $25. The only airline stock in my portfolio. They seem better financed, with better fundamentals than other airlines. \n\n**CCL** \\- $.25 Same reasoning as MGM\n\n**FL** \\- $25 - Seems to be trading at about fair value. I have invested in this stock since before COVID. \n\n**Macy's/GIII** \\- $.25 ($.50 total) I believe these two stocks still have potential. GIII might have better fundamentals in general but I believe both will bounce back up to some degree. \n\n**Trip Advisor** \\- $.25 Same reasoning as MGM and CCL",

        "selftext": " I thought it would be cool to post my stock portfolio and overall strategy as a means to see what you think I am doing great, what I am doing bad and what I could possibly change for the better. Feel free to post your own strategy on the comments below or PM me and I can offer my insights as well.\n\nI have been investing about $20-30 dollars a day in my portfolio. I have been investing from $.25 cents to about a $1 per stock in my portfolio on a daily basis.\n\n**My main stock components: These are the companies I feel very good about for the most part and that I think have the greatest competitive advantages and opportunity.**\n\nWFC $1 per day - Wells Fargo is a well known bank that has been hit hard by COVID and will be hit harder given the relatively low interest rates for the next few years at least. However, in the long term they seem to have low debt overall, they often pay a good dividend in good times and I believe they will survive.\n\n**ASR/OMAB/COPA**\\- $2 dollars total - I believe airports have a wide competitive moat given the nature of their industry. They need to be used contrary to airlines that face more competition from competing airlines. All three of these airports are based either in Mexico and Latin America solely because I haven't done research on more airports. The first two have good fundamentals and have growing eps, book value, free cash flow and strong gross and operating margins.\n\n**DFS** $1 per day - Discover Financial Services- A well known credit card financial institution that seems to have good investments, growth opportunity and is striving to reach middle-Americans.\n\n**PFE (Pfzier)**\\- $.50 a day- the only pharmaceutical in my portfolio that is well known and seems more fairly valued than some of the others. They have been working for a cure/vaccine for COVID.\n\n**BTI-** $1 a day - One of the tobacco companies that seem to have better fundamentals than some of the others (maybe with the exception of Philip Morris?). They often pay a good dividend, have been stable, and have lower debt than some of the others.\n\n**STOR (STORE Capital)** $1. They are a reit that specializes in net-lease properties. I honestly am still learning more about reits in general and how to properly evaluate them. However, they definitely have good fundamentals, their CEO Christopher VOLK believes in value investing and is a big fan of Warren Buffet. He has been increasing EPS, Free Cash Flow, and has strong profit and operating margins.\n\n**BUD- $1** \\- I still need to do more overall research on this stock but the nature of the industry makes this have a natural moat. It seems to be well known and loved by natives and those who drink their beverage products.\n\n**VIAC $.75** \\- They are the owners of CBS, Nickelodeon, BET, Comedy Central, Showtime, international networks, and Simon &amp; Schuster book publisher.\n\n**INTC (Intel)** $.75 Probably the only tech stock in my portfolio. While all the other tech stocks have gone up wild INTC actually took a dip. Intel has a wide moat given its name recognition and many computers use Intel parts. I heard they are probably becoming more obsolete but price wise and business-wise I still think they are undervalued to fairly valued. They provide a decent dividend.\n\n**POR (Portland General Electric)** $.75- They also seem to have good, overall fundamentals, and a competitive advantage at least in the Pacific Coast as providers and distributors of energy. They made a recent mistake by overpaying for electricity trades in California but this seems like an easily fixible and avoidable mistake in the future.\n\n**SECOND Tier (Pure Value Plays) Invest about $.50 per day**\n\n**XRX (Xerox**) $50 a day- They were hit hard by COVID but still seem to have overall good valuation/fundamentals. They are losing their competitive strategy but I think they are still profitable and their products are not obscelete yet although people are going digitally. People still need to print and they are slowly going to head back to their offices.\n\n**MLR $50** A much smaller company that focuses on providing tow truck and towing equipment manufacturing in Tennesse. Their products are naturally needed as cars get into accidents, have failures in the streets, or simply need to be transported for various reasons. Especially since Tennesse is spread out it seems that the tow-trucking industry is essential and many people will need their services.\n\n**NTR (Nutrien)** $.50 - They are a Canadian based fertilizer company. They are the larger producers of potash and the third-largest producer of nitrogen fertilizer in the world. They provide various agricultural products to farmers and other merchants. They seem to have decent to good fundamentals and also provide a decent dividend.\n\n**VEDL (Vedanta Limited) $.50** They are a precious metals operator in iron gold, aluminum, and various others to a lesser extent. They seem undervalued. They are trading for about $7 and their average stock price goes from $10-20. With the ever-increasing expansionary monetary and fiscal policies especially right now and low-interest rates I believe that the price of commodities will be going up. Instead of investing in commodities why not invest in precious metals manufacturing with good fundamentals? They also have a decent dividend at about 5-6%.\n\n**REITS (MAC, PK, EPR Properties, ESRT**) $.50 each or $2 total. Like I said they I still need to learn more about investing in reits but these seem like some of the most decent that have good current ratios, relatively low to modest debt and I believe they will survive (hopefully lol).\n\n**HNNA (Hennesy Advisors)** \\- $.25 They are starting to trade and fair value again. They are an active mutual fund company. In addition to trading at fair value they provide a big, overall dividend at about 5-6%. They have low valuations and very little to no debt.\n\n**Risk/Value Plays (Shorter-term investment stocks).**\n\n**MGM** \\- $.25With things starting to reopen again I believe that travel will begin to pick up. I plan on holding this stock for at least until next summer, if not a little longer.\n\n**BMA** $.25 I overpaid for this stock pre-COVID but I think they are decent. The main problem is the economic situation of Argentina with hyperinflation. Nonetheless, I am hoping that within the next 5-10 years their situation improves. The company itself seems to have good fundamentals and while they suspended their dividend they usually pay about 10% or more in good times.\n\n**SAVE** \\- $25. The only airline stock in my portfolio. They seem better financed, with better fundamentals than other airlines.\n\n**CCL** \\- $.25 Same reasoning as MGM\n\n**FL** \\- $25 - Seems to be trading at about fair value. I have invested in this stock since before COVID.\n\n**Macy's/GIII** \\- $.25 ($.50 total) I believe these two stocks still have potential. GIII might have better fundamentals in general but I believe both will bounce back up to some degree.\n\n**Trip Advisor** \\- $.25 Same reasoning as MGM and CCL\n\nIn addition to this I have invested very small portions in FCAU (Chrysler), URan Outfitters, and Capri holdings but I am starting to question whether they are sound investments. I have tried substitutes for them.",

You may have then been disappointed to learn that their margin requirements for writing puts is 100%.\n \nUnfortunately when Robinhood's risk management desk isn't too busy eating glue, they're busy keeping us safe from the dangers of unreasonable leverage. So you can't use margin buying power to cover twice as many contracts even though anyone whose brain doesn't have a mirror-like finish would realize this is in all ways safer than buying stock with margin.   \n  \nSo what do we do? We scroll all the way down the option chain and buy a put for $1. WHOA, suddenly we're not degenerate faggots trading secured puts, we're sophisticated investors trading put _spreads_.

Hear the angels sing \"Hosanah!\" as margin is unlocked and drool trickles down his chin.  \n  \nThen you realize that the strike on that dirt cheap put is only like 30% off the current stock price, so between the margin and the hard limit on your downside, you can sell 6x as many of these piss soaked contracts to the other retards on here. Just roll forever if the trade moves against you and youll never get margin called.   \n  \nThis isnt like normal spread trading because you're not actually paying for any theta. Its just a 3-6x leveraged position on the stock with continuous returns. You can get 12% a week from the premium alone if you're writing weeklies and roll every friday.\n  \n1.12^52 = 362x. \n  \nGo find something that's gonna trade sideways forever, like lmao fucking intel, and start writing.

        "selftext": "For all of you that lost money this week , I have a longer term play that can gain you back some of that money in a few months. Now, I am also as disappointed as most of you that TSLA did not get added to the index  - however I am sure they will make their way in. Teradyne TER is an absolute beast of a company and it was just announced that they have been added to the S&amp;P. They are the leading company in the Semiconductor testing space - their customers are the biggest names in the space TSMC, Intel, etc. They have been growing revenue and earnings at an incredible pace in recent years, and they have a rock solid balance sheet. They have made their way into the automation space mostly through solid acquisitions of companies that produce robots for industrial, warehouse, and other operations which just further diversifies them and moves them into another space set for explosive growth in the next 5 years.\n\nThey made a big run up leading into early August but have now slowed a bit even before the pullback this week which makes this play perfectly timed for a solid run-up leading into their next earnings and continue through the end of the year. Look at the 3-5 year chart this is unstoppable.\n\nI have not seen too much talk about them on WSB other than some DD leading up to their last earnings which was blockbuster but the stock dropped for a few days before continuing to run. \n\nI would suggest calls several months out so look for the Jan 15 2021 expiry's and a maybe C$90 or C$92.5 strike price.

        "selftext": "This confirms months of speculation...here are the initial thoughts from analysts.\n\n**Needham** \\- \"Will It Be Game Changing? We Shall See.\"\n\n\"We believe the acquisition represents a big risk but with potential huge awards. From a financial perspective, this acquisition is the largest deal in NVIDIA's history. We are not concerned about the size of the deal because NVIDIA generated $4.3BN of free cash flow in FY20 and is on track to generate $5.2BN in FY21, and hence we expect it to make up the $12BN in cash fairly quickly, even without a contribution from Arm. Additionally, the dilution represents only 7% of total shares - not a major event, in our view.\"\n\n\"Strategically, we believe there are several advantages: in the near-term, Arm IP is ubiquitous in the mobile phone and tablet markets with 95% share. NVDA can harvest that steady cash flow stream to finance growth. ARM has a cumulative number of licenses signed of 1,767 as of F4Q19 and 22.8 billion royalty units as reported by licensee. Longer-term, Arm is gaining inroads in the all the major secular growth drivers in technology including cloud and infrastructure equipment, edge IoT, robotics and self-driving vehicles. Arm technology is being used in advanced MCUs for IoT devices such as communication chips and sensors and broad range of networking equipment.\"\n\n\"On the skeptical side of the equation, we wonder about the anti-trust factors as Arm is the \"Arms-dealer\" in the semiconductor industry with a long list of customers, which include competitors, such as TI, MRVL, AMD, IFX, QCOM, AAPL, Samsung, NXPI, AVGO and others. We also need to have a better understanding of the long-term revenue ramp and overall TAM. Arm's net sales have been lackluster for the past two fiscal years, growing 3% in FY19 and declining in FY18 due to deterioration in overall business conditions in the semiconductor industry.\"\n\n**Jefferies**\u00a0\\- \"NVDA + ARM = $50 EPS Power in 2025\"\n\n\" We view the deal as transformative, positioning NVDA not just to capture 80% of the ecosystem value in the data center, but also unify the compute ecosystem between the edge and data center. We think the merged company has a 5-yr EPS power of $50, and increase our price target to $680, and bull-case to $1,000.\"\n\n\"We estimate the deal to be slightly accretive the first year after close.\"\n\n\"Transformative Deal - Heterogeneous Data Center Scale Solution Provider: In previous computing eras, one ecosystem typically controlled 80% of the profits of the ecosystem \u2013 in PCs it was Wintel, in Smartphones it is Apple. Due to the ecosystem it has created in Acceleration (processor, interconnect (MLNX), software stack including CUDA and vertical market software), we\u2019ve argued that Nvidia was best positioned to capture 80% of the profits of the Parallel Processing Era. However, with ARM, we think Nvidia is poised to also offer general purpose, heterogeneous data center scale solutions and ultimately capture up to 80% of the value of the serial processing part of the data center ecosystem as well. We also think that ARM gives it a larger moat in the data center.\"\n\n\"Transformative Deal - Unifying the Edge with the Data Center: the Cell Phone / Server Computing Era was the first where compute bifurcated, and two separate ecosystems operated in parallel (Apple\u2019s ecosystem in the Smartphone, and Wintel in the data center). Should Nvidia successfully acquire ARM, then the compute ecosystem will be unified from edge to data center, and we would expect Nvidia to offer more highly integrated compute solutions across the entire compute ecosystem, and realize the lion\u2019s share of the profits in this 4th Tectonic Shift in Computing.\"\n\n\"Five-year EPS Power of $50. We believe this is a differentiated interpretation of NVidia's earnings potential which stems from our view that Nvidia is supplying an ecosystem in the data center, much like Apple supplies to the smart phone market, or Intel and Microsoft did in PCs. In contrast to other traditional semiconductor competitors, Nvidia's ecosystem extends beyond processors, to high speed interconnect (MLNX) and a software stack. During the PC Era, Microsoft's PC operating profit was similar to Intel's, and we think Nvidia's earnings potential framework should be modeled more like Wintel, with half of its earnings power coming from the ecosystem that it created. We model Nvidia Data Center processor revenues of $34bn in 2025, and Data Center Ecosystem (software) of an additional $34bn.\"\n\n**RBC -** \"We continue to believe the same three major points: 1) biggest hurdle in our view is approval/official closing of transaction; 2) if the transaction closes, we think this would be a notable negative for Intel and a notable positive for Nvidia; and 3) with Apple, Amazon, and now Nvidia, a robust software ecosystem is ready to support an ARM-based server environment over the long term.\"\n\n\" What do Apple and Nvidia have in common? Access to successful software ecosystems. Since x86 has been the dominant player in the server market, Nvidia could argue that the transaction would create more competition against the x86 market. Currently, the market is largely Intel \\~85\u201390% (x86) and AMD 8\u201310% (x86) and a few points \u201cOther\u201d depending on how one defines the total market. If Nvidia puts research and development dollars behind the transaction, an ecosystem to compete against x86 would be possible, in our view, given Nvidia\u2019s success with CUDA. Finally, AWS has a new Graviton product based on ARM architecture. It is arguably a stable/solid alternative given its lower power consumption. We\u2019ve seen this story twice in the past in the Flops/Watt (GPU&gt;CPU) and TCO (AMD&gt;INTC\"\n\n**Raymond James** \\- \" As we had suspected earlier, much of the justification for the deal in the presentation centers on the datacenter market. Based on our initial read of the presentation, we view this as an assault on Intel\u2019s server CPU business. The intention would seem to be to become able to offer server customers a broader roadmap that covers both CPU, GPU and server. It\u2019s yet unclear however about how a NVDA datacenter business that would offer server CPUs benefit from NVDA owning ARM as opposed to simply being a licensee. Nonetheless, we do view this as a move on NVDA\u2019s part to compete more fully with both INTC and AMD in the server pace. MRVL is also an ARM licensee for server CPUs, but since MRVL has already announced that they would only pursue custom server CPU engagements going forward, we don\u2019t expect much impact to MRVL. Undoubtedly, the combination of ARM\u2019s leading processor IP with NVDA\u2019s GPU and AI IP will create a powerful combination. But it\u2019s not immediately clear how NVDA intends to leverage having ARM under their own ownership, and will expect that vision to be part of the company\u2019s presentation.\n\n\"The presentation notes that NVDA intends to continue ARM\u2019s open licensing model and NVDA IP would also be added to ARM\u2019s licensing business. That could certainly become additive to the revenue for the total licensing business, but more details will need to be provided to understand the potential revenue synergies.\"\n\n\"The transaction requires regulatory approval the U.K., China, the European Union and the United States. China approval will naturally be viewed as a risk given US/China trade tensions. Since ARM IP is the foundation of nearly all handsets and IOT devices, we would expect the deal to be highly scrutinized, and we would expect that NVDA would need to provide assurances that it will continue an open licensing model. NVDA is an ARM licensee, but ARM processors is a small part of NVDA\u2019s business, limited to the automotive business (3% of revenue) and the Nintendo Switch custom processor (4% of revenue, by our estimates). Therefore, since there is a very small part of revenue in which NVDA competes with ARM licensees, we don\u2019t expect that to raise significant regulatory concerns.\"",

        "selftext": " This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my [blog](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=r%2Finvesting) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i73sw1/deep_dive_into_the_reasons_behind_why_intel_is/), you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom for Intel. However, the reality is that\u2019s not necessarily the case. Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it\u2019s incredibly important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been overlooked in the past is packaging \u2013 essentially how you make the calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies, which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and lets the chip communicate with the outside world \u2013 as well as within the package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging, not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the falling benefits of moving to smaller processes \\[1\\], coupled with rapidly increasing costs \u2013 a EUV machine to make advanced processes can cost up to $125million \\[2\\], while the R&amp;D costs to make smaller processes are also increasing \\[3\\].\n\nWhat is packaging?\n\nThe best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker. Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making the \u2018workers\u2019 more productive in smaller spaces \u2013 first hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we\u2019re now at the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces (cubicles) it\u2019s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking\\[4\\]. In the terminology of our analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team can work on a job that they\u2019re specialised in, or where you can cut costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular department that\u2019s not too important instead of being forced to use identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a \u2018monolithic\u2019 , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure that communication flows easily and quickly between each different office building.\n\n3D stacking is like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing) to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat) escape. \n\nChiplets\n\nChiplets are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they\u2019re commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The most common method, the one that\u2019s widely used right now (notably in AMD\u2019s Zen 2 architecture), has an \u2018interposer\u2019 sitting underneath the chips you want to connect.\\[5\\] This interposer acts as a conduit between the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient (PCB traces).  AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we\u2019ll discuss later, but on a hardware level it\u2019s likely that they\u2019re using TSMC\u2019s CoWoS \u2013 Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation, the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). \\[6\\]The second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead. \\[7\\]While this approach is faster \u2013 each tunnel is dedicated to only connecting two dies, so you won\u2019t have issues where data is trying to get to lots of different places at once and getting \u2018stuck\u2019, as you would with AMD\u2019s approach, it\u2019s harder to design products for \u2013 you have to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really, this is a simple continuation of the two companies\u2019 philosophies. AMD\u2019s HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors. Meanwhile, Intel\u2019s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made it\u2019s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it\u2019s evident that each company has chosen the approach that\u2019s best for it \u2013 Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product, to get slightly better performance; while AMD\u2019s smaller size drives them to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD\u2019s own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the \u2018concrete foundation\u2019 is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which is impossible with Intel. \\[8\\] At the same time, it could also be used by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. \u2013 just like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market.\n\nChiplets are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they\u2019re sort of here from Intel, expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next few years, and will be here to stay. The two \u2018teams\u2019 have differing philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it\u2019ll be fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear, EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads, while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for the next two years at the very least.\n\n3D stacking\n\nIn theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges are sufficiently different that it\u2019s easier to discuss them separately.\n\n3D stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite the fact that Intel announced its\u2019 \u2018Foveros\u2019 stacking tech in 2019 \\[9\\], Samsung announced their \u2018X-cube\u2019 packaging a few weeks ago \\[10\\], and TSMC announcing their \u20183DFabric\u2019 family just a few days ago \\[11\\], the reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book, to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical footprint.\\[12\\] Even \u2018true\u2019 3D stacking \u2013 where you build layers one on top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn\u2019t far behind.\\[13\\] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). \\[14\\] These are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data. Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can technically stack any chips we want together right now \u2013 TSMC\u2019s SoIC is slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), \\[11\\] the issue is that cutting edge chips \u2013 especially x86 chips used in datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat. AMD Epyc\u2019s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power \u2013 an approximation of how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, \\[15\\]while Intel\u2019s Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. \\[16\\] When you consider the fact that all this heat is coming off a piece of silicon &lt;500mm2, it\u2019s apparent that it\u2019s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a paradigm shift in design philosophies \u2013 either drastic improvements in efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip, making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as is the case with current designs. \\[17\\] Obviously, this is completely uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die and reap the speed benefits between those two chips \u2013 for instance Samsung\u2019s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of a logic die. \\[10\\] We\u2019re likely to see a few years of this sort of in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic dies, before we reach the \u2018Holy Grail\u2019 of high-power logic on logic \u2013 and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away that it\u2019s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive \u2013 even leading, in the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly effective, both in cost and performance.\n\nAfter reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn\u2019t I going to tell you why Intel\u2019s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the opposite doesn\u2019t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel\u2019s future is promising is threefold.\n\n1. Packaging is in its\u2019 infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we\u2019re at the very start of the diminishing returns graph, where it\u2019s easy to make big strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has \u2018won\u2019 the battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic, unified approach to designing a chip proving useful.\n\n2. Intel spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in 2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%). \\[18\\]\\[19\\] Although Intel\u2019s operations are broader, with investments in anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it\u2019s likely that Intel\u2019s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of competitors. In addition, Intel\u2019s engineers are colloquially known to be some of the best in the business. It\u2019s current woes are largely a function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based.\n\n3. Intel\u2019s (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a comeback \u2013 a terrifying thought for any competitors. \n\nIf these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak.\n\nSemiconductors are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I\u2019m investing in, and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly throws at us.\n\nFeel free to contact me if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like me to look at, and thanks for taking the time to read!\n\n\\[1\\] https://cartesianproduct.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/the-end-of-dennard-scaling/\n\n\\[2\\] https://www.eetimes.com/euv-tool-costs-hit-120-million/\n\n\\[3\\] http://euvlsymposium.lbl.gov/pdf/2012/pres/G.%20Yeric.pdf\n\n\\[4\\] https://semiengineering.com/knowledge\\_centers/packaging/advanced-packaging/\n\n\\[5\\] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340843129\\_Chiplet\\_Heterogeneous\\_Integration\\_Technology-Status\\_and\\_Challenges\n\n\\[6\\] https://www.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/services/cowos.htm\n\n\\[7\\] https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/emib.html\n\n\\[8\\] https://www.amd.com/en/campaigns/hpc-solutions-webinar\n\n\\[9\\] [https://www.eejournal.com/article/intel-foveros-3d-packaging/](https://www.eejournal.com/article/intel-foveros-3d-packaging/)\n\n\\[10\\] https://news.samsung.com/global/tag/samsung-x-cube\n\n\\[11\\]TSMC Technology Symposium 2020\n\n\\[12\\] https://sst.semiconductor-digest.com/chipworks\\_real\\_chips\\_blog/2019/01/16/the-packaging-of-apples-a12x-is-weird/\n\n\\[13\\] https://www.nvmdurance.com/history-of-3d-nand-flash-memory/\n\n\\[14\\] http://www.appliedmaterials.com/files/Applied\\_TSV\\_Primer.pdf\n\n\\[15\\] [https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7742](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7742)\n\n\\[16\\] https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/194146/intel-xeon-platinum-9282-processor-77m-cache-2-60-ghz.html\n\n\\[17\\] https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02503-1\n\n\\[18\\] https://www.intc.com/filings-reports/all-sec-filings/content/0000050863-20-000011/0000050863-20-000011.pdf\n\n\\[19\\] https://www.tsmc.com/download/ir/annualReports/2019/english/index.html\n\n\\[20\\] https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-leadership-tech-team-changes-not-delayed-murthy-renduchintala-leaves",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 2, 2020**\n\nStocks continued advancing on Wednesday, with investors encouraged by positive economic data and moderating COVID-19 infection rate in previous epicenters. Tech stocks once again led the charge, with industry bellwethers like Amazon ($AMZN) and Google ($GOOG) all opening at new record high. Apple ($AAPL) and Tesla ($TSLA) pulled back sharply from their post-stock split highs.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday during a congressional hearing of the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis that he believed a bipartisan agreement on further fiscal stimulus \u201cstill should be reached. \n\nNewly announced economic data continues to surpass Wall St estimates. The ISM manufacturing index hit its highest levels since Aug 2018 and construction spending increasing. However, reports on the labor market are showing slower recovery. Per CNBC, \u2018private payroll gains in August totaled 428,000, or less than half the 1 million jobs expected\u2019.\n\nFollowing the best month in decades, investors appear hopeful and active in a usually slow month. There\u2019s hope that increasingly better economic data, support from the Federal Reserve, the potential for fiscal stimulus, and a vaccine in the short, and states reopening can continue to push the market higher.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Macy\u2019s ($M) temporarily alleviated fears of bankruptcy with a surprisingly encouraging earnings report. Stock was modestly down today.\n* AMC\u2019s ($AMC) news that it would be reopening more theaters this weekend. Stock was up 16% today.\n* Intel $INTC launches 11th Gen Intel processors with, reportedly the world\u2019s best processors for thin-and-light laptops. More than 150 designs based on 11th  Gen Intel Core processors are expected\n* Amarin[ $](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMRN&amp;src=cashtag_click)AMRN declined 28% on midday Wednesday as oral arguments on its appeal of a March ruling invalidating certain patents of its heart drug Vascepa begin\n* Berenberg decreased ($AAL) American Airlines price target from $14 to $10. (which is strange considering that today, they upgraded ($LUV) Southwest Airlines)\n* ($SDC) Smile Direct Club insiders (CEO, CFO and Director) purchased a combined 1.96 Million shares of stock for about $16 Million. Shares are up 23% so far in the day\n* Nvidia ($NVDA) has been on a tear recently. Stock is up 11.9% since Friday.\n\n**Notable Earnings for tomorrow, Sept 3:** Broadcom Inc ($AVGO), Campbell Soup ($CPB), Cooper Companies Inc ($COO), Docusign Inc ($DOCU),",

        "selftext": "Back in July, Barron\u2019s ran a story profiling the rise of Nvidia as the company moved past Intel in market cap to become the most valuable US semiconductor company. The article cited Nvidia\u2019s favorable exposure to data center, gaming, and AI as major reasons why the company overtook top spot from Intel. Only two months later, Nvidia is now worth $107bn more than Intel. In other words, Nvidia is worth more than an AMD more than its Santa Clara rival. Around the same time, AMD also began to see significant outperformance relative to Intel shares. With continued momentum in the PC market on the back of its Ryzen processors and increased success in data center with the EPYC product line, AMD has risen 57% since the start of July. Over that period, Intel declined 15%. \n\nIn contrast to Nvidia and AMD, Intel is disproportionately associated with the PC. Yet even within the PC market, analyst commentary has been overwhelmingly positive on AMD whereas doubts have surfaced over Intel\u2019s ability to innovate and remain competitive. In the span of a week at the end of July, Intel announced a major delay with its 7nm chips and AMD beat Q2 earnings, raised guidance, and hit its highest PC market share since 2013. However, the focus on Intel as a struggling PC player has wrongly overlooked several important developments that set the company up for a near-term rebound in PC and long-term revenue opportunities in the same higher growth end markets that have fueled premium valuations for both Nvidia and AMD. \n\n1. Release of Tiger Lake processor, expanded efforts in graphics via Xe architecture, and development of discrete GPUs for data center and desktop\n2. Continued momentum in company shift to data-centric business first and PC business second\n3. Expanded Total Addressable Market (TAM) associated with edge computing and edge-enabled technologies\n4. Competitive positioning in autonomous vehicle technology\n\nIntel is currently priced for stagnant to declining revenues, further market share erosion, and lower relative probability of success compared to Nvidia and AMD. Given recent product releases and refreshes, as well as a strong strategic vision to increase share in these higher growth end markets, [Intel revenue is more likely to accelerate and lead to significant multiple expansion in the coming years](https://blackjacketco.com/f/new-brand-new-intel-growth-ahead-for-tiger-lake-edge-and-av). \n\n* Assigning Intel CY23 PT of $125 per share\n* FY23 revenue projected at $100bn\n* FY23 net income projected at $34bn delivering 7.55 in EPS\n* Applying 16.55x P/E and 4.55 P/S \n\n**Tiger Lake and Renewed PC Innovation** \n\nYesterday Intel finally revealed the highly anticipated Tiger Lake 11th generation processors for ultra-thin high-performance laptops. Industry reporting in previous months had speculated that the new system-on-chip (SoC \u2013 incorporates different components like graphics and AI into one integrated unit) would offer CPU performance advances and improvements in graphics and AI. Intel even leaked some specs on Monday that seemed to confirm some of the performance metrics. Although independent industry studies are required to run Tiger Lake through its full paces, the event demonstrated that not only can Intel still innovate, it is more than premature to start counting the company out on PCs. \n\nTiger Lake clocks up to 20% higher frequencies compared to the 10th generation Ice Lake family and can reach a single core turbo of 4.8 GHz. During the presentation, Intel noted that the integrated Iris Xe graphics perform better than 90% of PCs sold last year, on-board AI is up to 5x more effective, and WiFi connectivity is up to 3x faster. In a like-for-like comparison to AMD, Tiger Lake enabled 4x faster photo upscaling, 2x faster video processing and exporting via Adobe Pro, and 20% faster performance in both Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. For gaming, Intel conducted side-by-side tests using Gears Tactics. Laptops running AMD 4800U with integrated graphics and a Nvidia MX350 discrete graphics card (with Intel 10th Gen i7) performed worse than Tiger Lake. Intel\u2019s test showed that Tiger Lake handled the game at up to 66% higher frames per second versus the AMD and Nvidia-powered laptops. \n\nBarring significant discrepancies found during independent reviews, Intel just delivered performance on 10nm that is equivalent to what is possible on 7nm. With the simultaneous launch of the Evo brand to encompass the new 11th generation-powered ultra-thin high-performance laptop range, Intel can begin building customer brand recognition and altering perceptions that Intel has lost competitive footing in the PC market. With 50 PC designs set to ship with Tiger Lake as soon as this fall, and at least 150 designs anticipated from partner OEMs, Intel may see a very near-term recovery in its PC market share even despite the 7nm delay. \n\n**Transition to Data-Centric Business and Future at the Edge**\n\nMore important to Intel\u2019s future is the multi-year shift towards higher-growth end markets associated with cloud, edge, and data. Rather than PCs, Intel sees its primary business as the Data-Centric reporting segment that now comprises 52% of revenues. That figure is likely to expand in coming quarters following 34% YoY growth in the most recent earnings report. In FY19 Q2, the Data-Centric segment only accounted for 46% of revenues. \n\nThat Data-Centric segment includes: The Data Center Group (36.3% of total Intel revenues); Non-Volatile Memory Storage Group (8.5%); Internet-of-Things Group (3.4%); Programmable Solutions Group (2.6%); and Mobileye (0.7%). The two largest contributors to the segment are performing extremely well. The Data Center Group grew 43% YoY and saw operating income climb 72%. The second largest business in the segment, Non-Volatile Memory Storage, grew 76% YoY for record revenue on the back of NAND demand growth and higher Average Selling Prices (ASPs). \n\nBy 2024, Intel expects its TAM to reach $300bn. But $230bn of this is attributed to the Data-Centric TAM. And Intel\u2019s own calculations may be slightly conservative. In the company\u2019s analysis of its various end markets, Intel only mentioned the edge compute market in general terms. Yet that market alone is projected to surpass $100bn by 2030. As much as public cloud adoption drove demand for server-related products over the past five years, the edge could end up being a far more important trend. That is because, in addition to further server demand, the edge will enable billions of IoT devices to finally become widespread after years of hype. With TAM growth associated with edge server CPU, GPU, and storage, plus IoT and edge AI solutions, Intel can achieve growth into the 2030s so long as the company can execute on its strategic vision.  \n\n*Edge Server* \n\nAn S&amp;P Global study in spring 2020 estimated that Intel has 90-95% share of the data center CPU market despite recent share gains by AMD. While edge server architectures and processes differ versus hyperscale cloud servers, this figure is testament to the strength of Intel\u2019s relationships with the leading cloud providers that are also among the early movers in the edge computing space \u2013 namely Amazon with its Lambda@Edge platform, Microsoft with Azure Functions, and Google with Google Cloud Functions.  \n\nFor smaller edge providers especially, like Fastly, Akamai, or Cloudflare, there will be particular emphasis on price-per-performance for server components. Until recently, that dynamic favored AMD whose EPYC Rome 7742 processor rivals Intel\u2019s Xeon Platinum 8280 on performance yet undercuts it on price by about 60%. The cost efficiency of EPYC led to some important edge server design wins for AMD, including Cloudflare\u2019s new GenX server that excluded Intel parts for the first time. \n\nThe latest Xeon processors had been on the market for a couple years, though, and Intel refreshed the product line earlier this year in an attempt to greatly reduce cost while maintaining performance. In its 24 February press release, Intel directly addressed the need to become more competitive with AMD on price-per-performance noting that the Xeon refresh: \u201c\u2026\\[reinforces\\] Intel\u2019s data center leadership by providing greater performance and performance-per-dollar choices for\u2026customers across cloud, network and edge.\u201d While Intel compromised on compatibility with certain server designs, the result is 1.42x better price-per-core-performance and a cost of $141 per-core for the Gold 6258R. The price tag puts Xeon in a much stronger position relative to EPYC Rome 7742 which goes for $108 per-core. \n\nDespite early advantages in cost-per-performance for AMD, Intel still managed to double its edge deployments year-over-year according to Forbes. And its impressive partner list includes Lenovo, Red Hat, Advantech, Caswell, Inventec, Lanner, Nexcom, World Wide Technology, Ericsson, ZTE, Verizon, Vodafone, Nokia, and China Telecom, among others. With drastic improvements in price-per-performance, Intel could very well see additional customer wins in upcoming quarters. \n\nBeyond CPU, edge applications will see an increase in demand for integrated and hybrid GPUs. Between advancements in Intel Xe graphics and its development of discrete graphics cards, the company will become better positioned to take advantage of the more than 33% CAGR projected for GPUs from 2020 to 2027 \u2013 taking the market from just under $20bn in 2019 to over $200bn according to Deloitte. Even if Nvidia and AMD maintain large leads over Intel in GPU market share for edge servers, even a marginal portion of the market could be meaningful to the Data Center Group which measured around $7bn in Q2. \n\nIn addition, edge servers present an unprecedented opportunity for NAND solutions as well \u2013 specifically flash storage that utilizes the NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) protocol. Edge servers have strong need for high-performance startup operations and extremely reliable storage. That is because rapid startup times are critical for edge providers to quickly launch computing instances and deliver the lowest possible latency for their customers. Improvements in NVMe NAND greatly shrink the physical storage footprint, reduce power and cooling costs, all the while improving the overall speed, flexibility, and failure rates. And Intel Optane and 3D NAND SSDs are exceptionally reliable for storage and offer performance improvements over legacy storage solutions. \n\n*IoT and AI*\n\nMuch like edge servers, edge deployed IoT devices will similarly boost demand for Intel processors. For workload intensive industrial IoT, Intel has its Core processor. And the Intel Atom processor is purpose-built for lower-power or embedded applications. Because IoT devices will collect and process vast amounts of data, these applications will also require significant amounts of flash memory \u2013 specifically NAND. On-device NAND SSD can increase data transfer speeds while also integrating module-level security features, remote management, and more flexible power configurations. Collectively, improvements in NAND will lower total cost of ownership for these machines.  \n\nThe edge will lead to rapid growth for edge AI chipsets that enable IoT devices to deploy machine learning at the edge without having to send data via internet back to a centralized data center. Deloitte notes that around 300 million edge AI chips were sold in 2017, but this year could see more than 750 million units hit the market. With compounded annual growth in edge AI chipsets anticipated to outpace the broader semiconductor industry by a considerable amount, ABI research predicts that these edge chips will surpass the market for cloud AI chips by 2025 \u2013 marking a massive shift. \n\n**Mobileye and Autonomous Driving Technology** \n\nIt is interesting the extent to which mainstream conversations in media and financial commentary largely exclude Intel\u2019s Mobileye and instead focus on Tesla as the technology leader in autonomous vehicles and Nvidia as the chipmaker best positioned to disrupt. Although Telsa claims to offer autonomous modes for its vehicles, based on the 5-level autonomous capability hierarchy \u2013 the industry standard established by the Society of Automotive Engineers \u2013 the most advanced cars currently on the market only operate at level 2+. Level 2+ falls between levels 2 (partial automation) and 3 (conditional automation). The hardware to support full level 5 autonomy does exist in 2020, and the software necessary to manage these systems is not too far behind. However, it will likely take 5-7 years before manufacturing volumes reach levels to drive down hardware prices, the necessary regulatory frameworks come into place, and fully autonomous vehicles gain broad consumer acceptance.  \n\nIn the intermediary period, the progression towards level 5 autonomy will continue to be gradual and incremental. Higher degrees of autonomy will be achieved by increasingly sophisticated advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that prove out the viability of these technologies and underpin the manufacturing, regulatory, and consumer environment that will facilitate the future arrival of self-driving cars. Beyond this, in many cases the same technology at the center of levels 4 and 5 builds on the existing foundations of ADAS capabilities. And the dominant player in the ADAS market is not Tesla, Waymo, or Nvidia. It is Mobileye. \n\nMobileye\u2019s market share has consistently stayed above 70% for years, even as competition from other players has ramped up \u2013 Nvidia in particular. The Mobileye solution is noteworthy, pairing its SoC \u2013 the EyeQ family \u2013 to support a range of ADAS capabilities using only a single camera sensor. This differs from the LiDAR and radar-based systems favored by Waymo, Uber, GM-owned Cruise, and Nvidia. Tesla \u2013 who previously used Mobileye technology until the two parted ways in 2016 \u2013 also leverages a camera-based system. However, Tesla deploys ultrasonic sensors and radars in combination with billions of miles of driver data. \n\nMobileye\u2019s commanding market share in ADAS means that its technology is used by more than 300 models from 25 global automakers, resulting in 60 million vehicles on the road worldwide. In contrast, Tesla currently has fewer than 1 million vehicles on the road equipped with variants of its autopilot technology. And Mobileye is already working with 4 major OEMs to soon provide level 3 autonomous solutions. As part of its arrangements with OEMs, Mobileye receives access to sensor data from customer vehicles. At present, Mobileye is collecting 3.7 million miles per day and growing as another 2 million vehicles from these OEMs are set to join the data-sharing program over the next two years. \n\nWhat this translates to is a massive partner network with the world\u2019s leading auto OEMs who will all have a vested interest in competing with Tesla both in autonomous but also electric vehicles. This also means that Mobileye has a significant advantage over Nvidia in getting its ADAS and future autonomous solutions on vehicles. As Mobileye further prioritizes its fully autonomous solutions, its leading competitive positioning in ADAS, as well its strong relationships with OEMs, gives the company a strategic advantage over its competitors as higher levels of autonomous technologies go to market. This is evidenced by Mobileye\u2019s strategic partnership with Tesla EV rival NIO to offer level 4 consumer vehicles by 2022. \n\nEven though Mobileye made its name based on its single camera platform, the company is separately developing what is called a full autonomous stack, incorporating the necessary LiDAR, radar, non-camera sensors, GPS, modems, and other hardware components that will run on its 5th generation EyeQ processor. In the meantime, Mobileye recently demoed a self-driving vehicle that navigated the congested streets of Jerusalem using only 12 cameras and no LiDAR, radar, or non-camera sensors. \n\nOn the back of the hyperbolic move in Tesla shares YTD, numerous articles have lauded the company\u2019s so-called multi-year advantages over rivals in the space. Notably, in July Elon Musk stated that Tesla is \u201cvery close\u201d to level 5 autonomy with no updates needed to hardware as the company\u2019s Tesla Computer processor currently supports full autonomy. Mobileye\u2019s EyeQ 5 also supports level 5 autonomy, however. And although the Tesla Computer exceeds EyeQ 5 on tera operations per second (TOPS), EyeQ 5 offers footprint and power consumption advantages. Moreover, unlike most other players in autonomous systems, Mobileye has opted for an open architecture that enables OEMs to program their own software on top of Mobileye hardware. \n\nTesla has a lead in data collected per mile at over 3 billion miles, but Mobileye is catching up and its data repositories also exceed the billion-mile mark on an annual run rate basis. To deepen the data sets available to Mobileye, Intel also bought Israeli mobility-as-a-service company Moovit for $900mn this year. Like Tesla, Mobileye is set to offer its technology in the important robotaxi market that many in the industry view as the precursor to consumer-adopted fully autonomous vehicles down the line. Mobileye is launching pilot robotaxi fleets in Tel Aviv, Paris, and Daegu City in 2022. \n\nMobileye still accounts for less than 1% of total Intel revenues despite doubling sales since being acquired by Intel. Given the strength of Mobileye\u2019s position in the ADAS market that is expected to grow to more than $80bn by 2030, as well as the prospects in robotaxis and level 4/5 autonomous systems, Mobileye has strong potential to develop into a major growth engine for Intel over the next 4-5 years. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIntel shares are roughly flat since early 2018 despite revenues up almost 20% from FY19 Q2 to FY20 Q2. The relative outperformance in Nvidia and AMD shares over that time has furthered perceptions that Intel could fall behind as the former two companies achieve sustained revenue growth tied to more attractive end markets like data center, gaming, AI, and autonomous vehicles. \n\nHowever, recent struggles with certain products and lost PC market share to AMD have distracted investors from Intel\u2019s ongoing transition to a more data-centric business. With a $230bn TAM projected by 2024 for this operating segment alone, Intel has multiple opportunities to likewise drive revenue growth over the long-term. \n\nGiven the company\u2019s recent advancements with its 11th generation Tiger Lake SoC, continued progress in improving price-per-performance for edge server components, and the vastly underrated leadership of Mobileye in the ADAS and autonomous vehicle markets, Intel offers an extremely compelling opportunity for investors seeking exposure to these technology trends at a more reasonable valuation. \n\n**Disclosures**\n\nWe are long Cloudflare (NET). \n\n*You can also find me on Twitter* [*@BlackjacketCo*](https://twitter.com/BlackjacketCo) *where I write about emerging technologies and long-term market trends.

        "selftext": " This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my [blog](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=r%2Finvesting) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i73sw1/deep_dive_into_the_reasons_behind_why_intel_is/),  you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom  for Intel. However, the reality is that\u2019s not necessarily the case.  Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it\u2019s incredibly  important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated  circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been  overlooked in the past is packaging \u2013 essentially how you make the  calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside  world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of  fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies,  which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and  lets the chip communicate with the outside world \u2013 as well as within the  package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over  the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging,  not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the  falling benefits of moving to smaller processes \\[1\\], coupled with  rapidly increasing costs \u2013 a EUV machine to make advanced processes can  cost up to $125million \\[2\\], while the R&amp;D costs to make smaller  processes are also increasing \\[3\\].\n\nWhat is packaging?\n\nThe  best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of  architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker.  Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making  the \u2018workers\u2019 more productive in smaller spaces \u2013 first  hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we\u2019re now at  the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces  (cubicles) it\u2019s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the  traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the  traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building  and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go  about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking\\[4\\]. In the terminology of our  analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office  building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team  can work on a job that they\u2019re specialised in, or where you can cut  costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular  department that\u2019s not too important instead of being forced to use  identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a  \u2018monolithic\u2019 , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure  that communication flows easily and quickly between each different  office building.\n\n3D stacking is  like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer  chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing)  to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies  on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing  life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer  rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat)  escape.\n\nChiplets\n\nChiplets  are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they\u2019re  commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The  most common method, the one that\u2019s widely used right now (notably in  AMD\u2019s Zen 2 architecture), has an \u2018interposer\u2019 sitting underneath the  chips you want to connect.\\[5\\] This interposer acts as a conduit between  the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as  having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you  had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient  (PCB traces).  AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we\u2019ll discuss  later, but on a hardware level it\u2019s likely that they\u2019re using TSMC\u2019s  CoWoS \u2013 Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation,  the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips  (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). \\[6\\]The  second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are  exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete  floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead.  \\[7\\]While this approach is faster \u2013 each tunnel is dedicated to only  connecting two dies, so you won\u2019t have issues where data is trying to  get to lots of different places at once and getting \u2018stuck\u2019, as you  would with AMD\u2019s approach, it\u2019s harder to design products for \u2013 you have  to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete  foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really,  this is a simple continuation of the two companies\u2019 philosophies. AMD\u2019s  HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source  interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors.  Meanwhile, Intel\u2019s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to  be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made  it\u2019s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an  attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences  inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which  approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it\u2019s  evident that each company has chosen the approach that\u2019s best for it \u2013  Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers  working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product,  to get slightly better performance; while AMD\u2019s smaller size drives them  to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across  many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD\u2019s  own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between  different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the \u2018concrete  foundation\u2019 is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect  their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which  is impossible with Intel. \\[8\\] At the same time, it could also be used  by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive  impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. \u2013 just  like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the  massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing  costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market.\n\nChiplets  are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they\u2019re sort of here from Intel,  expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next  few years, and will be here to stay. The two \u2018teams\u2019 have differing  philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it\u2019ll be  fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can  improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear,  EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads,  while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for  the next two years at the very least.\n\n3D stacking\n\nIn  theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on  top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges  are sufficiently different that it\u2019s easier to discuss them separately.\n\n3D  stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite  the fact that Intel announced its\u2019 \u2018Foveros\u2019 stacking tech in 2019 \\[9\\],  Samsung announced their \u2018X-cube\u2019 packaging a few weeks ago \\[10\\], and  TSMC announcing their \u20183DFabric\u2019 family just a few days ago \\[11\\], the  reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained  earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the  heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made  by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large  amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D  stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like  mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking  forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book,  to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical  footprint.\\[12\\] Even \u2018true\u2019 3D stacking \u2013 where you build layers one on  top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have  been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn\u2019t far  behind.\\[13\\] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the  high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved  the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling  issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred  through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). \\[14\\] These  are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data.  Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the  connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can  technically stack any chips we want together right now \u2013 TSMC\u2019s SoIC is  slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), \\[11\\] the  issue is that cutting edge chips \u2013 especially x86 chips used in  datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat.  AMD Epyc\u2019s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power \u2013 an approximation of  how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, \\[15\\]while Intel\u2019s  Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. \\[16\\] When you consider the fact that all  this heat is coming off a piece of silicon &lt;500mm2, it\u2019s apparent  that it\u2019s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current  techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip  conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past  the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before  we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a  paradigm shift in design philosophies \u2013 either drastic improvements in  efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip  better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be  tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip,  making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as  is the case with current designs. \\[17\\] Obviously, this is completely  uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with  current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die  and reap the speed benefits between those two chips \u2013 for instance  Samsung\u2019s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of  a logic die. \\[10\\] We\u2019re likely to see a few years of this sort of  in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic  dies, before we reach the \u2018Holy Grail\u2019 of high-power logic on logic \u2013  and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to  various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip  horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away  that it\u2019s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the  intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the  opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the  reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive \u2013 even leading, in  the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall  leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly  effective, both in cost and performance.\n\nAfter  reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn\u2019t I going to tell you  why Intel\u2019s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the  opposite doesn\u2019t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel\u2019s future  is promising is threefold.\n\n1. Packaging  is in its\u2019 infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind  now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in  process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we\u2019re at the very  start of the diminishing returns graph, where it\u2019s easy to make big  strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering  prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in  lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has \u2018won\u2019 the  battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that  integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic,  unified approach to designing a chip proving useful.\n2. Intel  spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in  2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%).  \\[18\\]\\[19\\] Although Intel\u2019s operations are broader, with investments in  anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it\u2019s likely  that Intel\u2019s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of  competitors. In addition, Intel\u2019s engineers are colloquially known to be  some of the best in the business. It\u2019s current woes are largely a  function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based.\n3. Intel\u2019s  (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it  to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down  for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay  his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best  person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be  constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the  internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening  up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a  comeback \u2013 a terrifying thought for any competitors.\n\nIf these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak.\n\nSemiconductors  are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such  huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for  shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the  technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing  style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I\u2019m investing in,  and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical  aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as  well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly  throws at us.\n\nFeel free to contact me if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like me to look at, and thanks for taking the time to read!\n\n\\[1\\] [https://cartesianproduct.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/the-end-of-dennard-scaling/](https://cartesianproduct.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/the-end-of-dennard-scaling/)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.eetimes.com/euv-tool-costs-hit-120-million/](https://www.eetimes.com/euv-tool-costs-hit-120-million/)\n\n\\[3\\] [http://euvlsymposium.lbl.gov/pdf/2012/pres/G.%20Yeric.pdf](http://euvlsymposium.lbl.gov/pdf/2012/pres/G.%20Yeric.pdf)\n\n\\[4\\] [https://semiengineering.com/knowledge\\_centers/packaging/advanced-packaging/](https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/packaging/advanced-packaging/)\n\n\\[5\\] [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340843129\\_Chiplet\\_Heterogeneous\\_Integration\\_Technology-Status\\_and\\_Challenges](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340843129_Chiplet_Heterogeneous_Integration_Technology-Status_and_Challenges)\n\n\\[6\\] [https://www.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/services/cowos.htm](https://www.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/services/cowos.htm)\n\n\\[7\\] [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/emib.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/emib.html)\n\n\\[8\\] [https://www.amd.com/en/campaigns/hpc-solutions-webinar](https://www.amd.com/en/campaigns/hpc-solutions-webinar)\n\n\\[9\\] [https://www.eejournal.com/article/intel-foveros-3d-packaging/](https://www.eejournal.com/article/intel-foveros-3d-packaging/)\n\n\\[10\\] [https://news.samsung.com/global/tag/samsung-x-cube](https://news.samsung.com/global/tag/samsung-x-cube)\n\n\\[11\\]TSMC Technology Symposium 2020\n\n\\[12\\] [https://sst.semiconductor-digest.com/chipworks\\_real\\_chips\\_blog/2019/01/16/the-packaging-of-apples-a12x-is-weird/](https://sst.semiconductor-digest.com/chipworks_real_chips_blog/2019/01/16/the-packaging-of-apples-a12x-is-weird/)\n\n\\[13\\] [https://www.nvmdurance.com/history-of-3d-nand-flash-memory/](https://www.nvmdurance.com/history-of-3d-nand-flash-memory/)\n\n\\[14\\] [http://www.appliedmaterials.com/files/Applied\\_TSV\\_Primer.pdf](http://www.appliedmaterials.com/files/Applied_TSV_Primer.pdf)\n\n\\[15\\] [https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7742](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7742)\n\n\\[16\\] [https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/194146/intel-xeon-platinum-9282-processor-77m-cache-2-60-ghz.html](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/194146/intel-xeon-platinum-9282-processor-77m-cache-2-60-ghz.html)\n\n\\[17\\] [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02503-1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02503-1)\n\n\\[18\\] [https://www.intc.com/filings-reports/all-sec-filings/content/0000050863-20-000011/0000050863-20-000011.pdf](https://www.intc.com/filings-reports/all-sec-filings/content/0000050863-20-000011/0000050863-20-000011.pdf)\n\n\\[19\\] [https://www.tsmc.com/download/ir/annualReports/2019/english/index.html](https://www.tsmc.com/download/ir/annualReports/2019/english/index.html)\n\n\\[20\\] [https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-leadership-tech-team-changes-not-delayed-murthy-renduchintala-leaves](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-leadership-tech-team-changes-not-delayed-murthy-renduchintala-leaves)",

        "selftext": " This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my [blog](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=r%2Finvesting) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i73sw1/deep_dive_into_the_reasons_behind_why_intel_is/),  you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom  for Intel. However, the reality is that\u2019s not necessarily the case.  Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it\u2019s incredibly  important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated  circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been  overlooked in the past is packaging \u2013 essentially how you make the  calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside  world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of  fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies,  which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and  lets the chip communicate with the outside world \u2013 as well as within the  package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over  the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging,  not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the  falling benefits of moving to smaller processes \\[1\\], coupled with  rapidly increasing costs \u2013 a EUV machine to make advanced processes can  cost up to $125million \\[2\\], while the R&amp;D costs to make smaller  processes are also increasing \\[3\\].\n\nWhat is packaging?\n\nThe  best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of  architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker.  Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making  the \u2018workers\u2019 more productive in smaller spaces \u2013 first  hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we\u2019re now at  the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces  (cubicles) it\u2019s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the  traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the  traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building  and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go  about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking\\[4\\]. In the terminology of our  analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office  building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team  can work on a job that they\u2019re specialised in, or where you can cut  costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular  department that\u2019s not too important instead of being forced to use  identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a  \u2018monolithic\u2019 , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure  that communication flows easily and quickly between each different  office building.\n\n3D stacking is  like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer  chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing)  to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies  on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing  life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer  rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat)  escape.\n\nChiplets\n\nChiplets  are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they\u2019re  commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The  most common method, the one that\u2019s widely used right now (notably in  AMD\u2019s Zen 2 architecture), has an \u2018interposer\u2019 sitting underneath the  chips you want to connect.\\[5\\] This interposer acts as a conduit between  the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as  having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you  had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient  (PCB traces).  AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we\u2019ll discuss  later, but on a hardware level it\u2019s likely that they\u2019re using TSMC\u2019s  CoWoS \u2013 Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation,  the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips  (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). \\[6\\]The  second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are  exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete  floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead.  \\[7\\]While this approach is faster \u2013 each tunnel is dedicated to only  connecting two dies, so you won\u2019t have issues where data is trying to  get to lots of different places at once and getting \u2018stuck\u2019, as you  would with AMD\u2019s approach, it\u2019s harder to design products for \u2013 you have  to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete  foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really,  this is a simple continuation of the two companies\u2019 philosophies. AMD\u2019s  HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source  interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors.  Meanwhile, Intel\u2019s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to  be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made  it\u2019s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an  attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences  inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which  approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it\u2019s  evident that each company has chosen the approach that\u2019s best for it \u2013  Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers  working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product,  to get slightly better performance; while AMD\u2019s smaller size drives them  to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across  many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD\u2019s  own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between  different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the \u2018concrete  foundation\u2019 is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect  their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which  is impossible with Intel. \\[8\\] At the same time, it could also be used  by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive  impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. \u2013 just  like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the  massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing  costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market.\n\nChiplets  are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they\u2019re sort of here from Intel,  expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next  few years, and will be here to stay. The two \u2018teams\u2019 have differing  philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it\u2019ll be  fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can  improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear,  EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads,  while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for  the next two years at the very least.\n\n3D stacking\n\nIn  theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on  top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges  are sufficiently different that it\u2019s easier to discuss them separately.\n\n3D  stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite  the fact that Intel announced its\u2019 \u2018Foveros\u2019 stacking tech in 2019 \\[9\\],  Samsung announced their \u2018X-cube\u2019 packaging a few weeks ago \\[10\\], and  TSMC announcing their \u20183DFabric\u2019 family just a few days ago \\[11\\], the  reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained  earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the  heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made  by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large  amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D  stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like  mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking  forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book,  to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical  footprint.\\[12\\] Even \u2018true\u2019 3D stacking \u2013 where you build layers one on  top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have  been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn\u2019t far  behind.\\[13\\] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the  high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved  the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling  issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred  through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). \\[14\\] These  are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data.  Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the  connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can  technically stack any chips we want together right now \u2013 TSMC\u2019s SoIC is  slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), \\[11\\] the  issue is that cutting edge chips \u2013 especially x86 chips used in  datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat.  AMD Epyc\u2019s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power \u2013 an approximation of  how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, \\[15\\]while Intel\u2019s  Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. \\[16\\] When you consider the fact that all  this heat is coming off a piece of silicon &lt;500mm2, it\u2019s apparent  that it\u2019s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current  techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip  conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past  the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before  we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a  paradigm shift in design philosophies \u2013 either drastic improvements in  efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip  better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be  tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip,  making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as  is the case with current designs. \\[17\\] Obviously, this is completely  uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with  current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die  and reap the speed benefits between those two chips \u2013 for instance  Samsung\u2019s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of  a logic die. \\[10\\] We\u2019re likely to see a few years of this sort of  in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic  dies, before we reach the \u2018Holy Grail\u2019 of high-power logic on logic \u2013  and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to  various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip  horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away  that it\u2019s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the  intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the  opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the  reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive \u2013 even leading, in  the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall  leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly  effective, both in cost and performance.\n\nAfter  reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn\u2019t I going to tell you  why Intel\u2019s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the  opposite doesn\u2019t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel\u2019s future  is promising is threefold.\n\n1. Packaging  is in its\u2019 infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind  now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in  process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we\u2019re at the very  start of the diminishing returns graph, where it\u2019s easy to make big  strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering  prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in  lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has \u2018won\u2019 the  battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that  integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic,  unified approach to designing a chip proving useful.\n2. Intel  spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in  2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%).  \\[18\\]\\[19\\] Although Intel\u2019s operations are broader, with investments in  anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it\u2019s likely  that Intel\u2019s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of  competitors. In addition, Intel\u2019s engineers are colloquially known to be  some of the best in the business. It\u2019s current woes are largely a  function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based.\n3. Intel\u2019s  (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it  to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down  for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay  his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best  person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be  constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the  internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening  up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a  comeback \u2013 a terrifying thought for any competitors.\n\nIf these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak.\n\nSemiconductors  are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such  huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for  shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the  technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing  style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I\u2019m investing in,  and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical  aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as  well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly  throws at us.\n\nFeel free to contact me if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like me to look at, and thanks for taking the time to read!\n\n\\[1\\] [https://cartesianproduct.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/the-end-of-dennard-scaling/](https://cartesianproduct.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/the-end-of-dennard-scaling/)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.eetimes.com/euv-tool-costs-hit-120-million/](https://www.eetimes.com/euv-tool-costs-hit-120-million/)\n\n\\[3\\] [http://euvlsymposium.lbl.gov/pdf/2012/pres/G.%20Yeric.pdf](http://euvlsymposium.lbl.gov/pdf/2012/pres/G.%20Yeric.pdf)\n\n\\[4\\] [https://semiengineering.com/knowledge\\_centers/packaging/advanced-packaging/](https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/packaging/advanced-packaging/)\n\n\\[5\\] [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340843129\\_Chiplet\\_Heterogeneous\\_Integration\\_Technology-Status\\_and\\_Challenges](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340843129_Chiplet_Heterogeneous_Integration_Technology-Status_and_Challenges)\n\n\\[6\\] [https://www.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/services/cowos.htm](https://www.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/services/cowos.htm)\n\n\\[7\\] [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/emib.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/emib.html)\n\n\\[8\\] [https://www.amd.com/en/campaigns/hpc-solutions-webinar](https://www.amd.com/en/campaigns/hpc-solutions-webinar)\n\n\\[9\\] [https://www.eejournal.com/article/intel-foveros-3d-packaging/](https://www.eejournal.com/article/intel-foveros-3d-packaging/)\n\n\\[10\\] [https://news.samsung.com/global/tag/samsung-x-cube](https://news.samsung.com/global/tag/samsung-x-cube)\n\n\\[11\\]TSMC Technology Symposium 2020\n\n\\[12\\] [https://sst.semiconductor-digest.com/chipworks\\_real\\_chips\\_blog/2019/01/16/the-packaging-of-apples-a12x-is-weird/](https://sst.semiconductor-digest.com/chipworks_real_chips_blog/2019/01/16/the-packaging-of-apples-a12x-is-weird/)\n\n\\[13\\] [https://www.nvmdurance.com/history-of-3d-nand-flash-memory/](https://www.nvmdurance.com/history-of-3d-nand-flash-memory/)\n\n\\[14\\] [http://www.appliedmaterials.com/files/Applied\\_TSV\\_Primer.pdf](http://www.appliedmaterials.com/files/Applied_TSV_Primer.pdf)\n\n\\[15\\] [https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7742](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7742)\n\n\\[16\\] [https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/194146/intel-xeon-platinum-9282-processor-77m-cache-2-60-ghz.html](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/194146/intel-xeon-platinum-9282-processor-77m-cache-2-60-ghz.html)\n\n\\[17\\] [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02503-1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02503-1)\n\n\\[18\\] [https://www.intc.com/filings-reports/all-sec-filings/content/0000050863-20-000011/0000050863-20-000011.pdf](https://www.intc.com/filings-reports/all-sec-filings/content/0000050863-20-000011/0000050863-20-000011.pdf)\n\n\\[19\\] [https://www.tsmc.com/download/ir/annualReports/2019/english/index.html](https://www.tsmc.com/download/ir/annualReports/2019/english/index.html)\n\n\\[20\\] [https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-leadership-tech-team-changes-not-delayed-murthy-renduchintala-leaves](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-leadership-tech-team-changes-not-delayed-murthy-renduchintala-leaves)",
