        "selftext": "# The Synopsis - Nothing new, just wrapping it in a bow\n\nAlright Handi-Capables, buckle up - I am going to tell you about a little WSB speculation that may be either the biggest fraud of all time or the most epic DD ever to have occurred in WSB history. A lot of this information comes from a real dick head named Yolo Capital Management on Twitter who is also known as [u/infamousbreadfruit99](https://www.reddit.com/u/infamousbreadfruit99/) within this Gamblers subreddit. This guy is a real piece of work, but I've come to have a real good working relationship with him as we've discussed theories behind Pershing Square as well as the most hyped target being discussed, STRIPE. This thread is really meant to just outline all the history, the theories, the risks and the potential moves that you can do to minimize risk. **I don't want this to turn into the great NRPLing of 2020, where PURPLE had the best quarter of all time but you Degenerates all sold off because they didn't announce an electric vehicle or an Ipad powered exercise bike. Warning to all: This is purely speculation, this SPAC is trading at 30% above NAV which is pretty damn unprecedented without any news. So be cautious as the downside might be 5-6 dollars per share should Bill announce a terrible DUD of a target. This post is not advice, really just general information that I am trying to present in an un-biased way. PSA: I am biased as hell though, hence my 3M investment, although I don't buy all the theories presented by some people on the forums. Also, there is a very good possibility that this SPAC doesn't acquire STRIPE.**\n\nFirst of all, for those of you not aware, PSTH is a SPAC led by Bill Ackman **(A very successful billionaire Jew, hence the title - Not an anti-Semitic post, genuinely aligns with the theory of an announcement soon)**. A SPAC is a special acquisition company that aspired to bring a company public through a reverse merger. The new entity receives a cash infusion and the SPAC holders shares become stock units in the company that trade on the open Market. SPACS are essentially just a giant cash reserve used to purchase a company. This particular SPAC IPO'd with Units being traded for 20.00 and 20.00 NAV in the trust. The units have since split into Warrants and Shares. As of last week, warrants were trading in the high single digits and shares were trading just below 26.00. Regardless of what the stock trades at, the NAV will remain fairly constant at 20.00 per share. For discussions sake, I am going to consider 20.00 as the theoretical floor as it would be very unusual for a Pre-Merger SPAC to drop drastically below NAV. Once a SPAC merges, the 20.00 floor is removed and market demand and market conditions determine the share price going forward. There have been many theoretical questions thrown around about how much this will jump on an announcement and the answer is **that no one knows until the terms of the deal are announced.**\n\nThe SPAC Structure and Anchor Investors\n\nNow that we have this out of the way, let's talk about Bill Ackman's SPAC. This SPAC launched on July 22nd, 2020, the SPAC sold 200,000,000 units for a total trust size of 4 Billion USD. There were additional clauses in this filing that allow for even more units to be issued to increase the buying power of the SPAC to somewhere in the 7B range. The SPAC was subscribed by some very Reputable investors. Investors Included :\n\n[Large institutions](https://preview.redd.it/4hl94rpxhm361.png?width=1317&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb7bfe45088a3c7d2b1b35800cd519b86b31f879)\n\n# Largest Institutional Investors\n\nAs you can see, you have some whale investors that include Wells Fargo, Baopost hedge fund, Soroban capital and Guggenheim. Well over 2B dollars is held by these 12 investors. According to the filing, institutions own about 65% of the public float. On Bill Ackmans last hedge fund call he indicated that because there was so much interest in this SPAC, he was able to hand pick his investors. Many of these investors are likely sovereign wealth funds or family offices that do not file and therefore we have no insight into whom they are, but Bill does.\n\nEach one of these investors owns common stock that was likely issued after the units split. For those of you that aren't aware, this SPAC has 3/9 of a common warrant per share. 1/9 was issued during the split from the units and the other 2/9 are issued to common share holders that hold through a merger. These warrants have a 23.00 strike price and they can be redeemed after the stock trades above 36.00 for a defined time period. If you don't know what a warrant is just ignore this paragraph.\n\nThis SPAC was designed with very favorable terms that ensure the sponsor's goals align with the company goals and don't create a conflict of interest. Many Many Many Many SPACs have very favorable terms that leave the sponsor's rich and the investors holding bags.\n\nThis is a very very good article that defines conflicts of interest within SPACS. PSTH has eliminated many of these issues and Bill Ackman's interest align with ours, in fact Bill can't make money until the investors reach a certain threshold of gains.\n\n[https://www.sewkis.com/publications/spacs-are-back-back-again-what-you-should-know/](https://www.sewkis.com/publications/spacs-are-back-back-again-what-you-should-know/)\n\nThis SPAC hard garnered many anchor investors and its structure is very very favorable as compared to its peers. Bill is setting a new precedent in the SPAC world and it will be interesting to see if other sponsors do the same. This is a key differentiating factor as to why this SPAC is very premium.\n\nTargets and Timing\n\nWhen this SPAC first launched, Bill Ackman indicated that he would likely find a target within 6 months and merge shortly thereafter. Bill also indicated that he was looking for a minority interest in a unicorn that met certain criteria. Here is the criteria as pulled directly from Pershing Square's website. On the last Pershing earnings call, it was indicated that Bill so no reason that he wouldn't meet his original timeline of having a target announced by Q1 and a merger by Q2. January 22nd is the official 6 month milestone from when the SPAC first began trading. **EDIT: The theory is Bill will announce before Hanukah which starts on Dec 10th or 11th.**\n\n* **Simple, predictable, and free-cash-flow-generative.**\u00a0We will generally seek companies with a proven track record of growth and free cash flow generation, and predictable future financial performance that we expect will generate strong, sustainable growth in cash flows over the long term\u2014however, we are open to considering a company that may, at the time of the initial business combination, be cash-flow negative, if we believe that the business\u2019s cash flow will become positive within a reasonable amount of time;\n* **Formidable barriers to entry.**\u00a0We will seek companies that have long-term sustainable competitive advantages, significant barriers to entry, or \u201cwide moats\u201d around their business, and low risks of disruption due to competition, innovation or new entrants;\n* **Limited exposure to extrinsic factors that we cannot control**. We will seek companies that are not materially affected by macroeconomic factors, commodity prices, regulatory risks, interest rate volatility and/or cyclical risk;\n* **Strong balance sheet**. We will seek companies that are conservatively financed relative to their free-cash-flow generation, after taking into consideration the\u00a0de-leveraging\u00a0effects of the initial business combination;\n* **Minimal capital markets dependency**. We will seek companies that can benefit from being a public company with broader access to the capital markets and greater governance, but will prefer companies that are not highly reliant on the capital markets to operate and grow their businesses;\n* **Large capitalization**. We will seek companies with large enterprise values and significant long-term growth potential that will be likely candidates for inclusion in the S&amp;P 500 index;\n* **Attractive valuation**. We will seek companies at an attractive valuation relative to their long-term intrinsic value; and\n* **Exceptional management and governance**. We will seek companies that have trustworthy, talented, experienced, and highly competent management teams. These companies may be led by entrepreneurs who are looking for a partner with our expertise to execute on the next stage of their growth. For target companies that require new management, we will leverage PSCM\u2019s experience in identifying and recruiting new management.\n\nAfter providing this criteria, Bill indicated there were likely 150 companies that were considered mature unicorns and \\~50 of them would meet all of Bill's criteria. Also, Bill indicated there may be other potential targets that are subsidiaries of other companies.\n\nAccording to the World Wide Web, here are the list of some potential unicorns.\n\n[https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies)\n\nSome of the most well known being:\n\n* SPACEX\n* COINBASE\n* BYTEDANCE\n* STRIPE\n* AIRBNB,\n* INSTACART\n* EPIC GAMES\n* Door Dash\n* DJI\n* SHEIN\n* CHIME\n* JUUL\n* ROBINHOOD\n* WISH\n* ARGO\n* TOKOPEDIA\n* SOFI\n\n# The Stripe Conjecture - Initialize Tin Foil Hats\n\nIf you don't want to hear the theories, then stop reading now as this is just going to really summarize many interesting snippets of information that don't necessarily mean anything but are certainly interesting.\n\n* Jackie Reses Stepping down from Square and maintaining a board seat on PSTH\n   * Jackie was the head of capital for square\n   * Stripe just launched Capital\n   * Jackie is a baller and has more big Dick energy than any man, woman or child alive when it comes to finance.\n   * Jackie has liked several PSTH related tweets, but she has also like other tweets about other financial institutions. This might just be purely coincidence.\n   * Why would Jackie step down from Square but retain all her other board seats, including those on Chamanth's SPACS. Is there a conflict of interest?\n* Bill Ackman following Collison Brothers on Twitter, he doesn't even follow the CEO's of all his biggest investments.\n   * Bill only follows 182 people\n   * Bill Doesn't follow the CEO of Lowes\n   * Bill Doesn't follow the CEO of Chipotle, as far as I can tell - CEO's twitter appears to be private\n   * Bill Doesn't follow Hilton's account, CEO doesn't have twitter as far as I can tell\n   * Bill DOES follow Starbucks CEO\n   * Bill Doesn't follow Agilent CEO\n   * Bill Doesn't follow Howard Hughes companies or leadership as far as I can tell\n* John Collison Following Breadfruit on Twitter (Yolocapitalmgmt)\n   * This dude is a billionaire that is following a WSB degenerate posting conspiracy theories.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/spvepib4im361.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=767c5a23b4f64208d9c11d2d27f1e69f040ccf5f\n\n* This dude is one of the original Irish stripe employees.... he has since unfollowed but he was. His name is Brian Delahunty\n* Wells FARGO invested in a PRE LOI SPAC - What the hell?\n* This is the one that I can't figure out. Why in the hell would wells FARGO invest in a shell company if they didn't have any inclination as to the target. HAS THIS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE? We know that wells fargo and stripe do have a relationship\n* SETH KLARMAN INVESTED IN A PRE LOI SPAC\n   * This is another ODD one. This is basically Seth Klarman saying hey Bill, your Hedge fund can invest my 400 million better than me?????????????? These are two different hedge fund manager and one of them is investing in the other. This is absolutely weird.\n* The size of the SPAC limits targets: why so big Bill???????\n   * Why in the world would Bill limit his options to such a small amount of companies, companies that are typically already backed by big money...... This is another point I can't wrap my head around, why in the world would bill launch a SPAC of this size without having preliminary top level talks. The sheer size of the SPAC is telling, he knew he wanted a whale and if he didn't think he could get one he would've maybe gone with a 2B dollar SPAC with the option to increase to 4B, INSTEAD he went with a 4B SPAC with option to go all the way to 7B!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n* Why would the Collison brothers have talks at all with Bill if they didn't intend to go public? The brothers are some smart ass Ginger Snaps and they knew Bill had a giant ass blank check. Many people are saying the Collison brothers will IPO and they don't need Bill... Why waste your time meeting with Bill if SPACing wasn't a possibility and going public wasn't a near term event?\n* Why hasn't Bill or the Collison's denied it\n   * Bloomberg denied rumors within an hour\n   * Airbnb Denied rumors within days\n   * Not a single Denial statement from Collisons or Big Dick Bill.\n* So far only known talks have been between Bloomberg, Airbnb and Stripe. These are all tech plays so we can hopefully expect the final deal is a tech play.\n* Collison Brothers are going for funding at a much higher valuation\n   * Why would they be going for funding, they just got funding in April. Also, it's rumored that Stripe is potentially already profitable.\n* Bill Ackman indicated his biggest regret was missing the boat on Mastercard\n* Bill Ackman is taking a minority stake so the terms are more appealing to unicorns as they can maintain control, raise funding and have large anchor investors that aren't worried about short term gains.\n\n# The ANTITHESIS to the conjecture\n\n* John Collison is trolling - If there was a deal why would John troll.\n* The Collisons just indicated they were not preparing a flotation.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4kxncd8him361.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c8a4b2a3124c3c781cb634a29bbcf7582275e66\n\n* The Collisons are a freaking darling that can raise private equity whenever they want, they really don't need Bill\n* Jackie Reses has trolled Breadfuit AKA Yolo on twitter\n* STRIPE doesn't need funding\n* Bill Ackman's historical investments are not fintech, why would he start\n* Big Unicorns don't want bill because he is an activist.\n\n# The Risk to Reward\n\n* You need to be aware that this is trading at a 30% premium to asset value. This means that for every share you buy at 26.00, there is only 20.00 of money in the trust being used to acquire the company. This means that we need to land a good company with good terms to justify the premium.\n* This SPAC is huge, it's not likely to quadruple like some of the other spacs.\n   * If a great deal is reached with a real hype company then we might see 35-40 pre merger and 40+ post merger. Otherwise, we will probably see 30-35, depending on the terms.\n* The SPAC has 2 years to make a deal and we are only \\~5 months into this duration. Your money could sit idle for another 18 months.\n* Warrants expire worthless should a deal fail to materialize. This is why I am not specifically buying warrants, although I do expect a deal will materialize.\n\n# Why I invested\n\n* I like Bill Ackman, he gets it done, he is smart, pragmatic and he learns from his mistakes.\n* This is really an investment in Bill, similar to investing in TSLA, it's really an investment in leadership, not so much the product.\n* Bill does have a relationship with some big players and he will land a good deal no matter what. Even if this is not Stripe, I will likely hold everything long term.\n* Tontine structure is appealing and it rewards holders. Google Tontine if you don't know what it is.\n* If they do get Stripe, you are getting Young visionary leadership and frankly I think the Collison's are probably stand up guys. In the back of my mind, I believe that they might SPAC to give the average joe an opportunity to invest; they seem more motivated in building an empire of amazing financial infrastructure products than getting egregious valuations\n* If they Don't get Stripe you are still getting Bill Ackman and Jackie Reses hunting for a company - they are both legends.\n* Anchor investors presented above indicate they are bullish on Bill, not to mention they limit the available float and if it is a epic deal, anchor investors holding will help push price of stock upwards.\n\n# The Plays\n\n* I am only buying commons.\n* For those that want options, I wouldn't buy any options earlier than a march '21 expiration and a 20.00 strike.\n* If I were buying options I would buy June expiration 15.00 strikes.\n* My previous posts outline why I believe just buying common stock is the way to go. Ticker is PSTH.\n\n# MY POSITIONS\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[My Common Stock](https://preview.redd.it/7ywotz3kim361.png?width=1512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e66fa3bffd4b93319883bdd3196c7f954479237a)\n\n# TL:DR\n\n* Bill will probably buy Subway and we're all FK'd.\n* Don't buy because it might be stripe, buy because it's Bill and Jackie.\n* Don't buy lotto's as I don't believe this SPAC will react like others.\n* This isn't investing advice. This is my thought process spewed about on a forum.\n\nMODS- Not sure if this qualifies as DD or not, but if it doesn't PM me and I will change it to story time or shitpost.",

        "selftext": "Tl;dr - NIO is a generational investment opportunity. Buy the dip ya fools!!!   \nTake this DD from your neighborhood genius asian man and friend of WSB. \n\nChina's Domestic Issues:  \n\\-Car ownership is rising in the millions as the middle class income is rising along with its soaring population. So is China's air pollution problem--a huge issue and international embarrassment.   \n\\-China is the world's 4th largest oil producer, behind the United States. This is not enough oil for China's voracious demand, so they must import tons of barrels from OPEC nations. Of course, they don't want to rely on them. Who does? Will they go to war with them like the US has done in the past twenty years? NO! Because the Chinese want to rely on a more tech-driven solution. \n\nEV's. Nio is an answer to many of China's problems. With battery swap technology making battery charging more affordable and faster for the driver, Nio's EV ecosystem will net billions of dollars from China alone. EV's used to be for the rich. NIO will increasingly make cars affordable for the middle class. Also, imagine if GE or Toyota made money off \"fuel\" in addition to selling their cars. That's what NIO will do with their subscription-based charging stations. \n\nInternational Upside:  \n\\-Why do you think China accepted Tesla into their country and not other businesses like Amazon, Google, or Facebook? Well, they say there's no free lunch. China wants to sell their cars to the United States. China also wants to set up EV charging stations throughout the US as Tesla will do in China--this is the next gas station business. Imagine Standard Oil level income for NIO!!!   \n\\-If the US doesn't agree with Nio, then China will say, \"bye bye Tesla\".   \n\\-Europe is a lock. NIO has offices in UK and Germany. Like it or not, Europe is swayed by China's money in a way that the US is still not. \n\nComparables:  \n\\-If you wanna see how China will do in the future, look no further than Japan and South Korea. Very similar in every respect. Japan thrived after it transitioned from an agrarian economy to a manufacturing one, of cheap electronics and cars. Then it transitioned into making quality products, right after they hosted the summer Olympics, like Sony, Toshiba, Toyota, etc. It was made possible due to the Japanese people's industriousness, denial of self, national pride, and quite frankly, Asian smarts.   \n\\-Similar thing happened in South Korea--transitioned from making rice to making cheap manufacturing of electronics and cars. Like Japan, they're now in the process of making quality products--the surge also happening after around the time they hosted the Summer Olympics in '88. Think Samsung's phones. Think higher-end Sonatas, or LG flat screen TV's.   \n\\-China? China has been a manufacturing powerhouse since the 2000s. But millennial sand boomers should remember all the cheap \"Made in China\" jokes. This image is slowly fading as China now has Huawei, Alibaba, Tencent making new innovations in AI and commerce. This again, happened after what? The 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.  \n\\-So where the hell are the Chinese cars? Where is China's Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, or Kia? \n\nNIO!!!! Unlike Toyota, Hyundai, etc. China's manufacturers can scale to levels no other country in the world has ever done in the past.\n\nNio will outgrow Tesla even if it doesn't make it to the United States. But Trump is no longer in office, and I doubt Biden will be capable of doing anything meaningful to stop Nio's rise. \n\nCEO Upside:  \n\\-William Li has a perfect track record. He took a failing Auto-Review company, invested in it with his own money and became its CEO. Within years, he IPO'd it on the NYSE, making himself and fellow investors billions of dollars.   \n\\-Forget Jack Ma, William is often called the Steve Jobs of China. That Elon Musk Battery Day flop? It will never happen with NIO. William has an immense eye for detail. He's a showman with the most anal high standards. In 2018, he got one of the Nio cars to talk about Bruno Mars and then had Bruno Mars frickin' show up on live stream to give a talk.\n\nNio is a steal in the $40 range. For you impatient ones, there'll be a catalyst in Nio Day coming up on Jan 9. But if you can buy leaps or hold shares long term, this will surpass 100 bucks for sure.\n\nBuy Nio.",

I was encouraged by several to share my work with this sub and while I am not familiar with the sub I thought why not?\n\nUltimately, I regret posting in WSB. It is a strange place. I've tried to answer them in the comments but it is an amazing casino. Its literally a casino. I think the quality of my DD (regardless of whether you know about the SPAC) speaks for itself.\n\nThe post below is really a primer. The link to the first DD is where the money is.\n\nHere's the PSTH S1\n\n[**https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811882/000119312520175042/d930055ds1.htm**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811882/000119312520175042/d930055ds1.htm)\n\nCheers,\n\nxxoo\n\n\\----------------\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **$PSTH \u2013 Activist Investor Bill Ackman\u2019s Gigantic SPAC \u2013 Updated DD** \ud83d\ude80\n\nI last wrote on PSTH roughly 30 days ago and at the time the SPAC was getting very little press attention. Ackman announced the SPAC in the spring of 2020 and it started trading in July at an NAV of $20. Ackman has steadily collected an impressive investor list, filled with long term and reputable names.\n\nSince then and since my last post, a lot has happened. This DD serves to provide an update and recap for those new to the stock and considering a play here.\n\n**TLDR;**\n\nPSTH is a gigantic SPAC with a reputable CEO and the most impressive investor list ever created. For context, Chamath's largest SPAC (IPOF) is worth $1.6B. PSTH is worth $5B with the option to increase to $7B. It is enormous. The company is on record for a Q1 announcement and is targeting a \u201cmature unicorn\u201d. At an NAV of $20, the downside risk is capped significantly while the upside potential is very high depending on target.\n\n**Two Key points in addition to the TLDR:**\n\nTwo aspects of this stock that most people miss to begin with (I've engaged with enough of them online to know):\n\n**1)** Tontine: detailed below but in essence, for every common share you buy now AND hold through the merger and ticker change, you get 2/9 a warrant exercisable at $23. That means for every 9 commons you own, you will receive another 2 commons later at a price of $23 (the stock trades at $26 today)\n\n**AKA if you own 99 commons through the merger, you get 22 more shares at $23 cost each simply for holding through the merger.**\n\n**THIS is what 2/9 Tontine means. It can grow to 3/9 or 4/9 if people choose not to hold through the merger, because the number of warrants is constant and will all be given out to someone.**\n\n**\\*\\*\\*Another note here: beware the manager's right to redeem warrants. This is in the S-1 but the manager's have the right to redeem warrants if the share price meets or exceeds $36 on 20/30 trading days. They have to give you 30 days notice, so just keep that in mind. The warrants are exercisable at the later of 1) 30 days post merger or 2) 1 year post listing which was in July 2020. So as long as you are keeping an eye on events, you will be okay. Don't fall asleep on the stipulation though.**\n\n**For example, if the stock price was to jump to $50 on LOI and then the merger happens 2 months later, 30 days post that merger you warrants go live but so does the manager's right to issue a redemption notice. At that point you would likely consider redeeming the warrants since at the end of that window they could be taken by manager for pennies each. No upside cap based on my reading of the S1, but just be vigilant once the merger is announced.**\n\n**2)** The bank set up. Typically the big banks gouge the eyes out of IPOs and traditional SPACS with fees, etc. We have seen big big misses on the order of $3-4B for both Snowflake and ABNB. With PSTH, Ackman has went a different route abandoning the large cap banks and instead giving underwriting privileges to a ton of small and minority owned banks and credit lenders. This is a legacy move. He's more interested in changing the landscape because he believes (and has explained) that quality public entry structures are the best improvements we can make for the economy, society, and the common retail investor. The structure also incentivizes him to make an exceptional deal, that's the only way he makes money through the warrant system, if the deal goes well. This is why HUGE names are on board, but only one big bank is. This SPAC is opposing the conventional bank-led IPO process. That in itself, is a game changer and once this pops and gets press you can bet your boots that future SPAC leaders (Chamath, etc.) will transition to this method.\n\n**Background information and recent events**\n\n\u00b7 In July 2020, Bill Ackman went live with SPAC $PSTH \u2013 the SPAC raised $5B in proceeds with the option to take it to $7B (leveraging funds from PSCM, Ackman\u2019s hedge fund) making it the biggest SPAC ever created.\n\n\u00b7 In multiple interviews following the SPACs debut, Ackman has been clear about several things:\n\no He is hunting for a \u201cmature unicorn\u201d - unicorn is defined as $1B or more but \"mature\" here is the key, he's looking for a company worth tens of Billions.\n\no He has stipulated a predictable business is most ideal with steady cash flow or guarantees along the lines of predictable growth\n\no This means a large cap, well run, asset light, family owned, high moat, company according to Ackman. He has explicitly said he's also friendly to a FINTECH\n\no He has a buying power of approximately $7B dollars at present and is hoping to capture a minority stake of between 15-20% of a large enterprise. This means a valuation in the ballpark of $30-40B.\n\n**o Ackman has recruit an incredible board of directors at PSTH, leveraging raw talent from both media and fintech sectors:**\n\nLisa Gersh - Former management executive at NBC News\n\nMichael Ovitz - Former President at The Walt Disney Company\n\nJackie Reses - Former executive at Square, mobile payment company\n\nJoseph Steinberg - Current Chairman of Jefferies Financial Group Inc.\n\n**\\*\\*We don't want to jump to conclusions, but on review of the board, this is certainly a MEDIA and FINTECH heavy group of executives\\*\\***\n\no He has delivered on developing an incredibly impressive list of investors thus far\n\no **Investors in the SPAC so far include:**\n\n\u00a7 Baupost Group (headed by Seth Klarman, $30B hedge fund manager, \u201cthe next Buffet\u201d and noted value investor) = $450M position\n\n\u00a7 Guggenheim Capital = $560M position\n\n\u00a7 Ontario Teachers Pension Plan = $290M position\n\n\u00a7 Soroban Capital = $290M position\n\n\u00a7 Wells Fargo = $290M position\n\n\u00a7 Kevin \u201cSharktank\u201d O\u2019Leary = undisclosed position to be reported in Q1\n\n\u00a7 **Warren Buffet\u2019s** position remains speculative. He recently left his JPM position and is secretly adding to a big position (pushing the filing deadline requirements as he does whenever he builds a big position as to not cause an overprice of the stock before he finishes buying). There is also a large undisclosed position in PSTH held by someone from Q3. This remains completely speculative and it may not be Buffet but another large stakeholder or pension fund.\n\n**\u00a7 KEY Point: \\*\\*No other big banks have secured big positions in PSTH\\*\\***\n\no The investor list above is just a sample of the top holders. Each of these positions were made at the end of Q3 of this year. The stock has risen $2 or 10% of NAV since this time (not much considering the size and runway ahead).\n\n**PSTH SPAC Design**\n\n\u00b7 PSTH is called a SPAC, but as others have pointed out, it does not resemble any other SPAC, in size or design. Some details:\n\n\u00b7 PSTH incentivizes long-term holding and only dramatic upward shifts in the stock price through its unique \u201ctontine\u201d structure. Upon purchase of one common share and holding of that share through announcement and merger, owners receive 2/9 of a warrant with a strike of $23. Those who buy and sell on announcement bounce therefore give up that 2/9 and it goes back into the pool for those who hold through merger. What a lot of people are missing is what this means. It means that the ceiling for the value of that fractional warrant is unknown but at minimum is 2/9. If there was a minority sell off on announcement that 2/9 could increase to 3/9 or 4/9 warrant for those who stay in. This creates a wild incentive for long-term holding of the company and is referenced in the \"tontine\" name - look it up, pretty cool.\n\n**Targets**\n\nMuch speculation exists online as to what companies Ackman is targeting. Here are some key points:\n\n\u00b7 Earlier in the year he commented publicly on Air B&amp;B, Stripe and Bloomberg. He praised all three companies publicly.\n\n\u00b7 Since that interview, Air B&amp;B has gone public via IPO and notably lost out on $3.8B during the valuation process and IPO\n\n**\u00b7 Stripe has generated intense interest online.** Despite the hype, the Collison brothers (head of Stripe) have publicly commented via tweet that \u201cno such deal\u201d had been struck after a WSB twitter account congratulated the brother\u2019s in a silly way. Despite this, many (including me) believe that Stripe is still very much in play and that some of this is a negotiation tactic. When questioned on Stripe, Ackman was gracious but said that the company was not ready to go public, citing managerial and personnel deficits only. In the immediate aftermath of that comment (literally the next week), Stripe went on an insane hiring spree specific to Public Managerial positions. This has been documented extensively by [u/YoloCapitalMgmt](https://www.reddit.com/u/YoloCapitalMgmt/) on twitter. Ackman is on record saying his biggest regret in investing was not getting in on MasterCard due to regulation uncertainty. He said the best investment you could ever make, assuming valuation made sense, was in a company that made royalties on others spending money. He has since commented that PSTH would very much be in favor of merging with a FINTECH. Big name FINTECH EXEC Jackie Reeses (former head of square) has been added to the board of PSTH, creating even more speculation around Stripe as a target).\n\n**\u00b7 Bloomberg remains in play.** There has been no definitive declination by Bloomberg and rumors in the past exist in both directions. Michael Bloomberg has both commented that he would not take the company public and that there could be interest in a minority stake being sold.\n\n\u00b7 Other potential targets that have been floated with little in the way of momentum include SpaceX, Fidelity, Inspire Brands and Subway.\n\n**Target summary based on my view**\n\nTargets in order of likelihood of Q1 merger announcement\n\n1. Bloomberg\n2. Stripe\n3. Fidelity\n\n**Bill Ackman**\n\nA few notes on the CEO of the SPAC, William A. Ackman:\n\n\u00b7 A billionaire activist hedge fund manager with a highly interesting track record if you\u2019re interested in looking into it.\n\n\u00b7 He has had some misses in years gone by most notably Herbalife short (where he was correct but still lost money) and Valeant.\n\n\u00b7 In recent years he has mounted an insane comeback poster annualized return of 50 and 60%.\n\n\u00b7 Some of his most iconic recent plays include Chipotle (take a look at that story) and Canadian Pacific\n\n\u00b7 Notably he shorted the market prior to COVID, correctly predicting a financial collapse. Through the use of CDS (made popular during the 2008 financial crisis, he turned a $27M insurance policy into a $2.6B trade in March of this year. He subsequently used the funds to advance positions in high quality companies he was a holder of (when these stocks were at their absolute lows in March).\n\n**Some other notes**\n\nThis is a highly interesting play and to get in you are betting on Ackman and the impressive investor list he has obtained.\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t objective financial advice, this play is incredibly enticing and one worth looking into.",

Ackman announced the SPAC in the spring of 2020 and it started trading in July at an NAV of $20. Ackman has steadily collected an impressive investor list, filled with long term and reputable investors.\n\nSince then and since my last post a lot has happened. This DD serves to provide an update and recap for those new to the stock and considering a play here.\n\n**TLDR;**\n\nPSTH is a gigantic SPAC with a reputable CEO and the most impressive investor list ever created.

        "selftext": "I am Chinese, or used to be years ago at least by nationality. I am not going to post Chinese news article detailing the entire power struggle, just English. I mean, you monkeys can't read moon runes.\n\nYou see, the power struggle has been happening since Alibaba and Jack Ma became the ecommerce god of China, like Jeff \"the bald Grinch\" Bezos did with Amazon in America. China are commies, worshipping anyone but the party is illegal. That is why despite the profits and everything else, they are still sitting at 300+ and not flying like AMZN. Chinese know the power struggles all to well, smart ones will avoid it like plague. Not even Chinese boomers are touching it.\n\nhttps://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Mystery-video-suggests-power-struggle-in-China\n\nThe previous power struggles resulted in Ma forced out of CEO position in 2018, cue lip service to western friends who don't give a fuck just to make sure BABA don't drop. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/10/18/alibabas-jack-ma-spent-10-years-preparing-for-his-retirement.html\n\nBut like anyone who had felt the power trip of being the richest and most powerful man before, Ma could not stay retired and out of the limelight for long.\n\nSo he came out of retirement with the biggest fintech IPO in Asia, Ant Group. Now, that really pisses the Emperor off. Recognising his efforts in revolutionalizing ecommerse, Emperor Xi decided to let him spend the rest of his life in retirement... like a charity case. Yet he decides to step in limelight again, and overshadow the most ~~paranoid and insecure~~ powerful man in all of China?! Well Emperor is the party and party is the Emperor, now Emperor finally decides that you must be removed. Especially when they are showing the entire China the power and money capitalism brings. Cue CCP vs CEO power struggle round 2, except this time they are clashing in the open.\n\nhttps://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Analysis-Xi-sees-Alibaba-and-Tencent-as-rising-threats-to-power\n\nSo what happens?\n\nBuy the dip??\n\nCut losses and run???\n\nAnswer is simple:\n\nIf you are holding stocks then just keep holding it. BABA isn't going anywhere, they are the ecommerce monopoly along with Tencent in almost the entire Asia. The dip will not stop until power struggle turmoil is over, it will get even uglier over the months as Politburo falsify more charges to threaten the CEOs to back down.\n\nRecover your call losses with puts, it really is that easy.\n\nI have no options in it because I hate commies and know how they work. So until there is a clear winner in the power struggle, I am not gonna be a bad retard. If you want to listen, cool. If you think it's the dip you were waiting for, good luck with welfare because I tried. Then again I YOLO 50k each on GME and PLTR so what do I know? \ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "I'm making this post because I'm tired of the misinformation and lack of understanding. So? Time to break out the big boy thesis: Tesla is going to the moon,or atleast minimum $700.\n\nPlease see my first post about what I'm doing--&gt; [TSLA to the moon! Part 1(the non DD)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kbyju1/tsla_to_the_moon_part_1_the_non_dd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) (if you curious)\n\n**Fact: Tracking &amp; benchmarked Funds have to purchase over 100million of tesla shares.**\n\n\\-to help illustrate this point see rob's video [Tesla Daily](https://youtu.be/QgCt2LRUj0k?t=248) it illustrates the need for shares, how many, and why exactly the price isnt going to change the number much. To make it easier for you laggards out there. it doesn't matter if TSLA's price hits $1000 they still need over 100million shares. That's ALOT of buying pressure. Here's another blog that allows you to download the excel spread sheets and play with the numbers. I advise you to do so to gain deeper understanding of not only why the statements i am presenting are closer to grounded facts than conjecture. read through it thoroughly if you would like: [Tesla Blog](https://teslainvestor.blogspot.com/2020/11/teslas-s-500-inclusion-part-2.html?m=1). I'm going to take a few excerpts from it.\n\n**Fact: They must purchase these shares the day before the day of inclusion** (in this case the 18th).  They also can NOT have done this months prior for it would throw off the precise tracking of the s&amp;p 500 etfs and those following it. And they cannot have done it after for the same reason.\n\nSources: Tesla daily on YouTube:\n\n \\[tesla daily #2\\]([https://youtu.be/ d\\_t4Cmuib6w](https://youtu.be/d_t4Cmuib6w)) \n\n\\[1st article \\]([https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/teslas-stock-will-be-added-to-the-sp-500-in-a-single-step-before-the-open-on-dec-21.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/teslas-stock-will-be-added-to-the-sp-500-in-a-single-step-before-the-open-on-dec-21.html))\n\n\"The stock will be added at its full float-adjusted market capitalization **before the open of trading on Dec. 21**, the index provider said.\" That's a vote for the **18th.**\n\n\\[2nd (pay or subscribe wall but scroll and see. i can see it on my laptop not my phone)\\]([https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-to-enter-s-p-500-at-full-weight-in-december-11606780897](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-to-enter-s-p-500-at-full-weight-in-december-11606780897))\n\n\"The index company said Tesla will be added to the broad stock-market gauge before the start of trading Dec. 21, meaning most index-tracking funds that follow the S&amp;P 500 will engage in a flurry of trading the Friday before.\" Another vote for the **18th.**\n\nLinked Study(pdf). If it doesn't open, go to google type in 'can a stock be added \"before the inclusion date\" '. 2nd link. Page 10. [Study(page 10)](https://thesis.eur.nl/pub/33763/MA-Thesis-Robert-Kaptein.pdf)\n\n\"Index funds try to follow the return of a specific index **as accurate as possible**, therefore they will need to buy the included stock before the actual inclusion takes place. To find the exact moment on which index funds buy the included stocks and sell the excluded stock, Think ETF\u00b4s, a Dutch ETF provider was interviewed about their trading procedure in case of an annual review (2016). Martijn Rozemuller, founder and managing director, and Aaron Renkers, fund manager, confirmed that Think ETF\u00b4s ideally buys the included stocks at the **market close of the day before the actual review takes place.** Index fund providers need to make sure that that they have the **included stocks before the inclusion day in order to prevent the risk of not completely following the index. Therefore index funds buy in the period before the inclusion date and at the latest at the market close of the last day before the index inclusion.** Therefore one would expect an upward price pattern in the days before the inclusion, and vice versa for exclusions.  \" \n\nI previously thought it could be done 3 days before and after the inclusion date, but i cannot find any evidence indicating this, so i will leave it out. but this makes it pretty clear that the 18th is the big day where over 100 million shares need to be bought. so don't be fooled by naysayers or those who seek to gain something by telling you its another day or its already have been bought. now you can clearly see they are fools, who are ignorant of the truth. Now I will not count out illegal activity because lets be honest, this is wallstreet fellow degenerates. But all funds buying before in liquid accounts this big to alleve buying pressure? likelihood is low,(and that it doesn't get caught) but there will always be those anomalies. \n\n**Fact: The 5 billion Offering was less than 1% of the company's current value.** This lowered the selling pressure a bit But not much.\n\n\" With Tesla\u2019s market capitalization at $598 billion, the new offering represents less than 1% of the company\u2019s value. \" [CNBC Article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/tesla-to-raise-up-to-5-billion-in-share-offering.html)\n\nSo I think I've made the landscape pretty clear for this upcoming week. If I've missed anything please let me know so I can update this. Thanks for reading!\n\nTLDR: Tesla is mooning, hop on board. And don't believe the b.s. people are pushing without sources to back it up.",

        "selftext": "Background: I've published peer-reviewed journal articles on China's politics and markets before. \n\nAlibaba (and Ant)'s getting pulled into a meeting with regulators today on the heels of a new anti-trust probe. Expect a correction, but much of the uncertainty had already been priced in. \n\nA quick sentiment analysis of the press releases from Chinese government mouthpieces like\u300a\u4eba\u6c11\u65e5\u5831\u300b\\[the People's Daily\\] shows their tone is much more mellow now than before. Where before they hawked on Ma and Alibaba, they're now focusing on \u201cthe country\u2019s focus on the healthy development of the platform economy in China\u201d. This talking point is repeated a significant number of times in the releases. \n\nThis stark shift in tone suggests regulators already have a for-show compromise in mind and BABA will only need to kiss the ring when they meet with said regulators today. It also suggests regulators are putting on this show for political grandstanding to send a message to digital companies and the billionaire class to do the same. \n\nTo put this into an even broader context, this episode is just the latest in a chest-puffing government campaign going on over the last couple of years to stress deference to the CCP. China's state-run banks have dragged their heels in performance for a while, and ever since private-sector digital platforms (BABA, JD, Meituan, TCEHY) have forged ahead in innovating much more efficient payment systems, the CCP felt left behind and wanted to be included in the party. What's key is we\u2019ve observed this campaign to be much more discursive and cultural in practice and effect (e.g. prodding individual people and companies to be more humble and thank the party, put on the frills, yaddi-yadda) than it has been economic (e.g. quashing entire companies). \n\nWhy? And where are we headed? BABA and the digital platform economy it's a leader in are essential to China. The CCP has been ramping up efforts to digitalize in a bid to take a lead in the global (fin)tech race and strengthen the yuan at the same time. The innovation of the new China digital currency is a game-changer. The Bank of China filed over 70 patents related to the digital currency in the past year. The patents will likely be approved 2021, which will be BABA's time to shine because the CCP will need the networks and infrastructure of Alipay to make the digital currency a success. \n\nMore bullish sentiment: in Q3 2020, close to 1800 hedge funds/financial institutions had BABA in their holdings, over 200 opened new positions, and \\~700 added to their positions. Bigger names who bought more over Q3: Cathie Woods' Ark, Ray Dalio's Bridgewater, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity, Barclays, Susquehanna, Deutsche, Canada Pension Plan, etc. It remains Blackrock's #8 holding and has become Bridgewater's #4 holding. \n\nMy take: buy and hold. I literally bought more yesterday and I intend to keep buying.",

        "selftext": " So I've been seeing a lot of posts/comments on different subs lately from new investors who are scared and are thinking of selling their BABA shares first thing tomorrow. If you are uncomfortable holding this company given the recent news, and understandably so, then go ahead - this post is not for you. It's your money, do whatever you want. But I want to make this post for the new investors who are in between/scared because they have a big position in this stock and are not sure what to do.\n\nFull disclaimer: Alibaba is my second biggest position and constitutes almost 8% of my portfolio. I have been holding this stock for a very long time and my cost basis is somewhere in the low 100s. Even I will be buying into this dip tomorrow. Let's break down some of the reasons and different scenarios:\n\n1. CCP (Chinese Communist Party) has bad blood with Jack Ma, not Alibaba. Yes Jack Ma was the founder and he still owns massive portions of the company, including portions of subsidiaries of this company, but he is no longer the CEO. If the government took some action against Jack Ma, it would not fundamentally hurt Alibaba as a whole. Let's remember, Alibaba is one of China's tech darlings. The government and their people take pride in Alibaba being one of the biggest companies in the world. CCP cares very deeply about the global image of China. They would not do anything drastic to the company that would ruin it's image or ruin the image of it's largest technology company\n2. Alibaba is facing anti-trust probes due to forcing sellers to do a pick one strategy. Right now, if vendors chose to sell on Alibaba's marketplace, they cannot sell on JD or Pinduoduo. Yes, the CCP can overturn this, and this is most likely what will happen. However, is this enough to justify the 5-10% sell-off that is coming tomorrow? Absolutely not. In fact, Alibaba trades at a 20x PE while Amazon trades at a PE above 100x. The company is already undervalued as of right now IMO.\n3. Alibaba may be forced to pay a fine to CCP: This changes absolutely nothing fundamental about the company. Alibaba is sitting on millions in cash and they generate insane levels of cash flow every quarter. Even a large fine would not hurt this company\n4. Alibaba may have to hand over some shares and ownership to CCP: This changes nothing about the company. Let's remember, the CCP essentially controls all businesses in China anyways. In particular, the CCP has always worked closely with Alibaba and Tencent anyways.\n5. Stricter regulations on Alibaba and Ant Group. This will likely happen. However, the company has already said it is willing to work with the CCP and regulators to come to an agreement.\n6. Worst case scenario: Alibaba gets broken up. Bad for Jack Ma, bad for Alibaba but GREAT for investors. If each of the parts of Alibaba were released separately into the market, Alibaba would be worth way more than what it is today. (The conglomerate discount: It's a thing, search it up)\n\nIn short, this anti-trust probe is likely just a small hiccup if you are a long term investor. CCP is most likely doing this just to remind Jack Ma and others that they are still the boss and that talking against Xi is a very bad idea, even if you are one of the richest man in the world. That is all.",

        "selftext": "i\u2019ve seen many posts here during my recent intro to this subreddit on Bullish BABA. It is a great firm no doubt, and I myself benefited immensely earlier in the year riding a 41-45% return.\n\nThis fiasco has been brewing for a while (since 2018). 2020 has ramped up over the past few months. Jack Ma didn\u2019t help himself by taunting a totalitarian government in public. \n\nI have no position on BABA, and I don\u2019t recommend any action right now other than take your damn time, hedge, and do your due diligence.\n\nReddit investor threads seldom are a good analysis or summary for any investment regardless of result. I dare you to find any reputable report/analysis that yields a page. Please people, hedge your portfolios because while it is fun to win 10k in a month, the music will eventually stop. This has happened every time, and you don\u2019t wanna be caught without a chair. You can talk shit about Buffett all you want, but there is a reason why the old man is revered and on top after so many ups and downs, he hedges on top of being defensive and having long time horizons. \n\nTL;DR - BABA is a prime example of the music stopping and why you need to HEDGE and do your DUE DILIGENCE",

I like to think I\u2019m doing decently. \n\nShould I switch to holding ETFs long term? Or just switch to buy and hold? I like swing trading but I admit I sold too early quite a few times. What are people with high tax liabilities doing? Does anyone know a good hedge fund or 5? \n\nI\u2019m paying 1/3 of my regular income in taxes, etc right now. No deductions - no mortgage (live at home), no kids, no nothing. So...what\u2019s the smart play here? I was planning to put every penny I save in 2021 into stocks....\n\nBefore you recommend it, I\u2019ve explored Roth IRA day trading, and I prefer Webull for day and swing trades but prefer Fidelity for my retirement, just feels more secure. I\u2019m not sure I trust Webull to be here in 50 years. I have FXAIX, etc in my Roth - buy and hold. If I do buy and hold, I\u2019ll do Vanguard and buy their ETF funds. There\u2019s also MHE, but the 4% returns, even if no taxes, are a bit low....",

        "selftext": "I believe AST Space Mobile ($NPA) could have one of the largest TAM\u2019s (they list it as $1 trillion in their presentation) by acting as the first and only space-based cellular broadband network that will bring connection to all cellular devices anywhere around the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s a speculative bet, but if they can meet their long term objectives I can see this company 100x+ over time. The first phase is to help the 51% of the world that doesn\u2019t have connection (think poor parts of Africa or parts of Japan where their lead investor Rakuten is investing many millions into AST).\nAST already has enough cash to make this phase happen (close to $550M) and has over 1,000 patents for the technology that works with any existing cell phone (key differentiating point).\u00a0 Most of the funding is coming from lead investors (Rakuten, AT&amp;T, Vodaphone, Samsung, American Tower).\u00a0 This is an extremely impressive investor list, which makes me think there is something special here.\u00a0 These type of companies don\u2019t just throw this kind of money around without extensive due diligence and conviction. These strategic investors are in for another $230 million at the $10 offering price so not far off from the current price. They also have a 12 month lockup period (longer than normal), which shows some confidence.\u00a0\nThe next phase would be global rollout where they plan to partner with current carriers.\u00a0 The plan is when you go somewhere that doesn\u2019t have connection it will push the option automatically to connect to AST Space Mobile. They are already in agreement with Vodaphone and AT&amp;T among others to push this out in the future. This would work literally anywhere on sea/plane or tough to reach parts of the USA/world.\u00a0 They would have a revenue share with the carriers.\u00a0 There is really no marketing costs or any additional work for AST to push this out and essentially reach every single person (seems like an amazing model). I know even living in Boston, MA I can\u2019t get a reliable connection on the train everyday to work so I would happily pay for this service.\u00a0\nOne of the more valuable use cases is during emergencies (like the other week in Tennessee) where everyone loses connection through traditional cellular towers.\u00a0 People would still get connection in these cases through Space Mobile and this seems like a must have feature that carriers will need to offer.\u00a0\u00a0\nAccording to the AST CEO and Rakuten CTO the initial testing has been successful, but 2021 will be another year of testing before the first phase is launched.\u00a0 They will need about another $1 billion plus in capex for the global rollout phase. \u00a0 There\u2019s a chance they could get substantial free US governmental funding one day or from other sources (see article below). Even if they don\u2019t it will be real easy to get these funds if the first phase is a success.\u00a0 They are also showing their EBITDA margins to be around 95% so they should be pumping out incredible amounts of cash after a few years if phase 1 is a success.\u00a0 It appears these low-orbit satellites will cost little to maintain and operate once in place based on Management\u2019s projections.\u00a0\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-us-senate-promotes-private-sector-development-of-next-generation-satellite-based-technology-to-deliver-broadband-connectivity-to-the-unconnected-301176838.html?s=03\u00a0\nThe CTO of Rakuten also discusses the partnership with AST at the link below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4MQxMQuy-c\nThis user \u201cSpactori\u201d on Stocktwitts seems to know the company very well so I have been reading his posts and asking various questions.\u00a0 He pointed out that AST also owns NanoAvionics https://nanoavionics.com/ (not clear if they own\u00a0 over 51% or 100%), which he thinks is valued between $500M to $1B, making the value for AST even more intriguing. The enterprise value at the $10 offering for AST is approximately $1.4 billion (net of cash).\u00a0 If the company can meet their long term objectives it will be massive - they are projecting $16.3 billion of EBITDA in 2030 (even if they can meet their phase 1 objectives it should be very successful where they project EBITDA of $1B in 2024 and $2.6B in 2025).\u00a0 You can imagine if you throw a 10x-30x multiple on the 2030 figures at that time ($160 billion - $500 billion market cap) compared to the $1.4B enterprise value at the offering price.\u00a0 Obviously they still need to prove that they can execute and get to a global rollout and many things could go wrong during this timeframe.\nThe current competition is very specialized since you need to purchase heavy industrial equipment and specialized phones that costs thousands of dollars to connect to satellites. Only special use cases are using this now it seems.\u00a0 It also seems AST is more mainstream than Starlink from SpaceX, which also needs special equipment to operate and doesn\u2019t work with cellular devices.\u00a0\nThere were discussions that Verizon and T-mobile were complaining early on to various parties and agencies about AST since they were scared of this technology and trying to block competition, but it seems they will have no choice but to join the AST system or else they will lose customers (along with any other carrier).\u00a0 American Tower ($100B market cap) investing and partnering in AST is essentially a hedge since their entire business could be disrupted from this.\u00a0\nI also like how the CEO seems credible and already successful having exited a prior satellite business for\u00a0 a large sum of money.\u00a0 He is clearly a serial entrepreneur.\u00a0 In the below interview he seems to be confident and is not pumping this or over hyping like some other CEO\u2019s of other pre-revenue companies or SPACS.\u00a0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54rsQvW9otk&amp;feature=emb_logo\nI would expect alot of volatility in the stock. It doesn\u2019t seem like the word is really out on AST and despite having many risks the opportunity seems too massive to pass up (not too mention the Company can do a lot of good for the world helping poor nations get connection and during emergency disasters when normal cellular towers can\u2019t be reached)\u00a0\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\nNote: this is not advice and can\u2019t be relied upon.\u00a0 Please do your own due diligence.\u00a0\u00a0I have a starter position. \nSee investor presentation for $NPA below\nhttps://www.npa-corp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AST_SpaceMobile_Investor_Presentation_Public_12-15-20.pdf\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0",

        "selftext": "Big fan of Peter lynch and the concept of uncomplicated investment strategies. Like Mr Lynch, I don't pay much attention to extra technical analysis.\n\nSo For me, when making big bulk (no yolo) investments, I only focus on a few things: \n\n* **Profitable?** (Yes , Margins? - Mid-HIGH %)\n* **Debt?** (Preferably NO, or Yes, but with 2x cash to pay it off)\n* **Competition?** (Yes, but market leader or top player) \n* **Growth ?** (Yes, more growth potential) \n\nTo me, a company that fits this criteria will get into my portfolio and I'll adjust as i see fit on a YoY basis. \n\nThis brings me to facebook. Currently trading at $277, I believe that the stock is far far far far undervalued. And below are my reasons why:   \n\n\n* **Is Facebook profitable?** \\- Yes, 2019 profits of $18.4billion on $70b revenue. We still have Q4 2020 to go and as of Q3 2020 Facebook generated around $21.5 billion in revenue up 22% year-on-year (beating estimates) \n* **Do they have debt?** ($277m as of 2019 with $55billion in cash)\n* **Competition** (they own a couple in IG and Whatsapp, but you also have Twtr, Snap, TikTok - FB is still most profitable out of all of them, better balance sheet) \n* **Growth** (Room for IG commerce, still yet to monetise whatsapp, could start off in non western countries if they wanted to do it slowly) \n\nFrom a balance sheet perspective, this is a solid business bearing in mind that almost every business took a hit from Covid. Facebook is not a 1-product company.. and they shouldn't be seen as such. The core FB app isn't going to be the source of future growth per se. Think Oculus, think Whatsapp payments, and many more.. ultimately, Facebook has one thing that everyone values - **DATA** from older audiences on the core product, to younger audiences on **Whatsapp and IG.** \n\n# What is the major risk? \n\n# Regulatory split up.. I don't need to go into details here, but we all know that FB is under a lot of anti-trust scrutiny much like AT&amp;T, Microsoft and Standard Oil experienced. \n\nMost people say that FB could be broken up.. and I say, this is more reason to **BUY.** \n\nTypically when a company is forced to split, it's existing shareholders will experience a split in shares across the various baby subsidiaries.. \n\n***Let's use AT&amp;T for example:*** \n\n&gt;On Jan. 1, 1984, more than 3 million AT&amp;T shareholders were given new stock: For every 10 shares of Ma Bell they owned, they received one share in each of seven new regional phone companies, or \u201cBaby Bells.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;10yrs later in 1996, their investment had grown more than 600%. 100 shares in AT&amp;T became 550 shares in 10 different companies. (source: [https://www.spokesman.com/stories/1996/may/25/att-rewards-steady-investors-shares-held-since/](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/1996/may/25/att-rewards-steady-investors-shares-held-since/)) \n\nAll in All, most forced splits via regulation only served to make the companies stronger : Another example - Standard Oil led to Exxon, BP etc (good for existing shareholders) \n\nThe bottomline is, Facebook is a wonderful business from a balance sheet perspective, and there is still room to grow.. the risks aren't as bad as they seem or different to any other business in the world and the only reason not to buy FB right now is probably your moral concerns of what they actually do. \n\nLooking forward to your thoughts.\n\nThank you.",

        "selftext": "Greetings fellow retards,\n\nI would like to submit for your consideration the following hypothesis: **a spin-off of a Financial Crime Enforcement division from within Stripe as a publicly owned company through Bill Ackman's SPAC.**\n\nAfter having my mind totally shattered the last few days by watching some of the most insane biopharma pumping and dumping upon the Actual Stupids that inhabit stocktwits.com go down in real time (and getting banned from the platform in the process), I decided to clear my head for a while and then have a good think about the forgotten jewel of my autistic eye, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings.\n\nThis hypothesis should be read as an optimist's case that could possibly tie together a number of disparate threads into a sort of unified field theory about the roles that a SPAC like PSTH specifically and an infrastructure behemoth like Stripe will have in building the economic future of the internet. If you feel like immediately dismissing this post because of [this exchange](https://imgur.com/azcdTT3) or because your brain don't work good for other reasons, please exit the \ud83d\ude80 immediately.\n\nTo start with [Bill Ackman](https://imgur.com/a/wwofHhU), I mean, just look at the man. You would let this silver fox impregnate your wife if he showed up at the door because you are, like me, A F*gg0t Who Cares Too Much (or if you please, a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b). It'd probably make her happy and you'd get a kid way smarter than the wretched spawn you've loosed from your own loins out of the deal, too.\n\nAnyway, for those who somehow still don't know this, Ackman is an activist investor and one of the more unconventional thinkers operating in the cesspool known as Wall Street. He's probably best known for two things: 1) his COVID crash short that was a [literal hundred bagger] (https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2020/03/25/billionaire-bill-ackman-100-fold-return-on-coronavirus-hedge-2-billion/?sh=6f49d29e6fcc) and 2) a short position that blew up in his face to the tune of $1 billion, which he took against the very cool and very legal company that is definitely not a pyramid scheme, Herbalife.\n\nIf you've been paying attention to Ackman's last few days on Twitter, [he's been busy putting the screws to the big credit card companies](https://imgur.com/ZHsjkAP), with some apparent [success](https://imgur.com/kOq2H8E), for servicing Pornhub, known destination for pedo creeps. As someone who has spent the last year and a half slowly losing sanity while learning as much as I can about one [Jeffrey Edward Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein), a network of events and financial institutions that support this hypothesis starts to take shape here.\n\nFamously, Epstein hung around a lot of people at the highest echelons of so-called \"polite\" society, appears to have been some kind of intelligence honeypot meant to blackmail sick rich fucks (look up the origins of the CIA if you want to know more about this), and [most definitely did not kill himself with the toilet paper thin sheets that they give you in the clink](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7855039/Graphic-photos-Jeffrey-Epsteins-autopsy-reveal-bloodied-neck.html) **(warning: dead guy pics within)**. He had close working relationships with [JP Morgan Chase](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/business/jeffrey-epstein-business-wall-street.html) and [Deutsche Bank](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/07/jeffrey-epstein-case-deutsche-bank-fined-150-million-penalty-for-relationship.html), which both have [conspicuously small positions](https://imgur.com/b4dOMkL) in PSTH, as well as [Goldman Sachs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jeffrey-epstein-burrowed-into-the-lives-of-the-rich-and-made-a-fortune-11564092553), which is totally absent. I should probably note [that Ackman's wife did receive some Epstein bucks through the MIT Media Lab](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/neri-oxman-jeffrey-epstein-13236/) and that Ackman looks to have tried to [bury that story,](https://www.axios.com/joi-jeffrey-epstein-ties-mit-media-lab-professor-8384aa42-32d4-42dc-a0eb-54e23bcdee3a.html) which is ***very not cool***. Anyway, enough about Epstein (go listen to TrueAnon if you want to get yourself some of the same psychic damage that I have about him \ud83d\udc41). \n\nBank ownership of PSTH seems weirdly low in general except for [Wells Fargo](https://imgur.com/I3mrEiM), which strikes me as odd when considering that the top known holder is of PSTH is Guggenheim, which has been historically [jacked to the tits](https://imgur.com/gRaf649) with holdings from the finance sector, but trimmed those positions considerably after the financial crisis.\n\nBy this point you may be finding yourself asking \"how the fuck does all this relate to Stripe, you schizoid freak?\" to which my response is that the [banks themselves](https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/) are the biggest financial crime doers in the world and with institutions like [Deutsche and JP Morgan](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-21/highlights-from-the-fincen-files-on-banks-suspect-transactions) being particularly egregious offenders, Ackman could be using his big fucking brain to cook up the future of public accountability in finance.\n\nConsider the recent toothlessness of the organizations theoretically in charge of maintaining compliance with financial laws. There are examples that directly are relevant to everyone here who uses Robinhood (which picked [fucking Goldman Sachs](https://www.reuters.com/article/robinhood-ipo/exclusive-trading-app-robinhood-hires-goldman-sachs-to-lead-ipo-sources-idUSL1N2IO2TN) to lead their IPO). This includes their failure to disclose their practice of [selling order flow](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-free-trading-on-robinhood-isnt-really-free-1541772001), for which they were fined a [piddly $1.25 million by FINRA](https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2019/finra-fines-robinhood-financial-llc-125-million-best-execution). Robinhood's [top buyer of order flow is a little company called Citadel,](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1m2p1cv68bx56/Twitter-Freaked-Out-Over-Robinhood-Selling-Its-Trade-Flow-But-the-App-and-Others-Have-Been-Doing-It-for-Years) which was fined [a mere $700,000](https://imgur.com/0yT6vpJ) for using this data to snipe retail orders from retards like you and your cousin Billy using [high frequency trading algorithms](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091615/world-high-frequency-algorithmic-trading.asp), which is called frontrunning and is ***extremely not cool and extremely not legal*** (but crime definitely pays). For a company whose literal mission statement is to [\"democratize finance for all,\"](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/our-mission/) Robinhood sure does seem to put their finger on the scale in ways that unquestionably favor the big guys and by extension, themselves. By the way, the concept selling of order flow was invented by a dude you may have heard of who is currently serving a 150 year sentence for running a giant Ponzi scheme and will well-deservedly die in prison in the middle of Fucking Nowhere, [Bernard Madoff](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentoforderflow.asp). Don't you wish the regulators would get off their knees, get the market maker dicks out of their mouths, and do their jobs?\n\nNow we return to Stripe. If you've ever bought anything on the internet, you've probably used Stripe to process the payment, even if you didn't realize it at the time. Stripe could wind up being one of the biggest and most valuable companies in the world if they play their cards right, and big brain haver [Paul Graham thinks they could wind up being the next Google in terms of valuation.](https://imgur.com/am4ONjr) Stripe is thought to [be valued somewhere from $70-100 billion right now](https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/28/what-to-make-of-stripes-possible-100-billion-valuation/), and we know that Ackman has about $7 billion in his war chest. I'd wager it's likely that the recent spate of IPOs by dog shit companies like AirBnB and DoorDash giving them ~$80 billion and ~$55 billion market caps respectively pushes Stripe's valuation toward the higher end of those current valuation estimates. Also take note of the second tweet in that screenshot, because it's strikes me as being not altogether dissimilar to what Ackman has previously said about what he thinks was his biggest miss going long, [Mastercard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxqTwpWizw4).\n\nStripe offers an [expansive and rapidly growing](https://imgur.com/OUSWYZi) anti-financial crimes platform called [Radar](https://stripe.com/radar) and is actively hiring for roles that seem like they'll be mission critical for the future of a company that's growing globally like [this one](https://stripe.com/jobs/listing/financial-crimes-investigation-payment-methods-lead-apac-chinese-speaker/2351914). They've already built the infrastructure that huge swathes of the internet economy run on and they're just getting rolling. \n\nGiven the utter levels of incompetence bordering on malfeasance by the syphilitic boomers with worm-filled brains that supposedly regulate finance, is it so implausible that an avowed optimist and guy who definitely thinks about this stuff more than you, [Patrick Collison,](https://imgur.com/5zwzFPm) would team up with the man running the [most investor-friendly SPAC ever](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/ackman-pershing-square-taking-no-compensation-for-new-spac-investment-vehicle.html) to truly bring the fight for equality of financial opportunity to the free market? I don't think so. Such an act would help subvert the power of creeps like [Ken Griffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_C._Griffin), who almost certainly believes that you and everyone you love are pathetic little worms that live in a world belonging to him and his buddies.\n\n**TLDR: An offshoot of Stripe could still be the target and the merger of PSTH with Stripe Radar as an independent, publicly owned entity, could be a step toward truly democratizing the markets and saving America and the rest of the world from the leviathan of Big Capital.** \n\n\nPositions: short puts and long shares + March calls of PSTH in my active trading account, along with ~25% of my Roth IRA currently allocated to PSTH shares with the intention to sell about half of my mutual fund holdings after the next dividend goes out and put all of that money into PSTH.\n\nDisclaimer: I am retarded and this is not financial advice. Sorry for any typos that still exist, I proofread this a bunch of times and I tried my best.\n\nP.S: if I die for any reason after making this post, please do not accept the coroner's conclusion, because it means JP Morgan and Deutsche probably sent their hitters after me.",

        "selftext": "Been lurking here for awhile.  Thought I'd share a small story with everyone.  If you don't like reading, carry on your way, ya fckin degen.\n\nI began MY journey to degeneracy with a simple \"intro to understanding a business\" video I found on youtube.  The business model explored in this video was a simple lemonade stand.  Basic, straightforward fundamentals; perfect.  A striking, clearly intelligent, well spoken, demure, silver-haired gentleman guides me through the growth of this business model, beginning as single lemonade stand with a single investor, all the way through to a dividend paying, publicly traded company.  Had doubts at first but it ends up being pretty good stuff.  I noted the gentleman's name and carried on my way, to continue skimming the very surface of the business/finance world.\n\n   As you may have guessed, the gentleman in this video is Bill Ackman.  I took a liking to the guy.  I did some reading, watched some more videos.  Wasn't long before I found out about Pershing Square Tontine Holdings.  Didn't know what a SPAC was so I had to learn about those.  Turns out Spacman's SPAC isn't like other SPACs.  Okay cool, why?  Many reasons, the largest (as I understand them) being, the massive amount of capital at its disposal, and the \"tontine\" setup of share value/distribution, upon merger.  \n\nOkay so how'd I get here?  I found a post by u/infamousbreadfruit99 (if you see this, thank you btw, great stuff).  His post about going hard into SPACman's SPAC reminded of an interview I'd seen with him.  This video was about Ackman's missed opportunity with VISA/MASTERCARD going public.  The video starts with Ackman recounting sometime someone asked him the question in the title, \"What is the single best business in the world?\"  His answer?  \"If you could own a royalty on people spending money.\"  Smart guy, smart answer.\n\n...and AFAIK Stripe is... literally that... right?\n\nAnyway.  Felt like sharing.  Fck u, ya welcome.",

        "selftext": "Strap in for a wall of text boys, it's worth it I promise. \n\nChina's Crown Jewel, Alibaba, is trading lower in US markets on uncertainty surrounding a series of problems the company has been facing in the US media and public eye. The following are the 'catalysts' to this price action, by order of popularity in the US News media:\n\n1. The delay of Ant Group's IPO , owner of Alipay and affiliate company of Alibaba, headed by Jack Ma\n2. Antitrust investigation into Alibaba for antitrust practices, namely 'forced exclusivity' agreements with vendors\n3. Rumors of bad blood betweeen Xi Jinping and Jack Ma\n4. Fears of heightening hostility between US and China through trade and posturing, risk of a 'Cold War II'\n\nAll of these are immaterial, however, in the face of a much larger 'catalyst' that has been historically holding down prices for Chinese firms: red-scare propagandizing of planned economies within the US public, lack of information available to foreign investors, and a fundamental misunderstanding of the political environment and philosophies of Chinese government.\n\nThe fundamental reason for my thesis is my belief that these secondary catalysts will be removed as China opens further to foreign investment, in line with the philosophical framework that underlies their society, namely Socialism with Chinese characterstics and Deng Xiaoping Theory. Under these philosophies, China, a socialist state whose stated goal is the development of communism--a form of stateless, classless society--must harness markets where necessary within society's productive forces to maintain their position as a global power while the state apparatus continues the 'transitional phase' between socialism and communism, which is basically a very slow retraction or 'phasing-out' of the state once stability has been attained under public ownership. The people must resist capitalist aggression against China in order to be successful, since in their view China has a target on its back in the capitalist world community, and must be destroyed to maintain the validity of existing contradictory power structures within capitalist nations. In order to accomplish this, China has opened itself to foreign investment from capitalist nations, and seems eager to stabilize their role in the international community and 'spread the good word'. Whether you agree with the dominant political ideology in China, it's highly likely that it will be a key predictor of their actions in the coming months, and it is the misunderstanding oft his ideology by foreign investors that is driving their overreaction to recent news about Alibaba, and a much larger problem of high volatility and negative sentiment surrounding Chinese firms.\n\nUnder the philosophy of Dengism, if we re-examine the four catalysts driving down prices in international markets, they prove to be immaterial. Ant Group's IPO delay after Ma's struggle against regulators is part of a larger push to attract controlled foreign investment in the Chinese finance industry. Alibaba itself is not Jack Ma's property, but now part of a larger structure that must be maintained, at the risk of the collapse of the entire socialist project. If Jack Ma displays insubordination or lack of adherence to this goal, then he must be made to understand the error in his ways, or risk condemnation by the state which he is working against. Antitrust investigations into Alibaba are a push to encourage competition in the market, again with the purpose of attracting foreign investment in the country as a whole. Alibaba and Ant Group both welcome regulation, as it is part of a larger social project towards and evolution of society, and to go against this imperative would go against the very ideology their nation was founded on. Any 'bad blood' between Jack Ma and Xi Jinping is no greater than between Xi and any other chinese billionaire, and entirely depends of Ma's willingness to rejoin the path of Dengist thought, which he eventually will under penalty of death. Nonetheless, Alibaba will press on without him.\n\nIn the long run, a rising tide will lift all boats. Both Alibaba and its domestic competitors $PDD, $JD, and others will continue to grow as the sector expands, and as foreign investors gain a better understanding of China. $BABA is uniquely positioned to these other firms, as it has the strongest fundamentals and largest marketshare, with its fingers in about as many pies as a company can. Anti-trust and anti-big business are not synonymous, and Alibaba has done its part to prepare itself for the day when it would inevitably be brought into the fold by diversifying its revenue sources, and cementing itself as THE most important player in China's ascension to world superpower without falling out of favor with China's dominant political denomination.\n\n\nBABA is literally too big to fail, **if you think it will respect the price floor at $200 and won't be wiped off the face of the earth (which it wont), then most LEAPs are almost all upside** [my position](https://ibb.co/zXdrBzZ)\n\n[chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/BN4pYd6c/)\n\nSupplemental reading:\n[Alibaba antitrust probe isn't political](https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3115344/alibaba-antitrust-probe-not-sign-winter-coming-new-start-tech-industry)\n\n[Alibaba CEO bends the knee](https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3115399/alibaba-antitrust-probe-ceo-affirms-commitment-regulated-development)\n\n[China heavily encouraging foreign investment](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/29/chinas-moves-to-boost-foreign-business-also-helps-chinese-companies.html)\n\n[BABA itself is Buying The Fucking Dip\u2122](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-group-upsizes-share-repurchase-000000595.html)\n\nPositions:\nShitload of shares, and BABA 1/21/2022 300c",

        "selftext": "Why the fuck did everyone forget about DKNG? This got pumped up over $60 a couple months ago and has shown a steady rebound since falling back to a low of around $35 on 11/2. For about a month now, there has been some nice consolidation and it appears to be ready for another breakout soon. It looks like resistance is soon going to meet support while the RSI is also showing slightly on the oversold side.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wtfhbr1lcc861.png?width=1250&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da011d27029154ab2bad73d07bb76fb642c100f8\n\nSo what caused the first coming of this stock to meme? Sports coming back. What will cause the second coming of the meme? Sports returning to stability and normalcy. I already have shares and I like May 21 call options here for a couple reasons.

        "selftext": "**Why did FuboTv and Lemonade crash yesterday. JP Morgan goes all-in on travel and Nikola spikes after their report. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/w73qSnv) leading the way, up .87%, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/6y9ZnHT) also gaining more than .7% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/qnJN88J) rising by more than 200 points to finish the day, with all 3 big indexes finishing broadly higher, with all of them also closing at all-time highs, after the relief [BILL](https://ibb.co/LRcCDdL) lifted many stocks, as this bill does include direct payments and unemployment benefits while also including over $300B that will be direct to the small businesses relief funding programs alongside other good [programs](https://ibb.co/jbhM2b2), like rent assistance, child care, vaccine distribution and others. But despite this great movement in the stock market, we did see the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Hn8QrkZ) rising by almost 1%, with most factor groups trading lower [yesterday](https://ibb.co/F7dWsYS), with only large-cap growth companies gaining, while the biggest losers were in the small and mid-caps, especially the growth companies.\n\n[Yesterday](https://ibb.co/Cwnvhrv) there was almost a 50/50 split in advancing to declining stocks, with 177 new highs on decent volume, as more companies have started to trade below the 50-day SMA, which is a good thing as the trend was worrying with over 84% of companies above that moving average just recently.\n\nWe also saw 9 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/Km2fdpd) gaining yesterday with communications, consumer discretionary and technology all gaining over 1% for the day while the 2 sectors that lost ground and lagged the market were Energy and Materials.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gr6GrMj) that confirms those charts, as we can see big gains made in the big tech names with Amazon, Facebook and Google all gaining more than 2% for the day with Netflix and Microsoft also posting a 1% gain. We can also see the biggest losers coming in the Software-Application and Biotech sectors, probably because of tons of profit taking after huge-runups this year, while funds want to show investors that they own the big names, not those very volatile high-flying stocks of 2020, maybe that is one of the reasons for this rotation.\n\nWe also saw the total people through TSA [checkpoints](https://ibb.co/ByxKmYy) in the Christmas weekend rise to over 2.4M people, the busiest since March, but that is still down about 50% since last year. This are better news for the Airlines especially after Trump also finally signed the stimulus bill which does include funds for the Airlines.\n\nWhile TrueCar also released some December [estimates](https://ibb.co/KL4K7X9) for auto sales, in which we can see a 4,7% increase year over year and a 32% increase over last month, as the industry is still continuing the rebound since the March lows. This is a good outlook for the industry so expect big OEM to start rising again after a pause in companies like Ford or GM since the end of November. Regarding this subject maybe Tesla can start selling even more cars, this after an Indian minister [reported](https://ibb.co/k2W2LML) Tesla will start operations in early 2021 in the country.\n\nAlongside great sales numbers in the auto industry, we also received the Dallas FED manufacturing [Survey](https://ibb.co/Ssdf7Kd), which came in better than expected with production, new orders and capacity utilization all having big increases since the last report.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/vdHr1wT) we get some numbers from the Redbook store sales and the SP Home Price Index, while we also await to see what the Republican [Senate](https://ibb.co/261v76w) will do after the House passed the $2000 stimulus proposal, as the leader of the Senate hasn\u2019t yet announced anything.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw some highly volatile names make moves with [Nikola](https://ibb.co/M8xVsvm) popping after a JP Morgan analyst predicted a less drama filled 2021, I can\u2019t imagine what he sees in the company, as they still don\u2019t have any new breakthrough technology or really anything to show, just promises after promises. While we also saw [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/vkkLy38) dropping more than 11% for the 2nd straight day before regaining some of the losses after-hours, this happened after it was called a best short idea at Hedgeye on top of last week short reports, and meanwhile, we also saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vVZnw9c) fall 14% after the lockup period expired after the IPO, adding more than 30M shares to the small public float available until now.\n\nWe also saw JP Morgan [acquiring](https://ibb.co/WVq4jGp) a credit card rewards business; thus, betting travel will come back in the next years. The company will acquire the technology platforms, travel agency, gift card and points businesses from cxLoyalty Group, which is a privately held company. This will be a hit to Expedia, as JP Morgan had been using the credit card rewards program from them, but now will return the use the cxLoyalty platform like they did until 2018, as cxLoyalty has over 3.000 clients and market partners like Citigroup, Capital One and Mastercard and serve more than 70M consumers.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as both the [EU STOCKS](https://ibb.co/zFkGLYs) and the [US FUTURES](https://ibb.co/R2L0kRV) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way, as growth companies are [outperforming](https://ibb.co/gMFNd50) the value plays in this final month of 2020. As we also saw yesterday Goldman\u2019s chief economist lifting the [outlook](https://ibb.co/rv12bH5) for the Q1 US GDP by 2% and a full year growth increase of .50% to see a GDP growth of 5.8% in 2021, which should be another bullish sign for the stock market.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

        "selftext": "# The Synopsis - Nothing new, just wrapping it in a bow\n\nAlright Handi-Capables, buckle up - I am going to tell you about a little WSB speculation that may be either the biggest fraud of all time or the most epic DD ever to have occurred in WSB history. A lot of this information comes from a real dick head named Yolo Capital Management on Twitter who is also known as u/infamousbreadfruit99  within this Gamblers subreddit. This guy is a real piece of work, but I've come to have a real good working relationship with him as we've discussed theories behind Pershing Square as well as the most hyped target being discussed, STRIPE. This thread is really meant to just outline all the history, the theories, the risks and the potential moves that you can do to minimize risk. **I don't want this to turn into the great NRPLing of 2020, where PURPLE had the best quarter of all time but you Degenerates all sold off because they didn't announce an electric vehicle or an Ipad powered exercise bike. Warning to all: This is purely speculation, this SPAC is trading at 30% above NAV which is pretty damn unprecedented without any news. So be cautious as the downside might be 5-6 dollars per share should Bill announce a terrible DUD of a target. This post is not advice, really just general information that I am trying to present in an un-biased way. PSA:  I am biased as hell though, hence my 3M investment, although I don't buy all the theories presented by some people on the forums. Also, there is a very good possibility that this SPAC doesn't acquire STRIPE.**\n\nFirst of all, for those of you not aware, PSTH is a SPAC led by Bill Ackman **(A very successful billionaire  Jew, hence the title - Not an anti-Semitic post, genuinely aligns with the theory of an announcement soon)**. A SPAC is a special acquisition company that aspired to bring a company public through a reverse merger. The new entity receives a cash infusion and the SPAC holders shares become stock units in the company that trade on the open Market. SPACS are essentially just a giant cash reserve used to purchase a company. This particular SPAC IPO'd with Units being traded for 20.00 and 20.00 NAV in the trust. The units have since split into Warrants and Shares. As of last week, warrants were trading in the high single digits and shares were trading just below 26.00. Regardless of what the stock trades at, the NAV will remain fairly constant at 20.00 per share. For discussions sake, I am going to consider 20.00 as the theoretical floor as it would be very unusual for a Pre-Merger SPAC to drop drastically below NAV. Once a SPAC merges, the 20.00 floor is removed and market demand and market conditions determine the share price going forward. There have been many theoretical questions thrown around about how much this will jump on an announcement and the answer is **that no one knows until the terms of the deal are announced.**\n\n# The SPAC Structure and Anchor Investors\n\nNow that we have this out of the way, let's talk about Bill Ackman's SPAC. This SPAC launched on July 22nd, 2020, the SPAC sold 200,000,000 units for a total trust size of 4 Billion USD. There were additional clauses in this filing that allow for even more units to be issued to increase the buying power of the SPAC to somewhere in the 7B range. The SPAC was subscribed by some very Reputable investors. Investors Included :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Largest Institutional Investors](https://preview.redd.it/p0lmr68tel361.png?width=1317&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94857b6901ef98c609b21940244d5b962098142a)\n\nAs you can see, you have some whale investors that include Wells Fargo, Baopost hedge fund, Soroban capital and Guggenheim. Well over 2B dollars is held by these 12 investors. According to the filing, institutions own about 65% of the public float. On Bill Ackmans last hedge fund call he indicated that because there was so much interest in this SPAC, he was able to hand pick his investors. Many of these investors are likely sovereign wealth funds or family offices that do not file and therefore we have no insight into whom they are, but Bill does.\n\nEach one of these investors owns common stock that was likely issued after the units split. For those of you that aren't aware, this SPAC has 3/9 of a common warrant per share. 1/9 was issued during the split from the units and the other 2/9 are issued to common share holders that hold through a merger. These warrants have a 23.00 strike price and they can be redeemed after the stock trades above 36.00 for a defined time period. If you don't know what a warrant is just ignore this paragraph.\n\nThis SPAC was designed with very favorable terms that ensure the sponsor's goals align with the company goals and don't create a conflict of interest. Many Many Many Many SPACs have very favorable terms that leave the sponsor's rich and the investors holding bags. \n\nThis is a very very good article that defines conflicts of interest within SPACS. PSTH has eliminated many of these issues and Bill Ackman's interest align with ours, in fact Bill can't make money until the investors reach a certain threshold of gains.\n\n[https://www.sewkis.com/publications/spacs-are-back-back-again-what-you-should-know/](https://www.sewkis.com/publications/spacs-are-back-back-again-what-you-should-know/)\n\nThis SPAC hard garnered many anchor investors and its structure is very very favorable as compared to its peers. Bill is setting a new precedent in the SPAC world and it will be interesting to see if other sponsors do the same. This is a key differentiating factor as to why this SPAC is very premium.\n\n# Targets and Timing\n\nWhen this SPAC first launched, Bill Ackman indicated that he would likely find a target within 6 months and merge shortly thereafter. Bill also indicated that he was looking for a minority interest in a unicorn that met certain criteria. Here is the criteria as pulled directly from Pershing Square's website. On the last Pershing earnings call, it was indicated that Bill so no reason that he wouldn't meet his original timeline of having a target announced by Q1 and a merger by Q2. January 22nd is the official 6 month milestone from when the SPAC first began trading.\n\n \n\n* **Simple, predictable, and free-cash-flow-generative.**\u00a0We will generally seek companies with a proven track record of growth and free cash flow generation, and predictable future financial performance that we expect will generate strong, sustainable growth in cash flows over the long term\u2014however, we are open to considering a company that may, at the time of the initial business combination, be cash-flow negative, if we believe that the business\u2019s cash flow will become positive within a reasonable amount of time;\n* **Formidable barriers to entry.**\u00a0We will seek companies that have long-term sustainable competitive advantages, significant barriers to entry, or \u201cwide moats\u201d around their business, and low risks of disruption due to competition, innovation or new entrants;\n* **Limited exposure to extrinsic factors that we cannot control**. We will seek companies that are not materially affected by macroeconomic factors, commodity prices, regulatory risks, interest rate volatility and/or cyclical risk;\n* **Strong balance sheet**. We will seek companies that are conservatively financed relative to their free-cash-flow generation, after taking into consideration the\u00a0de-leveraging\u00a0effects of the initial business combination;\n* **Minimal capital markets dependency**. We will seek companies that can benefit from being a public company with broader access to the capital markets and greater governance, but will prefer companies that are not highly reliant on the capital markets to operate and grow their businesses;\n* **Large capitalization**. We will seek companies with large enterprise values and significant long-term growth potential that will be likely candidates for inclusion in the S&amp;P 500 index;\n* **Attractive valuation**. We will seek companies at an attractive valuation relative to their long-term intrinsic value; and\n* **Exceptional management and governance**. We will seek companies that have trustworthy, talented, experienced, and highly competent management teams. These companies may be led by entrepreneurs who are looking for a partner with our expertise to execute on the next stage of their growth. For target companies that require new management, we will leverage PSCM\u2019s experience in identifying and recruiting new management.\n\nAfter providing this criteria, Bill indicated there were likely 150 companies that were considered mature unicorns and \\~50 of them would meet all of Bill's criteria. Also, Bill indicated there may be other potential targets that are subsidiaries of other companies. \n\nAccording to the World Wide Web, here are the list of some potential unicorns.\n\n[https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies)\n\nSome of the most well known being: \n\n* SPACEX\n* COINBASE\n*  BYTEDANCE \n* STRIPE\n* AIRBNB, \n* INSTACART\n* EPIC GAMES\n* Door Dash\n* DJI\n* SHEIN\n* CHIME\n* JUUL\n* ROBINHOOD\n* WISH\n* ARGO\n* TOKOPEDIA\n* SOFI\n\n# The Stripe Conjecture - Initialize Tin Foil Hats\n\nIf you don't want to hear the theories, then stop reading now as this is just going to really summarize many interesting snippets of information that don't necessarily mean anything but are certainly interesting.\n\n* Jackie Reses Stepping down from Square and maintaining a board seat on PSTH\n   * Jackie was the head of capital for square\n   * Stripe just launched Capital\n   * Jackie is a baller and has more big Dick energy than any man, woman or child alive when it comes to finance.\n   * Jackie has liked several PSTH related tweets, but she has also like other tweets about other financial institutions. This might just be purely coincidence.\n   * Why would Jackie step down from Square but retain all her other board seats, including those on Chamanth's SPACS. Is there a conflict of interest?\n* Bill Ackman following Collison Brothers on Twitter, he doesn't even follow the CEO's of all his biggest investments.\n   * Bill only follows 182 people\n   * Bill Doesn't follow the CEO of Lowes\n   * Bill Doesn't follow the CEO of Chipotle, as far as I can tell - CEO's twitter appears to be private\n   * Bill Doesn't follow Hilton's account, CEO doesn't have twitter as far as I can tell\n   * Bill DOES follow starbucks CEO\n   * Bill Doesn't follow Agilent CEO\n   * Bill Doesn't follow Howard Hughes companies or leadership as far as I can tell\n* John Collison Following Breadfruit on Twitter (Yolocapitalmgmt)\n   * This dude is a billionaire that is following a WSB degenerate posting conspiracy theories.\n   * &amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/syzsbimcpl361.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1cdaf5940156de2aabad55172ce983a3cf57674\n\n* Global head of security was following Breadfruit on Twitter\n   * This dude is one of the original Irish stripe employees.... he has since unfollowed but he was. His name is Brian Delahunty\n* Wells FARGO invested in a PRE LOI SPAC - What the hell?\n   * This is the one that I can't figure out. Why in the hell would wells FARGO invest in a shell company if they didn't have any inclination as to the target. HAS THIS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE? We know that wells fargo and stripe do have a relationship\n* SETH KLARMAN INVESTED IN A PRE LOI SPAC\n   * This is another ODD one. This is basically Seth Klarman saying hey Bill, your Hedge fund can invest my 400 million better than me?????????????? These are two different hedge fund manager and one of them is investing in the other. This is absolutely weird.\n* The size of the SPAC limits targets: why so big Bill???????\n   * Why in the world would Bill limit his options to such a small amount of companies, companies that are typically already backed by big money...... This is another point I can't wrap my head around, why in the world would bill launch a SPAC of this size without having preliminary top level talks. The sheer size of the SPAC is telling, he knew he wanted a whale and if he didn't think he could get one he would've maybe gone with a 2B dollar SPAC with the option to increase to 4B, INSTEAD he went with a 4B SPAC with option to go all the way to 7B!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n* Why would the Collison brothers have talks at all with Bill if they didn't intend to go public? The brothers are some smart as Ginger Snaps and they knew Bill had a giant ass blank check. Many people are saying the collison brothers will IPO and they don't need Bill... Why waste your time meeting with Bill then if SPACing wasn't a possibility and going public wasn't a near term event?\n* Why hasn't Bill or the Collison's denied it\n   * Bloomberg denied rumors within an hour\n   * Airbnb Denied rumors within days\n   * Not a single Denial statement from Collisons or Big Dick Bill.\n* Collison Brothers are going for funding at a much higher valuation\n   * Why would they be going for funding, they just got funding in April. Also, it's rumored that Stripe is potentially already profitable.\n* Bill Ackman indicated his biggest regret was missing the boat on Mastercard\n* Bill Ackman is taking a minority stake so the terms are more appealing to unicorns as they can maintain control, raise funding and have large anchor investors that aren't worried about short term gains.\n\n# The ANTITHESIS to the conjecture\n\n* John Collison is trolling - If there was a deal why would John troll.\n* The Collisons just indicated they were not preparing a flotation.\n   * &amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d7v47h1btl361.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d637174323dd1c70c0e87ec31aa06a2bca601b6e\n\n* The Collisons are a freaking darling that can raise private equity whenever they want, they really don't need Bill\n* Jackie Reses has trolled Breadfuit AKA Yolo on twitter\n* STRIPE doesn't need funding\n* Bill Ackman's historical investments are not fintech, why would he start\n* Big Unicorns don't want bill because he is an activist.\n\n# The Risk to Reward\n\n* You need to be aware that this is trading at a 30% premium to asset value. This means that for every share you buy at 26.00, there is only 20.00 of money in the trust being used to acquire the company. This means that we need to land a good company with good terms to justify the premium.\n* This SPAC is huge, it's not likely to quadruple like some of the other spacs. \n   * If a great deal is reached with a real hype company then we might see 35-40 pre merger and 40+ post merger. Otherwise, we will probably see 30-35, depending on the terms.\n* The SPAC has 2 years to make a deal and we are only \\~5 months into this duration. Your money could sit idle for another 18 months.\n* Warrants expire worthless should a deal fail to materialize. This is why I am not specifically buying warrants, although I do expect a deal will materialize.\n\n# Why I invested\n\n* I like Bill Ackman, he gets it done, he is smart, pragmatic and he learns from his mistakes.\n* This is really an investment in Bill, similar to investing in TSLA, it's really an investment in leadership, not so much the product.\n* Bill does have a relationship with some big players and he will land a good deal no matter what. Even if this is not Stripe, I will likely hold everything long term.\n* Tontine structure is appealing and it rewards holders. Google Tontine if you don't know what it is.\n* If they do get Stripe, you are getting Young visionary leadership and frankly I think the Collison's are probably stand up guys. In the back of my mind, I believe that they might SPAC to give the average joe an opportunity to invest; they seem more motivated in building an empire of amazing financial infrastructure products than getting egregious valuations\n* If they Don't get Stripe you are still getting Bill Ackman and Jackie Reses hunting for a company - they are both legends.\n* Anchor investors presented above indicate they are bullish on Bill, not to mention they limit the available float and if it is a epic deal, anchor investors holding will help push price of stock upwards.\n\n# The Plays\n\n* I am only buying commons.\n* For those that want options, I wouldn't buy any options earlier than a march '21 expiration and a 20.00 strike.\n* If I were buying options I would buy June expiration 15.00 strikes.\n* My previous posts outline why I believe just buying common stock is the way to go. Ticker is PSTH.\n\n# MY POSITIONS\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5uqhlk10wl361.png?width=1512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aeb0553b3ecb7ed0bb7d145ad6bb1cb08e3047dc\n\n# TL:DR\n\n* Bill will probably buy Subway and we're all FK'd.\n* Don't buy because it might be stripe, buy because it's Bill and Jackie.\n* Don't buy lotto's as I don't believe this SPAC won't react like others.\n* This isn't investing advice. This is my thought process spewed about on a forum.\n\nMODS- Not sure if this qualifies as DD or not, but if it doesn't PM me and I will change it to story time or shitpost.",

        "selftext": "**Are investors too bullish right now? What are the latest market movements in the auto industry? Pot get legalized in Mexico while FuboTv Plunges yet again. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning!\n\nFirst of all, I wanted to wish everyone a happy new year and hopefully things get better in 2021, and this also brings us at least the great returns that we had in 2020 in the stock market! \n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes finish the last full trading day of the year in the green, with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/0cvjjHN) leading the way, up .24% and closing at a new record high, while both the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/QFyd2f6) and the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/B67fT1g) were up just over .1% for the day.\n\nWe also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/b6Nqf9Z) barely drop yesterday closing just below 23, and with the Georgia runoff election just days away, we can see this going higher if the Democrats win both seats.\n\nWe saw almost 70% of the companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/g9CHK9Q) with most of them trading way below average volume as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/LzXDF2P) finished in the green, with Energy &amp; Materials closing the day up more than 1.3% while the biggest loser was the Communications sector, falling almost 0.7%, as we saw the small-cap stocks regain some momentum, [leading](https://ibb.co/yQCFtTZ) the way after they had 2 very bad days to start the week, while the only group that was losing ground yesterday was the large-cap growth sector.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/x5bN7Lk) from yesterday that pretty much sums up the other charts as we can see most big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and even Apple losing ground for the day, while the biggest gainers were companies like Tesla &amp; TSM alongside the industrial sector and companies like Disney and Mastercard.\n\nYesterday we also got the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/7QPXjPV), which for me personally came in pretty mixed, as I use this as a contrarian indicator. This last week we saw 2.5% more investors moving to the bull\u2019s camp, while we also saw almost a 5% increase in bears, as investors become more divided. I think the market is still a little to over bullish and I would avoid to add more money right now, but I wouldn\u2019t get of the stock market either. I think this is a good moment to stay put and wait for more developments overall, but there might still be some good opportunities around in the market and I wouldn\u2019t avoid getting into those.\n\nWe also got a lot of economic data yesterday, with a survey for business uncertainty for [December](https://ibb.co/87FMyQ6) showing increasing uncertainty for sales growth but a with a small decline in employment growth expectations. \n\nMeanwhile another number that confirms the investor sentiment survey is the Investor Confidence [Index](https://ibb.co/5952C9Z) which rose by more than 13 points in November, as investors increased the risk appetite for their portfolios.\n\nAlongside this we also saw the November pending home [SALES](https://ibb.co/F8WBXnh) decrease by more than 2.5% month over month, but are still up more than 16% since a year ago, with this monthly decrease mostly coming due to the shortage of inventory.\n\nThe Chicago [PMI](https://ibb.co/QF40My3) also came in way better than expected and 59.5 vs 57 expected and up from the 58.2 in the previous month with the biggest movement coming from the employment indicator as it rose to a one year high but is still in contraction territory since 2019.\n\nWe also saw the wholesale [inventories](https://ibb.co/fkWmNmc) decrease in November\u2019s advance read while the [retail](https://ibb.co/BBKNrb5) inventories saw an increase of .7%, pretty much in-line with expectations while the trade [balance](https://ibb.co/CKSR070) also saw a surprise decline in the deficit to more than of $84B, $4B worse than the last revision.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/D14JGZc) we get initial and continuing jobless claims numbers, alongside the money supply and the FED Balance sheet to end us off for the year as market close early today.\n\nIn some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/GkZgGM1), we saw Fubo sink more than 14% again yesterday after another investing firm announced they have shorted the stock, pointing to the insane valuations of more than $13.000/subscriber.\n\nWe also saw a [research](https://ibb.co/QMF5fnG) that indicated some changes in the market share of car companies with Hyundai/Kia having the biggest gains alongside GM, while Nissan saw the biggest decline in market share, mostly due to selling larger &amp; pricier SUVs with cars continuing to see a decline in sales, while the larger vehicles have started to rebound slightly, as all car makers are [bringing](https://ibb.co/kJGkXtz) more &amp; more SUVs and Trucks to the market.\n\nLockheed Martin also was [awarded](https://ibb.co/bWS5G6j) a new Navy contract worth more than $900M as this might help the company start to get back on track while Mexico will become the world largest legal cannabis market as the Mexican Senate passed a bill in November which is [expected](https://ibb.co/VW3Lqtn) to receive approval in the lower house by February. This is great news for companies in the sector like ACB, Canopy Growth and the future merged company Tilray &amp; Aphria.\n\nAlso, one of the biggest active ETFs with over $15B in assets, the [ARK](https://ibb.co/80WJFdW) Innovation ETF saw it\u2019s first daily withdrawal since November, as this hasn\u2019t experienced weekly outflows since early in 2020, this might have been driven by profit taking as this ETF has surged more than 140% this year and also just the ex-dividend date on the 29th, as people expect for the ETF to have a hard time in duplicating the results of this year, which saw it rise on the back of Tesla and Roku with both of them seeing massive increases, with Tesla having more then 7x-ing this year, as that is the biggest holding in the ETF, but who knows we have to wait and see as [TESLA](https://ibb.co/ZzGQgqX) may hit 500K deliveries this year.\n\nAnd one last piece of [news](https://ibb.co/9bQhB4B) is that Apple did a big purge in their App Store, removing almost 40K game apps as this was the deadline for the developers to submit a government issued license number that enabled users to make in-app purchases. I don\u2019t really think this will have a major impact for the revenues but we will soon find out.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mvv7tjX) seem to be pointing at a mixed open, with the Nasdaq and the SP500 pointing at a good open while the Dow is slightly down, and with no connection to this, in the UK, the [BREXIT](https://ibb.co/Rh1DYyG) chapter is finally about to close.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

It could bounce/consolidate around 2.38 and head back down to the 2 support level and make another run. Thit would be an optional place to scale in additional funds with a SL at 1.90 the risk/reward is quite attractive.  \nThe reasons why I think it won't bounce off 2.38 is because of the tailwind it has from the stay at home stocks. As the numbers climb they're coming back into favour and this is the canadian version. Expect it to break through 2.38 on the first attempt and the falling wedge and fib retracement levels (2.38, 2.59, 2.75, 2.91, 3.13, 3.41) will become support if it pulls back at all.  \nAny retracement back to any of those levels confirms the pattern on the first bounce off and that can serve as a place to scale in a final time.  \nOf course it could rip pretty quick at the same time with no real bounces to load up but one of the above scenarios is very likely. I'm 75% confident on this one, but that confidence would increase to 85% if it bounces off $2 one more time to fill up the wedge. Buying back in at $2 and keeping the SL at 1.90 minimizes losses and allows to be fully loaded for a final run at the wedge resistance.\u00a0  \n\n\nAnother thing I like is the 13/30 MA (hourly)crossed over to the upside so we'll definitely head up in the short term.\n\nIs this a good stock to hold long term? Who the hell knows? Is it a good stock to grab while virus numbers skyrocket? Very possibly.\u00a0\n\nDisclaimer - I am long DOC (as of yesterday)\u00a0",

        "selftext": "Sorry to be cliche and bring this up yet again but heres my take:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) There is definitely more downside. \n\n\\-How much downside? Not sure. But the fact that Jack MA opened his mouth and spoke out about the CCP was a big mistake. Aside from MA, China doesn't want BABA to get so big they can't control it. I think during the course of the probe shares will continue to slump. I wouldn't be surprised if at its lowest it dipped under $190.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I wouldn't buy BABA right now. \n\n\\- There is absolutely no telling what Chinese officials will do to BABA. You may have some idea, but at the end of the day it's the CCP and you cannot predict what they do. Therefore, any investment in BABA (right now) I would consider extremely risky. All it takes is the CCP to announce they are breaking BABA up for shares to sink like the titanic. Is this likely to happen? No. In fact it's unlikely. But from a pure risk perspective there is way too much uncertainty.  I sold my position today. My thought is they will just inject more CCP officials into board positions in the company, giving them more control over it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Wait for good news before buying. \n\n\\-Good news being that the investigation has concluded, and that BABA will not be broken up. As the saying goes, don't try to catch a  falling knife. Even if you miss out on that first 5-10% up-spike, you at least wont be averaging into something with a ton of uncertainty that could still tank.    \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will say i'm kind of surprised at the amount of people who are saying to buy BABA now. This investigation just started. BABA is not going to go back up any time soon. You also have no idea what the investigations findings/actions will be. Way to much uncertainty for me.",

        "selftext": "News broke yesterday that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) formally started an antitrust investigation of Alibaba. The stock plummeted by more than 7% in after and pre-market trading. This is the latest development in the ongoing story of a deterioration in relations between Alibaba and the CCP following Jack Ma's harsh criticisms of China's financial regulators on stage at a Shanghai conference in October.\n\nRead on for an analysis of the relationship between CCP and Alibaba and whether BABA is a buy, hold, or sell after this news.\n\n# What exactly happened?\n\nChina's State Administration for Market Regulation released a [very brief statement](http://www.samr.gov.cn/xw/zj/202012/t20201224_324638.html) declaring that it has begun an antitrust investigation of Alibaba over suspected monopolistic conduct including the \"picking one from two\", or \"\u4e8c\u9009\u4e00\" policy. This policy forces online merchants to sell exclusively on one platform and is actually widespread in China's ecommerce market.\n\nAlibaba responded publicly with an equally brief and terse statement.\n\n&gt;\"Today, Alibaba Group has received notification from the State Administration for Market Regulation that an investigation has been initiated into the Company pursuant to the Anti-Monopoly Law. Alibaba will actively cooperate with the regulators on the investigation\".\n\n# Analysis\n\nThere are three scenarios that can play out, ranging from mild, moderate, to severe. The following is a high level summary of each with a conclusion on what I believe is the most plausible outcome.\n\n## Mild\n\nThe CCP is simply seeking to teach Jack Ma a lesson in humility. The antitrust investigation results in minor changes to the regulatory oversight of Alibaba and perhaps even a small fine. Jack Ma falls back in line and business as usual ensues.\n\nThis outcome implies buying BABA on this dip.\n\n## Moderate\n\nTo preserve it's own interests and validity, the CCP is seeking to make a strong example out of Jack Ma and his companies. This is just the start of a long string of bad news between the CCP and Alibaba to inflict maximum pain on Jack Ma. A potential outcome for Alibaba could be heavy fines and heavy regulatory oversight that effectively sacrifices Alibaba in favor of more obedient domestic firms.\n\nThis outcome implies selling BABA and trimming exposure to other Chinese companies until new information emerges suggesting that relations are improving.\n\n## Severe\n\nThe CCP pulls the plug on the Variable Interest Entity (VIE) structure that allows Alibaba and other Chinese companies to list in the US. In a VIE, the Chinese company sets up intermediate companies registered outside of China, thus outside of the CCP's jurisdiction. These companies own X% of the Chinese company and has a contractual obligation to X% of the company's profits but not the company nor its assets. These offshore intermediate companies then list on US exchanges and effectively give US investors ownership of the company (but not really, just the company's profits). For Alibaba, its intermediate offshore company is domiciled in the Cayman Islands.\n\nVIEs are a legal grey area under Chinese law. In 2015, the CCP drafted legislation banning them but didn't follow through. In 2019, they approved legislation with an updated definition of what is considered foreign investment that conveniently doesn't mention VIEs. This was interpreted as an implicit approval. Why wouldn't China approve of VIEs given that they are a significant source of foreign direct investment in Chinese companies? However, not mentioning VIEs also keeps the CCP's options open to pull the plug whenever.\n\nAs it pertains to the current spat between Alibaba and the CCP, a possible outcome is the CCP banning VIEs and effectively ending foreign ownership of domestic companies. All Chinese companies listed in the US would have to be delisted.\n\n## What's the most plausible outcome?\n\nTo the market, given everything that is known, the most plausible outcome is the Moderate case. This is as much because of the information at hand as well as the lack of information. What we know so far is that relations between Jack Ma and the CCP have deterioriated. What we don't know is how severe the deterioration is and how much pain does the CCP want to indirectly (and perhaps directly) inflict on Jack Ma through his corporate empire. So far, there is no indication that the CCP is getting off the case of Jack Ma and this presents significant risks for institutional investors. To make matters worse, the CCP acts on the behest of a single person, Xi Jinping, and a single person's opinions and actions are much more volatile than a commitee's. This only adds to the uncertainty of the present situation. What do institutional investors do in the face of uncertainty? They sell for safer bets.\n\nA common argument against the Moderate case is that China is unwilling to hurt its geopolitical crown jewel. Alibaba is a key piece in China's strategy to satiate its hefty appetite for global soft power and the CCP hurting Alibaba beyond any surface wounds only hurts itself. The fall of BABA collapses the credibility of Chinese companies internationally and reduces foreign direct investment in China. On the surface, this argument holds weight but there are several holes. First and foremost, as much as the CCP desires to project global soft power, its number one priority is maintaining domestic power and legitimacy. There is little information on how much of a threat Xi perceives Jack Ma to be and again, this lack of clarity by itself gives weight to the Moderate case as far as market sentiment is concerned. Secondly, Alibaba is not the only Chinese multinational company that can continue to increase China's soft power projection. Tencent is a peer to Alibaba in terms of market capitalization and international influence and don't forget there are many other smaller companies waiting in the wings. As such, it's unlikely that market sentiment will veer towards the Mild case over the Moderate case.\n\nFinally, the market doesn't believe in the Severe case. VIEs have been significantly beneficial to the CCP in terms of foreign direct investments and soft power projection. Banning VIEs will destroy the CCP's credibility and hurt international investments in China for years to come.\n\n# The BABA action plan\n\nBABA is a sell in the short term until the uncertainty begins to clear. Institutional investors will be trimming their positions and selling as soon as they can. Although there will be a segment of retail investors trying to catch a falling knife, their buying volume will be dwarfed by the rest of the market's selling. In addition, BABA's fall coincides with the year-end tax-loss harvesting period where investors sell underperforming assets to reduce the next year's tax burden which is even more impetus for selling. In terms of price action, BABA will probably consolidate after the massive drop overnight. There will be a short term relief bounce during this consolidation so selling the top of this bounce is ideal. After consolidation, if the situation doesn't change, it'll form a descending price channel to a prior support level (e.g. $200).\n\nIn the long term, I believe that BABA will do well and long positions should be established the moment clarity starts to form and BABA has consolidated at a lower support. I personally believe that the CCP isn't interested in significantly hurting Alibaba and is really targeting Jack Ma. Given that Jack Ma has given up the reigns of the company, the CCP has little to gain from inflicting more than surface wounds on Alibaba. As always, personal beliefs should be separated from overall market sentiment.\n\nI share my thoughts in this blog: [FinanceTLDR - Alibaba is being investigated by the CCP.

Please note, the savings from being tax-free in a TFSA far outweigh the benefits of no withholding on US securities in an RRSP, so if you want to hold US ETFs, by all means do so, but TFSA is the better vehicle if you still have room.\n\n\n\n\n**Growth - technology dependent**\n\n\n\nZNQ [alternatives: XQQ (hedged), HXQ (swap), QQC-F (hedged), TEC]\n\n- 0.35 management fee, holds NASDAQ 100, 55% in the top ten, 44% are technology\n\n- 42% YTD (0.3% yield), 20% average return over 5 years\n\n- Volatility is high (1.30) , p/e is high (35), p/cash is high (21) - typical for technology sector\n\n\n\n**S&amp;P 500 - the metric by which all others are measured -**\n\n\n\nVFV [alternatives: ZSP, XUS, HXS (swap), and hedged versions]\n\n- 0.08 management fee, 92k ave. volume, holds S&amp;P 500 (25% technology), hold US listed ETFs\n\n- 13.54% YTD (1.37% yield), 13% average return over 5 years\n\n- middle of the road for most measures\n\n\n\n**Diversified Portfolios**\n\n\n\nXUU [alternatives: VUN and hedged versions]\n\n- 0.07 management fee, holds US listed ETFs that have 3500+ stocks (24% technology)\n\n- 14.7% YTD (1.34% yield), 12% average return over 5 years\n\n\n\nXUS + XMC + XSMC or ZSP + ZMID + ZSML\n\n- create your own all-in ETF with three ETFs focused on S&amp;P 500, Mid caps and Small caps\n\n- together hold 1500 stocks but lets you balance the ratios\n\n\n\n**More Focused**\n\n\n\nZUQ - MSCI USA High Quality Index\n\n- 0.30 management fee, 7k ave volume, holds 148 stocks (34% technology, 40% in top ten), no utilities, no real estate\n\n- 17.27% YTD (1.03% yield), 15% average return over 5 years\n\n- looks like a select grouping of mostly the S&amp;P 500: AAPL, MSFT, V, JNJ, MA, PG, UNH \n\n\n\nXSUS - ESG Aware MSCI USA Index\n\n- 0.28 management fee, 4k ave volume, holds 344 stocks (25% technology, 25% in top ten)\n\n- 16.8% YTD (0.95% yield), only one year old\n\n- FANG, JNJ, PG (consumer cyclicals, financials, healthcare, communications, industrials, technology)\n\n\n\n**Traditional Metrics**\n\n\n\nZLU - Low Volatility US Equity\n\n- 0.30 management fee, 11k ave volume, holds 101 stocks, 23% consumer defensive, 22% utilities, 0% technology and energy, 14% in top ten\n\n- 1.31% YTD (1.70% yield), 9.54% average return over 5 years\n\n- p/e 22 (average), p/cost 11.53 (below average), low volatility (0.59 beta)\n\n\n\nZDY - US Dividend (most hurt by withholding tax)\n\n- 0.30 management fee, 6k ave volume, holds 162 stocks, 19% financials, 15% utilities, 13% consumer defensive, 13% healthcare, 11% technology, 0% real estate, 17% in top ten\n\n- (-6.10)% YTD (4.24% yield), 8.50% average return over 5 years\n\n- p/e 17 (below average), p/cost 9.25 (well below average), average volatility (0.95)\n\n\n\n**The New**\n\n- WOMN - Women in Leadership Fund Series: 13% ave return over 2 years\n\n- HBGD - Big Data &amp; Hardware Index - Blockchain, FinTech, Semiconductors, Data: 83% YTD but also only one year old\n\n- ZHU - Equal Weight US Health Care Index: 19.62% YTD (0.15 yield), holds 70 stocks, but is still very new",

        "selftext": "Hello Everyone, \n\nThis is my first post here, and I'm going to be explaining some DD on Neo Lithium Corp. You can read for yourself some of the information I have [here](https://www.neolithium.ca/index.php). **All of the $ values in this post will be in CAD - Canadian Dollars**\n\n**Fundamentals:** \n\nNLC is a lithium/lithium carbonate mining company headquartered in Toronto, and operating in Argentina. They are traded on the TSX, under the ticker symbol **NLC.V.** They are planning to operate in the Lithium Triangle, a region in Argentina/Chile/Bolivia **LOADED** with Lithium. Approximately 27% of the worlds Lithium supply is mined out from this region, and 12% of which is located in Argentina, where Neo Lithium Corp is operating. The area in which they operate is 100% owned by Neo Lithium Corp, which lowers external risks from competitors operating in the area. More info on the competitors will be included below in the risks section.\n\nNow, into the good stuff. Currently, NLC is priced at $1.56 / share (@close December 27th) with a market capitalization of \\~$187M. Yes, I know, the market cap is quite small compared to other big industrial companies, however this company is fresh and is showing great upside potential. Recently, they secured an \\~$8.6M deal with CATL, a massive Chinese lithium battery manufacturer, where 10.2M shares were sold to CATL. This is good news because it means that this company is getting noticed and people are buying in. NLC has a strong net cash position, approximately $35M, with little to no debt. The no-debt thing was mentioned in their investor presentation, but take it with a grain of salt. I believe they have little debt, but it would be foolish to assume that they are completely debt-free, however, they are in a great position cash-wise. Approximately 9% of outstanding shares are owned by company insiders, 40% belonging to institutional ownership, and the remaining 51% being publicly owned. The volume on average is \\~290k which is quite low, but is steadily increasing as the days go by. I expect to see a massive volume increase by the spring.\n\nSpeaking of the spring, the last peace to this puzzle is **to obtain the construction permit.** Once this permit is granted, the company will be fully operational and start generating revenue. As this happens, news will come out and with that, attract investors to this company. There is no definitive date where this permit will be granted, however I expect it to happen before Q3 of 2021. When this permit is granted, and revenue starts being generated, I expect the stock to rise by AT LEAST $3 by Q4 2021. The best thing about this is that the price currently is dirt cheap. Yes, I know, stocks that are priced this low are quite volatile and risky, however, it is up to you and your personal risk tolerance to decide if this play is right for you. I've included a risk section to detail every risk that could be potentially threatening to this company. Continuing on, you will be able to absolutely load up with shares on this company and by the time summer of 2021 comes around, you should be able to realize a large gain. Please note that this play will take anywhere from a few months to a year to actually make you some money, however if they are successful in operations then holding longer will prove more profitable.\n\n**MY POSITION (CURRENTLY) : 122 shares @ $1.50 / share.** I would like to say that while I would love to buy more shares, I'm a semi-broke college student with not a lot of money to invest, so I'm doing the best I can. I do plan on buying more shares with any money received over the holidays. Please refrain from making fun of my positions, lol. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TA:** \n\nRight off the bat I'm going to admit I'm no saint at Technical Analysis. I have watched quite a bit of videos, and gained a minimal amount of knowledge in TA. However, the rule of thumb stands, which is **to conduct your own TA**. This is simply DD.  I'm going to include my share of TA so that you guys can get an idea of how the stock is performing, however it's definitely best if anyone interested conducts further TA.\n\n[This](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=NLC.V) link is the link to the [stockcharts.com](https://stockcharts.com) graph of NLC. It includes the RSI, MA (50/200), and the MACD chart. Starting with the RSI, this stock fluctuates in between 50 and 70, and ATM is at 61.15. This is a decent rating as it indicates the security is neither underbought/overbought. It fluctuates periodically over 70, only to drop immediately after. It typically drops a few cents when it peaks above 70, but typically recovers once it hits \\~50.\n\nMoving on to the candlestick chart w/ moving averages. As seen in many other securities, the 50 day Moving Average acts as a support line, and you can see for yourself how it bounces after it comes close/touches the support line. Both moving averages are showing bullish symbols, so that is always good. \n\nLooking at the MACD indicator, as I'm writing this the EMA's are bottoming out after a bearish 2 weeks. I expect to see a nice, bullish 1-2 weeks coming. The indicator shows lots of people selling, but the number of which dropping each week, which to me is bullish. The candlesticks are currently showing a bullish uptrend above the support line but looking at how the stock has performed in the last 6 months I think it will continue to bounce, which is inline with what the MACD indicator is showing. \n\n**TA TL;DR:** Technical Analysis of this security is showing a bullish trend in the coming weeks.\n\n**Risks:** \n\n**Risk #1: Construction Permit Not Granted.**\n\nThe first main risk with this play is the construction permit getting blocked. This would be absolutely detrimental to the company as the future of NLC is entirely dependent on this permit being granted. There are 2 reasons that I believe would be the cause of the permit being denied\n\n* **COVID-19**\n   * Obviously, COVID-19 is a serious risk to tons of businesses this year. If COVID-19 continues it's rampage on the world we might see the local government in Argentina cancelling any concurrent operations. This could mean a delay in getting the construction permit, and if granted, a pause in the construction process. We also have to take into account that COVID-19 procedures in Toronto may cause delays in decision making/administrative related-decisions. Ultimately, most of the risk from COVID-19 is focused in Argentina.\n* **Argentinian government changes their mind.**\n   * I really do not see this happening, but I'm just including it juuuuust in case. Other companies already operate in this area and have been for quite a while, so the odds of this happening are quite slim. If it does happen, its not good news for NLC.\n\n**Risk #2 - Competition**\n\nThis is a risk that occurs in any industry. Competition is inevitable, and some may see it as a bad thing but I see an increase in competition as a sign of money to be made. Most of the worlds lithium is produced by \"the big three\": **Albermarle Corp, FMC Corp, and SQM (**Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile)\n\n* **Albermarle Corp** mines lithium in CHILE\n* **FMC Corp** mines lithium in ARGENTINA, however the lithium division of the company is a separate entity \n* **SQM** mines lithium in CHILE\n\nSince NLC is going to be operating in Argentina, the main competitor is FMC Corp. FMC Corp is a big company, however they operate in an area hundreds of miles away from where NLC is going to be mining. Also mentioned above, NLC owns 100% of the massive area where they operate, so it's almost safe to say that FMC Corp will not be a huge risk in terms of generating profit\n\n**Risk #3 - Switch from Lithium batteries to some other variant**\n\nThis risk is close to impossible from happening, however there's a sliver of a chance that some big, blockbuster switch from lithium batteries to some other compound occurs, where most lithium mining companies would be heavily impacted. I highly, highly doubt this is going to happen in the next 2-3 years, so its a very small risk.\n\nWell, this is the end of my DD. Please feel free to comment your thoughts, ask questions, or call something out I may have missed/overlooked. I'm no JPM analyst, just a 20 year old trying to make some money.",

        "selftext": "It was Monday morning on the 28th of December. Ryan had just woken up in his bed when he realized he had the taste of raw fish in his mouth. He tried to figure out where the fuck in his apartment there was raw fish and that\u2019s when he heard a snore. He looked to his left when he to his surprise saw a woman. \u201cOh dear, **what have I done!?**\u201d Exclaimed Ryan loudly in disbelief.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The day before:**\n\nThe three musketeers Ryan, Elon and Jack dumbfuck Ma had all planned to go to the new bar WSB to try and get laid before the new year. Jack had unfortunately been convicted for stealing Winnie the Pooh plushies and burning them on his roof. Needless to say, it was only Ryan and Elon that showed up. \u201cElon, it\u2019s time.\u201d Ryan opened the doors and instantly try were blinded by extreme RGB lighting. The so called bar looked more like a casino the more the two gentlemen looked around. And that was when they saw her. On the grandest of poles right in the center of roulette hall was the finest stripper Ryan and Elon had ever seen. The boys looked at each other and simultaneously started rushing towards the golden pole.\n\nWhen Ryan had made it to the pole, the woman he had gazed at had started dressing and seemed ready to walk out. \u201cMiss?\u201d Ryan asked, who had made it first to her since Elon had stopped on the way to talk to some nerd about how he was planning on selling the moon. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d she asked, followed by a smile that triggered a huge blush on Ryan\u2019s cheeks. It was at this moment that he knew what he had to do, he had to fuck her. \u201c My name is Ryan Cohen and I would be honored if I could bed you tonight miss?\u201d. \u201cNames Palantir. My shift just ended I have a room upstairs follow me\u201d She took his hand and started leading him towards the edge of the hall. Thoughts were rushing through Ryan\u2019s head like a rocket ship headed for the moon. He couldn\u2019t understand how he had pulled this off. On the outside, she looked like the finest bitch he had ever seen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Fast forward to the morning after:**\n\nRyan woke up with his heart beating aggressively and sweat dripping like something terrible had just happened. He instantly ripped his iPhone 20X from his golden nightstand and pressed the familiar Robin Hood app. Fuck, fuck! he mumbled until the numbers loaded: GME shares were up 15% in pre-market. A sigh of relief went out, he sat there alone in his bed wondering what an absolute retard you would have to be to buy fuckin Palantir calls just to get an own on Warren maddafuckin Buffet who can die literally any day for being a fat fucking boomer!!!\n\n**(TL:DR)**\n\n**Instead, you could have invested in fucking a REAL business that you can barely understand instead of throwing money on something you DONT EVEN KNOW EXISTS LET ALONE WHAT THE FUCK IT DOES!!!!!!!

        "selftext": "**Why did FuboTv and Lemonade crash yesterday. JP Morgan goes all-in on travel and Nikola spikes after their report. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/w73qSnv) leading the way, up .87%, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/6y9ZnHT) also gaining more than .7% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/qnJN88J) rising by more than 200 points to finish the day, with all 3 big indexes finishing broadly higher, with all of them also closing at all-time highs, after the relief [BILL](https://ibb.co/LRcCDdL) lifted many stocks, as this bill does include direct payments and unemployment benefits while also including over $300B that will be direct to the small businesses relief funding programs alongside other good [programs](https://ibb.co/jbhM2b2), like rent assistance, child care, vaccine distribution and others. But despite this great movement in the stock market, we did see the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Hn8QrkZ) rising by almost 1%, with most factor groups trading lower [yesterday](https://ibb.co/F7dWsYS), with only large-cap growth companies gaining, while the biggest losers were in the small and mid-caps, especially the growth companies.\n\n[Yesterday](https://ibb.co/Cwnvhrv) there was almost a 50/50 split in advancing to declining stocks, with 177 new highs on decent volume, as more companies have started to trade below the 50-day SMA, which is a good thing as the trend was worrying with over 84% of companies above that moving average just recently.\n\nWe also saw 9 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/Km2fdpd) gaining yesterday with communications, consumer discretionary and technology all gaining over 1% for the day while the 2 sectors that lost ground and lagged the market were Energy and Materials.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gr6GrMj) that confirms those charts, as we can see big gains made in the big tech names with Amazon, Facebook and Google all gaining more than 2% for the day with Netflix and Microsoft also posting a 1% gain. We can also see the biggest losers coming in the Software-Application and Biotech sectors, probably because of tons of profit taking after huge-runups this year, while funds want to show investors that they own the big names, not those very volatile high-flying stocks of 2020, maybe that is one of the reasons for this rotation.\n\nWe also saw the total people through TSA [checkpoints](https://ibb.co/ByxKmYy) in the Christmas weekend rise to over 2.4M people, the busiest since March, but that is still down about 50% since last year. This are better news for the Airlines especially after Trump also finally signed the stimulus bill which does include funds for the Airlines.\n\nWhile TrueCar also released some December [estimates](https://ibb.co/KL4K7X9) for auto sales, in which we can see a 4,7% increase year over year and a 32% increase over last month, as the industry is still continuing the rebound since the March lows. This is a good outlook for the industry so expect big OEM to start rising again after a pause in companies like Ford or GM since the end of November. Regarding this subject maybe Tesla can start selling even more cars, this after an Indian minister [reported](https://ibb.co/k2W2LML) Tesla will start operations in early 2021 in the country.\n\nAlongside great sales numbers in the auto industry, we also received the Dallas FED manufacturing [Survey](https://ibb.co/Ssdf7Kd), which came in better than expected with production, new orders and capacity utilization all having big increases since the last report.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/vdHr1wT) we get some numbers from the Redbook store sales and the SP Home Price Index, while we also await to see what the Republican [Senate](https://ibb.co/261v76w) will do after the House passed the $2000 stimulus proposal, as the leader of the Senate hasn\u2019t yet announced anything.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw some highly volatile names make moves with [Nikola](https://ibb.co/M8xVsvm) popping after a JP Morgan analyst predicted a less drama filled 2021, I can\u2019t imagine what he sees in the company, as they still don\u2019t have any new breakthrough technology or really anything to show, just promises after promises. While we also saw [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/vkkLy38) dropping more than 11% for the 2nd straight day before regaining some of the losses after-hours, this happened after it was called a best short idea at Hedgeye on top of last week short reports, and meanwhile, we also saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vVZnw9c) fall 14% after the lockup period expired after the IPO, adding more than 30M shares to the small public float available until now.\n\nWe also saw JP Morgan [acquiring](https://ibb.co/WVq4jGp) a credit card rewards business; thus, betting travel will come back in the next years. The company will acquire the technology platforms, travel agency, gift card and points businesses from cxLoyalty Group, which is a privately held company. This will be a hit to Expedia, as JP Morgan had been using the credit card rewards program from them, but now will return the use the cxLoyalty platform like they did until 2018, as cxLoyalty has over 3.000 clients and market partners like Citigroup, Capital One and Mastercard and serve more than 70M consumers.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as both the [EU STOCKS](https://ibb.co/zFkGLYs) and the [US FUTURES](https://ibb.co/R2L0kRV) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way, as growth companies are [outperforming](https://ibb.co/gMFNd50) the value plays in this final month of 2020. As we also saw yesterday Goldman\u2019s chief economist lifting the [outlook](https://ibb.co/rv12bH5) for the Q1 US Gross domestic product by 2% and a full year growth increase of .50% to see a Gross domestic product growth of 5.8% in 2021, which should be another bullish sign for the stock market.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "BABA is recovering fast because the anti-trust investigation/guidance is political theatre, not a legitimate threat.\n\nThe same narrative is in every post about this: \"Jack Ma pissed-off the CCP\".\n\nThat's not what happened. In fact, Ma's now maligned speech likely came after he had heard about the anti-trust legislation. So the speech didn't cause the regulations, the regulations caused the speech.\n\nChina would never destroy a company as large as BABA over an interpersonal grudge. And do it based on a speedy timeline because they need to give Jack Ma a \"fuck you\" sooner.\n\nAll of these actions - breaking-up the ANT ipo, investigating BABA - are part of a geopolitical strategy for China to expand their economic influence in the region and gain leverage against the US during the process of de-escalating the trade war once Biden takes office.\n\nMango strained the shit out of a lot of our alliances in the Pacific. Once it was clear that Biden would become president and the state dept would start doing shit again, the PRC had to lock-in its soft-power advantage in the pacific by finalizing what is now the largerst trade block in the world.\n\nAnd they actually do need to reign-in BABA, etc. somewhat. Because no country in their right mind would have agreed to the RCEP with the PRC propping-up a giant competitor. BABA will probably need to drop the \"choose 1 of 2\" thing but that'll be it if anything.\n\nSo they did consciously crack-down on some anti-competitive practices but thats only to grease the wheels of the trade deal so they only need the *appearance* of due diligence.\n\nFinally, Bidne taking office also means that China will need an alibi for putting pressure on the US to reign-in *its own* internet giants. They can claim they cracked some heads to pressure the US to do the same. \n\nI can probably cite some of this stuff but I'm lazy.\n\nTL;DR - BABA's price decrease was an over-reaction to political theatre. calls Feb and after.",

        "selftext": " So I've been seeing a lot of posts/comments on different subs lately from new investors who are scared and are thinking of selling their BABA shares first thing tomorrow. If you are uncomfortable holding this company given the recent news, and understandably so, then go ahead - this post is not for you. It's your money, do whatever you want. But I want to make this post for the new investors who are in between/scared because they have a big position in this stock and are not sure what to do.\n\nFull disclaimer: Alibaba is my second biggest position and constitutes almost 8% of my portfolio. I have been holding this stock for a very long time and my cost basis is somewhere in the low 100s. Even I will be buying into this dip tomorrow. Let's break down some of the reasons and different scenarios:\n\n1. CCP (Chinese Communist Party) has bad blood with Jack Ma, not Alibaba. Yes Jack Ma was the founder and he still owns massive portions of the company, including portions of subsidiaries of this company, but he is no longer the CEO. If the government took some action against Jack Ma, it would not fundamentally hurt Alibaba as a whole. Let's remember, Alibaba is one of China's tech darlings. The government and their people take pride in Alibaba being one of the biggest companies in the world. CCP cares very deeply about the global image of China. They would not do anything drastic to the company that would ruin it's image or ruin the image of it's largest technology company\n2. Alibaba is facing anti-trust probes due to forcing sellers to do a pick one strategy. Right now, if vendors chose to sell on Alibaba's marketplace, they cannot sell on JD or Pinduoduo. Yes, the CCP can overturn this, and this is most likely what will happen. However, is this enough to justify the 5-10% sell-off that is coming tomorrow? Absolutely not. In fact, Alibaba trades at a 20x PE while Amazon trades at a PE above 100x. The company is already undervalued as of right now IMO.\n3. Alibaba may be forced to pay a fine to CCP: This changes absolutely nothing fundamental about the company. Alibaba is sitting on millions in cash and they generate insane levels of cash flow every quarter. Even a large fine would not hurt this company\n4. Alibaba may have to hand over some shares and ownership to CCP: This changes nothing about the company. Let's remember, the CCP essentially controls all businesses in China anyways. In particular, the CCP has always worked closely with Alibaba and Tencent anyways.\n5. Stricter regulations on Alibaba and Ant Group. This will likely happen. However, the company has already said it is willing to work with the CCP and regulators to come to an agreement.\n6. Worst case scenario: Alibaba gets broken up. Bad for Jack Ma, bad for Alibaba but GREAT for investors. If each of the parts of Alibaba were released separately into the market, Alibaba would be worth way more than what it is today. (The conglomerate discount: It's a thing, search it up)\n\nIn short, this anti-trust probe is likely just a small hiccup if you are a long term investor. CCP is most likely doing this just to remind Jack Ma and others that they are still the boss and that talking against Xi is a very bad idea, even if you are one of the richest man in the world. That is all.",

        "selftext": "So I've been seeing a lot of posts/comments on different subs lately from new investors who are scared and are thinking of selling their BABA shares first thing tomorrow. If you are uncomfortable holding this company given the recent news, and understandably so, then go ahead - this post is not for you. It's your money, do whatever you want. But I want to make this post for the new investors who are in between/scared because they have a big position in this stock and are not sure what to do. \n\nFull disclaimer: Alibaba is my second biggest position and constitutes almost 8% of my portfolio. I have been holding this stock for a very long time and my cost basis is somewhere in the low 100s. Even I will be buying into this dip tomorrow. Let's break down some of the reasons and different scenarios:\n\n1. CCP (Chinese Communist Party) has bad blood with Jack Ma, not Alibaba. Yes Jack Ma was the founder and he still owns massive portions of the company, including portions of subsidiaries of this company, but he is no longer the CEO. If the government took some action against Jack Ma, it would not fundamentally hurt Alibaba as a whole. Let's remember, Alibaba is one of China's tech darlings. The government and their people take pride in Alibaba being one of the biggest companies in the world. CCP cares very deeply about the global image of China. They would not do anything drastic to the company that would ruin it's image or ruin the image of it's largest technology company \n2. Alibaba is facing anti-trust probes due to forcing sellers to do a pick one strategy. Right now, if vendors chose to sell on Alibaba's marketplace, they cannot sell on JD or Pinduoduo. Yes, the CCP can overturn this, and this is most likely what will happen. However, is this enough to justify the 5-10% sell-off that is coming tomorrow? Absolutely not. In fact, Alibaba trades at a 20x PE while Amazon trades at a PE above 100x. The company is already undervalued as of right now IMO. \n3. Alibaba may be forced to pay a fine to CCP: This changes absolutely nothing fundamental about the company. Alibaba is sitting on millions in cash and they generate insane levels of cash flow every quarter. Even a large fine would not hurt this company \n4. Alibaba may have to hand over some shares and ownership to CCP: This changes nothing about the company. Let's remember, the CCP essentially controls all businesses in China anyways. In particular, the CCP has always worked closely with Alibaba and Tencent anyways. \n5. Stricter regulations on Alibaba and Ant Group. This will likely happen. However, the company has already said it is willing to work with the CCP and regulators to come to an agreement.\n6. Worst case scenario: Alibaba gets broken up. Bad for Jack Ma, bad for Alibaba but GREAT for investors. If each of the parts of Alibaba were released separately into the market, Alibaba would be worth way more than what it is today. (The conglomerate discount: It's a thing, search it up) \n\nIn short, this anti-trust probe is likely just a small hiccup if you are a long term investor. CCP is most likely doing this just to remind Jack Ma and others that they are still the boss and that talking against Xi is a very bad idea, even if you are one of the richest man in the world. That is all.",

        "selftext": "What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is near the lows and almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!\n\nIf you guys find this list useful (it's my first time posting this here), I can make this a weekly/weekend thing. I like doing it on Sundays so I can prepare for the trading week ahead.\n\n# High IV Tickers List\n\n\\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays! Also, the \"next earnings date\" data will resume starting in January, 2021 (very soon).\n\nPlease note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit.

It could bounce/consolidate around 2.38 and head back down to the 2 support level and make another run. Thit would be an optional place to scale in additional funds with a SL at 1.90 the risk/reward is quite attractive.  \nThe reasons why I think it won't bounce off 2.38 is because of the tailwind it has from the stay at home stocks. As the numbers climb they're coming back into favour and this is the canadian version. Expect it to break through 2.38 on the first attempt and the falling wedge and fib retracement levels (2.38, 2.59, 2.75, 2.91, 3.13, 3.41) will become support if it pulls back at all.  \nAny retracement back to any of those levels confirms the pattern on the first bounce off and that can serve as a place to scale in a final time.  \nOf course it could rip pretty quick at the same time with no real bounces to load up but one of the above scenarios is very likely. I'm 75% confident on this one, but that confidence would increase to 85% if it bounces off $2 one more time to fill up the wedge. Buying back in at $2 and keeping the SL at 1.90 minimizes losses and allows to be fully loaded for a final run at the wedge resistance.\u00a0  \n\n\nAnother thing I like is the 13/30 MA (hourly)crossed over to the upside so we'll definitely head up in the short term.\n\nIs this a good stock to hold long term? Who the hell knows? Is it a good stock to grab while virus numbers skyrocket? Very possibly.\u00a0\n\nDisclaimer - I am long DOC (as of yesterday)\u00a0",

        "selftext": "[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-27/ant-turning-from-windfall-to-nightmare-for-its-global-investors](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-27/ant-turning-from-windfall-to-nightmare-for-its-global-investors)\n\n**Full text:** \n\n Two months ago, global investors were on the cusp of embracing a windfall from what would have been the world\u2019s largest initial public offering. Now, returns on the hundreds of millions of dollars invested with Ant Group Co. are in jeopardy.\n\nChina ordered Ant to reexamine its fintech businesses -- spanning from wealth management to consumer credit lending and insurance -- and return to its roots as a payments service.\n\nWhile the central bank\u2019s statement on Sunday was short on specifics, it presents a serious threat to the growth and most lucrative operations of billionaire Jack Ma\u2019s online finance empire. Regulators stopped short of asking directly for a breakup of the company, yet stressed it was important Ant \u201cunderstand the necessity of overhauling its business\u201d and told it to come up with a plan and timetable as soon as possible.\n\nAuthorities also berated Ant for sub-par corporate governance, disdain toward regulatory requirements, and engaging in regulatory arbitrage. The central bank said Ant used its dominance to exclude rivals, hurting the interests of its hundreds of millions of consumers.\n\nAnt said in response that it will set up a special team to comply with regulators\u2019 demands. It will maintain business operations for users, vowing not to increase prices for consumers and financial partners, while stepping up risk controls.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based firm needs to set up a separate financial holding company to comply with rules and ensure it has sufficient capital, regulators added.\n\nHere are some of the scenarios from investors and analysts on what the restructuring could look like:\n\n**Mild**\n\nOptimists say regulators are merely re-asserting their right to oversee the country\u2019s financial sector, sending a warning to the internet companies without intentions of drastic change.\n\nBeijing could be trying to make an example out of Ma\u2019s Ant, the largest among a raft of new but pervasive fintech platforms. Past crackdowns of this nature have dealt short-term blows to companies, leaving them mostly unscathed. Social media giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., for instance, became a prominent target of a campaign to combat gaming addiction among children in 2018. While its shares took a hit, they eventually recovered to all-time highs.\n\nAnt\u2019s affiliate, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., similarly regained the confidence of investors after short-run selloffs following accusations by authorities on everything from unfairly squeezing merchants to turning a blind eye to fakes on its e-commerce platform.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think regulators are thinking of breaking up Ant, as no fintech company in China has a monopoly status,\u201d said Zhang Kai, an analyst at market research firm Analysys Ltd. \u201cThe act is not just targeting Ant but also sending out a warning to other Chinese fintech companies.\u201d\n\nSome see it as an opportunity for Ant. With the industry as a whole facing tougher oversight, Ant has more resources to cope with the challenges as an industry leader, said Zhang.\n\n**Bad**\n\nA more troubling outcome would be if regulators moved to break up Ant Group. That would complicate the shareholder structure, and hurt the company\u2019s fastest-growing businesses.\n\nValued at about $315 billion before its initial public offering was halted, Ant corralled investments from the world\u2019s biggest funds. Among them: Warburg Pincus LLC, Carlyle Group Inc., Silver Lake Management LLC, Temasek Holdings Pte and GIC Pte.\n\nThe global investors backed the company when it was valued at about $150 billion in its last round of fundraising in 2018. A break-up would make the return on their investments uncertain, with the timeline for an IPO that was due in November now pushed into the distant future.\n\nThe government could ask Ant to spin off its more lucrative operations in wealth management, credit lending and insurance, offloading them into a financial holding company that will face tougher scrutiny.\n\n\u201cThe emerging reality is China\u2019s regulators are adopting similar regulation toward banks and fintech players,\u201d said Michael Norris, research and strategy manager at Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina.\n\nAnt\u2019s payments business alone leaves much less to the imagination. While the service handled $17 trillion of transactions in one year, online payments have largely been loss-making. The two biggest mobile payments operators, Ant and Tencent, have heavily subsidized the businesses, using them as a gateway to win over users. To make money, they leveraged the payments services to cross sell products including wealth management and credit lending.\n\n\u201cAnt\u2019s growth potential will be capped with the focus back onto its payments services,\u201d said Chen Shujin, a Hong Kong-based head of China financial research at Jefferies Financial Group Inc. \u201cOn the mainland, the online payments industry is saturated and Ant\u2019s market share pretty much reached its limit.\u201d\n\n**Nightmare**\n\nThe worst case scenario would be for Ant to forgo its money management, credit and insurance businesses, halting its operations in the units that service half a billion people.\n\nIts wealth management business which includes the Yu\u2019ebao platform that sells mutual funds and money market funds, accounted for 15% of revenue.\n\nCredit tech, which includes Ant\u2019s Huabei and Jiebei units, was the biggest revenue driver for the group, contributing 39% of the total in the first six months this year. It made loans to about 500 million people.\n\nThat outcome would be underpinned by the idea that China\u2019s leaders have grown frustrated with the swagger of tech billionaires and want to teach them a lesson by killing off their businesses -- even if it means short-term pain for the economy and markets.\n\nChina\u2019s private sector has maintained a delicate relationship with the Communist Party for decades, and has only recently been recognized as central to the nation\u2019s future. Many commentators have attributed the recent crackdown on fintech companies to remarks Ma made at a conference in October, when he decried attempts to rein in the burgeoning field as short-sighted and outmoded.\n\nBetween them, Alibaba, Ant and Tencent commanded a combined market capitalization of nearly $2 trillion in November, surpassing state-owned behemoths such as Bank of China Ltd. as the country\u2019s most valuable companies.\n\nThe trio have invested billions of dollars in hundreds of up-and-coming mobile and internet companies, gaining kingmaker status in the world\u2019s largest smartphone and internet market by users.\n\n\u201cThe Communist Party is the end-all and the be-all in China. It controls everything,\u201d said Alex Capri, a Singapore-based research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation. \u201cThere is nothing that the Chinese Communist Party doesn\u2019t control and anything that does appear to be gyrating out of its orbit in any way is going to get pulled back very quickly,\u201d he said, adding \u201cwe can expect to see more of that.\u201d",

        "selftext": "**Are investors too bullish right now? What are the latest market movements in the auto industry? Pot get legalized in Mexico while FuboTv Plunges yet again. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning!\n\nFirst of all, I wanted to wish everyone a happy new year and hopefully things get better in 2021, and this also brings us at least the great returns that we had in 2020 in the stock market! \n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes finish the last full trading day of the year in the green, with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/0cvjjHN) leading the way, up .24% and closing at a new record high, while both the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/QFyd2f6) and the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/B67fT1g) were up just over .1% for the day.\n\nWe also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/b6Nqf9Z) barely drop yesterday closing just below 23, and with the Georgia runoff election just days away, we can see this going higher if the Democrats win both seats.\n\nWe saw almost 70% of the companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/g9CHK9Q) with most of them trading way below average volume as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/LzXDF2P) finished in the green, with Energy &amp; Materials closing the day up more than 1.3% while the biggest loser was the Communications sector, falling almost 0.7%, as we saw the small-cap stocks regain some momentum, [leading](https://ibb.co/yQCFtTZ) the way after they had 2 very bad days to start the week, while the only group that was losing ground yesterday was the large-cap growth sector.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/x5bN7Lk) from yesterday that pretty much sums up the other charts as we can see most big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and even Apple losing ground for the day, while the biggest gainers were companies like Tesla &amp; TSM alongside the industrial sector and companies like Disney and Mastercard.\n\nYesterday we also got the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/7QPXjPV), which for me personally came in pretty mixed, as I use this as a contrarian indicator. This last week we saw 2.5% more investors moving to the bull\u2019s camp, while we also saw almost a 5% increase in bears, as investors become more divided. I think the market is still a little to over bullish and I would avoid to add more money right now, but I wouldn\u2019t get of the stock market either. I think this is a good moment to stay put and wait for more developments overall, but there might still be some good opportunities around in the market and I wouldn\u2019t avoid getting into those.\n\nWe also got a lot of economic data yesterday, with a survey for business uncertainty for [December](https://ibb.co/87FMyQ6) showing increasing uncertainty for sales growth but a with a small decline in employment growth expectations. \n\nMeanwhile another number that confirms the investor sentiment survey is the Investor Confidence [Index](https://ibb.co/5952C9Z) which rose by more than 13 points in November, as investors increased the risk appetite for their portfolios.\n\nAlongside this we also saw the November pending home [SALES](https://ibb.co/F8WBXnh) decrease by more than 2.5% month over month, but are still up more than 16% since a year ago, with this monthly decrease mostly coming due to the shortage of inventory.\n\nThe Chicago [PMI](https://ibb.co/QF40My3) also came in way better than expected and 59.5 vs 57 expected and up from the 58.2 in the previous month with the biggest movement coming from the employment indicator as it rose to a one year high but is still in contraction territory since 2019.\n\nWe also saw the wholesale [inventories](https://ibb.co/fkWmNmc) decrease in November\u2019s advance read while the [retail](https://ibb.co/BBKNrb5) inventories saw an increase of .7%, pretty much in-line with expectations while the trade [balance](https://ibb.co/CKSR070) also saw a surprise decline in the deficit to more than of $84B, $4B worse than the last revision.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/D14JGZc) we get initial and continuing jobless claims numbers, alongside the money supply and the FED Balance sheet to end us off for the year as market close early today.\n\nIn some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/GkZgGM1), we saw Fubo sink more than 14% again yesterday after another investing firm announced they have shorted the stock, pointing to the insane valuations of more than $13.000/subscriber.\n\nWe also saw a [research](https://ibb.co/QMF5fnG) that indicated some changes in the market share of car companies with Hyundai/Kia having the biggest gains alongside GM, while Nissan saw the biggest decline in market share, mostly due to selling larger &amp; pricier SUVs with cars continuing to see a decline in sales, while the larger vehicles have started to rebound slightly, as all car makers are [bringing](https://ibb.co/kJGkXtz) more &amp; more SUVs and Trucks to the market.\n\nLockheed Martin also was [awarded](https://ibb.co/bWS5G6j) a new Navy contract worth more than $900M as this might help the company start to get back on track while Mexico will become the world largest legal cannabis market as the Mexican Senate passed a bill in November which is [expected](https://ibb.co/VW3Lqtn) to receive approval in the lower house by February. This is great news for companies in the sector like ACB, Canopy Growth and the future merged company Tilray &amp; Aphria.\n\nAlso, one of the biggest active ETFs with over $15B in assets, the [ARK](https://ibb.co/80WJFdW) Innovation ETF saw it\u2019s first daily withdrawal since November, as this hasn\u2019t experienced weekly outflows since early in 2020, this might have been driven by profit taking as this ETF has surged more than 140% this year and also just the ex-dividend date on the 29th, as people expect for the ETF to have a hard time in duplicating the results of this year, which saw it rise on the back of Tesla and Roku with both of them seeing massive increases, with Tesla having more then 7x-ing this year, as that is the biggest holding in the ETF, but who knows we have to wait and see as [TESLA](https://ibb.co/ZzGQgqX) may hit 500K deliveries this year.\n\nAnd one last piece of [news](https://ibb.co/9bQhB4B) is that Apple did a big purge in their App Store, removing almost 40K game apps as this was the deadline for the developers to submit a government issued license number that enabled users to make in-app purchases. I don\u2019t really think this will have a major impact for the revenues but we will soon find out.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mvv7tjX) seem to be pointing at a mixed open, with the Nasdaq and the SP500 pointing at a good open while the Dow is slightly down, and with no connection to this, in the UK, the [BREXIT](https://ibb.co/Rh1DYyG) chapter is finally about to close.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

        "selftext": "After speaking with a Chinese contact I found this info bare with the translation... \n\n\"Alibaba's empire will not collapse for a while. First of all, in the field of mobile payment and e-commerce, Alibaba is still the top company. If a company achieves the top position in a field, it will involve monopoly more or less.The news also showed that if it was true that \"for the better development of the industry\", some money would be fined and handed over to subsidize the society (although this money is exaggerating for most people, it is still relatively small for Ali). This time, the vulgar point is to catch and beat, just to educate.Maybe it's a good chance to speculate.\"\n\n\"The fact that our country is filing antitrust cases is just the beginning, and there will be more to come.Alibaba's U.S. stock market fell below $600 billion and its high fell by 30%. It can be said that it collapsed directly, which shows the power of the second investigation. Therefore, Jack Ma's Christmas Eve was not a safe day.\nThere is no Era of Jack Ma, only the era of Jack Ma.The early Internet companies, under the slogan of innovation, ran around and even hit some red lights, and the state has been lenient in its regulation.In order to innovate, as long as you don't do bad things and don't go out of line, the country is tolerant and encourages growth. That's why alibaba, JD.com, Baidu, Tencent and so on have developed.\nBut today, they have developed into such a large enterprise, and it is time to nurture society and foster technological innovation. Where is the foundation of the Internet economy?It must be built on the basis of serving the real economy, the livelihood of the people and the national development strategy.However, people are not satisfied with the snake and swallow the elephant, so they play the big data to kill two or choose the way to exploit the common people.\nNo matter how high you fly, you can't forget your roots.Leaving the country's support is nothing, talk about tycoons, talk about the rich ah.So regulatory action is to prevent these Internet companies from having too much of a monopoly.But not to abolish them altogether.So the People's Daily commented that \"the Internet industry has never been, and should not be, a lawless place for antitrust.\"One flower does not make a spring.An invisible hand has always maintained social justice, so the era of barbaric growth, cutting leeks, pulling wool for violence is over\" \n\n\n\"As is known to all, the main business of Ant Group is Alipay, which was originally established to change the payment method at that time and promote the completion of online transactions.With the determination of Alipay's position in the field of mobile payment, it successively launched the functions of Huabei and Borrowed Bai, and started the credit payment and loan business. With these two businesses, Alipay also conquered some territory in the mobile payment market and became the dominant player in the field of mobile payment.\nTo give Alipay a broader future, Ma decided to take Ant Group public in order to soak up a lot of money.It is not wrong for an enterprise to go public on a certain scale. However, under the guise of technology and finance, Ant Group chose to go public on the KEChuang Board, with an obvious intention to get rid of the supervision of China's financial system\nAfter reading all of this its relatively clear to me China is most afraid of losing control over its electronic transfers.  I also belive baba is hurting institutional banks. \n\nOnce the ant group in kechuang board listing is successful, there is no corresponding regulatory system, once the ant group management appeared a little problem, it may cause big shareholders' money and run, the risk of people regarded as leeks harvest, with the ants', will cause a huge holes in its capital, social unrest, finally need countries pay for him\" \n\n\n\nIt appears China was most concerned with losing the big bank consumer transactions... \n\n\nBe easy on me as I literally copied and pasted my conversation.",

        "selftext": " Is BlackBerry worth a look again?  \n \n\n$100+ at peak 12 years ago before iPhone took most of their market share  away causing it to crash below $10 for 8 years.   \n \n\nAnyway, they've recently partnered with Amazon in developing IVY.  \n \n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-surges-most-ever-amazon-161730792.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-surges-most-ever-amazon-161730792.html)  \n \n\n&gt;IVY is a cloud-connected software platform that aims to let automakers  read vehicle sensor data, improving the performance of cloud-connected  vehicles, according to a joint statement. BlackBerry, once known for a  popular array of phones, now focuses on its software and security  offerings.  \n   \n Shares climbed as much as 65% Tuesday before paring some gains to close  up 19%. BlackBerry trading volume was more than 70 times the daily  average.  \n   \n Sales of BlackBerry\u2019s QNX, its software platform for cars, could get a  boost from IVY, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst John Butler.  Amazon Web Services\u2019 strong reputation may also \u201cenhance the appeal\u201d of  IVY when it becomes available, Butler said. \t\n\n  \n [https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/01/blackberry-teams-up-with-amazon-web-services-to-ma/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/01/blackberry-teams-up-with-amazon-web-services-to-ma/)\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The BlackBerry IVY system is a scalable software platform with deep  roots on AWS cloud computing services. This vehicle data platform  provides consistent and secure methods for gathering vehicle sensor  information, packaging it into a normalized format, and preparing the  data blobs for real-time analysis running on the car's own processors as  well as deeper dives through AWS-based cloud computing services.  \n   \n BlackBerry's role in this partnership consists of using machine learning  tools to collect and normalize data from thousands of parts made by  dozens of different manufacturers. In many cases, there are no industry  standards available, and BlackBerry IVY will need to build its own  data-access models for every undocumented sensor. Amazon's high-powered  AWS systems will provide number-crunching muscle on the cloud-based side  of the data analysis, augmented by direct access to the vehicle's  embedded processing systems.  \n   \n This system provides a standardized tool kit for managing crucial data  points such as vehicle sensor data, driver habits, and engine  reliability readings. Automakers can then tap into the BlackBerry/AWS  system to build their own custom vehicle software frameworks without  reinventing the wheel for each new car model.  \n   \n \"This software platform promises to bring an era of invention to the  in-vehicle experience and help create new applications, services, and  opportunities without compromising safety, security, or customer  privacy,\" BlackBerry CEO John Chen said in a prepared statement.",

        "selftext": "**Are investors too bullish right now? What are the latest market movements in the auto industry? Pot get legalized in Mexico while FuboTv Plunges yet again. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning!\n\nFirst of all, I wanted to wish everyone a happy new year and hopefully things get better in 2021, and this also brings us at least the great returns that we had in 2020 in the stock market! \n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes finish the last full trading day of the year in the green, with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/0cvjjHN) leading the way, up .24% and closing at a new record high, while both the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/QFyd2f6) and the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/B67fT1g) were up just over .1% for the day.\n\nWe also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/b6Nqf9Z) barely drop yesterday closing just below 23, and with the Georgia runoff election just days away, we can see this going higher if the Democrats win both seats.\n\nWe saw almost 70% of the companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/g9CHK9Q) with most of them trading way below average volume as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/LzXDF2P) finished in the green, with Energy &amp; Materials closing the day up more than 1.3% while the biggest loser was the Communications sector, falling almost 0.7%, as we saw the small-cap stocks regain some momentum, [leading](https://ibb.co/yQCFtTZ) the way after they had 2 very bad days to start the week, while the only group that was losing ground yesterday was the large-cap growth sector.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/x5bN7Lk) from yesterday that pretty much sums up the other charts as we can see most big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and even Apple losing ground for the day, while the biggest gainers were companies like Tesla &amp; TSM alongside the industrial sector and companies like Disney and Mastercard.\n\nYesterday we also got the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/7QPXjPV), which for me personally came in pretty mixed, as I use this as a contrarian indicator. This last week we saw 2.5% more investors moving to the bull\u2019s camp, while we also saw almost a 5% increase in bears, as investors become more divided. I think the market is still a little to over bullish and I would avoid to add more money right now, but I wouldn\u2019t get of the stock market either. I think this is a good moment to stay put and wait for more developments overall, but there might still be some good opportunities around in the market and I wouldn\u2019t avoid getting into those.\n\nWe also got a lot of economic data yesterday, with a survey for business uncertainty for [December](https://ibb.co/87FMyQ6) showing increasing uncertainty for sales growth but a with a small decline in employment growth expectations. \n\nMeanwhile another number that confirms the investor sentiment survey is the Investor Confidence [Index](https://ibb.co/5952C9Z) which rose by more than 13 points in November, as investors increased the risk appetite for their portfolios.\n\nAlongside this we also saw the November pending home [SALES](https://ibb.co/F8WBXnh) decrease by more than 2.5% month over month, but are still up more than 16% since a year ago, with this monthly decrease mostly coming due to the shortage of inventory.\n\nThe Chicago [PMI](https://ibb.co/QF40My3) also came in way better than expected and 59.5 vs 57 expected and up from the 58.2 in the previous month with the biggest movement coming from the employment indicator as it rose to a one year high but is still in contraction territory since 2019.\n\nWe also saw the wholesale [inventories](https://ibb.co/fkWmNmc) decrease in November\u2019s advance read while the [retail](https://ibb.co/BBKNrb5) inventories saw an increase of .7%, pretty much in-line with expectations while the trade [balance](https://ibb.co/CKSR070) also saw a surprise decline in the deficit to more than of $84B, $4B worse than the last revision.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/D14JGZc) we get initial and continuing jobless claims numbers, alongside the money supply and the FED Balance sheet to end us off for the year as market close early today.\n\nIn some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/GkZgGM1), we saw Fubo sink more than 14% again yesterday after another investing firm announced they have shorted the stock, pointing to the insane valuations of more than $13.000/subscriber.\n\nWe also saw a [research](https://ibb.co/QMF5fnG) that indicated some changes in the market share of car companies with Hyundai/Kia having the biggest gains alongside GM, while Nissan saw the biggest decline in market share, mostly due to selling larger &amp; pricier SUVs with cars continuing to see a decline in sales, while the larger vehicles have started to rebound slightly, as all car makers are [bringing](https://ibb.co/kJGkXtz) more &amp; more SUVs and Trucks to the market.\n\nLockheed Martin also was [awarded](https://ibb.co/bWS5G6j) a new Navy contract worth more than $900M as this might help the company start to get back on track while Mexico will become the world largest legal cannabis market as the Mexican Senate passed a bill in November which is [expected](https://ibb.co/VW3Lqtn) to receive approval in the lower house by February. This is great news for companies in the sector like ACB, Canopy Growth and the future merged company Tilray &amp; Aphria.\n\nAlso, one of the biggest active ETFs with over $15B in assets, the [ARK](https://ibb.co/80WJFdW) Innovation ETF saw it\u2019s first daily withdrawal since November, as this hasn\u2019t experienced weekly outflows since early in 2020, this might have been driven by profit taking as this ETF has surged more than 140% this year and also just the ex-dividend date on the 29th, as people expect for the ETF to have a hard time in duplicating the results of this year, which saw it rise on the back of Tesla and Roku with both of them seeing massive increases, with Tesla having more then 7x-ing this year, as that is the biggest holding in the ETF, but who knows we have to wait and see as [TESLA](https://ibb.co/ZzGQgqX) may hit 500K deliveries this year.\n\nAnd one last piece of [news](https://ibb.co/9bQhB4B) is that Apple did a big purge in their App Store, removing almost 40K game apps as this was the deadline for the developers to submit a government issued license number that enabled users to make in-app purchases. I don\u2019t really think this will have a major impact for the revenues but we will soon find out.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mvv7tjX) seem to be pointing at a mixed open, with the Nasdaq and the SP500 pointing at a good open while the Dow is slightly down, and with no connection to this, in the UK, the [BREXIT](https://ibb.co/Rh1DYyG) chapter is finally about to close.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

        "selftext": "Saw the news, saw reddit blow up, and so... I just wanted to give my 2 cents for what they are worth for the newer long-term investors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**REMINDER: Do not panic sell.  Do not let your emotions influence your decision-making.**  Whether the stock price spikes or dips, take a breath, assess the situation and make a calculated decision.\n\n**TRY to tease out your biases.** For those who think China cares about flexing its power.  You are correct.  However, the perspective from which you are viewing the situation may be biased/primed by the drop in the stock price that you saw.  Try your best to get your mind out of that.  Don't think about the stock price, enjoy your holidays, and on Sunday or Monday morning, whenever you typically spend time to get updated on the news, do that first before looking at the stock price again and make a decision to buy, hold, or sell.\n\n**It's NOT WRONG to SELL.**  At the end of the day, we are all entitled to make our own hypotheses. That's part of the beauty of investing.  It's completely justified if you sold because you were convinced that BABA's global presence be significantly diminished coming out of this meeting. Or if you made the determination that you would unlikely consider BABA as an investment again.  I just encourage everyone to take a deep breath, take out the emotions, and consider as many neutral factors as possible.\n\n**My PERSONAL thoughts:**  The greatest flex of power is to establish and solidify its global presence and dominance.  Is China really willing to sever relationships with one of its bigger assets just to prove a point?  I personally don't think so.  I think this will be a slap on the wrist for Ma (i.e. \"don't speak poorly about us, okay buddy?\") to keep him in check.  Even if you wanted to sell because you are uneasy about the politics and cannot stand the volatility, you shouldn't have sold today.  Today was likely an over-reaction to the news.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor those curious, I am holding BABA at a loss, bought a little more today, and it is about 6% of my overall portfolio at an avg. of $259.",

        "selftext": "Pot Stocks on Robinhood\n\nSo I\u2019ve been trading pot stocks since September and did well with the election. I\u2019ve been looking at the pure US focused ETF MSOS that is only recently available on Robin Hood and now they are offering options contracts. Right now I have 34c 2/19/21 and 40c 6/18/21 also long the equity on margin. It seems like a really easy and simple win given these are mostly big MSOS with exposure to the newly legalized states NJ AZ IL MA NV as well as the hot medical states like PA FL. Also lot of upside for the long term. I think this ETF is gonna be a huge deal until they allow these individual stocks to trade on NYSE and robinhood gives the us pot stocks the green light on the platform. \n\nWonder if anyone else saw these contracts or knows about MSOS I\u2019m pretty familiar with the holdings and they are all killing it but I\u2019m still in the early piece of this trade might size it up if things continue to work out \n\nHappy hunting",

        "selftext": "**Why did FuboTv and Lemonade crash yesterday. JP Morgan goes all-in on travel and Nikola spikes after their report. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/w73qSnv) leading the way, up .87%, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/6y9ZnHT) also gaining more than .7% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/qnJN88J) rising by more than 200 points to finish the day, with all 3 big indexes finishing broadly higher, with all of them also closing at all-time highs, after the relief [BILL](https://ibb.co/LRcCDdL) lifted many stocks, as this bill does include direct payments and unemployment benefits while also including over $300B that will be direct to the small businesses relief funding programs alongside other good [programs](https://ibb.co/jbhM2b2), like rent assistance, child care, vaccine distribution and others. But despite this great movement in the stock market, we did see the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Hn8QrkZ) rising by almost 1%, with most factor groups trading lower [yesterday](https://ibb.co/F7dWsYS), with only large-cap growth companies gaining, while the biggest losers were in the small and mid-caps, especially the growth companies.\n\n[Yesterday](https://ibb.co/Cwnvhrv) there was almost a 50/50 split in advancing to declining stocks, with 177 new highs on decent volume, as more companies have started to trade below the 50-day SMA, which is a good thing as the trend was worrying with over 84% of companies above that moving average just recently.\n\nWe also saw 9 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/Km2fdpd) gaining yesterday with communications, consumer discretionary and technology all gaining over 1% for the day while the 2 sectors that lost ground and lagged the market were Energy and Materials.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gr6GrMj) that confirms those charts, as we can see big gains made in the big tech names with Amazon, Facebook and Google all gaining more than 2% for the day with Netflix and Microsoft also posting a 1% gain. We can also see the biggest losers coming in the Software-Application and Biotech sectors, probably because of tons of profit taking after huge-runups this year, while funds want to show investors that they own the big names, not those very volatile high-flying stocks of 2020, maybe that is one of the reasons for this rotation.\n\nWe also saw the total people through TSA [checkpoints](https://ibb.co/ByxKmYy) in the Christmas weekend rise to over 2.4M people, the busiest since March, but that is still down about 50% since last year. This are better news for the Airlines especially after Trump also finally signed the stimulus bill which does include funds for the Airlines.\n\nWhile TrueCar also released some December [estimates](https://ibb.co/KL4K7X9) for auto sales, in which we can see a 4,7% increase year over year and a 32% increase over last month, as the industry is still continuing the rebound since the March lows. This is a good outlook for the industry so expect big OEM to start rising again after a pause in companies like Ford or GM since the end of November. Regarding this subject maybe Tesla can start selling even more cars, this after an Indian minister [reported](https://ibb.co/k2W2LML) Tesla will start operations in early 2021 in the country.\n\nAlongside great sales numbers in the auto industry, we also received the Dallas FED manufacturing [Survey](https://ibb.co/Ssdf7Kd), which came in better than expected with production, new orders and capacity utilization all having big increases since the last report.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/vdHr1wT) we get some numbers from the Redbook store sales and the SP Home Price Index, while we also await to see what the Republican [Senate](https://ibb.co/261v76w) will do after the House passed the $2000 stimulus proposal, as the leader of the Senate hasn\u2019t yet announced anything.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw some highly volatile names make moves with [Nikola](https://ibb.co/M8xVsvm) popping after a JP Morgan analyst predicted a less drama filled 2021, I can\u2019t imagine what he sees in the company, as they still don\u2019t have any new breakthrough technology or really anything to show, just promises after promises. While we also saw [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/vkkLy38) dropping more than 11% for the 2nd straight day before regaining some of the losses after-hours, this happened after it was called a best short idea at Hedgeye on top of last week short reports, and meanwhile, we also saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vVZnw9c) fall 14% after the lockup period expired after the IPO, adding more than 30M shares to the small public float available until now.\n\nWe also saw JP Morgan [acquiring](https://ibb.co/WVq4jGp) a credit card rewards business; thus, betting travel will come back in the next years. The company will acquire the technology platforms, travel agency, gift card and points businesses from cxLoyalty Group, which is a privately held company. This will be a hit to Expedia, as JP Morgan had been using the credit card rewards program from them, but now will return the use the cxLoyalty platform like they did until 2018, as cxLoyalty has over 3.000 clients and market partners like Citigroup, Capital One and Mastercard and serve more than 70M consumers.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as both the [EU STOCKS](https://ibb.co/zFkGLYs) and the [US FUTURES](https://ibb.co/R2L0kRV) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way, as growth companies are [outperforming](https://ibb.co/gMFNd50) the value plays in this final month of 2020. As we also saw yesterday Goldman\u2019s chief economist lifting the [outlook](https://ibb.co/rv12bH5) for the Q1 US GDP by 2% and a full year growth increase of .50% to see a GDP growth of 5.8% in 2021, which should be another bullish sign for the stock market.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": " \n\nSE is has a 98B market cap.  \n\n$SE just got the license to operate as a fully digital bank in Singapore. This is great for a number of reasons (strengthening shoppeepay) and to generating money as a bank. The data insights from one of the biggest online shopping platform giants partnered with banking can bring massive potential to the company.\n\nAmazon only offers a creditcard, that is small compared to operating a fully digital bank. There are so many more products $SE can offer clients (mortgages, LoC, heloc). Singapore is also just the start.\n\nShopeePay is currently in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines. **It is only a matter of time before $SE is able to launch a digital bank in the other countries.** Looking at the careers pay there are hiring exec level positions for SeaMoney in the Philippines.\n\n[https://careers.shopee.sg/jobs/?region\\_id=10&amp;dept\\_id=&amp;level=202&amp;limit=20&amp;offset=0](https://careers.shopee.sg/jobs/?region_id=10&amp;dept_id=&amp;level=202&amp;limit=20&amp;offset=0)\n\nit also doesn't just stop there too. Where Shopee has a foothold in other countries such as Brazil. Sea is also working to building out the financial sector there too. Look at this posting for \"**Head of Payments - (S\u00e3o Paulo)**\"\n\n[https://careers.shopee.sg/jobs/?region\\_id=13&amp;dept\\_id=&amp;level=202&amp;limit=20&amp;offset=0](https://careers.shopee.sg/jobs/?region_id=13&amp;dept_id=&amp;level=202&amp;limit=20&amp;offset=0)\n\nSE is valued under 100B compare that to Amazon at over a trillion. There is huge potential for $SE, especially in these growing economies. If anyone has read Ray Dalio rise and fall of empires, it is about rise and fall of countries. Cathie Wood also treats these major FAANGs like cash cause they grow so slow, and she invests in the next set of FAANGs. Look how much she has been adding to her portfolio\n\nTLDR: Invest in $SE (located in tiger economies, strong upside potential, lots of integration between online shopping and finance, cathie wood buys tons of it). Anything under $200/share is a steal for what this company will be worth\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. Online holiday sales up 50% over last year beating forecasts by 20 to 30% or about 50 billion dollars.

        "selftext": "New York (CNN Business) Who says investing is hard?\n\nAll you needed to do for the past few years to enjoy solid gains in the stock market was buy an S&amp;P 500 or Nasdaq 100 index fund. That provided exposure to market darlings like the FAANG quintet of Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX) and Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) as well as Microsoft (MSFT).\nThe Big Tech stocks have boomed thanks to strong gains in revenue, market share and earnings over the past few years \u2014 which has raised antitrust concerns and created intense regulatory scrutiny.\n\nBut that dominance might be about to change.\n\nAfter years of growth stocks outperforming the market, some strategists and fund managers think it could be time for value sectors like banks, health care, energy, retail and others that have been laggards to emerge as new market leaders.\n\n\"We're coming out of a multi-year period of extraordinary outperformance from big cap techs. Value stocks have been so inexpensive,\" said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer with North Star Investment Management.\n\n\"A major rotation is going to take place. When valuations are so out of whack, there has to be a reversion,\" Kuby added.\n\nKuby likes smaller consumer companies like Acco Brands (ACCO), which owns Mead notebooks and Swingline staplers, as well as financial firms like the suburban Chicago-based bank Wintrust (WTFC).\n\nBanks, retailers and energy stocks all look attractive, said David Harden, president of Summit Global Investments. He thinks these three more value-oriented sectors will benefit from a stabilization in the economy in 2021 \u2014 especially if there are multiple Covid-19 vaccines available.\n\n\"There is no question value stocks will outperform. It's time to look for high quality and low volatility with larger companies,\" Harden told CNN Business. Some of Harden's top picks for 2021 include JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Walmart (WMT) and Exxon Mobil (XOM).\n\nStill, some experts say that value stocks and growth industries like tech and biotech can both do well for the foreseeable future. There is no particular reason why the FAANGs have to fall in order for other sectors to do well.\n\n\"Value versus growth is the perennial debate,\" said Dec Mullarkey, managing director of investment strategy at SLC Management. \"The recovery will be broader based because the market rally has been so tech-centric. But I don't see growth falling out of favor even if value stocks come back.\"\n\n**Growth at the right price**\n\nThat's why it might make more sense for investors to look for companies that have the characteristics of both value and growth \u2014 stocks that trade at reasonable prices but also have the potential to generate solid gains in earnings and revenue.\n\n\"We continue to think the rotation to value should be focused on creating a more balanced value/growth portfolio, and not abandoning growth/tech en masse,\" said Tom Essaye, editor of The Sevens Report investing newsletter, in a report Tuesday. \"Tech also can do well.\"\n\nEssaye added that there is \"simple logic\" for this prediction. \"Massive stimulus\" could be coming from the incoming Biden administration as well as a continuation of 0% rates from the Federal Reserve.\n\n\"The value versus growth question simplifies the market a bit. You want to find durable growth,\" said Doug Rao, a portfolio manager with Janus Henderson, in an interview with CNN Business.\nWith that in mind, Rao's firm owns stakes in industry leaders like travel company Booking (BKNG), Disney (DIS), LVMH (LVMHF) and Mastercard (MA).\n\n\"The transformation to a digital economy has been the biggest change for companies in every industry,\" Rao said. \"You want to look more for companies that are on the right side of that transformation.\"",

        "selftext": "One of the largest public pensions in the U.S. recently made some major adjustments in its stock investments.\n\nThe State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio cut back on investments in Apple (ticker: AAPL) and Tesla stock (TSLA) in the third quarter, and bought more shares of General Motors (GM) and Alibaba Group Holding (BABA). STRS Ohio, as the pension is known, disclosed the trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nSTRS Ohio, which managed assets of $80.9 billion as of June 30, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the stock trades.\n\nThe pension sold 864,478 post-split Apple shares in the third quarter to trim its position in the iPhone maker to 9.8 million shares as of Sept. 30. Apple stock split 4 for 1 at the end of August.\n\nApple shares have surged 80% year to date through Thursday\u2019s close, including a 14% gain so far in the fourth quarter. By comparison, the S&amp;P 500 index, a measure of the broader market, has risen 14.6% year to date, including a 10.1% so far in the fourth quarter.\n\nApple has been lifted by a recent report that demand for its 5G iPhones has been stronger than expected, and one analyst sees shares continuing their rally in 2021. There is speculation that Apple is actively developing a car, but we\u2019re skeptical of the company\u2019s foray into electric vehicles. Still, we\u2019re upbeat on the stock, and Apple is one of our 10 top stock picks for next year.\n\nSTRS Ohio sold 41,987 post-split Tesla shares to end September with 316,583 shares of the electric-vehicle maker. Tesla stock split 5 for 1 at the end of August.\n\nTesla\u2019s stock price has rocketed nearly 700% in 2020, including a 54.3% surge in the fourth quarter alone.\n\nTesla joined the S&amp;P 500 earlier this month, the most valuable company ever added to the index. Barry Ritholtz, chairman and chief investment officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management, recently told us, \u201cTesla\u2019s already shifted the paradigm. They\u2019ve already won.\u201d\n\nGM stock has added 13.6% in 2020, including a 40.5% surge since the end of September.\n\nGM last month scaled back an agreement with Nikola (NKLA), a maker of trucks powered by alternative fuels. We\u2019ve suggested that GM stock could continue to rise in 2021 on earnings growth as the economy recovers. GM could even resume paying a dividend next year.\n\nSTRS Ohio bought 750,442 additional GM shares in the third quarter, raising its investment to 2.8 million shares of the auto giant.\n\nThe pension bought 46,700 American depositary receipts of Alibaba in the quarter, ending September with 205,434 ADRs of the Chinese internet giant.\n\nAlibaba ADRs have gained 4.7% year to date, including a 24.5% drop so far in the fourth quarter.\n\nAlibaba and peers have been pressured by Chinese regulators over their business practices. Also, Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma himself has faced a backlash in China. Also weighing on the ADRs is a potential delisting in the U.S.\n\nSource: Barron's",
