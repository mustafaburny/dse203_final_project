        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, September 2, 2020**\n\nStocks open September with the bang, as tech continued rallying and benchmarks ended in all-time highs. This is an encouraging start to what is usually a rough month for traders. Both the S&amp;P 500 Index and the Nasdaq set new records on Tuesday, underpinned by the continuing rally in technology shares like Apple ($AAPL), Amazon ($AMZN)  and Microsoft ($MSFT) \u2014 which both soared after their stocks split on Monday help boost market sentiment.\n\nThe S&amp;P finished that day 0.97% up, the NASDAQ finished 1.8% up and the DOW finished 0.85% up. Great day for the markets overall!\n\nGoldman Sachs ($GS) said, \u201cwhile equities have never been as expensive since the Tech bubble, based on a 24-month \\[price/earnings basis\\], the equity risk premium is close to an all-time high, suggesting that equities have rarely been as attractive relative to bonds.\u201d Moreover, July\u2019s economic data in labor and manufacturing broadly overperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates suggesting the market could get even \u2018boomier\u2019, according to JP Morgan ($JPM).\n\nTraders are encouraged by the Fed\u2019s new policy, which promises economic support for as long as necessary, and declining numbers of Coronavirus cases in Southern states like Georgia and Florida, which recently became epicenters for the virus.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The ISM Manufacturing Index hitting its highest levels since August 2018.\n* Piper Sandler lifted price target for $ZEN Zendesk Inc from $87 to $123\n* Wedbush increased the price target for $CMG Chipotle Mexican Grill from $1,320 to $1,600\n* $WFC Wells Fargo raised their price target for $QCOM Qualcomm, Inc. from $90 to $120\n* $GS Goldman Sachs raised Price Target of $ZM Zoom Communications from $187 to $402. Shares are up an incredible 40% since earnings report yesterday after the bell on a BLOWOUT quarter.\n* Precious metals once again underperformed. Miners ($GDX) were down 1.42%, Gold ($IAU) was down 0.24% and Silver ($SLV) was down 0.42%\n\n**Notable Earnings for tomorrow, tomorrow, Sept 2:** China Petroleum ($SNP), Copart ($CPRT), Crowdstrike Holdings ($CRWD), GSX Techedu ($GSX), Huazhu Group ($HTHT), Korea Electric Power ($KEP), Mongodb Inc ($MDB), Rocket Companies Inc ($RKT)",
