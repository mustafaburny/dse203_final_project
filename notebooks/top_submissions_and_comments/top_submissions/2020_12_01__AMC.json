        "selftext": "Me and my dad started a trading account together.\n\nBackground on my dad: He has worked hard labor most of his life and has little to show for it. I have been sharing my leveraged internet money positions during this bull run and after securing heavy gains on my small investments, he is ready to give trading a go.\n\nHim and I have never traded a single stock before but he heard about the AirBNB IPO and wanted to get his feet wet, but he is not so good with technology so he sent me 450 to go all in on the IPO. I set up a Robinhood acct and got $450 BP.\n\nUnfortunately I don't know how IPO's work so none of my $68-70 orders got filled in the order book.\n\nI read an article friday morning about Disney releasing a new streaming service and with all the vaccine news, I figured their theme parks would see some of that hype roll over. I honestly had no idea what I was doing and didn't even know the announcement would have such an impact.\n\nSo I bought a couple of $180 calls on Disney expiring 12/18 when the stock was at $156. Within a few hours Disney was at 170+ my $450 turned into $950, I tried to sell, but robinhood has some sort of \"pattern day trade protection\" that kept me from selling the peak euphoria. Ended up selling 1/3 of my position and the account is sitting at $755 now.\n\nDisney ended the day at 175.72 and I made almost 70% gains on my entire portfolio in one day. But I wasn't happy, I want more.\n\nBefore I tell you about my degen decisions this weekend, just know that I have more than enough money saved to pay my dad back if I lose it all. Anyways, while the markets have been closed I have been piling my gains into OTM calls wherever I can find an opening. I have been scanning the call orderbooks for any calls that seem out of place. If I see a 0.05c call in the order book when the calls above and below are .25-.50c I have been submitting the orders. (I am aware that most of these will probably not get filled, but I think if they do, it's a way way trip to tendie town.)\n\nDoesn't it make sense that these calls will rise in price to correlate with their placement in the orderbook?\n\nANYWAYS, it's been done. I have OTM orders for puts for TSLA expiring Jan (crash after SP listing?,) calls for TSLA exp 12/18 (pump ahead of sp listing), calls for Darden exp Jan (earnings this week, mom and pop restaurants are closing left and right, and Yard House is delicious,) Pfizer calls exp Jan (Vax priced in, but who cares,) Calls on Trane exp Mar (Those vaccines need to stay cool, and I'm bearing on Chinese suppliers in US markets,) Shorts on AMC exp March (They need $750 million or they are about to Bankrupt,) Shorts on Peloton exp Jan (Gyms are about to reopen and Apple is going to steal the digital exercise market,) Calls on Blackrock and Mircostrategy exp 12/18 (Reasons) Calls for Delta exp FEB (I reckon airlines will pump a bit on Vaccine news, and Delta is world class IMO)\n\nI will keep you posted.",

I put up $10k collateral and receive $5,851 in credit, so I am really only putting up $4,149 on this bet (max loss).

If AMC goes back to $5 or $6 and the price per contract in the next 3-6 months and the price of the contract drops to like $0.50 or so, I'd probably exit and use the capital elsewhere.",

        "selftext": "**Should you get into stocks that benefit from the booming housing market? Is the workout at home trade done? Intel stops the bleeding while Apple loses lawsuit. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes closing the day in the red despite hitting intraday records, with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PCN8dwz) losing .38%, while both the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/cDjpNKP) and the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/RydQj61) Industrial finished the day down just over .2% as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/44wGzR0) rising by more than 4% yesterday as the $2000 stimulus was [BLOCKED](https://ibb.co/WFNSpCH) in the Senate by McConnell and the Georgia Senate runoff election is just a week away.\n\nAlmost 70% of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/LYM4JfL) were declining yesterday on below average volume as the number of companies that were trading above the 50-day moving average fell under 70% for the first time in quite a while.\n\nWe saw 9 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/GRJSmht) closing in the red yesterday, with only the Health Care and Consumer Discretionary sectors having small gains as almost all the types of companies were losing ground [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/7tKPyP4), especially the small-caps with the small-cap growth group losing more than 2%.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/KjVsn9X) from yesterday, it\u2019s mostly red, with only a couple of companies that were gaining big like the Chinese companies alongside Amazon and Intel.HEAT\n\nWe also got some economic data yesterday, as a review of the 2020 aviation and air travel [ESTIMATED](https://ibb.co/hRbYxpG) that traffic will be down 67% since last year, dropping to levels not seen since 1999, as air travel is still struggling to come back after the march bottoms. This has affected most of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/FBq4g37) worldwide but it seems that China airlines is doing somewhat better with the biggest percentage of the total number of flights completed compared to last year.\n\nThe SP Home price [INDICES](https://ibb.co/W67RBYh) also came in better than expected with the National Index increasing by 1.4% M/M, as this is a leading measure of real estate prices, gaining 8.4% nationwide over year ago. \n\nThese moves can also be seen in the latest Redfin report, as home sales [PRICES](https://ibb.co/CwR5H56) are up 14% year/year to over $320K with a great increase in pending [SALES](https://ibb.co/mJtrwV9) which are also up more than 34% since last year, as the number of active [LISTINGS](https://ibb.co/vVkfMMh) of home sales is down more than 30%, as buyers can\u2019t snatch them up quick enough with such low [YIELDS](https://ibb.co/7j1kY3s), as this has led for the [AVERAGE](https://ibb.co/gzQq8Wb) sale price to list value to rise to 99.4% which Is up 1.5% since 2019. This should be good news for companies like Toll Brothers, Lennar, HD and LOW.\n\nThis was also accompanied by the great numbers in the us chain store sales [NUMBERS](https://ibb.co/4PykPcH), which rose by almost 9% y/y with December sales expected to rise almost 5% since last year and a .2% increase since last month.\n\nWhile [TODAY](https://ibb.co/8N3YMPV) we start the day with MBA Mortgage applications, home sales and the Chicago PMI alongside advance reads on many other data points.\n\nIn some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/q1J6Snv), we saw Apple cool of a little yesterday, losing more than 1% for the day while they also lost a lawsuit aimed of stopping Corellium using virtual iPhone for security researching in the operating system, while [INTEL](https://ibb.co/3vvXFGT) finally got a breather and recovered some of the recent loses, after an activist hedge fund manager pushed for strategic changes in the company as Intel is losing market share and top designers, with the company also [ISSUING](https://ibb.co/WgtwTrY) a statement that lifted spirits around the stock.\n\nWe also saw the [FAA](https://ibb.co/6rJ6bHd) introduce new rules for drones, this may have a big impact on companies like UPS, Walmart and Amazon, as all of them have started trials for drone-delivery, as this could lead to better margins for the companies.\n\nThe Fed also [EXTENDED](https://ibb.co/cxV3HkC) the main street lending programs until Jan. 8 with the approval of Mnuchin as they try to process a bunch of applications this month, this means we can get even more money put into the economy and eventually the stock markets which is good news.\n\nAnd meanwhile, AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine was [APPROVED](https://ibb.co/y5QWbmh) for emergency use in the UK, this is another weapon to find this freaking illness, while JNJ will give us some results in early 2021 and Novavax just started their trial in the US.\n\nAlso, one last piece of data that I found recently shows that there was indeed a huge spike this [YEAR](https://ibb.co/JrKw01B) in the move to live streaming video and pre-recorded videos this year, as this has boosted companies like Peloton, Lululemon and others.\n\nBut this trend is seen slowing down in the next years with just a 4% [CAGR](https://ibb.co/HGhFJXS) in the equipment market, but that the exercise apps will see a big [GROWTH](https://ibb.co/02wm273) in the next years, so there are 2 different POV. I wouldn\u2019t stay invested in companies like PTON right now, I\u2019d rather take profits and move to other areas in the stock market. But don\u2019t rush into companies like AMC which have diluted their stock a lot or have lots of debt\u2026 this will not recover so fast, with [AMC](https://ibb.co/gDR8S81) filling to share up to 50M shares.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/nbV49Bs) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

        "selftext": "Today I noticed how strong PLUG was compared to the overall overall market. On top of that options pool activity showed a shit ton of calls bought and alot of puts sold today. All day just bullish call activity. News coming sometime next week. Maybe Monday. Tomorrow above $36. Notice the $36 puts sold expiring tommorow. Could test 52 week highs\n\n[https://imgur.com/Q6BU5fR](https://imgur.com/Q6BU5fR)\n\nAs majority of people believe that AMC is going bankrupt soon in january but I believe that they will be saved. Either a buyout or something else. News coming soon. Today they stock hit it close to its 52 week lows and looking at the daily chart all the way since march, I believe today was the bottom and should go back up. Also Smart money bought alot of call options for march 2021 and 2022 - $2.5  and $8 calls respectively. Someone believes this will go back up soon. Too big to fail but trade carefully.\n\n[https://imgur.com/2teY9OG](https://imgur.com/2teY9OG)\n\nTime to load up! Follow the Money",

Its been hovering at most around the upper $4 before dropping.\n\nAs a cinema chain, its not in a good situation. But the recent release of 800 million in shares cashed in, will result in keeping it afloat. By mid-end of 2021 the stock will be comfortably at $6-8 as it will for sure not be bankrupted. \n\nThere is 0% chance of movie theatres closing in general.

        "selftext": "What\u2019s up fellow autists. I\u2019ve been a lurker of this subreddit for a few years now and always enjoyed the content, the shitposts, the memes, and the rare DD\u2019s. But this week, I\u2019ve feeling for my fellow retards, especially those that gambled their 401k\u2019s and Holographic Charizard Pokemon cards on $PLTR. Orders on $ROPE seem to be up BIGLY over the past week, so I wanted to offer a bit of DD on an industry that you and your Netflix and Chill partner have become well acquainted with this year being stuck at home. At the very least, you owe it to your hand to hear me out about Cinemark ($CNK).\n\nTLDR: $CNK 15 Jan 22, 20 Strike Bought Calls / $CNK 19 Mar 21, 12.5 Strike Sold Puts\n\nSo quickly, just to get this out of the way: I am a curator of shit. I originally started this reddit account several years ago because I got tired of playing shitty Super Mario Maker levels and had finally decided to make my own. Then, a year later, I was on a Pokemon kick and was desperately looking to trade Pokemon on my 3ds. It\u2019s where I learned to sift through shitty trades and allowed my autism to truly flourish. You ever need a 5 IV hacked Japanese Ditto to get a perfectly spec\u2019d egg? Do you have any idea what the hell I\u2019m talking about? No, probably not. But I bring this up because when you\u2019re willing look into the details so much for a fucking Pokemon, it only makes sense to use that same treatment for a financial investment. And just like Super Mario Maker, I got tired of seeing shitty trades and wanted to do something myself. So I went and studied markets and options the past four years and will likely make a career out of finance now. \n\nBut you\u2019re here to learn about Cinemark. And here\u2019s what you already know: Movie theaters have been absolutely crippled by Covid. That\u2019s no secret. And just when vaccine news helps to get the likes of CNK and AMC back on their feet a bit, Warner Bros comes out yesterday and says they are moving all of their films to HBO Max. This announcement alone sent movie stocks tumbling as much as 20%.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/warner-bros-to-release-movies-on-hbo-max-threatening-theatrical-windows.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/warner-bros-to-release-movies-on-hbo-max-threatening-theatrical-windows.html)\n\nTo add insult to injury, AMC had already announced ANOTHER 200 million shares in a public stock offering THAT MORNING to raise money, with their CEO going on to threaten investors that AMC will go bankrupt without help. This probably isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve heard of a possible AMC bankruptcy either, especially if you\u2019re a subscriber to this very subreddit.\n\n[https://investorplace.com/2020/12/amc-stock-why-amc-entertainment-shares-sunk-16-today/](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/amc-stock-why-amc-entertainment-shares-sunk-16-today/)\n\nAnd here is where I\u2019m gonna start throwing some numbers at you. Because as awful as it is to threaten investors with the fear of bankruptcy, the reality is that AMC is in SERIOUS financial trouble. Pulled from TD Ameritrade, here\u2019s a few numbers for you from their balance sheet (as of their earnings in Q3 2020):\n\nAssets:\n\nCash/Cash Equivalents: $506 million\n\nTotal Current Assets: $609 Million\n\nProp./Plant/Equip, Net: $6,808 million\n\nTotal Assets: $10,876 million\n\nLiabilities:\n\nCurrent Accounts Payable/Accrued Expenses: $1,057 million\n\nTotal Current Liabilities: $1,588 million\n\nTotal Debt: $5,919 million\n\nTotal Liabilities: $13,246 million\n\nSo I know what you\u2019re thinking: TLDR, StOp NuMbErs GiVe PoSiTiOnS ReTaRd. And I\u2019ll get there, just like George R.R. Martin is getting to the end of the Game of Thrones series. But what is really important to see here is that for the CURRENT period that ends in one year, AMC has a deficit of $979 million ($1,588 million in current liabilities minus $609 million in current assets). And normally, when in such a situation, you generally have three solutions: go offer more stock; go sell some of your company; or, you take out loans with a creditor. AMC is doing the former with a stock offering. But why not go to a creditor and get a loan? Well, maybe it\u2019s because YTD for Q1, Q2, and Q3, AMC has already drawn down a shit town of debt out just to cover their ass. Creditors likely will not be willing to finance this sinking ship much longer and AMC are in legitimate trouble.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/amc-could-run-out-of-cash-by-then-end-of-2020-company-warns.html\n\nSo this brings me to Cinemark and their balance sheet. And it\u2019s here I\u2019ll give you a few more numbers from their Q3 2020 Balance Sheet:\n\nAssets:\n\nCash/Equivalents: $826 million\n\nTotal Current Assets: $984 million\n\nProp./Plant/Equip, Net: $2,832 million\n\nTotal Assets: $5,803 million\n\nLiabilities:\n\nAccounts Payable/Accrued Expenses: $599 million\n\nTotal Current Liabilities: $624 million\n\nTotal Debt: $2,519 million\n\nTotal Liabilities: $4,796 million\n\nSo I\u2019d like to immediately draw your attention to the current period for CNK. Due to their stronger cash position (which in fairness, has been due to financing this year as well), they have a net surplus of $360 million for the next 12 months. What\u2019s more, they can cover ALL of their current liabilities with their cash position alone for the next year. This is to say that if you believe that the Covid will be behind us within a year and that movie theaters will at least by open back to full capacity, Cinemark has the financial strength to survive another year without any sales.\n\nThe next thing I\u2019d like to bring to your attention is the SIZE of both companies. If you look at the Prop./Plant/Equipment for AMC and CNK, you\u2019ll see that\n\nAMC has $6,808 million in assets\n\nCNK has $2,832 million in assets\n\nAMC is the largest movie theater company in the world, and here, it shows. They are over twice the size of Cinemark in property alone, and their total assets are just over twice the value of Cinemark\u2019s as well. So AMC does have quite a bit of market share on the movie theater industry. However, with AMC\u2019s financial weakness and a looming threat of bankruptcy, here are some possible outcomes:\n\n1. AMC goes bankrupt. They will have to reorganize their corporate structure and will likely lose some of their theaters along the way. Competitors may have the option to buy some of these theaters and AMC loses some of their market share which could be beneficial for CNK.\n\n2. AMC looks to merge. This is true for the larger market as a whole, but with belabored businesses that are on the verge of bankruptcy, mergers and acquisitions look to be a huge market in the upcoming year. And while Cinemark doesn\u2019t have the financial strength, on paper, to take on the massive debts the AMC currently holds, there is something to consider here in the numbers. If AMC is twice the size of Cinemark, Cinemark\u2019s market share would increase by 3x on an outright acquisition of AMC (and that\u2019s assuming they took on their debts as they stand today). Cinemark would more than double their debt in doing so, but CNK has also shown that they can manage their book better. They may see the added market share as a warrantable risk to take on.\n\n3. AMC gets the funding it needs and survives in the short term. Cinemark isn\u2019t really affected by this outcome.\n\nNext, let\u2019s consider the technicals of Cinemark. Cinemark was trading just above $30 before the great stock market fall back in March. It was trading as low as $5.71 at it\u2019s lowest, and outside a one month period from the end of September to November 9th(vaccine news day), CNK was trading in a price channel that bottomed out around $10. With positive vaccine news in that will allow likely allow CNK to open its doors again in the next six months, it seems unlikely that CNK will break a fairly strong level of support moving forward.\n\nThe last part, admittedly, is a bit of my own opinion. But since the election and Pfizer/Moderna\u2019s vaccine news, there has been a large shift in money across the markets. Specifically, money in the NASDAQ (Covid-proof) tech sector moved outwards towards other sectors, including stocks that were rightfully battered due to Covid. Retail, energy, and entertainment all saw large boosts with Covid relief. You don\u2019t have to look much farther than stocks like Kohl\u2019s (KSS), Nordstrom (JWN), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), Airlines (any of them), or cruise lines, all while watching tech largely stagnate (except for beloved meme stocks like Tesla and AMD, of course). Many of these are still trading below their pre-covid highs, and it is where I personally believe large, institutional money is moving and holding large portions of money. Sure, Covid cases are spiking at the moment and there is an argument to be made for the NASDAQ taking up arms again. But the stock market is a forward looking instrument and is now looking ahead to a point in time when Covid has been dealt with.\n\nSo to bring this all full circle, here is my TLDR for why Cinemark is a stock you should seriously consider looking into:\n\n1. It has the financial strength to survive for at least another year, well past the point of covid vaccinations and a return to normalcy.\n\n2. With AMC on the ropes, CNK could stand to benefit from an increase in market share if AMC does file bankruptcy. They could even pick up existing AMC theaters for significantly cheaper if such a corporate AMC structure were to occur.\n\n3. While still trading below its pre-Covid highs (and for veritable reason), vaccine news and actual vaccinations only stand to help stocks in the entertainment sector (barring a failed vaccine, of course). And while Covid cases are certainly rising in the short term, because CNK has the financial backing to weather another year, it is a short term headwind that will likely be overtaken when vaccinations ramp up.\n\nPositions? TLDR? Give yourself a year on this one. Buy a leap and leave it for a while. If you hate getting cucked by Theta decay, maybe sell some 10 or 12.5 strike OTM puts. That way, if you end up getting put shares, it\u2019s of a stock you wanted long term anyway (and you got paid to get put into it). Premiums for such a volatile industry and very high right now and there is good money to be made in Theta and Vega.\n\nCNK 15 Jan 2022 20 Bought Call: 4.00 (as of this writing)\n\nCNK 19 March 2021 12.5 Sold Put: 2.40 (as of this writing). With a breakeven of 10.10, this puts you just above support if you do get put. If Cinemark is trading above $12.50 in 3 months time, this is a 19.2% ROI (or 6.4% a month), which is still a hell of a return (especially if you believe in the stock long term, like I do).\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, fiduciary, analyst, nor do I hold any position in a financial company.

        "selftext": "# Introduction:\n\nGood morning/evening everyone. AT&amp;T won over ABBV and PG in the latest poll (on r/dividends). There is a lot to unpack with this stock and it is definitely more controversial, especially in regards to it's debt. Let's take a look at everything it does, the financials, and a quick look at its investments/acquisitions. The dividend and possible growth with also be discussed. \n\n# AT&amp;T - American Telephone and Telegraph:\n\n**Sector: Communication Services** \n\nAT&amp;T is a diversified global leader in telecommunications, media and entertainment, and technology. It operates four segments: \n\n* AT&amp;T Communications: \n\n&gt;AT&amp;T Communications serves +100 million with TV, mobile and broadband services. In addition, it provides internet to more than 3 million business customers.\n\n* AT&amp;T International:\n\n&gt;AT&amp;T International provides TV and wireless services to consumers and businesses in over 11 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\n* AT&amp;T ad and analytics:\n\n&gt;Ad and analytics provides marketers with targeted, data-driven advertising focused around premium video content.\n\n* Warner Media\u2019s HBO &amp; Turner and Warner Bros divisions:\n\n&gt;Warner Media\u2019s HBO, Turner and Warner Bros. are leaders in creating content and operating the world\u2019s largest TV and film studio.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n&gt;\\- Acquisitions have added to AT&amp;T\u2019s economic moat,  increased revenues, increased ability to bundle services (synergies that enable cost cutting).   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- Billions of dollars in capital expenditures and company investments (over 170 billion the last 5 years).   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- The company merger with Time Warner will allow it to squeeze its way into the lucrative streaming market. Having one of the world\u2019s largest content creators combined with AT&amp;T\u2019s services could be powerful. (This will be discussed further below)\n\n**Risks:**\n\n&gt;\\- Lots of debt. This company is quite leveraged. The Time-Warner merger increases AT&amp;T\u2019s debt to the point the company balance sheet should be watched intensely.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- AT&amp;T is largely concentrated in the US right now.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- Intense competition from Verizon and other telecom giants. \n\n# Financial History:\n\nBefore diving into the financials AT&amp;Ts goals need to be discussed. Recently they appointed a new president for the company, their stated goals include bringing down their overall debt, increasing their earnings and cash flow through the HBO and Warner acquisitions, remaining committed to the dividend, and the sale of underperforming assets to streamline capital investments. \n\nThis first chart will break down their Revenue, Earnings, Debt, and Debt Ratio over the decade. The source of the information is the company 10K SEC filings. \n\n|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Short + Long Term Debt|Debt / EBITDA|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2011|$126,723|$32,443|$65,573|2|\n|2013|$128,752|$47,005|$75,293|1.5|\n|2015|$146,801|$45,551|$129,613|2.8|\n|2017|$160,546|$45,572|$165,665|3.6|\n|2019|$181,190|$56,172|$191,680|2.9|\n\nRevenue as increased 5% YoY, it is pretty solid, for a company this large that has been around for as long as it has double digit growth is definitely not expected. Earnings has increased \\~9% YoY over the decade, outpacing the revenue, this is nice since it is increasing their margins. \n\nDebt has definitely grown at a significant pace, this is largely based off their acquisitions over the recent years. Back in 2015 they acquired Direct TV (gross), and in 2018 Time Warner + HBO. In both 2015 and 2017 you can see the spike in the debt to EBITDA levels above the 3x we would normally like to see, however AT&amp;T has stated they are committed to reducing their debt levels, their stated objective is to bring debt/EDITDA below 2.5x. Already we can see at the end of 2019 that they have managed to bring the ratio down to 2.9, which is a good trend, something that, based on their quarterly earnings this year, they have been continuing. \n\nLet's take a closer look at the cash flow, and their debt payments.\n\n|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|Debt Payment / Influx|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2011|$34,743|$20,272|$14,833|\\+362 Million|\n|2013|$34,796|$21,228|$22,706|\\+9,138 Billion|\n|2015|$35,880|$20,015|$39,792|\\+23,927 Billion|\n|2017|$38,010|$21,550|$52,342|\\+35,882 Billion|\n|2018|$43,602|$21,251|$11,023|\\-11,328 Billion|\n|2019|$48,660|$19,635|$15,430|\\-13,603 Billion|\n\nNet cash flow is very strong and growing \\~4% average. Their CAPEX line has been steady, but note that it does not include the cost of any mergers, acquisitions or purchases.\n\nNow, the Free Cash Flow to Equity is looking really weird in 2015 and 2017, the reason there is such a spike in FCF/E is because those are the years AT&amp;T loaded up on new debt, note the spike in Long Term Debt in the previous chart, the influx of cash from those loans is simply being added to the FCF/E here.  If they are subtracted the ratio more in line with the $15 Billion they have averaged. \n\nLastly, the debt payments. After the acquisitions, we can see that in 2018 and 2019 they have been making substantial debt payments. Based on the recent quarterly earning they have continued to pay down the debt load.\n\nSo, thus far we have seen increasing revenues and earnings, strong free cash flow, and an increase in debt repayments. Good trends, yes the company is still leveraged, but not as leveraged as some other companies we have recently looked at (Looking at you IBM - they are currently approx 4x debt/EBITDA)\n\nAnyways, let's now take a look at the acquisitions before discussing the dividend. \n\n# Direct TV:\n\nAT&amp;T acquired DirectTV in 2015 for \\~$67 Billion dollars. Since then (and even before the acquisition), It has YoY decreasing profits as more and more people move away from traditional expensive cable in favor of streaming. Already they are looking to action off Direct TV, with optimistic guesses it'll likely sell for around $20B Billion. There is no doubt that this was an absolute failure and questionable decision, even in 2015, given the trends. This is one of the largest factors causing the former CEO Stephenson to be replaced. \n\nSelling Direct TV would allow AT&amp;T to continue off-loading legacy, and capital intensive segments to boost free cash flow to focus on growth of more profitable (and not declining) company segments. It does come with a stinging loss of over $40 Billion just from the sale alone. The new CEO, Stankey, seems more than ready to just offload Direct TV, use the cash to invest back into the company, and move on. \n\n# Time Warner (Warner Media) and HBO: \n\nThese acquisitions were incredibly expensive for AT&amp;T, however, unlike Direct TV, they are becoming significantly more profitable. The profits for Warner Media in Dec 2019 was \\~9.5Billion, these numbers are down for 2020, however much of the loss is attributed to the impacts COVID has had to the entertainment industry. Now, the introduction of HBO Max streaming was botched and delayed, this gave significant ground to Disney and Apple as they released their streaming services, however, HBO Max is reported to have \\~38 Million subscribers at this point in time, which is ahead of their previous timeframe predictions. Their stated goals are to have over 50 Million domestic subscribers by 2025, and increase the subscription revenue to over $5 Billion by that time. \n\nIn addition to this, Warner is planning to aggressively push its streaming service in 2021 by releasing every single one of its movies on HBO Max. This move is definitely putting AT&amp;T on the offensive and many are awaiting to see the response from Netflix and Disney will be. Warner does still have agreements with AMC, however over the decade theaters as a whole have been on the decline. This just highlights how significant the move into streaming by Disney and AT&amp;T have been. Yes AT&amp;T was late to the party, but they have their slice of the pie and Warner Media produces tons of movies and entertainment, it will likely continue to have a significant impact to the company's profitability as streaming becomes more and more favorable over theaters and traditional cable. \n\nThere is a lot more to the Time Warner and HBO piece that will not be touched on here, please do your own research to supplement these points. \n\n# Let's Take a Look at the Dividend and Price/Value, and Growth:\n\nThe AT&amp;T is a dividend Aristocrat, its dividend has been paid continuously since 1881 and increased for 36 consecutive years.\n\nNOTE: Current for December 2020 and very likely to change.\n\n|Stock Price|$29.54|\n|:-|:-|\n|P/E Ratio|19.44|\n|Current Annual Payout / Share|$2.08|\n|Yield|7.04% (Based on Price Dec 2020)|\n|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|\n|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|\n|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|2%|\n|Current Payout Ratio (Based on Earnings)|58.26%|\n\nThe payout ratio may seem lower here, however, using the Cash flow from the chart above, in 2019 their total cash flow from operations was $48 Billion, minus the CAPEX of \\~$20 Billion leaves around $28 Billion in free cash. According to their 2019 10K the amount paid out in dividend distributions was \\~$14.8 Billion. So just about half of the free cash, leaving the rest to be paid towards short/long term debt, or whatever other financing activities.  \n\nHowever, AT&amp;T under their new leadership has several ways to go about increasing their margins here. Firstly, they could pay down debt to decrease future debt payments, this is one route they have mentioned they are committed to. Another is they could cut their dividend payment. The new CEO and management have stated they are committed to the dividend, however, this is a route that could be taken to further increase the cash flow for the company which could be used for more aggressive debt payments, and reinvestment back into the company to further stimulate growth and increase the profitability of their Media segment. \n\nNote though, AT&amp;T has not been buying back shares at this time, in fact the number of outstanding shares has increased from 5,926 to 7,305. This does dilute the value of the stock, however, over the short term (especially if you are holding more long term), this isn't necessarily bad. You will see less price appreciation, but because they are paying out a dividend it will allow you to accumulate more shares through DRIP, so later on when the company can afford to buy back shares in addition to payout a dividend distribution you will see the benefits from the compounding effect of accumulating shares, and stock price appreciation. This ofcourse assumes that the company will move itself in a position to afford this. So the question you'd have to ask yourself here is whether or not you believe AT&amp;T can manage their debt, whether their telecommunication services will remain relevant, and whether their Media services can turn more a profit. \n\n# Closing Thoughts:\n\nThis stock is definitely more controversial but hopefully this post helped highlight some key points. With the new CEO in management it will be interesting to see how AT&amp;Ts current position changes. They have been trending towards completing their stated goals like bringing down debt, and investing into their media services. \n\nIf you're not sure if you like the company, add it to a watch list, watch its movements for awhile, check out the news from the company. Take your time to research, investing is not a race, more a journey. And, as always, please supplement this with your own research. \n\nA quick disclosure, I do own AT&amp;T stock, but that says nothing! Do your own research! There are more risks that need to be considered, read opposing views. Don't just read whatever will validate a preformed opinion.  \nThanks for reading, and have a good day/night!",

        "selftext": "**DocuSign crushes earnings and AMC may go bankrupt. Lemonade spiked yesterday over 20% while Pfizer confirmed delivery numbers, let\u2019s talk about this and everything new in the stock market**\n\nHey everyone! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the DOW leading the way up almost 0,3% with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/G9JLH78) close behind up 0,23% and finishing at a new record high while the broader market [SP500](https://ibb.co/7rMK8RY) finished barely down for the day. All 3 of them were trading a lot higher intraday before the most recent Pfizer [news](https://ibb.co/qCXxh0Q) popped up as they are only expected to ship half of the doses that were initially planned, but people spooked at this to much in my opinion. This thing was already known, when they published the candidate data in November, they also [announced](https://ibb.co/cDtdMCy) this number, but people runed away way to fast before going more into the data. Pfizer did not cut supply, they just explained why this happened in this latest headline. It is way better for companies to under-promise and over-deliver than the other way around.\n\nThe [VIX](https://ibb.co/HYrVJNH) also saw a spike around the Pfizer news and finished higher for the day while 59% of companies were advancing with almost 150 new highs and just 3 new lows on below average volume of 11,5 billion shares compared to 11,7 billion shares in the last 20 trading days. [CHART](https://ibb.co/6PVC7Lr)\n\nThe best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/2t3kk7m) yesterday were Energy and Real Estate while Utilities finished more than 1% down for the day with small and mid-cap growth companies [leading](https://ibb.co/sP2rMzd) the way while the large-caps where lagging the market as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/d2cJ7hZ) as all the FAANG stocks were down with Microsoft also joining them. While TESLA continued to be red hot and Alibaba has finally regained some momentum.\n\nHere is the most important [ECONOMIC DATA](https://ibb.co/w6b2bxv) that will be released today as we will get nonfarm payrolls and unemployment rates in the early morning alongside the trade deficit, with Factory orders numbers coming in a bit latter. \n\nThe [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/7GrND6j) are largely higher today not only in the US but also Europe is [gaining](https://ibb.co/mXsLDSb) momentum after Germany manufacturing [orders](https://ibb.co/9NVsjQw) rose for the sixth straight month in October and [Asia](https://ibb.co/7zhQnDt) as the global retail sector saw an [increase](https://ibb.co/k4dCN3f) of 30% in transactions with the whole Black Friday to Cyber Monday period doing very well this year.\n\nWhile yesterday we got numbers on the [NOVEMBER ISM](https://ibb.co/hcmvzgg) as it continued to a sixth straight month of expansion with employment being the biggest gainer in the index with even greater numbers coming in from the [PMI COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/GHcFV4g) with the fastest growth since 2015 as employment rose at the fastest pace in the history of the survey.\n\nAlso, the Jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/7txF4QQ) came in whey lower than expected at 712k more than 60k below estimated with continuing claims dropping for the first time in the last 9 months to under 6 million\n\nMeanwhile we also got some sales number for October in the [SEMI sector](https://ibb.co/VTy4BvP) yesterday, as sales had big increases Y/Y and M/M with all regions ramping up sales on a monthly basis. This is great news for companies like Nvidia, QCOM, AVGO and many more.\n\nMoving on to the auto sector the US light vehicle sales [forecast](https://ibb.co/THKtD9y) has seen an improved outlook for next year, up around 10% from 2020 at around 15.6 million with US [EV SALES](https://ibb.co/Hdk0qqq) increasing over 70% next year, this could be a huge boost to Tesla and other EV ramping up players like GM and FORD.\n\nThis is great news for Tesla after a big bear on the company just [trimmed](https://ibb.co/25tcFhJ) his short position on TESLA\n\n[Lemonade](https://ibb.co/wLqdKCS) had a big jump yesterday after the Motley Fool [published](https://ibb.co/PrJVJ5G) a long pitch for this company. I also own this stock and I believe it can become a very big player in the insurance business in the future. At the moment the company still only has a small market cap but I plan to own this for the long-term(5+years) as I expect great things from them. But don\u2019t just rush today in the stock because it spiked 20%, wait for it to cool off, maybe dollar cost average on it.\n\nWhile I am very interested to see what Disney [announces](https://ibb.co/hZDjxwk) next week as they may give new information on how the streaming business is doing and what the plans for the company are looking forward as 30% of the revenues of the company came from parks in the last years. I don\u2019t think that parks are ever going to be such a big part of the company as streaming and content production will lead the way. But I still like this company very much as it is one of my biggest portfolio holdings and I can see this stock rising to 170$ in the near future.\n\nA couple of companies released earnings yesterday as DocuSign [beat](https://ibb.co/znppzsn) the top and bottom line with billings coming in at $440M way over the consensus of $386M due to many more customers using the electronic signature to close contracts. While they also offered [guidance](https://ibb.co/34Hfnsz) for next quarter of around $404M to $408M also better than consensus at $387M as the stock is up 5% pre-market. \n\nWhile Marvell [missed](https://ibb.co/nCx5nHF) on expectations as the company cited supply issues constraints that are limiting the capability to satisfy demand. \n\nBad [news](https://ibb.co/yWJz3Kg) also came in for AMC with Warner\u2019s decision to send all they\u2019re 2021 movies directly to streaming on the same day as the theatrical release. This combined with the fact that AMC is filling to sell around [200M shares](https://ibb.co/Lkjkt5G), makes me think that this company is going to have the same route as Hertz. The cinema business wasn\u2019t doing so great since 2017, and this might be the final blow for the industry.\n\nAnd one final thought, it might be a good opportunity to get long on Dave &amp; Busters, Chewy, Adobe and Lululemon for next week, as I think they are all poised for good quarterly results. So, I will give all of them a small allocation today as I think there might be some good upside here in a few days, as there is a lot of money still on the sidelines with the most recent AAII asset [survey](https://ibb.co/7SRKkzk) showing that investors have more than 18% in cash on hands that can be pumped in the stock market.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

Over the course of 2 months it shot back up from 3 to 6 dollars and then eventually will fall back down.

        "selftext": "In June I bought a lot of JWN thinking that once a vaccine would arrive, there was a lot of upside and time and again its support level had been tested and tried so I didn\u2019t worry too much about it diving much and also didn\u2019t fear bankruptcy (cheap me post history to confirm). \n\nWell, here I am about 120% up (and that\u2019s only because sadly I bought a lot at ~$17, but then added three times as much at ~11.9. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve considered taking my profits and selling it all now only to buy something else that\u2019s currently cheap. JWN was like 80% down year to date when I bought that at 11.9 and now it\u2019s only about 25 % down. \n\nSo, I could go for airlines, cruises, oil companies, cinemas... and wait for them to do the same as JWN or even better as casino stocks (CZR, MGM). \n\nBUT, I feel like buying value stocks right now is super different from getting them six months ago.. or even two months ago. Mostly because now we have a vaccine and if stocks haven\u2019t already recovered a fair amount or completely, there is likely a long term climb to face. So yeah sure it\u2019s probably going to pay off in five years if you buy something like AAL, maybe AMC, NCLH or XOM.. but I doubt there\u2019s going to be a 100 % rally just around the corner - at least I feel it\u2019s much more uncertain than what I was aiming for pre-vaccine with JWN. It just seemed so simple.\n\nPlus, JWN still is 25 % down so if all goes well it has more recovery to do. It feels less risky than buying into NCHL which could be a 5 year thing before it climbs big time. \n\nOr what do you think? Thanks for any comments.",

        "selftext": "**Should you get into stocks that benefit from the booming housing market? Is the workout at home trade done? Intel stops the bleeding while Apple loses lawsuit. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes closing the day in the red despite hitting intraday records, with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PCN8dwz) losing .38%, while both the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/cDjpNKP) and the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/RydQj61) Industrial finished the day down just over .2% as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/44wGzR0) rising by more than 4% yesterday as the $2000 stimulus was [BLOCKED](https://ibb.co/WFNSpCH) in the Senate by McConnell and the Georgia Senate runoff election is just a week away.\n\nAlmost 70% of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/LYM4JfL) were declining yesterday on below average volume as the number of companies that were trading above the 50-day moving average fell under 70% for the first time in quite a while.\n\nWe saw 9 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/GRJSmht) closing in the red yesterday, with only the Health Care and Consumer Discretionary sectors having small gains as almost all the types of companies were losing ground [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/7tKPyP4), especially the small-caps with the small-cap growth group losing more than 2%.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/KjVsn9X) from yesterday, it\u2019s mostly red, with only a couple of companies that were gaining big like the Chinese companies alongside Amazon and Intel.HEAT\n\nWe also got some economic data yesterday, as a review of the 2020 aviation and air travel [ESTIMATED](https://ibb.co/hRbYxpG) that traffic will be down 67% since last year, dropping to levels not seen since 1999, as air travel is still struggling to come back after the march bottoms. This has affected most of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/FBq4g37) worldwide but it seems that China airlines is doing somewhat better with the biggest percentage of the total number of flights completed compared to last year.\n\nThe SP Home price [INDICES](https://ibb.co/W67RBYh) also came in better than expected with the National Index increasing by 1.4% M/M, as this is a leading measure of real estate prices, gaining 8.4% nationwide over year ago.\n\nThese moves can also be seen in the latest Redfin report, as home sales [PRICES](https://ibb.co/CwR5H56) are up 14% year/year to over $320K with a great increase in pending [SALES](https://ibb.co/mJtrwV9) which are also up more than 34% since last year, as the number of active [LISTINGS](https://ibb.co/vVkfMMh) of home sales is down more than 30%, as buyers can\u2019t snatch them up quick enough with such low [YIELDS](https://ibb.co/7j1kY3s), as this has led for the [AVERAGE](https://ibb.co/gzQq8Wb) sale price to list value to rise to 99.4% which Is up 1.5% since 2019. This should be good news for companies like Toll Brothers, Lennar, HD and LOW.\n\nThis was also accompanied by the great numbers in the us chain store sales [NUMBERS](https://ibb.co/4PykPcH), which rose by almost 9% y/y with December sales expected to rise almost 5% since last year and a .2% increase since last month.\n\nWhile [TODAY](https://ibb.co/8N3YMPV) we start the day with MBA Mortgage applications, home sales and the Chicago PMI alongside advance reads on many other data points.\n\nIn some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/q1J6Snv), we saw Apple cool of a little yesterday, losing more than 1% for the day while they also lost a lawsuit aimed of stopping Corellium using virtual iPhone for security researching in the operating system, while [INTEL](https://ibb.co/3vvXFGT) finally got a breather and recovered some of the recent loses, after an activist hedge fund manager pushed for strategic changes in the company as Intel is losing market share and top designers, with the company also [ISSUING](https://ibb.co/WgtwTrY) a statement that lifted spirits around the stock.\n\nWe also saw the [FAA](https://ibb.co/6rJ6bHd) introduce new rules for drones, this may have a big impact on companies like UPS, Walmart and Amazon, as all of them have started trials for drone-delivery, as this could lead to better margins for the companies.\n\nThe Fed also [EXTENDED](https://ibb.co/cxV3HkC) the main street lending programs until Jan. 8 with the approval of Mnuchin as they try to process a bunch of applications this month, this means we can get even more money put into the economy and eventually the stock markets which is good news.\n\nAnd meanwhile, AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine was [APPROVED](https://ibb.co/y5QWbmh) for emergency use in the UK, this is another weapon to find this freaking illness, while JNJ will give us some results in early 2021 and Novavax just started their trial in the US.\n\nAlso, one last piece of data that I found recently shows that there was indeed a huge spike this [YEAR](https://ibb.co/JrKw01B) in the move to live streaming video and pre-recorded videos this year, as this has boosted companies like Peloton, Lululemon and others.\n\nBut this trend is seen slowing down in the next years with just a 4% [CAGR](https://ibb.co/HGhFJXS) in the equipment market, but that the exercise apps will see a big [GROWTH](https://ibb.co/02wm273) in the next years, so there are 2 different POV. I wouldn\u2019t stay invested in companies like PTON right now, I\u2019d rather take profits and move to other areas in the stock market. But don\u2019t rush into companies like AMC which have diluted their stock a lot or have lots of debt\u2026 this will not recover so fast, with [AMC](https://ibb.co/gDR8S81) filling to share up to 50M shares.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/nbV49Bs) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

And in the [interim results](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-micro-focus-international-stock-surged-today-2020-11-18) released in November, they're projecting THREE BILLION in revenue for the full year. \n\nAnd you know what the market cap is, even after the price rose recently to just under $6?  $1.9 billion! Let me tell ya, this ain't no fucking AMC with closed down theaters in the middle of a pandemic. This is a British enterprise **technology company selling for less than revenue**! You know what PLTR's Price to Sales ratio is? Over 40, you fucking imbeciles. \n\nAnd what kind of technology is this? **FUCKING COBOL**. You know that shit your grandpa coded to pay gas for your grandma's boyfriend's 1972 VW Beetle. Yeah, that. It's still around and companies can't find enough help to maintain their two thousand year old mainframes. [Companies and governments need help with COBOL!](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/04/20/brush-up-your-cobol-why-is-a-60-year-old-language-suddenly-in-demand/) You know who competes with MFGP on COBOL? Eye-Bee-fucking-Em. IBM! No one else is going to compete with Micro Focus on this cause it's just so goddamn boring. I dare you, f me one goddamn degenerate on this board that funded their loss porn through COBOL. But you know what, whatever boring ass shit Micro Focus does, they're goddamn good at it. Migrating old companies to the cloud? Done! And it's not just me saying this. **Even Jeff Fucking Bezos loves them**. [Amazon Web Services picked just four partners for Cloud Migration](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/03/micro-focus-international-stock-pops-on-amazon-par/), and you know who's in that exclusive list? That's right, Micro Focus. \n\nAnd if any of you retards think this baby's going bankrupt, you can go back to jerking off on your loss porn. They got more than 1 billion dollars in liquidity, and they've been whittling down their debt, reducing it by more than $400 million this past year. And don't forget there are lines of yield-hungry Europeans willing to get shitty interest on their money cause you know what other options they got? None! So even though they got $4.2 Billion dollars worth of it, thanks to their [successful refinancing](http://otp.investis.com/clients/uk/microfocus/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?cid=108&amp;newsid=1393816) earlier this year, they don't have any debt due until June 2024! \n\nSo how much tendies we talking about here? No, not that Wendy's shit. Fucking Fuddruckers tendies with nacho cheese, retard. With a fucking OSTRICH burger on the side. Let's say they get to a 3x price/sales multiple, which is dirt cheap for a Technology company. That would lead to a share price of almost $30! 5x the current price. Those paper handed retards at Seeking Alpha were calling this company Micro FuckUs earlier this year, but you know what? Unlike them, maybe **we like getting fucked if it means we make a shitload of money in the end.** So join me on the Micro FuckUs Tendie Train, shares or April 2020 options work (don't get earlier options, so you can benefit from likely positive year-end earnings), and let's get rich motherfuckers.",

        "selftext": "In June I bought a lot of JWN thinking that once a vaccine would arrive, there was a lot of upside and time and again its support level had been tested and tried so I didn\u2019t worry too much about it diving much and also didn\u2019t fear bankruptcy (cheap me post history to confirm). \n\nWell, here I am about 120% up (and that\u2019s only because sadly I bought a lot at ~$17, but then added three times as much at ~11.9. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve considered taking my profits and selling it all now only to buy something else that\u2019s currently cheap. JWN was like 80% down year to date when I bought that at 11.9 and now it\u2019s only about 25 % down. \n\nSo, I could go for airlines, cruises, oil companies, cinemas... and wait for them to do the same as JWN or even better as casino stocks (CZR, MGM). \n\nBUT, I feel like buying value stocks right now is super different from getting them six months ago.. or even three months ago. Mostly because now we have a vaccine and if stocks haven\u2019t already recovered a fair amount of completely, there is likely a long term climb to face. So yeah sure it\u2019s probably going to pay off in five years if you buy something like AAL, maybe AMC, NCLH or XOM.. but I doubt there\u2019s going to be a 100 % rally just around the corner - at least I feel it\u2019s much more uncertain than what I was aiming for pre-vaccine with JWN. It just seemed so simple.\n\nPlus, JWN still is 25 % down so if all goes well it has more recovery to do. It feels less risky than buying into NCHL which could be a 5 year thing before it climbs big time. \n\nOr what do you think? Thanks for any comments.",

Lemonade spiked yesterday over 20% while Pfizer confirmed delivery numbers, let\u2019s talk about this and everything new in the stock market**\n\nHey everyone!

All 3 of them were trading a lot higher intraday before the most recent Pfizer [news](https://ibb.co/qCXxh0Q) popped up as they are only expected to ship half of the doses that were initially planned, but people spooked at this to much in my opinion. This thing was already known, when they published the candidate data in November, they also [announced](https://ibb.co/cDtdMCy) this number, but people runed away way to fast before going more into the data. Pfizer did not cut supply, they just explained why this happened in this latest headline. It is way better for companies to under-promise and over-deliver than the other way around.\n\nThe [VIX](https://ibb.co/HYrVJNH) also saw a spike around the Pfizer news and finished higher for the day while 59% of companies were advancing with almost 150 new highs and just 3 new lows on below average volume of 11,5 billion shares compared to 11,7 billion shares in the last 20 trading days.

        "selftext": "**Should you get into stocks that benefit from the booming housing market? Is the workout at home trade done? Intel stops the bleeding while Apple loses lawsuit. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes closing the day in the red despite hitting intraday records, with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PCN8dwz) losing .38%, while both the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/cDjpNKP) and the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/RydQj61) Industrial finished the day down just over .2% as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/44wGzR0) rising by more than 4% yesterday as the $2000 stimulus was [BLOCKED](https://ibb.co/WFNSpCH) in the Senate by McConnell and the Georgia Senate runoff election is just a week away.\n\nAlmost 70% of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/LYM4JfL) were declining yesterday on below average volume as the number of companies that were trading above the 50-day moving average fell under 70% for the first time in quite a while.\n\nWe saw 9 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/GRJSmht) closing in the red yesterday, with only the Health Care and Consumer Discretionary sectors having small gains as almost all the types of companies were losing ground [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/7tKPyP4), especially the small-caps with the small-cap growth group losing more than 2%.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/KjVsn9X) from yesterday, it\u2019s mostly red, with only a couple of companies that were gaining big like the Chinese companies alongside Amazon and Intel.HEAT\n\nWe also got some economic data yesterday, as a review of the 2020 aviation and air travel [ESTIMATED](https://ibb.co/hRbYxpG) that traffic will be down 67% since last year, dropping to levels not seen since 1999, as air travel is still struggling to come back after the march bottoms. This has affected most of the [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/FBq4g37) worldwide but it seems that China airlines is doing somewhat better with the biggest percentage of the total number of flights completed compared to last year.\n\nThe SP Home price [INDICES](https://ibb.co/W67RBYh) also came in better than expected with the National Index increasing by 1.4% M/M, as this is a leading measure of real estate prices, gaining 8.4% nationwide over year ago. \n\nThese moves can also be seen in the latest Redfin report, as home sales [PRICES](https://ibb.co/CwR5H56) are up 14% year/year to over $320K with a great increase in pending [SALES](https://ibb.co/mJtrwV9) which are also up more than 34% since last year, as the number of active [LISTINGS](https://ibb.co/vVkfMMh) of home sales is down more than 30%, as buyers can\u2019t snatch them up quick enough with such low [YIELDS](https://ibb.co/7j1kY3s), as this has led for the [AVERAGE](https://ibb.co/gzQq8Wb) sale price to list value to rise to 99.4% which Is up 1.5% since 2019. This should be good news for companies like Toll Brothers, Lennar, HD and LOW.\n\nThis was also accompanied by the great numbers in the us chain store sales [NUMBERS](https://ibb.co/4PykPcH), which rose by almost 9% y/y with December sales expected to rise almost 5% since last year and a .2% increase since last month.\n\nWhile [TODAY](https://ibb.co/8N3YMPV) we start the day with MBA Mortgage applications, home sales and the Chicago PMI alongside advance reads on many other data points.\n\nIn some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/q1J6Snv), we saw Apple cool of a little yesterday, losing more than 1% for the day while they also lost a lawsuit aimed of stopping Corellium using virtual iPhone for security researching in the operating system, while [INTEL](https://ibb.co/3vvXFGT) finally got a breather and recovered some of the recent loses, after an activist hedge fund manager pushed for strategic changes in the company as Intel is losing market share and top designers, with the company also [ISSUING](https://ibb.co/WgtwTrY) a statement that lifted spirits around the stock.\n\nWe also saw the [FAA](https://ibb.co/6rJ6bHd) introduce new rules for drones, this may have a big impact on companies like UPS, Walmart and Amazon, as all of them have started trials for drone-delivery, as this could lead to better margins for the companies.\n\nThe Fed also [EXTENDED](https://ibb.co/cxV3HkC) the main street lending programs until Jan. 8 with the approval of Mnuchin as they try to process a bunch of applications this month, this means we can get even more money put into the economy and eventually the stock markets which is good news.\n\nAnd meanwhile, AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine was [APPROVED](https://ibb.co/y5QWbmh) for emergency use in the UK, this is another weapon to find this freaking illness, while JNJ will give us some results in early 2021 and Novavax just started their trial in the US.\n\nAlso, one last piece of data that I found recently shows that there was indeed a huge spike this [YEAR](https://ibb.co/JrKw01B) in the move to live streaming video and pre-recorded videos this year, as this has boosted companies like Peloton, Lululemon and others.\n\nBut this trend is seen slowing down in the next years with just a 4% [CAGR](https://ibb.co/HGhFJXS) in the equipment market, but that the exercise apps will see a big [GROWTH](https://ibb.co/02wm273) in the next years, so there are 2 different POV. I wouldn\u2019t stay invested in companies like PTON right now, I\u2019d rather take profits and move to other areas in the stock market. But don\u2019t rush into companies like AMC which have diluted their stock a lot or have lots of debt\u2026 this will not recover so fast, with [AMC](https://ibb.co/gDR8S81) filling to share up to 50M shares.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/nbV49Bs) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

Activist\ninvestors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.\nThere is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.\nSchedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management\n(such as Index funds).\n\nThere is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize\nis that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.\nThe reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.\nIn contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.\n\n## New Filings\nThis table lists new 13D filings in the last week.

It dropped a little to 3.4 after news came out that HBO and others will be streaming their movies. AMC said they\u2019ll be on the brink of bankruptcy by the end of January and will have no more money. I don\u2019t think theatre\u2019s will go bankrupt but then again you never know. With the vaccine rolling out which is going to take some time probably till May-June, will AMC survive? I think the stock will dip to around 1.8 - 2.3 range and at that time it\u2019ll be a good time to buy.",

Im using revolut app for this and just a few dollars every month from the money im not going to spend and would just put it into a piggy bank. When i started i saw that AMC stock have dropped a lot and since it was just at 4,5$ i bought 11.1. then it dropped to 4,32$ and bought 12.1 shares again it dropped to 3,98$ and bought 8.7 shares. Now its at 2,47$/shares. I know its a High risk stock right now but every stock new website lists it either a guaranteed lose or a possibly high gain investment. I mean i know if it survives the pandemic then opens the theaters/cinemas then it will rise pretty high but the company lives on debts and forecast websites list it dead within Q2 2021 or uder 1$. What do you think. Should I sell it now and aknowledge my loss then try it with another Stable rise stock or should i stay with it and wait for a miracle?  \n\n\nSorry if my question is stupid, i just had to ask from people who know their stuff :D",

        "selftext": "Disney hiked its five-year streaming subscriber estimates on Thursday, expecting Disney+ to continue to post remarkable growth.\n\nThe company now forecasts 230 million to 260 million subscribers to Disney+ by 2024. \n\nUpon its launch 13 months ago, Disney said it expected the platform to reach 60 million to 90 million subscriptions by 2024.\n\nDisney shares closed up 13.59% on Friday after briefly hitting an all-time high earlier in the day.\n\nWhen Disney+ launched 13 months ago, Disney said it expected the platform to reach 60 million to 90 million subscriptions by 2024. Then the streaming platform quickly took off. As of Thursday evening, it had already closed in on the high end of that projection, with 86.8 million Disney+ subscribers.\n\nIt's an impressive goal, especially since competition in the space has only increased. Apple TV+, Netflix, AT&amp;T's HBO Max, Comcast's Peacock, ViacomCBS' Paramount+ and AMC Networks' AMC Plus are all competing for eyeballs. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, who recently announced Discovery's premium service Discovery+, recently told CNBC the winners and losers of the streaming wars will emerge in the next 12 to 24 months.\n\nHere's a quick rundown of Disney+'s rapid growth: Ten million people signed up within the first day, with a total of 26.5 million subscribers in its first operating quarter. Disney+ jumped from 33.5 million subscribers in its second quarter to 57.5 million by its third quarter. By the fourth quarter, the company said it surpassed 73.7 million subscribers.\n\nSome of those subscribers arrived at the service through bundles or one-time promotions, like a partnership with Verizon that offered one year of Disney+ to customers, though Disney doesn't break out those numbers.\n\nBy comparison, Netflix reported 195.15 million subscribers in the third quarter. Earlier this week, AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey said there are now 12.6 million HBO Max subscribers.\n\nDisney has invested heavily into its direct-to-consumer business, as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to keep millions of people at home and in need of entertainment. The company will continue to push into original content, with new shows and movies likely able to bring in even more subscribers.\n\nCEO Bob Chapek said at Disney's investor day Thursday that of the roughly 100 projects that were announced, about 80% will go directly to Disney+. Disney will allow users to opt in for more mature content, which will enable older audiences to watch titles such as \"Atlanta\" and \"Modern Family.\" That could also help attract more subscribers.\n\nAs it expands content, Disney said, it plans to increase the cost of the service to $7.99, up $1.\n\nDisney added that it expects its family of streaming services, which includes Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, to hit 300 million to 350 million total subscriptions by fiscal 2024.\n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/after-showing-massive-growth-disney-hikes-5-year-subscriber-goal-.html)",
