        "selftext": "**Disclaimer and disclosure:** I am not a financial advisor and none of the below research constitutes investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell. Always do your own due diligence. I currently own 700 commons and 1500 warrants of LCAP and plan to buy an additional 3500 warrants, just waiting for an account transfer to go through. All prices mentioned below are as of market close on February 18.\n\n**Note:** Any constructive criticism to improve this DD would be welcome. If you see any red flags or risks I may have missed, please highlight them.\n\n**TL;DR:** Lionheart Acquisition Corp. II (LCAP) is a SPAC targeting a company at the intersection of real estate and technology with a team experienced in SPAC dealmaking, the target sector, and private equity. Commons and warrants are relatively cheap at $10.73 and $1.57, respectively.\n\n**Fast Facts:**\n\n* Leadership: Ophir Sternberg (CEO, President, and Chairman), Trevor Barran (COO), and Paul Rapisarda (CFO)\n* Units have half a warrant, one warrant for one share + $11.50\n* IPO: August 8, 2020; 18-month term, $230 million initial trust\n* Target: A real-estate technology (\u201cPropTech\u201d) company with an enterprise value of least $1 billion\n* Current prices: units ($11.32), commons ($10.73), and warrants ($1.57)\n* Incorporated in Delaware\n* Interestingly, contrary to what its name suggests, LCAP is not the second SPAC from this sponsor. More on that below.\n\nThough many DD posts tout SPACs that they claim are \u201cunder the radar\u201d and \u201csleeping giants,\u201d I genuinely believe LCAP is relatively overlooked by investors. It has low-to-medium volume (3-month average is 93K, 10-day average is 91K), is relatively near NAV, has only 142 followers on [Stocktwits](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/LCAP), and has no DD posted on this sub to date (which was surprising).\n\n**Leadership:**\n\n* CEO Ophir Sternberg previously led OPES Acquisition Corp., which successfully merged with BurgerFi (BFI, +54% above $10 offer price) in December 2020. (Interestingly, OPES IPO\u2019d in March 2018 and originally focused on a target in Mexico and went through a number of deadline extensions; after Sternberg became Chairman of OPES in March 2020, the BurgerFi deal was announced in June. More on that under \u201cThe Sternberg\u2013OPES Connection.\u201d) He has decades of experience developing and investing in the real-estate industry. He\u2019s CEO of Lionheart Capital, a Miami-based real-estate development and investment firm founded in 2010. Sternberg has led a number of large real-estate transactions, including the Miami Beach Ritz-Carlton project, which resulted in a total sell-out value in excess of $560 million as well as the $30 million purchase and $120 million sale of the Seagull Hotel. Ongoing projects include retail properties in Miami\u2019s Design District, two oceanfront condominium towers in Pompano Beach, Florida and a ski-in/ski-out hotel and residences in Breckenridge, Colorado.\n* COO Trevor Barran has been at Lionheart Capital since 2017. For two decades, Barran worked in investment and operations roles across the financial services, healthcare, technology, and real estate industries, including the last ten years acquiring and developing real estate properties.\n* Paul Rapisarda joined Lionheart in 2019 and previously was CFO of Etrion Corp., a solar energy development company.\n* Sternberg, Barran, and Rapisarda are also all part of Out of the Box Ventures, a Lionheart Capital subsidiary that acquires and repositions distressed retail properties in the US. Out of the Box currently controls over 6 million square feet of big box stores, shopping centers, and enclosed regional mall properties with plans to improve and expand upon these acquisitions.\n\n**Target Sector:**\n\nFrom the [S-1](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-086909/#aa_006):\n\n&gt;\u201cWe define the PropTech sector as businesses that apply innovative digital technologies and technology-enhanced services and solutions to the identification, design, development, construction, operation, financing, management and disposition of real estate properties. This definition applies to both technology companies that are disrupting the real estate sector as well as to real estate companies that utilize innovative technology.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The businesses we seek to acquire offer innovative software, hardware, products, operations or services that are technologically equipped to improve property ownership; property financing; property valuation; property operations; property management; leasing; property insurance; real estate asset management and investment management; and design, construction and development. These businesses have a large addressable market across the broader real estate sector potentially including landlords, tenants, developers, operators, managers, brokers, investors, lenders, architects, engineers, and general contractors. We believe the acquisition of one or more businesses in this sector can serve as a platform for expansion, both organically and through further acquisitions, including \u2018roll-ups\u2019 of smaller players in some of the more fragmented, emerging sectors such as co-working and co-living.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We will seek to acquire established businesses of scale that we believe are poised for continued growth with capable management teams and proven unit economics, but potentially in need of financial, operational, strategic or managerial enhancement to maximize value. We do not intend to acquire startup companies or companies without established business plans.\u201d\n\nOverall, I think PropTech is an intriguing sector with the potential for strong growth. Though we\u2019re familiar with some innovative PropTech companies like Airbnb, Zillow, Autodesk, Redfin, and others, the real-estate sector is still ripe for disruption. In 2018, for instance, PropTech companies received just $5.3 billion of venture funding compared to approximately $47 billion for U.S. fintech companies, indicating we\u2019re still early on in this cycle and greater growth and innovation may be ahead.\n\nAlso, recent SPAC mergers with PropTech companies OpenDoor (OPEN, previously IPOB, +211% above $10 offer price) and Porch.com (PRCH, previously PTAC, +105% above $10 offer price) have generated increased awareness of and interest in the sector. I won\u2019t go through possible target companies here (maybe in a future post), but those interested in learning more about the sector and the relevant companies should see \u201cLinks of Interest\u201d below.\n\n**Progress on Finding a Target:**\n\nIn October 2020, an [article](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_b248f39712383d5ad501a6465d5f6f55/lionheartacquisitioncorp/db/942/8000/pdf/MergerMarket+10+8.pdf) linked from LCAP\u2019s official site noted, \u201cLionheart Acquisition Corporation II has reviewed more than 20 potential property technology targets since listing in August and **five of them are \u2018very interesting,\u2019** CEO Ophir Sternberg said.\u201d The article is short but provides a lot of good information about the kind of target LCAP is looking for and I recommend people read it. In the same article is where he mentions looking for a company that is at least $1 billion in value. It\u2019s relevant to note that Sternberg also said that he\u2019s more interested in the tech side of PropTech than actual real estate companies:\n\n&gt;\u201cWe are looking at them all, but companies that are more focused on providing technology than on property are more exciting right now,\u201d Sternberg said. \u201cThey have a higher growth potential.\u201d\n\nGiven that four months have passed since the article without an update from Sternberg, my guess is that LCAP is making progress on their search and may have approached one or more businesses to begin talks. They may even be close to finalizing a deal, but this is pure speculation. Beyond that, I can\u2019t make any other claims about where they might be in the process.\n\n**The Sternberg\u2013OPES Connection:**\n\nIn the interest of assessing Sternberg\u2019s leadership and dealmaking skills, I wanted to learn more about his time at OPES. I hope you\u2019ll permit me to go on a bit of a tangent concerning this because I found it pretty interesting. As I mentioned above, OPES IPO\u2019d in March 2018 and originally focused on a target in Mexico and went through a number of deadline extensions; Sternberg only became Chairman of OPES in March 2020, and the BurgerFi deal was announced in June. This prompted a series of questions: **Under what conditions did Sternberg take the lead at OPES? Did OPES approach Sternberg or vice versa? Were they close to a merger deal at the time? When did the pivot from Mexico to BurgerFi happen?** The LCAP S-1 has this to say: \u201cThe OPES team, led by Mr. Sternberg, evaluated over 50 potential targets and negotiated business combination terms with multiple candidates **in a span of a few months** and is acquiring BurgerFi at what it believes is an attractive multiple relative to its peers.\u201d\n\nI thought that would be the end of it and we\u2019d never know the precise details of Sternberg\u2019s time at OPES. Well, it turns out that a detailed timeline is provided in the OPES [Schedule 14A](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1723580/000121390020028487/ea125096-prem14a_opesacqu.htm), the filing where investors are informed of the merger vote meeting, on pp.48\u201350. In short, OPES decided to shift gears at some point in March 2020, likely around the time their fourth extension was approved by stockholders on March 16, to a new team led by Sternberg that would focus on \u201cidentifying a high-growth US company that could take advantage of the new team\u2019s extensive experience in real estate development, design and build, acquisitions, leasing and rapid growth strategies.\u201d Almost immediately, on March 18, Sternberg contacted John Rosatti, the CEO and Founder of BurgerFi, to gauge interest in merging. On April 25, they had an initial draft of the LOI, a signed LOI on June 7, and a signed DA on June 29.\n\nAll of this leads me to believe that Sternberg\u2019s leadership and connections were instrumental in helping OPES pivot and finally close a deal. And this is where we can guess why Lionheart added the \u201cII\u201d to its name after the BurgerFi merger announcement in June: LCAP is not the second SPAC by Lionheart, but instead should be seen as a successor of sorts to OPES. At $15.41/share, BFI investors may not be seeing the kind of returns they would get from an EV or fintech company, but BFI is a fast-growing business executing an expansion plan during a pandemic, and I recall the company being well-liked on this sub (for those who were here then).\n\n**Bearish DD:**\n\nWhile researching, I came across another [writeup](https://spacteams.com/lcap-spac-mall-renovator-making-spac-money-moves/) linked from Stocktwits. Titled \u201cMall Renovator Making SPAC Money Moves,\u201d the post concludes: \n\n&gt;\u201cLionheart Corporation is led by a mediocre CEO and a team that has most of its experience in mall-based retailers. Both the SPAC and Lionheart Capital has a bright future ahead and I don\u2019t see them running into any deadline problems. Lionheart is clearly an opportunist, and will likely take advantage of retail displacement due to COVID. Also Lionheart Capital is taking full advantage of the retail real estate deal flow during the Pandemic, so they definitely know what they\u2019re doing. Finally, with subsidiary\u2019s such as Out of the Box Ventures, Lionheart Capital is sure to expand their horizons, whether its in the real estate sector or any other sector.\u201d\n\nPutting aside the question of how a mediocre team can have a bright future, let\u2019s examine these claims. While it\u2019s true that Out of the Box has acquired properties related to a number of struggling mall-based retailers (e.g., Macy\u2019s, JCPenney, Sears, etc.), it specifically targets these kinds of distressed companies and aims to be at the forefront of transforming the properties into multipurpose destinations. Further, Lionheart has a broader portfolio across residential, commercial, hotel, and retail properties, so I think the characterization of the team and their experience as \u201cmall renovators\u201d is unfair and misleading. The mention of COVID, though, was interesting and something I had in mind as well. COVID is changing numerous aspects of real estate (particularly the housing market and commercial/retail spaces like malls) in ways I haven\u2019t fully explored yet, and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see LCAP capitalize on that somehow. But at the same time, management makes no mention of using the economic effects of COVID to their advantage in the S-1 and there\u2019s really no solid evidence that it\u2019s part of their strategy (unless you count their emphasis on tech, which has thrived during the pandemic). \n\nLCAP might pick up some sort of mall-based company, as the DD post above suggests, but I think this would be a deviation from the team\u2019s investment thesis, recent interview statements, and commitment to the tech side of PropTech. Further, the sentiment that the team is defined by their focus on dying malls and retailers is inaccurate. Overall, I think the DD post above is off-base and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the kind of target LCAP is looking for. But the bearish outlook is useful for thinking about this SPAC from a different point of view, which is always helpful.\n\n**Miscellaneous:**\n\n* I\u2019ve checked some of management\u2019s LinkedIn pages but found little of interest (actually, I did, but it\u2019s a lot of disconnected pieces that makes me feel a bit like the [guy from this meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pepe-silvia)).\n* I checked the most recent 10-Q to see if increased operating expenses indicated they may have found a target but saw nothing out of the ordinary.\n* The most recent 13G can be found [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1802450/000110465921024054/tm216967d1_sc13g.htm) and shows that Lionheart Equities and Sternberg own 16.7% of shares each as of December 31 of last year. Other institutional investors can be seen [here](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/lcap?selected_quarter=24) (which also shows Lionheart with a 41% stake in LCAP).\n\n**Risks:**\n\n* **Liquidation and opportunity cost:** As with all SPACs, two main risks are liquidation (if the SPAC fails to find a target before its deadline) and opportunity cost. LCAP is currently about a third of the way through its 18-month term and investors waiting for a DA may be waiting up to a year for an announcement.\n* **Unknown target and valuation:** As with all pre-DA/LOI/rumor SPACs, investors buy into the management and sector without knowing which company they will ultimately merge with, the terms of the agreement, or whether it will be at a fair valuation, making it impossible to determine the long-term market value of their investment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis SPAC checks a number of the right boxes for me: good management experience in both SPACs and the target sector, inexpensive shares/warrants, resulting in reduced risk, and in a less-hyped sector than EV or fintech with the potential for growth. This SPAC is about a third of the way through its life cycle, and based on my research, it\u2019s rare to have commons and warrants this cheap this far along without coming across a few red flags\u2014but I haven\u2019t found any. LCAP\u2019s trust is \u201conly\u201d $230 million and it may not pick up the next hottest company, but it doesn\u2019t need to. At this point, I would prefer a fair valuation for an established business. There\u2019s evidence to suggest LCAP offers low-risk access to a growing sector with capable leadership at the helm. In a frothy, unpredictable market, that\u2019s valuable.\n\n**Links/Sources:**\n\n* [S-1](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-086909/#aa_006)\n* [Property tech SPAC Lionheart Acquisition II prices $200 million IPO at $10 press release](https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/70307/Property-tech-SPAC-Lionheart-Acquisition-II-prices-$200-million-IPO-at-$10)\n* [Lionheart Acquisition Corp.
