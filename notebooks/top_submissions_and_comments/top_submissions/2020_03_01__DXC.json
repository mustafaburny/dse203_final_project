        "selftext": "I own only VGRO in my registered accounts outside of my work DC plan.   I have my wife's TFSA to put to work and was thinking of the following allocation.  \n\n20% ZLB\n\n20% VSP\n\n40% VFV\n\n20% ZAG\n\nThe reason being, I think the S&amp;P 500 is where the growth will continue to come from. Europe and Emerging markets worry me and businesses that make up the S&amp;P 500 are doing business all over the world anyways.   The currency hedge,  ZAG and ZLB are just there to mute some of the wild swings.   Anyone else have similar thoughts?   Anything better than ZLB out there?   If an ETF existed that capped energy at maybe 5% and banks at 15-20% that would be perfect.  I have looked at DXC and I own a little DGRC but neither have done much better than VCN over the past few years.",
