        "selftext": "Hey All, each Sunday, I plan to pick 5 stocks from ARK\u2019s funds that are most attractive from a fundamental perspective (i.e. growth rates, margins, valuation). I'm doing this for myself so thought it'd be helpful to share with others before trading begins on Mondays.\n\nPlanning to do this for the Innovation (ARKK) fund today, then the autonomous tech next week, then next gen internet, then fintech before the whole cycle repeats. (Unless it turns out that there\u2019s no interest in this, then I\u2019ll stop posting).   \n\n\n**Why ARK?**\n\n* Though ARK\u2019s strategy can be seen as overhyped and controversial, what I do like about the fund is that they are growth-focused with an [internal annual hurdle rate of 15%](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/Marketing_Material/ARKInvest_122019_ESG-Policy.pdf) based on a 5-year time horizon \n* But, I think ARK tends to be on the optimistic end of the spectrum and sometimes ***too***\u00a0**tolerant of overly stretched valuations** \n* As a result, I\u2019m hoping to give you the **best of both worlds: high growth stock picks at the most attractive prices,** all by using ARK\u2019s ETF picks as a filter for vetted, high-growth companies\u00a0 \n   * To be clear, I\u2019m not saying ARK\u2019s picks are all bulletproof. Just using the fund\u2019s picks since they have a much bigger research team and resources than an individual investor such as myself, so **think of this post as a potential** ***starting point***\u00a0**for more research** \n\n**My Process &amp; Selection Criteria**\n\n* First of all,\u00a0I\u2019ll be excluding all non-tech stocks in my analysis because I personally like to focus on tech. Including healthcare stocks (which pretty much are what the non-tech stocks are) ruins the metric comparisons given the differences in industries.\n* My process was pretty simple. Downloaded all the tickers from ARK, pulled data from wallmine or went through filings myself. As a result, there may be some slight discrepancies from the data you use and mine but they should be around the same ballpark.\n* Next, my **selection criteria,** which will I\u2019ll likely change over time each week. Today the ones I\u2019m using include the following (data sourced from wallmine and filings): \n   * **Trading at less than 70% of the 52 week high** \\- provides context around market sentiment \n   * **Greater than 25% LTM revenue growth** \\- guide for the future \n   * **Greater than 60% LTM gross margins** \\- operational efficiency \n   * **LTM cash flow positive** \\- operational efficiency \n   * **LTM Revenue multiple of less than 15x** \\- valuation \n* Given that the market is a bit bearish right now and punishing stocks with stretched valuations, I\u2019m heavily weighting the valuation criteria as you\u2019ll see soon \n\n**The Top 5 Picks of the Week**\n\n* **2U - a leading edtech company**\n   * 52 week high discount: 41% \n   * LTM revenue growth: 34% \n   * LTM gross margins: 71% \n   * LTM cash flow positive: 0% \n   * EV / LTM revenue: 3.3x \n   * Commentary: Most software companies are trading 20-30x with these types of fundamentals, so based on the valuation, 2U seems very promising \n* **Baidu - a Chinese AI and internet conglomerate**\n   * 52 week high discount: 26% \n   * LTM revenue growth: 46% \n   * LTM gross margins: 48% \n   * LTM cash flow positive: 33% \n   * EV / LTM revenue: 4.7x \n   * Commentary: Really great financial figures and super low revenue multiple, but do keep in mind that there\u2019s always heightened risk when investing in Chinese companies \n* **PagerDuty - an incident response software company**\n   * 52 week high discount: 36% \n   * LTM revenue growth: 27% \n   * LTM gross margins: 87% \n   * LTM cash flow positive: (35%) \n   * EV / LTM revenue: 13.1x \n   * Commentary: The company is in its growing phase so that\u2019s why I\u2019m forgiving of its negative 35% free cash flow margin and a 13.1x revenue\u00a0multiple seems very fair for this kind of financial profile for a software company. Keep in mind these are EV / LTM revenue multiples, so this multiple is even lower for NTM but I just don\u2019t have that data. \n* **Teradyne - a test\u00a0equipment manufacturing company whose customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, and more**\n   * 52 week high discount: 23% \n   * LTM revenue growth: 34% \n   * LTM gross margins: 57% \n   * LTM cash flow positive: 29% \n   * EV / LTM revenue: 5.8x \n   * Commentary: Based on the growth rate, margins, and valuation, seems like a bargain \n* **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company - primarily makes chips**\n   * 52 week high discount: 15% \n   * LTM revenue growth: 33% \n   * LTM gross margins: 53% \n   * LTM cash flow positive: 29% \n   * EV / LTM revenue: 11.4x \n   * Commentary: The company isn\u2019t trading at much of a discount relative to the others at 85% but I chose this company because there has been some news I came across recently of a chip shortage,\u00a0which means there is incredible demand for TSMC\u2019s products",

        "selftext": "First, I'm long on this with 2000 shares. I'm posting my very quick DD here on just the latest developments - anyone wanting to dig more into the history can review googlecheatednetlist.com, where a lot of the information has been gathered (including court docket info and filings). I'll do a quick summary for those not wanting to read that.  I personally prefer this seekingalpha entry : https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/52496833-agni-research/5562387-netlist-high-stakes-patent-litigation\n\n&gt;Netlist has been in litigation with Google since 2009 over allegations that Google infringed upon Netlist\u2019s seminal 912 patent. It is a hardware patent for processing commands in an LRDIMM memory module using rank multiplication. Google signed an NDA to take a look at it. It passed on using the technology described in the patent. Netlist alleges that Google infringed the patent by building servers using the 912 patent technology. Netlist sued Google on December 2009 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. The judge in the case ordered a random cross section of servers to be examined which showed that Google indeed was using technology described in the 912 patent.\n\nI've seen a lot of people glossing over this. Do you understand why this is a big deal?  Netlist technology is considered a seminal patent (for any apes here, *seminal* in this case means that it is was so impactful it shifted the entire industry).  I work in enterprise storage and this stuff gets me tingly.\n&gt;So why is the 912 patent a big deal? It is a seminal patent. A seminal patent is defined as a patent that describes an invention so impactful that it creates or shifts the technology space. Netlist believes that the teachings of the 912 patent can be found in various DDR3 and DDR4 server DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Module) as well as future products that will be produced under the DDR5 server DIMM standards currently being established by the industry. Furthermore, Netlist asserts that the 912 patent enabled Google to build servers with high capacity and rapid memory that allowed said servers to store an entire Oracle database in memory which allowed lightning fast search results. **The 912 patent played a large part in Google\u2019s dominance in search**. Right now, **it is not a question whether Google infringed the 912 patent. That has already been established**. Now, Google is at the stage where it can settle with Netlist or go to a jury trial to determine damages. As for the damages, Netlist will most likely use a hedonic pricing model to determine the damages. Hedonic pricing looks at both the product itself (internal factors) and the environment (external factors) in determining pricing. In this case Netlist will argue that **the 912 patent established Google\u2019s dominance in search, which allowed monopolist profits that funded Google\u2019s entire ecosystem. While at the same time, Google\u2019s infringement of the patent prevented Netlist from establishing itself in the server memory marketplace. Netlist will most likely seek billions in damages.** Also, the prospect of treble damages is in play as Netlist will allege willful infringement on Google\u2019s part. The most likely scenario is Google will settle the case rather than risk going in front of a jury. A settlement would include a large lump sum plus licensing of the patent going forward.\n\nCATALYSTS\n\n* Mar 4  : NLST management will participate in the Arete Tech Conference 2021\n* Mar 4  : Markman hearing (SK Hynix) \n* Mar 11: Case Management Conference on next proceeding for Google payout\n* Mar 16: NLST management will participate in the 33rd Annual ROTH Conference\n* Jul 6   : Markman jury trial \n\n**This litigation will allow Netlist to become a gatekeeper for the DDR5 memory standard, much like QCOM is in the cellular field.**\n\nThe Netlist 912 Patent\n\nNetlist also sued Inphi for infringement of the 912 patent in the US District Court for the Central District of California. That case was also stayed pending the Court of Appeals decision, and now that the 912 patent was upheld it is expected Netlist will resume court proceedings once it is finished with the Google case.\n\nOn March 2020 Netlist filed a patent infringement lawsuit against SK Hynix in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas based on the infringement of Netlist\u2019s 218, 523, and 595 patents in SK Hynix\u2019s RDIMM and LRDIMM server memory products. SK Hynix petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (\u201cCAFC\u201d) to change the venue from Texas to California. This petition was denied and the case will be tried in Texas. The Markman hearing was set for March 4, 2021 with Jury trial set for July 6, 2021. The Western District of Texas is notorious for being very pro-patent holder friendly. Recently, on March 2, 2021 in this very same court under the same judge that will be preceding over the Netlist case, Intel was found guilty of infringing on two of VSLI\u2019s patents and the jury awarded $2.1B in damages.\n\nTL;DR : Google stole tech from Netlist, lied about it, and then lost a 10-year legal battle. They have been ordered to pay, and this call is getting the ball rolling on the original lawsuit to address this. SK Hynix has also been found to be using NLST patented technology, though they are still going through appeals with actionable items scheduled already in 2021\n\nThis. Is. Big.  Feel free to also peruse the earnings call\n\nhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4410579-netlist-inc-nlst-ceo-chuck-hong-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript\n\n\nALL of this is separate from the fact that Netlist has beaten earnings the past two quarters and added 5 more patents to their repertoire in 2020, all while being dragged down in these legal proceedings and unable to realize their legally owed dues until this is over. They continue to shift the tech space while being bogged down.  Imagine what they can do when they get their proper payday...\n\nAnyway, I certainly like the stock. Please feel free to poke holes in this or point out any blind spots.  This is mainly weighing on their legal win and brilliance of the tech, but I think the company is incredibly undervalued because of *all* of the above factors dragging down the stock.\n\nedit : oops. I somehow added a 6 in the title. The 6th is actually July 6, for the HK Skynix stuff in TX court",

        "selftext": "GSAT (Globalstar) is the future of Satellite Communications (GPS) and 5G PT $6.60 2021, $10-15 2022 Here's why: Compare the 5G demand to Straight Path Communications in 2017. There was a vicious bidding war between Verizon and AT&amp;T to acquire the next big 5G telecommunications company, StraightPath. I'm here to tell you history is going to repeat itself in GSAT.\n\n\"Globalstar, Inc. provides mobile satellite services worldwide. The company offers duplex two-way voice and data products, including mobile voice and data satellite communications services and equipment for remote business continuity, recreational usage, safety, emergency preparedness and response, and other applications; fixed voice and data satellite communications services and equipment at industrial, commercial, and residential sites, as well as rural villages and ships; and satellite data modem services comprising asynchronous and packet data services. It also provides SPOT consumer retail products, such as SPOT satellite GPS messenger for personal tracking, emergency location, and messaging solutions; and SPOT Trace, an anti-theft and asset tracking device. In addition, the company offers commercial Internet of Things one-way transmission products to track cargo containers and rail cars, as well as to monitor utility meters, and oil and gas assets. Further, it sells wholesale minutes to independent gateway operators (IGOs); and provides engineering services, such as hardware and software designs to develop specific applications; and installation of gateways and antennas.\"\n\nMarketplace: 5G is clearly the future of many industries. Autonomous cars (EV), Cellular, Energy, Agriculture, etc all willsoonrelyon5Gstructuredcommunications. GSATencompassesallofthese. The 5G market alone is expected to be worth over 667 Billion dollars in 5 years. This is not even including the EV space, which relies heavily on secure communications (aka GSAT) The Market is setup for a dominant, trusted company like GSAT to overtake.\n\nLeadership:\n\nDavid Kagan Chief Executive Officer David Kagan currently serves as CEO of Globalstar. Prior to re-joining Globalstar as President and COO in December 2017, Kagan was the COO of SpeedCast International Limited. He served as President of ITC Global, a premier global VSAT satellite services provider from August 2014 through September 2015. He was also the President and CEO of Globe Wireless from June 2011 through January 2014 when it was sold to Inmarsat PLC.\n\nL. Barbee Ponder IV General Counsel and Vice President of Regulatory Mr. Ponder has previously served as Senior Regulatory Counsel for BellSouth Corporation in Washington, D.C. where he provided representation before the Federal Communications Commission, Congress and the White House on issues concerning 1996\n\nTelecommunications Act, deregulation of broadband services and tax issues concerning the telecommunications industry. Guys...This man worked for the FCC on the telecommunications act in 1996. He knows the regulations and rules behind telecom industry (5G).\n\nTechnology, Current Contracts Band53 technology created by GSAT is being used by companies like Nokia and recently Qualcomm. From a press release: \"Globalstar has worked to develop the Band 53 ecosystem with a group of priority partners like Nokia. Globalstar\u2019s Band 53 is a prime mid-band spectrum resource that we offer to our partners for deployment with customers that otherwise would not have access to the benefits of licensed spectrum. The combination of Nokia\u2019s global reach and Globalstar\u2019s Band 53 terrestrial authorizations in multiple countries around the globe present an exciting opportunity for secure wireless solutions.\" This technology is the absolute future of secure 5G connections in not only telecommunications, but also in the EV landscape. Yes you heard it right, GSAT already uses their technology in auto makers such as Fiat Chrysler and Jeep. GSAT has the technology to jump fully into the connected car market, especially the ever poipular EV connected car market. GSAT owns 24 ground stations that serve as points between satellites and over 120 countries. The reach is already there. They are only limited by which contracts they will inevitably pick up. See: Nokia, Jeep, Qualcomm. (So far)\n\nFuture Growth With the world becoming ever more connected, these smaller but established companies are just waiting to boom. Every partnership that GSAT sees can increase its cap 2-3 fold. Just a basic true evaluation by some analysts see GSAT worth 9.25 Billion (pre Qualcomm deal) which puts them at $6.60 a share at current valuations! If you don't believe me, go look at what Nokia has said about their partnership with Globalstar: https://investors.globalstar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/globalstar-announces-nokia-deployment-over-licensed-band-53-port",

        "selftext": "Source: [agniresearch.substack.com](https://agniresearch.substack.com)\n\n**THESIS**\n\nNote: This is outside our normal focus on biotech stocks. A member of another forum we are part of brought this stock to our attention. We got interested in the stock for its strong risk-reward profile. Netlist (OTC: NLST) is suing several large manufacturers of server memory products for infringement of its patents. Most notably, Google, SK Hynix, and Inphi.\n\n**RESEARCH**\n\nThis is straight from the investor portion of Netlist\u2019s website describing the company\u2019s mission: Netlist provides high-performance SSDs and modular memory subsystems to enterprise customers in diverse industries. The Company's NVMe SSD portfolio provides industry-leading performance offered in multiple capacities and form factors. HybriDIMM, Netlist's next-generation storage class memory product, addresses the growing need for real-time analytics in Big Data applications, in-memory databases, high-performance computing and advanced data storage solutions. Netlist also manufactures a line of specialty and legacy memory products to storage customers, appliance customers, system builders and cloud and datacenter customers. ***Netlist holds a portfolio of patents in the areas of server memory, hybrid memory, storage class memory, rank multiplication and load reduction.***\n\nNetlist has been in litigation with Google since 2009 over allegations that Google infringed upon Netlist\u2019s seminal 912 patent. It is a hardware patent for processing commands in an LRDIMM memory module using rank multiplication. Google signed an NDA to take a look at it. It passed on using the technology described in the patent. Netlist alleges that Google infringed the patent by building servers using the 912 patent technology. Netlist sued Google on December 2009 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. The judge in the case ordered a random cross section of servers to be examined which showed that Google indeed was using technology described in the 912 patent. Google then asserted that the patent was invalid. In 2010 Google requested an Inter Partes Reexamination of the 912 patent by the USPTO\u2019s (United States Patent and Trademark Office) PTAB (Patent Trial and Appeal Board). While the reexamination was going on the Northern District Court granted a joint request made by both companies to stay the 912 patent infringement lawsuit until the USPTO made its findings. On January 2019 the PTAB upheld the validity of Netlist\u2019s 912 patent. In April 2019 Google appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In June 2020 the US Court of Appeals upheld the PTAB\u2019s decision on the validity of the 912 patent. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic Google was granted a 6 month extension to decide if it wanted to appeal this decision to the United States Supreme Court. Google did not choose to appeal. On February 16, 2021 Netlist moved to lift the stay in the Northern District of California so the patent infringement lawsuit could continue. The Court granted the request and ordered that both Netlist and Google shall appear for a telephone Case Management Conference on March 11, 2021. At least 7 calendar days prior to the conference, the parties shall meet and confer and file a Joint Case Management Conference Settlement that sets forth the status of the case and proposes a schedule.\n\nSo why is the 912 patent a big deal? It is a seminal patent. A seminal patent is defined as a patent that describes ***an invention so impactful that it creates or shifts the technology space***. Netlist believes that the teachings of the 912 patent can be found in various DDR3 and DDR4 server DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Module) as well as future products that will be produced under the DDR5 server DIMM standards currently being established by the industry. Furthermore, Netlist asserts that the 912 patent enabled Google to build servers with high capacity and rapid memory that allowed said servers to store an entire Oracle database in memory which allowed lightning fast search results. The 912 patent played a large part in Google\u2019s dominance in search. Right now, it is not a question whether Google infringed the 912 patent. That has already been established. Now, Google is at the stage where it can settle with Netlist or go to a jury trial to determine damages. As for the damages, Netlist will most likely use a hedonic pricing model to determine the damages. Hedonic pricing looks at both the product itself (internal factors) and the environment (external factors) in determining pricing. In this case Netlist will argue that the 912 patent established Google\u2019s dominance in search, which allowed monopolist profits that funded Google\u2019s entire ecosystem. While at the same time, Google\u2019s infringement of the patent prevented Netlist from establishing itself in the server memory marketplace. Netlist will most likely seek billions in damages. Also, the prospect of treble damages is in play as Netlist will allege ***willful infringement*** on Google\u2019s part. The most likely scenario is Google will settle the case rather than risk going in front of a jury. A settlement would include a large lump sum plus licensing of the patent going forward.\n\nNetlist also sued Inphi for infringement of the 912 patent in the US District Court for the Central District of California. That case was also stayed pending the Court of Appeals decision, and now that the 912 patent was upheld it is expected Netlist will resume court proceedings once it is finished with the Google case.\n\nOn March 2020 Netlist filed a patent infringement lawsuit against SK Hynix in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas based on the infringement of Netlist\u2019s 218, 523, and 595 patents in SK Hynix\u2019s RDIMM and LRDIMM server memory products. SK Hynix petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (\u201cCAFC\u201d) to change the venue from Texas to California. This petition was denied and the case will be tried in Texas. The Markman hearing was set for March 4, 2021 with Jury trial set for July 6, 2021. The Western District of Texas is notorious for being very pro-patent holder friendly. Recently, on March 2, 2021 in this very same court under the same judge that will be preceding over the Netlist case, Intel was found guilty of infringing on two of VSLI\u2019s patents and the jury awarded $2.1B in damages.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nWe don\u2019t claim to be an expert on Netlist\u2019s product portfolio and its prospect for success selling its products to the market. We are a shareholder for the short term prospects of major patent wins against giants such as Google, SK Hynix, Inphi (for now) and many more (in the future). We anticipate that once Netlist either settles or wins cases against these three defendants other infringers will quickly move to settle. ***Netlist will have established itself as a necessary licensor for pretty much any high speed server memory product***, much like Qualcomm did with its patents in cellular technology.\n\nWe see Netlist becoming a very lucrative gatekeeper. The shares are still greatly underpriced at $1.50 as of March 2, 2021, but that won\u2019t last long as the market becomes aware of Netlist and its strong position in the lawsuits it is currently engaged in. Large settlements or jury awards will quickly drive the share price up as the market cap currently is only roughly $300M. There is also a poison pill set in place at the price of $6.56 which would come into play in the event of a hostile takeover attempt. Even though Netlist finds itself in a strong legal position, remember that this is still a speculative microcap stock.\n\n**Disclosure:**\u00a0I am/we are long NLST.\u00a0I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

        "selftext": "Hi all, long time lurker here and I've found this subreddit to be tremendously useful!  With the recent tech stock beatdown, here are some of the stocks I am eyeing and looking to buy: \n\n- Corsair (CRSR) : had stellar earnings and they make fantastic products in the gaming and PC hardware space.  They're making good acquisitions in the streaming space.  \n\n- Salesforce (CRM) : another solid company that has taken a big beating for no apparent reason.  They recently acquired Slack and I dont see any other competitor being remotely close in the CRM space. \n\n- Square (SQ): revolutionizing payments for small businesses and making key moves in the crypto space.  \n\n- Cloudflare (NET): yet to turn profitable but a great tech company that is growing rapidly. \n\n- Snowflake (SNOW): another tech company that was overvalued upon IPO and climbed all the way to $429 before being brought back to earth.  Currently trading at  $213\n\n- Costco (COST): solid company that has a loyal following and great business model.  \n\n- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM): market leader in chip manufacturing and with the current shortage in chips,  their future looks great. \n\n- Teladoc (TDOC): one of the big companies in the telemedicine space that should thrive in the post covid world as more patients want the convenience of seeing their doctor from the comfort of their own home. \n\n- Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY): pharma giant that made key acquisitions recently (Celgene and Myokardia) that should boost their pipeline and revenue.  Also pays good dividend. \n\n- Facebook (FB) : social media giant that isn't going away anytime soon.  Would be interesting to see how they leverage Oculus to boost their revenue.  \n\n- CVS (CVS) : pharmacy giant that should get a boost from covid vaccine rollout and their new in-house clinics. \n\n- Tattooed Chef (TTCF): fast growing company in the plant based protein and healthy frozen foods space.  They have products in almost all major retailers and are rapidly expanding.  \n\n- Nvidia (NVDA): leader in GPU space and a tech giant.  \n\n- Palantir (PLTR): big data company with a revolutionary product that is just getting started.  \n\n- Qualcomm (QCOM): makes chips for phones and are well established for the 5G Era\n\n- American Tower Corp (AMT): they make/ rent out cell signal towers and should benefit from the move to 5G\n\n- Planet13 Holdings (PLNHF): they make giant superstores for Marijuana sale and are set to have their own brand of products \n\nOf course I would also add Apple, Visa, Microsoft, and Amazon if they dipped enough. \n\nWhat stocks did I miss?  Are there any others you would suggest keeping an eye on during the recent sell-off?  Thank you!",

        "selftext": "Hey All, each Sunday, I plan to pick 5 stocks from ARK\u2019s funds that are most attractive from a fundamental perspective (i.e. growth rates, margins, valuation). I'm doing this for myself so thought it'd be helpful to share with others before trading begins on Mondays.\n\nPlanning to do this for the Innovation (ARKK) fund today, then the autonomous tech next week, then next gen internet, then fintech before the whole cycle repeats. (Unless it turns out that there\u2019s no interest in this, then I\u2019ll stop posting). \n\n**Why ARK?**\n\n* Though ARK\u2019s strategy can be seen as overhyped and controversial, what I do like about the fund is that they are growth-focused with an [internal annual hurdle rate of 15%](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/Marketing_Material/ARKInvest_122019_ESG-Policy.pdf) based on a 5-year time horizon \n* But, I think ARK tends to be on the optimistic end of the spectrum and sometimes ***too***\u00a0**tolerant of overly stretched valuations** \n* As a result, I\u2019m hoping to give you the **best of both worlds: high growth stock picks at the most attractive prices,** all by using ARK\u2019s ETF picks as a filter for vetted, high-growth companies\u00a0 \n   * To be clear, I\u2019m not saying ARK\u2019s picks are all bulletproof. Just using the fund\u2019s picks since they have a much bigger research team and resources than an individual investor such as myself, so **think of this post as a potential** ***starting point***\u00a0**for more research** \n\n**My Process &amp; Selection Criteria**\n\n* First of all,\u00a0I\u2019ll be excluding all non-tech stocks in my analysis because I personally like to focus on tech. Including healthcare stocks (which pretty much are what the non-tech stocks are) ruins the metric comparisons given the differences in industries.\n* My process was pretty simple. Downloaded all the tickers from ARK, pulled data from wallmine or went through filings myself. As a result, there may be some slight discrepancies from the data you use and mine but they should be around the same ballpark.\n* Next, my **selection criteria,** which will I\u2019ll likely change over time each week. Today the ones I\u2019m using include the following (data sourced from wallmine and filings): \n   * **Trading at less than 70% of the 52 week high** \\- provides context around market sentiment \n   * **Greater than 25% LTM revenue growth** \\- guide for the future \n   * **Greater than 60% LTM gross margins** \\- operational efficiency \n   * **LTM cash flow positive** \\- operational efficiency \n   * **LTM Revenue multiple of less than 15x** \\- valuation \n* Given that the market is a bit bearish right now and punishing stocks with stretched valuations, I\u2019m heavily weighting the valuation criteria as you\u2019ll see soon \n\n**The Top 5 Picks of the Week**\n\n* **2U - a leading edtech company**\n   * 52 week high discount: 41% \n   * LTM revenue growth: 34% \n   * LTM gross margins: 71% \n   * LTM cash flow positive: 0% \n   * EV / LTM revenue: 3.3x \n   * Commentary: Most software companies are trading 20-30x with these types of fundamentals, so based on the valuation, 2U seems very promising \n* **Baidu - a Chinese AI and internet conglomerate**\n   * 52 week high discount: 26% \n   * LTM revenue growth: 46% \n   * LTM gross margins: 48% \n   * LTM cash flow positive: 33% \n   * EV / LTM revenue: 4.7x \n   * Commentary: Really great financial figures and super low revenue multiple, but do keep in mind that there\u2019s always heightened risk when investing in Chinese companies \n* **PagerDuty - an incident response software company**\n   * 52 week high discount: 36% \n   * LTM revenue growth: 27% \n   * LTM gross margins: 87% \n   * LTM cash flow positive: (35%) \n   * EV / LTM revenue: 13.1x \n   * Commentary: The company is in its growing phase so that\u2019s why I\u2019m forgiving of its negative 35% free cash flow margin and a 13.1x revenue\u00a0multiple seems very fair for this kind of financial profile for a software company. Keep in mind these are EV / LTM revenue multiples, so this multiple is even lower for NTM but I just don\u2019t have that data. \n* **Teradyne - a test\u00a0equipment manufacturing company whose customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, and more**\n   * 52 week high discount: 23% \n   * LTM revenue growth: 34% \n   * LTM gross margins: 57% \n   * LTM cash flow positive: 29% \n   * EV / LTM revenue: 5.8x \n   * Commentary: Based on the growth rate, margins, and valuation, seems like a bargain \n* **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company - primarily makes chips**\n   * 52 week high discount: 15% \n   * LTM revenue growth: 33% \n   * LTM gross margins: 53% \n   * LTM cash flow positive: 29% \n   * EV / LTM revenue: 11.4x \n   * Commentary: The company isn\u2019t trading at much of a discount relative to the others at 85% but I chose this company because there has been some news I came across recently of a chip shortage,\u00a0which means there is incredible demand for TSMC\u2019s products",

        "selftext": "In some cases like Sony or Blizzard it made the stocks good buys that you could comfortably keep as blue chippers to rise in the future since they are priced right. In other cases like Qualcomm and AMD I believe it made them great buys since they are severely undervalued but you have to watch out not every company that dipped is a must buy. Take Tesla for example that lost more than 36% of value in just a month when it was at 880 or Square that lost 27% since last month and is now at 201. Considering their financials it still feels like they might keep dipping because you are buying their financials not just the company. If Tesla has a P/E ratio of over 800 with 0.63 EPS and only 31 Billion in revenue that doesn't scream like a 1000$ stock more so 250-300 so watch out when just looking at pricing history and making a buying decision purely based on that.",

        "selftext": "I know I'm late to the party but I want to add my 2 cents. Also, I know this isn't GME, AMC, RKT but f\\*\\*k it.\n\n\\### Introduction:\n\nTanger Factory Outlet Centers is a leading operator of open-air upscale outlet shopping centers that owns, or has an ownership interest in, a portfolio of 38 centers. Tanger's operating properties are located in 20 states and in Canada, totaling approximately 14.1 million square feet, leased to over 2,700 stores operated by more than 500 different brand name companies. The Company has more than 39 years of experience in the outlet industry and is a publicly-traded REIT. Tanger is furnishing a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") that includes a supplemental information package for the quarter ended September 30, 2020.\n\n\\### Why is it an amazing opportunity?\n\nI believe there are several catalysts that make SKT great.\n\n1)Texas and others are starting to re-open. Covid has affected business for SKT in 2020, but Texas has just announced they are reopening and lifting the mask requirement. Other states and cities are following. This is great for business for Tanger.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/us/coronavirus-reopening-texas.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/us/coronavirus-reopening-texas.html)\n\n2) SKT is heavily shorted. There is data from multiple sources showing various amounts of short interest, but one thing is for certain; SKT is heavily shorted. Short sellers think they have dodged a bullet for now, but if we work together we can make this squeeze.\n\n[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401937-reits-getting-short-squeezed](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401937-reits-getting-short-squeezed)\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/25/1-real-estate-stock-with-even-higher-short-interes/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/25/1-real-estate-stock-with-even-higher-short-interes/)\n\n3) Positive news in latest earnings report. Under the operational updates section, they stated that over 99% of total occupied stores are open as of January 31, 2021. The trend followed throughout the year goes as followed.\n\nApril = 1% --&gt; May =18% --&gt; June = 56% --&gt; July 95% --&gt; January 2021 = &gt;99%\n\nAs you can see, SKT is back to fully operational as mandates were lifted throughout the year.\n\nIn addition to being fully operational now, they also managed to beat estimates for Q3 and Q4 of 2020 even with the Covid pandemic happening. This is an amazing feat and shows the company is resilient and is run properly.\n\n[https://s25.q4cdn.com/152538475/files/Earnings\\_Upload/Q42020/Q4-2020-PRESENTATION-FINAL.pdf](https://s25.q4cdn.com/152538475/files/Earnings_Upload/Q42020/Q4-2020-PRESENTATION-FINAL.pdf)\n\n4) Small market cap. SKT's market cap is 1.5B. In terms of \"moving the needle\" for a potential squeeze this is great news! I like the stock, but I also hope that you like it too.\n\n5) Excellent dividend returns. $SKT pays an excellent dividend per share. Currently it's paying .71 a share which is 4.41% returns at it's current price just for holding shares! For comparison, Qualcomm and Microsoft are known to be good dividend stocks, but they only pay out 1.9% and .96% per share respectively.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI bought in late today. We'll see how it goes, but I do truly believe this can be a great play. If RKT can do what it did with a 50B dollar market cap, I would love to see what a \"squeeze\" would look like with a company at 1.5B.",

There has been some movement by world leaders to improve supply chains in order to get the semiconductors to the place they need to be. Some car manufacturers have had to cut production in vehicles due to this ongoing issue. I believe this issue will be fixed in due time, but probably not in the immediate future. \n\n**What is SOXL?**\n\n**SOXL** is a Leveraged ETF that invests in the biggest semiconductor manufacturers in the world (INTC, AMD, QCOM, TSM, etc). \n\nBe careful, this is a \"Leveraged\" ETF - and therefore it's rather aggressive and aiming for high returns. Do some more research here if you want. Essentially it means, if the sector of semiconductors does well, the fund will do well. \n\n**Breakdown:**\n\nNow, they recently had a 15:1 split on their shares, which were trading at about $636 in February. This brought the public float to **99.40M.**\n\nWhen looking into a company, I like to start with what they own, followed by who owns them.\n\n**What they own:**\n\nHere is a breakdown of the assets that SOXL owns with their 1.46bn market cap:\n\nDreyfus Government Cash Management Institutional Shs\t11.00%\n\nFinancial Square Treasury Instruments Fund FST Shares\t9.39%\n\nBroadcom Inc.\t5.22%\n\nQualcomm Inc.\t4.96%\n\nIntel Corp.\t4.94%\n\nTexas Instruments Inc.\t4.88%\n\nNVIDIA \t4.67%\n\nMicron Technology Inc.\t2.81%\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. ADR\tTSM\t2.69%\n\nAnalog Devices Inc.\t2.54%\n\nApplied Materials Inc.\t2.51%\n\nLam Research Corp.\t2.50%\n\nKLA Corp.\t2.41%\n\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.\t2.40%\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc.\t2.37%\n\nASML Holding N.V.\t2.22%\n\nMicrochip Technology Inc.\t2.16%\n\nXilinx Inc.\t2.01%\t\n\nMarvell Technology Group Ltd.\t1.92%\n\nSkyworks Solutions Inc.\t1.53%\n\nTeradyne Inc.\t1.20%\n\nQorvo Inc.\t1.14%\n\nMonolithic Power Systems MPWR\t0.99%\n\nON Semiconductor Corp.\t0.81%\n\nEntegris Inc.\t0.78%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now, I'm not sure what the first two are, but that throws up a potential flag.** These two entities represent nearly 20% of the portfolio owned. It could be nothing more than some type of government investment in such a company, as it is critical right now. \n\n**Who owns them?:**\n\nLooks like mostly hedge funds. No one really of note other than Citadel and Susquehanna. \n\n**Short Interest:**\n\nNot a heavily shorted stock. About 3.4m shares are available to short with a ratio of about 25%.\n\n**Technicals** (got me excited):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7ndly6se1m61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=698eae9b1d4ff4726eac546d2a6a8f4bb753fbc6\n\nHere we have a bounce just under the (white) 200sma. On this 4h chart, the bottom represents the buy/sell volume over time. the middle represents where we're at in terms of a squeeze. You also can see heavy buy volume at the bottom followed by a potential turn up ahead in the next few days. TONS of buy volume since the beginning of the month. \n\nThe daily was also looking nice:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/id2j5879f1m61.png?width=452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23cbb6a2b7af021cadc9d35a9d2f8413c636cb90\n\nThere is an AIM on the indicator, meaning at this point the next logical step might be a shot to the upside in the next week. There was heavy call and put volume on the $37 strike, which seemed quite coincidental. Why that level? There were more calls than puts. The OI is still over 10k on the option. \n\nMy target is $42 by 3/19. But I encourage you to do your own analysis and come up with your own targets. I happen to think this is a good potential trade. I think in this case, the probability in my belief is to the upside.",
