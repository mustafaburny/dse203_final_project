        "selftext": "Transcript of earnings call published today -Bill Foley: \"BFT, which is we've now gone through, we just finished our third round  of comments on BFT, we're hopeful that we'll be going effective with the  SEC sometime in the next 10 days or so. And then the shareholders the  proxy we file we go through the shareholder vote and we will de-SPAC.\n\n\"In  our target date, for that if we hit our milestones, and who knows,  sometimes you get hung up on various things, Paysafe should be or BFT  should be de-SPAC sometime before the 31st of March.\"\n\nFoley describes Paysafe and Alight as, \"examples of companies that  serve multi trillion dollar industries, which offer tremendous potential  for future growth through continued scale and transformation led by  technology initiatives.\"\n\n\"We are confident in our approach to  sourcing transactions, demonstrating our discipline, value-based  approach, which we believe ultimately delivers superior long-term  returns to our shareholders over market cycle.\"\n\nSome highlights on BFT/Payafe for those unaware:\n\n\u2022 Proprietary scalable electronic payment platform used by Draftkings, Roblox, Youtube, Coinbase, Visa, Fortnight, Amazon, ApplePay, Twitch, Microsoft, Xbox, Spotify, Amelco, William Hill, Golden Nugget, Ceasar\u2019s Entertainment, Betfair, PayLease, Vanilla Direct, MindBody, ESL Gaming, Luckbox etc.\n\n\u2022 $1.5Billion revenue / $103Billion transactional volume (2021E)\n\n\u2022 $560 Million EBITDA (2021E) \u201cforecast to rise significantly by 2023. Its projections show $744 million in adjusted EBITDA on 2023 revenue of $1.881 billion. That represents an EBITDA margin of 39.55%.\u201d (21% CAGR)\n\n\u2022 10-15X growth projected in iGaming (currently 34% Paysafe revenue). US iGaming continues to be legalized state by state, growing revenue by 234% in just the last year. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Recently launched Paysafecash in US. Now in 40 currencies and 30 global markets for easier cross border payments\n\n\u2022 Enabled for cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Ether, Litecoin, EOS, XLM, XRP etc.)\n\n\u2022 Paysafe owns Openbucks, Neteller and Skrill, 2019 winner \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for best consumer take up and most innovative technology with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems\u201d. \u201cDigital wallet and mobile payments operator Skrill, part of Paysafe Group, has also enabled an instant crypto-to-crypto feature. Skrill users no longer have to convert their crypto holdings back into fiat currencies before buying another cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Highly differentiated B2B and B2C global network\n\n\u2022 Strong 80% adj. cash conversion business model with no significant capex or balance sheet requirements\n\n\u2022 2017-2019 revenue grew from $800 Million to $1.4Billion (27%CAGR- including impact of acquisitions)\n\n\u2022 2019 Gross profit of $909 million (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n\n\u2022 High profit margins with significant operating leverage. (Adj. EBITDA margins above 30% with path to 35%+) Expanding margin projections offers flexibility and plays into Bill Foley\u2019s strength of pursuing inorganic growth.\n\n\u2022 Merger deal eliminates 2/3 debt, leaving increased margins and strong cash buffer for Foley to initiate M&amp;A plans\n\n\u2022 Bill Foley, who drove value creation in Fidelity National Information Services from $2.5Billion MC to over $91Billion, says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Foley, a sophisticated dealmaker known for under-promising and over-performing, has led five separate multi-billion dollar public market platforms to complete over 100 acquisitions. In just the last five years, Foley and his team have grown Ceridian from $4.2B to $14B, Dun &amp; Bradstreet from $2B to $11.3B and Black Knight from $1.6B to $14B.  Foley\u2019s consistent M&amp;A track record in generating synergistic growth indicates Paysafe\u2019s current growth projections are conservative. Foley and his investors also own a large portion of SPAC shares which aligns his motives with the common retail shareholder. Foley says Paysafe may be his \u201cbest investment ever.\u201d\n\n\u2022 CNBC Pundit coverage: Steve Grasso says BFT will triple. \u201c$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there\" \u201cBFT. It\u2019s the most excited I\u2019ve been about a stock in a long time. I\u2019m looking for a triple and I think I\u2019m going to get it.\u201d   Cramer calls BFT/Paysafe \u201cterrific\u201d, \u201csmart\u201d with \u201cgood bloodlines.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Paysafe price targets based on recent EV/EBITDA ratios of sector peers :\n\n    \u2043 Nuvei : 54x &gt; Paysafe = $42\n    \n    \u2043 PayPal : 59x &gt; Paysafe = $45\n    \n    \u2043 Shift : 39x &gt; Paysafe = $30\n    \n    \u2043 Repay : 77x &gt; Paysafe = $60\n    \n    \u2043 Affirm: 89x &gt; Paysafe = $69\n    \n    \u2043 Square : 218x &gt; Paysafe = $169\n\nPost-merger analysts\u2019 12 months price targets will look to 2022-23 projections with 35% higher EBITDA sending fair valuations higher.  Combine this with the type of inorganic growth potential represented by Foley\u2019s track record along with the fact that most institutions can only invest once the merger is complete and you start to get a sense of how far this can run.\n\n\u25aa Bill Foley, Chairman of the Board Fidelity:\n\n    \"Whether it\u2019s a lottery or slot machines or sportsbetting opening in a state, it\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate. We\u2019re focusing on gaming, particularly sportsbetting, in the United States as it becomes legal and we\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d - \u201cI have a vision that we should be the \\\\\\[digital\\\\\\] wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody. That\u2019s why I got so excited about Paysafe Group Holdings Limited as its position in iGaming is really second to none.\n    \n    Paysafe has an attractive combination of payment assets including a leading digital wallet platform in Skrill, one of the fastest growing eCash businesses, and a merchant business focused on high growth vertical markets\u2026We believe we can further enhance Paysafe\u2019s growth trajectory through accelerated operational transformation and M&amp;A, enabled by our de-levered balance sheet. Paysafe delivers a unique value proposition in large and high-growth markets, such as gaming and e-commerce, enabling the company to generate strong organic revenue growth and margin expansion. With a proven strategy and an experienced management team and our newly formed partnership, we believe Paysafe has significant long-term growth potential\u2026We have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise.\u201d",
