        "selftext": "This SPAC has not garnered much hype after DA was announced on 30 Nov last year. Now that we are in Q1 of 2021 and approaching the merger date in roughly 2 months time, the share price has been steadily advancing. I think that the current share price of $12.6 still presents a rather good risk-return profile in the short term to enter, mainly riding on the green energy wave. I have presented 2 plays for this SPAC at the bottom of this DD.\n\nMost have downplayed this SPAC due to its high valuation of $1.6B for just being a window company (non-EV) especially in a period where commercial real estate is taking a hit due to the pandemic. But I think precisely this is a good time to invest for the long term before the next boom. We might also have overlooked certain secular trends in motion that can provide some serious tailwind for this company. Now taking a deep dive into the company:\n\n# The Product\n\n&gt;\"View is the market leader in next-generation smart windows that use artificial intelligence and machine learning which will tint the glass to optimize natural light while controlling heat and glare, effectively eliminating the need for blinds/shades in the room. The smart glass enhances mental and physical well-being for occupants, creating smart connected buildings which reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\"\n\nBasically, they are the next-era windows maker for smart buildings. Think of your standard run-of-the-mill window glass panes. If you live in a tropical climate or countries with high sunlight hours, you would know that having a window seat in the noon is extremely uncomfortable and glaring. Even if the the blinds/shades were drawn down, the air-conditioning will still have to work extra hard to maintain the same room temp. By doing so, the building's energy consumption is higher = higher green house emission.\n\n*Processing img kz6m8gsggqa61...*\n\nWhat if you had a smart dynamic glass installed which will automatically tint the windows by tracking the Sun's trajectory? Aside from the glare protection from the tinting, the temperature in the room is also effectively maintained by blocking out solar heat, so the HVAC does not have to work overtime. What if this glass panel can also act as a transparent HD display for a suite of immersive work experiences?\n\nThe building window glass market is huge, having a $120 billion TAM in North America alone, and $1.2 trillion TAM in global glass consumption. Smart buildings are perhaps the key to the future of urban planning, due to the push for green innovation in smart cities that has gained momentum and will continue to do so under Biden's administration.\n\n**ESG/Green Wave**\n\nBiden administration clean energy plan to tackle climate change resulted in the rally of green/energy stocks recently. Tailwind can be expected from the green wave for View Inc. since their dynamic glass will help buildings attain **LEED certification** to become more energy efficient with the growing requirements from regulators in US and rising importance of ESG globally. View Inc. can help buildings reduce overall energy consumption and green house emission through **20% reduction in HVAC &amp; lighting consumption, with 10% overall peak energy reduction**.\n\n# Analysis of Product\n\n**1) Suite of Services -** They are not just a smart windows maker, but essentially a tech play as well. They have launched their suite of services in 2020 to complement the Smart Glass, comprising:\n\n1. *View Net* \\- Provides bandwidth power and data network that is the backbone to an intelligent building platform\n2. *View Immersive Experience* \\- Transparent see-through HD display on the window that is fully interactive with touchscreen capabilities.\n3. *View Sense* \\- Modules that provide the ability to measure and optimise light, humidity, temperature, air quality that cater to the well-being of occupants inside the building.\n\n[Transparent HD Display with 5G Network](https://preview.redd.it/ejqf6ukreqa61.png?width=1256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11729adffcdff43f94f7349d4c5909bed32347e6)\n\nWhat I like about the product is that its very modular and customisable. For the basic package you can just have the dynamic smart glass installed, with just the tinting capabilities. However, the infrastructure for other capabilities is already installed after the initial set up, which customers can choose to add on different modules (e.g. sensors/displays) and customise it based on their needs. This effectively sets up for repeat businesses.\n\n**2) Longevity** \\-You may be wondering about the longevity of their smart windows, since functionality will never be given due consideration if the product is shitty and fails to withstand the weather/time/pressure. If the smart windows are treated like consumables with the need to replace/maintain every few years, it will never be scalable. You may hear it from the CEO himself on how their team initially conceptualise the product and build it around a fundamental principle in mind - longevity. Therefore, the lifespan is similar to standard window glass with over **40-50 years of lifespan**.\n\nVideo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MaF21GtUcg&amp;ab\\_channel=GreenBiz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MaF21GtUcg&amp;ab_channel=GreenBiz) (watch from 12:30 onwards)\n\n**3) Durability -** Another point about why View Inc. glass is more durable than than other dynamic smart windows is because they are using an **inorganic ceramic material** as the nano-coating layer instead of organic material, which is the current industry norm. Even though organic material is cheaper to engineer, resulting in a cheaper product for their end clients, but the coating will be degraded by the heat from the sun which will make it less durable over time.\n\n**4) Market share** \\- Currently, they are leading the market with over 80% market share. In terms of economic moat, they have over **1k patents** (600+ currently, 300+ filed). This is a proprietary tech and after 12 years of R&amp;D, I think that they will be able to fairly sustain a huge competitive advantage over many other competitors, and effectively creating a high barrier to entry for new entrants due to the sheer amount of patents they possess.\n\n**5) Pricing &amp; Revenue** \\- Current revenue as of 2020 stands at around $31m with over $560m in  backlog orders (LOI signed). Although their dynamic window glasses cost upward of 50% more than standard window glasses, I think it's a highly differentiated product in which building owners can eventually charge a premium on rental leases = resulting in higher leasing revenues for them. One success case story is Civica Cherry Creek, an office building in Denver has managed to achieve the highest weighted average rental rates out of any office buildings in Denver city after switching to View's glass.\n\nOf course, I anticipate a huge inertia in the beginning where the mass market will put up resistance to adopt this product. However, overtime, combining the economies of scale in their factories to bring down production costs (higher gross margins) and rising demand globally arising from a proven track record, I can foresee exponential growth for this company in the long term. They are expecting revenue growths to be around 127% CAGR over the next 5 years, which I personally think it's possible but the exponential growth will not happen till 2023 onwards, since they need the initial two years for market entry into more markets/sectors.\n\n6) **Investors** \\- Early prominent VC funding include Corning and Softbank. However, I wish to point out that in recent SEC filings, **GIC Investment** (*Singapore state-owned sovereign fund, owned by the Government of Singapore*) initiated a 10% stake of $50 million in CFII last week, and an additional $200m PIPE investment today. Let me tell you why I'm so bullish about this. Singapore is a highly developed and urbanised country located in South-east Asia with a myriad of high-rise buildings/skyscrapers, tropical climate with plenty of sun activity all year round. Although N.A market is huge, but usually buildings in states with most sunlight activity e.g. California/Arizona will constitute the main bulk of customers. Let's imagine if the product is able to break into the Asia market, or even into South-east Asia with tropical climate zones, the revenues would be insane. GIC obviously conducted their DD as they won't screw around with state-owned money. They know the growth potential of this proprietary tech once this hits the market big time, and perhaps even a business arrangement to bring this product into Singapore? Other players will likely not stand a chance, with the exception of China.\n\n7) **Ability to scale**:\n\n* Current projects are only in the commercial space which has taken a huge hit due to the pandemic. With the ongoing trend in WFH, the residential market is essentially a cash cow for milking, especially against the backdrop of demand for healthy home working environment. In light of this, the CEO said in an interview that he has **already completed 50 residential projects** (this wasn't published as it's still in the works) and he is developing a product for residential market **this year** to target contemporary homes. LINK: [https://lookingbeyondwithmichaelsikand.fireside.fm/view](https://lookingbeyondwithmichaelsikand.fireside.fm/view) (from 10:45 onwards). The convergence of WFH trend and smart homes will definitely be a huge play, even more so than commercial. Does it reminds you of Netflix's Black Mirror? Transparent displays are certainly a sight to behold.\n\n*Processing img 908m94rkeqa61...*\n\n* Given the ubiquitous applications with glass, possibilities are not limited to just smart buildings. In fact, one really strong partnership with great potential would be to license the proprietary tech to EV car makers. **Incredible synergy can be found in the future of electric vehicle glass display**, where car window panels can function as a smart display with vehicle integration + auto tinting capabilities. In fact, the **entire transportation industry** could be disrupted by this tech, think of your Buses/Rails/Subway/Cruises and how smart glass display could reinvent the future of Advertisements in commercial transportation, and how fast would they jump on this bandwagon if they are able to monetise this new piece of glass.\n* Other uses across different sectors include the **hospitality industry** (airports, hotels, resorts) and **healthcare sector**, like hospital wards windows.\n\nFYI, they have piloted their product in 3 different US airports, namely SFO, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Boston airports.  After retrofitting their Smart Glass in the airports, results were rather stellar with an actual increase in concessionary sales, energy cost savings, as well as longer dwell time in such areas.\n\nCase study for DFO airport: [https://view.com/sites/default/files/documents/dfw-airport-dynamic-glass-pilot-research-study\\_0.pdf](https://view.com/sites/default/files/documents/dfw-airport-dynamic-glass-pilot-research-study_0.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bear Case/Downsides**\n\n* Glassdoor rating of company seems poor with management woes at the executive level, and there were reports of View Inc laying off their staff sometime in April 2020. I think that internal turmoil would be detrimental and could impede their growth in the future.\n* Current earnings of $31m in 2020 does not really justify the valuation of $1.6b (much speculation is on future growth potential).\n* They have a current minimum order of $1M, which will not sit well with smaller commercial buildings or residential market. This will result in them losing market share gradually to their smaller competitors who can cater to such clientele.\n* The biggest risk to their Intellectual Property is that it is not universal i.e. it does not have an international protection. Patents are territory rights, so even though their tech is protected in US, I expect proliferation of copy cats in other countries like \\*coughs\\* China. They may register for IP in China as well, but let's face it, its not exactly fool-proof and Chinese companies operate differently in China. Although there will be imitations, but I believe that View's level of R&amp;D is extremely strong after 12 years in operation. Other copy-cat Smart Glass companies would unlikely be able to achieve the same level of product as View, thus ensuring levels of product differentiation.\n\n**The Play**\n\nWith the merger expected to complete by Q1 of 2021 (2 months time), I expect CFII to pop closer to merger date based on the lifecycle of SPAC companies, perhaps in the $14-$15 range. But once it reaches ATH right before merger, it will probably be a good time to sell, as once post-merger happens and downside cap is removed, it will most likely fall below $10 or even lower as the industry is very CAPEX- intensive. In addition, I think that the commercial space is likely to remain sluggish in the near term, which will push the price further down. It will also likely burn more cash in the process, since you have to bear in mind that any new futuristic tech adoption is an extremely long and arduous process.\n\nRevolutionary tech like iPhones/Tesla did not pick up from the get-go after it was introduced to the market, and it took several years before they saw some real results. This is probably a good time to accumulate your positions while its being massively hated on, and believe in the conviction that 1) they are the market leader with a wide economic moat, &gt;1k patents and ability to scale up while bringing down costs. 2) secular ESG trend with Biden's green plan will provide good tailwind for the sector at least for the next 4+ years, in which their policies will likely benefit the industry. 3) multiple uses applications are HUGE with amazing potential for licensing/partnership plays in EV/hospitality/healthcare sectors. I have strong conviction in the long term that it is going to be a multi-bagger if you keep accumulating the dips post-merger.\n\n**TLDR**: In short, buy now for the pre-merger pop and sell right before merger. Following a post-merger sell-off, accumulate on the dip and ride on for the long term in the next few years.\n\n*Positions: Warrants @ $2.4*\n\nLink to investor presentation: [https://view.com/sites/default/files/documents/View-Investor-Presentation-High.pdf](https://view.com/sites/default/files/documents/View-Investor-Presentation-High.pdf)",

        "selftext": "An idea for those of you looking for a steady 12%+ unleveraged yield (the company is debt free) - I present vitreous glass. $vci.to \n\nThey just announced a 21 cent dividend (5% for the quarter) payable February 15th. \n\nWho are they? \n\nVitreous exclusively collects all of the waste glass from the Alberta Liquor Depot (slightly over 60k tons per year) and also buys smaller quantities from BC and Saskatchewan. Waste glass is transported via truck, which is then cleaned, crushed and sold as cullet to three fibreglass insulation manufacturers (two of which are large and have most of the market - Johns Manville/Schuller International Canada in Innisfail, and the Owens-Corning Fibreglass Canada plant in Edmonton), which use cullet as raw material in their production facilities. These three manufacturers produce ALL of the fibreglass building insulation made in Alberta; hence, demand for Vitreous' product is primarily driven by new-build real estate activity.\n\nThe real costs in raw materials are in shipping, which are significant. Despite most of Vitreous' glass being sourced locally, the cost of trucking transportation is estimated to be at least 3x the cost of just raw materials in COGS. However, the benefit of this low value-to-weight ratio, long-haul transportation is generally uneconomic and therefore the Company receives little competition from out of the province.

Smart buildings are perhaps the key to the future of urban planning, due to the push for green innovation in smart cities that has gained momentum and will continue to do so under Biden's administration.\n\n**E.S.G/Green Wave**\n\nBiden administration clean energy plan to tackle climate change resulted in the rally of green/energy stocks recently. Tailwind can be expected from the green wave for View Inc. since their dynamic glass will help buildings attain **LEED certification** to become more energy efficient with the growing requirements from regulators in US and rising importance of E.S.G globally. View Inc. can help buildings reduce overall energy consumption and green house emission through **20% reduction in HVAC &amp; lighting consumption, with 10% overall peak energy reduction**.\n\nAnalysis of Product\n\n**1) Suite of Services -** They are not just a smart windows maker, but essentially a tech play as well. They have launched their suite of services in 2020 to complement the Smart Glass, comprising:\n\n1. *View Net* \\- Provides bandwidth power and data network that is the backbone to an intelligent building platform\n2. *View Immersive Experience* \\- Transparent see-through HD display on the window that is fully interactive with touchscreen capabilities.\n3. *View Sense* \\- Modules that provide the ability to measure and optimise light, humidity, temperature, air quality that cater to the well-being of occupants inside the building.\n\n[Transparent HD Display with 5G Network](https://preview.redd.it/6j7ts22erqa61.png?width=1256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=954bb8d49c7d1df39a9739f05f4c2211d05bdf39)\n\nWhat I like about the product is that its very modular and customisable. For the basic package you can just have the dynamic smart glass installed, with just the tinting capabilities. However, the infrastructure for other capabilities is already installed after the initial set up, which customers can choose to add on different modules (e.g. sensors/displays) and customise it based on their needs. This effectively sets up for repeat businesses.\n\n**2) Longevity** \\-You may be wondering about the longevity of their smart windows, since functionality will never be given due consideration if the product is shitty and fails to withstand the weather/time/pressure. If the smart windows are treated like consumables with the need to replace/maintain every few years, it will never be scalable. You may hear it from the CEO himself on how their team initially conceptualise the product and build it around a fundamental principle in mind - longevity. Therefore, the lifespan is similar to standard window glass with over **40-50 years of lifespan**.\n\nVideo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MaF21GtUcg&amp;ab\\_channel=GreenBiz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MaF21GtUcg&amp;ab_channel=GreenBiz) (watch from 12:30 onwards)\n\n**3) Durability -** Another point about why View Inc. glass is more durable than than other dynamic smart windows is because they are using an **inorganic ceramic material** as the nano-coating layer instead of organic material, which is the current industry norm. Even though organic material is cheaper to engineer, resulting in a cheaper product for their end clients, but the coating will be degraded by the heat from the sun which will make it less durable over time.\n\n**4) Market share** \\- Currently, they are leading the market with over 80% market share. In terms of economic moat, they have over **1k patents** (600+ currently, 300+ filed). This is a proprietary tech and after 12 years of R&amp;D, I think that they will be able to fairly sustain a huge competitive advantage over many other competitors, and effectively creating a high barrier to entry for new entrants due to the sheer amount of patents they possess.\n\n**5) Pricing &amp; Revenue** \\- Current revenue as of 2020 stands at around $31m with over $560m in backlog orders (LOI signed). Although their dynamic window glasses cost upward of 50% more than standard window glasses, I think it's a highly differentiated product in which building owners can eventually charge a premium on rental leases = resulting in higher leasing revenues for them. One success case story is Civica Cherry Creek, an office building in Denver has managed to achieve the highest weighted average rental rates out of any office buildings in Denver city after switching to View's glass.\n\nOf course, I anticipate a huge inertia in the beginning where the mass market will put up resistance to adopt this product. However, overtime, combining the economies of scale in their factories to bring down production costs (higher gross margins) and rising demand globally arising from a proven track record, I can foresee exponential growth for this company in the long term. They are expecting revenue growths to be around 127% CAGR over the next 5 years, which I personally think it's possible but the exponential growth will not happen till 2023 onwards, since they need the initial two years for market entry into more markets/sectors.\n\n6) **Investors** \\- Early prominent VC funding include Corning and Softbank. However, I wish to point out that in recent SEC filings, **GIC Investment** (*Singapore state-owned sovereign fund, owned by the Government of Singapore*) initiated a 10% stake of $50 million in C.F.II last week, and an **additional $200 million PIPE investment today**. Let me tell you why I'm so bullish about this. Singapore is a highly developed and urbanised country located in South-east Asia with a myriad of high-rise buildings/skyscrapers, tropical climate with plenty of sun activity all year round. Although N.A market is huge, but usually buildings in states with most sunlight activity e.g. California/Arizona will constitute the main bulk of customers. Let's imagine if the product is able to break into the Asia market, or even into South-east Asia with tropical climate zones, the revenues would be insane. GIC obviously conducted their DD as they won't screw around with state-owned money. They know the growth potential of this proprietary tech once this hits the market big time, and perhaps even a business arrangement to bring this product into Singapore? Other players will likely not stand a chance, with the exception of China.\n\n7) **Ability to scale**:\n\n* Current projects are only in the commercial space which has taken a huge hit due to the pandemic. With the ongoing trend in WFH, the residential market is essentially a cash cow for milking, especially against the backdrop of demand for healthy home working environment. In light of this, the CEO said in an interview that he has **already completed 50 residential projects**(this wasn't published as it's still in the works) and he is developing a product for residential market **this year** to target contemporary homes. LINK: [https://lookingbeyondwithmichaelsikand.fireside.fm/view](https://lookingbeyondwithmichaelsikand.fireside.fm/view) (from 10:45 onwards). The convergence of WFH trend and smart homes will definitely be a huge play, even more so than commercial. Does it reminds you of Netflix's Black Mirror? Transparent displays are certainly a sight to behold.\n\n[Touchscreen Capabilities](https://preview.redd.it/8hpryx7frqa61.png?width=1240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14ba9afda332f5311a24744efd9376d8d5291043)\n\n* Given the ubiquitous applications with glass, possibilities are not limited to just smart buildings. In fact, one really strong partnership with great potential would be to license the proprietary tech to EV car makers. **Incredible synergy can be found in the future of electric vehicle glass display**, where car window panels can function as a smart display with vehicle integration + auto tinting capabilities. In fact, the **entire transportation industry** could be disrupted by this tech, think of your Buses/Rails/Subway/Cruises and how smart glass display could reinvent the future of Advertisements in commercial transportation, and how fast would they jump on this bandwagon if they are able to monetise this new piece of glass.\n* Other uses across different sectors include the **hospitality industry** (airports, hotels, resorts) and **healthcare sector**, like hospital wards windows.\n\nFYI, they have piloted their product in 3 different US airports, namely SFO, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Boston airports. After retrofitting their Smart Glass in the airports, results were rather stellar with an actual increase in concessionary sales, energy cost savings, as well as longer dwell time in such areas.\n\nCase study for DFO airport: [https://view.com/sites/default/files/documents/dfw-airport-dynamic-glass-pilot-research-study\\_0.pdf](https://view.com/sites/default/files/documents/dfw-airport-dynamic-glass-pilot-research-study_0.pdf)\n\n**Bear Case/Downsides**\n\n* Glassdoor rating of company seems poor with management woes at the executive level, and there were reports of View Inc laying off their staff sometime in April 2020. I think that internal turmoil would be detrimental and could impede their growth in the future.\n* Current earnings of $31m in 2020 does not really justify the valuation of $1.6b (much speculation is on future growth potential).\n* They have a current minimum order of $1M, which will not sit well with smaller commercial buildings or residential market. This will result in them losing market share gradually to their smaller competitors who can cater to such clientele.\n* The biggest risk to their Intellectual Property is that it is not universal i.e. it does not have an international protection. Patents are territory rights, so even though their tech is protected in US, I expect proliferation of copy cats in other countries like \\*coughs\\* China. They may register for IP in China as well, but let's face it, its not exactly fool-proof and Chinese companies operate differently in China. Although there will be imitations, but I believe that View's level of R&amp;D is extremely strong after 12 years in operation. Other copy-cat Smart Glass companies would unlikely be able to achieve the same level of product as View, thus ensuring levels of product differentiation.\n\n**The Play**\n\nWith the merger expected to complete by Q1 of 2021 (2 months time), I expect C.F.II to pop closer to merger date during March, perhaps in the $15-$16 range. But once it reaches ATH right before merger, it will probably be a good time to sell, as once post-merger happens and downside cap is removed, it will most likely fall below $10 or even lower as the industry is very CAPEX- intensive. In addition, I think that the commercial space is likely to remain sluggish in the near term, which will push the price further down. It will also likely burn more cash in the process, since you have to bear in mind that any new futuristic tech adoption is an extremely long and arduous process.\n\nRevolutionary tech like iPhones/Tesla did not pick up from the get-go after it was introduced to the market, and it took several years before they saw some real results. This is probably a good time to accumulate your positions while its being massively hated on, and believe in the conviction that 1) they are the market leader with a wide economic moat, &gt;1k patents and ability to scale up while bringing down costs. 2) secular E.S.G trend with Biden's green plan will provide good tailwind for the sector at least for the next 4+ years, in which their policies will likely benefit the industry. 3) multiple uses applications are HUGE with amazing potential for licensing/partnership plays in EV/hospitality/healthcare sectors. I have strong conviction in the long term that it is going to be a multi-bagger if you keep accumulating the dips post-merger.\n\n**TLDR**: In short, buy now for the pre-merger pop and sell right before merger. Following a post-merger sell-off, accumulate on the dip and ride on for the long term in the next few years.\n\n*Positions: Warrants @ $2.4*\n\nLink to investor presentation: [https://view.com/sites/default/files/documents/View-Investor-Presentation-High.pdf](https://view.com/sites/default/files/documents/View-Investor-Presentation-High.pdf)",

Sauntering down the hallway, with your 50 pound dick grazing the velveteen carpet with each step. You hear the guttural screams coming out of sales. You walk by the engineers, and gaze upon the latest widget as they kowtow before your bespecled grandeur. You hear about the customers who sing your praises, and the (much fewer) ones who tell you your product sucks donkey balls... But we (the retards @ WSB or frankly the dubmasses @ seeking alpha and even JP Morgan equity coverage) don\u2019t know the details any of this, only dry ass reports that come out every quarter.\n\nSo, other than hacking into John\u2019s brain (not recommended), what can we do? We can suckle at the teat of Twitter announcements, and sometimes that\u2019s fun but usually it\u2019s PR driven (unless it comes from Papa Chen\u2019s account in which case suckle away).\n\nBut boy oh boy wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could know the things P. Chiddy does. What new things are in development. Big new sales in the pipeline. Whether the company is hiring (or shrinking), and in what areas\u2026.Wait. For the last thing we actually can!\n\nthanks to the grotesquely fat (and very rich, no offense Gabe) founder of a soul-crushing professional network called LinkedIn. Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So let\u2019s see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?\n\nTo start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If you\u2019re a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If you\u2019re growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they don\u2019t think they need, and last time I checked $BB\u2019s CFO wasn\u2019t completely retarded. Now, it\u2019s important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c they\u2019re growing, duh) and vice versa.\n\nFANG isn\u2019t a perfect comp (I\u2019ll get to the others in a sec), but **serves as a good proxy of a \u201cbaseline growthy\u201d tech.** No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking. See below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1g1ubpfxize61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58d58b12644e9688e15e35e907386b910b9d938d\n\n# IMPLICATION NUMBER #1 - $$BB COMPARES FAVORABLY TO FANG IN TERMS OF HEADCOUNT-IMPLIED GROWTH. IF YOU SAID \u201c$BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG\u201d, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOU\u2019D BE RIGHT!!\n\n\u201cBut wait,\u201d you say. \u201cgrowthinvestor123 you fucking idiot, [didn\u2019t you just compare $BB to CRWD, ZS, SAIL, and PANW](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/) to justify a **$60 / share** price target for $BB? I want to see the ratios for those.\u201d Ok you, got me. See below, headcount-implied growth is higher for endpoint security comparables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eaz3begzize61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d01221903b3c50a6838710f32daa173035eb9e92\n\n\u201cHah,\u201d you say smugly. \u201cThose other endpoint security businesses blow $BB out of the water, $BB sucks\u201d.\n\nNo, you fucking idiot. If a simple headcount ratio without context was all it took I\u2019d be rich instead of handsome like mommy tells me.\n\n$BB went through [**round**](https://channeldailynews.com/news/layoffs-hit-blackberry-in-waterloo/28015) after [**round**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=blackberry+layoffs&amp;atb=v224-1&amp;ia=web&amp;iai=r1-3&amp;page=1&amp;sexp=%7B%22cdrexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22artexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prodexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prdsdexp%22%3A%22c%22%2C%22biaexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22msvrtexp%22%3A%22b%22%7D) of painful layoffs as it shifted from being a handset business to what it is today. Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a **history**, and that is a blessing and a curse.\n\n**Remember**, Daddy chen\u2019s primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other??? And these smart monkes who were retained \u2013 Well, no need to make a job posting for that role anymore, right?\n\n# IMPLICATION #2 \u2013 BLACKBERRY HAD &gt; 20K EMPLOYEES. UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS. HAVING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES QUICKLY LIKE CERTAIN COMPETITORS\n\nThis brings me to the final part of our headcount analysis. Let\u2019s look at those endpoint security comparables again. Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Let\u2019s look at two two non-retard quotes \u2013\n\n***\"I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company.\" Steve Jobs***\n\n***\u201cIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it\u2019s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.\u201d Peter Thiel***\n\nI was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BB\u2019s Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales. See below\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6nog6m62jze61.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb26266cbef428abb3152f1b9077c1a0daee07b0\n\nEven as a $BB bull, I didn\u2019t expect the discrepancy to be so large.\n\n# IMPLICATION #3 \u2013 BLACKBERRY ACTUALLY IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING / IT FOCUSED COMPANY RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS. IN MANY WAYS IT IS MORE OF A \u201cSTART-UP\u201d. EVEN WITH FINANCIAL PRESSURE, JOHNNY CHEN RETAINED TECHNICAL TALENT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE, AND VALUATION ???\n\n**TLDR: BB IS NOT A ROCKET SHIP.

        "selftext": "This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or \"counterfeit\" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.\n\nMuch of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.\n\nOne thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**Methodology**\n\nI'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that\n\n1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.\n2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.\n3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date\n\nHowever, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.\n\n**The Code**\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    import time\n    import requests\n    POLYGON_API_KEY = '&lt;ADD YOUR API KEY HERE&gt;'\n    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&amp;apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY\n    \n    data\n    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))\n    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n    for line in f:\n        parts = line.split('|');\n        date = parts[0]\n        ticker = parts[2]\n        try:\n            fails = int(parts[3])\n            price = float(parts[5])\n            value_of_fails = price * fails\n            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)\n        except ValueError:\n            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')\n            pass\n    \n    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():\n        day = int(date[-2:])\n        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))\n        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])\n        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] &gt; 10000000, sorted_stocks)\n        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:\n            val_of_fails = data[0]\n            num_fails = data[1]\n            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))\n            res = req.json()\n            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':\n                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))\n                continue\n            else:\n                try:\n                    volume = res['volume']\n                except KeyError:\n                    print(res)\n            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)\n            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100\n            print('{: &lt;6} ${: &lt;5} {: &lt;9} / {: &lt; 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))\n\nHere's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.\n\nIf everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I

        "selftext": "Bullish on FEYE over next few quarters. To me it\u2019s unclear how the recent SolarWinds hack will impact Q4 earnings due to the timing of the hack. On a recent conf call Mandia mentioned that Incident Response hours aren\u2019t billed until after the incident response engagement is over. The SolarWinds news broke on Sunday Dec 13th.  Response engagements of this scale typically take weeks if not months. So we might be looking at meeting Q4 estimates but raising Q1 guidance.  Even without a beat, I\u2019ll take this as a bullish sign. \n\nI\u2019ve been watching job openings at FireEye for the last month.  They\u2019ve been recruiting non-stop and a large portion of these at Incident Response or other services consultants. There are currently 192 open roles.  \n\nBack of the napkin calculations are... many of the senior roles will be sent immediately into the field at a billing rate between $250-$450. At a 80% utilization that is between $400k-$720k per head per year. If they have hired between 50-100 people into these roles since the Solarwinds hack that is could lead to $20M-$36M revenue increase on the low end to $40M-$72M on the high end. With current annual revenues at $928M we could see an annual revenue increase of 7% on these services alone which is above their current 6.9% revenue growth rate. If we see acceleration in any of their newish businesses like Managed Defense and Mandiant Advantage Cyber Threat Intelligence services we could have a great growth story on our hands. Incident Response services are (hopefully) a one time thing for breached companies but Managed Defense and Intel services are a recurring revenue stream, so growth in these areas would be a very good thing indeed. \n\nAny upticks in the hardware business would be positive news, but I believe they are facing upgrade cycle challenges and I\u2019m not expecting much on this front. \n\nFinally, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we saw FEYE acquired by a larger player in the next few months. There have been multiple rounds of rumors over the last few years that indicate FEYE has hired an investment bank to assist with the process. While Mandia hasn\u2019t confirmed these rumors, he hasn\u2019t denied them either. Cisco allegedly passed. I think good candidates are Microsoft, IBM or even someone like CrowdStrike using their astronomically high share price to swing a deal and create a cyber powerhouse to rival Pali Alto.  \n\nI\u2019m long with shares, considering NTM/OTM LEAPS, might by some June calls.  FD weeklies might payout but are risky IMO.",

They expect for Q4 an increase of app. 33,5% to 40,5% compared to the same quarter in 2019.\n\n**Shareholders**\n\nThe main shareholder is Hui Zuo with 46,8% of the shares. He is the founder and the Chairman of the Board. Second greatest shareholder is Tencent Holdings Limited. Tencent provides services to KE in connection to various aspects of the operations. We all know that Tencent is doing great. The CEO Peng Yongdong also has 3,6% of the shares.\n\nIn August 2020 KE went public on the NYSE. Current market price is approx. $63.\n\n**Market opportunities**\n\nAccording to the CIC Report, China has the largest housing market in the world in terms of GTV and number of transactions of existing and new home sales and home rentals in 2019. After a period of significant growth, the market is expected to enter an era of steady growth. It is expected that the existing home transactions market will gain more importance and grow with a CAGR of 12.4%.\n\n**Risk factors (highlights)**\n\n\u00b7  The business is susceptible to fluctuations in China's residential real estate market and is subject to government regulations.\n\n\u00b7  If they fail to maintain relationships with real estate developers or attract them to engage them, or otherwise fail to procure new real estate property listings at favorable terms, the business and growth prospects may suffer.\n\n\u00b7  If they fail to obtain or keep licenses, permits or approvals applicable to the various services provided by them, they may incur significant financial penalties and other government sanctions.\n\n\u00b7  Competition from other industry players. They may lose market share and customers if they fail to compete effectively. Their greatest competitor is E-House. Alibaba has a large stake (&gt;10%) in E-House.\n\nSEC Filing F-1: [https://investors.ke.com/financials/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=14285443](https://investors.ke.com/financials/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=14285443)\n\n**Own opinion**\n\nKE is a long-term investment for me. They have a great growth potential. I really like the real estate sector, especially in such a large company like China, Also,  I started this DD some days ago. Today I read that ARK Invest also has invested in KE. And let\u2019s be honest; everything Cathie touches turns into gold.",

        "selftext": "*Disclaimer - I am just a retard w/ a keyboard and you should do your own $DD. Also the karma whores @ WSB keep deleting my shit so one of you go post over there if you like $BB and what you read*\n\nTOday I did research to calm myself down after pounding a redbull and getting triggered by all the misinformation and greedy nitwits that have flooded this site looking for a quick flip.\n\nImagine you\u2019re John Chen. Sauntering down the hallway, with your 50 pound dick grazing the velveteen carpet with each step. You hear the guttural screams coming out of sales. You walk by the engineers, and gaze upon the latest widget as they kowtow before your bespecled grandeur. You hear about the customers who sing your praises, and the (much fewer) ones who tell you your product sucks donkey balls... But we (the retards @ WSB or frankly the dubmasses @ seeking alpha and even JP Morgan equity coverage) don\u2019t know the details any of this, only dry ass reports that come out every quarter.\n\nSo, other than hacking into John\u2019s brain (not recommended), what can we do? We can suckle at the teat of Twitter announcements, and sometimes that\u2019s fun but usually it\u2019s PR driven (unless it comes from Papa Chen\u2019s account in which case suckle away).\n\nBut boy oh boy wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could know the things P. Chiddy does. What new things are in development. Big new sales in the pipeline. Whether the company is hiring (or shrinking), and in what areas\u2026.Wait. For the last thing we actually can!\n\nthanks to the grotesquely fat (and very rich, no offense Gabe) founder of a soul-crushing professional network called LinkedIn. Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So let\u2019s see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?\n\nTo start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If you\u2019re a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If you\u2019re growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they don\u2019t think they need, and last time I checked $BB\u2019s CFO wasn\u2019t completely retarded. Now, it\u2019s important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c they\u2019re growing, duh) and vice versa.\n\nFANG isn\u2019t a perfect comp (I\u2019ll get to the others in a sec), but **serves as a good proxy of a \u201cbaseline growthy\u201d tech.** No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking. See below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8x0sjsj4wxe61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc0b996f191f3f47d37bb6b2888f537c6789ae0e\n\n# IMPLICATION NUMBER #1 - $$BB COMPARES FAVORABLY TO FANG IN TERMS OF HEADCOUNT-IMPLIED GROWTH. IF YOU SAID \u201c$BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG\u201d, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOU\u2019D BE RIGHT!!\n\n\u201cBut wait,\u201d you say. \u201cgrowthinvestor123 you fucking idiot, didn\u2019t you just compare $BB to CRWD, ZS, SAIL, and PANW yesterday to justify a **$60 / share** price target for $BB? I want to see the ratios for those.\u201d Ok you, got me. See below, headcount-implied growth is higher for endpoint security comparables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q7cepei5wxe61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7308c115e3d45a072dac92b20ac029eb132b348\n\n\u201cHah,\u201d you say smugly. \u201cThose other endpoint security businesses blow $BB out of the water, $BB sucks\u201d.\n\nNo, you fucking idiot. If a simple headcount ratio without context was all it took I\u2019d be rich instead of handsome like mommy tells me.\n\n$BB went through [**round**](https://channeldailynews.com/news/layoffs-hit-blackberry-in-waterloo/28015) after [**round**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=blackberry+layoffs&amp;atb=v224-1&amp;ia=web&amp;iai=r1-3&amp;page=1&amp;sexp=%7B%22cdrexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22artexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prodexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prdsdexp%22%3A%22c%22%2C%22biaexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22msvrtexp%22%3A%22b%22%7D) of painful layoffs as it shifted from being a handset business to what it is today. Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a **history**, and that is a blessing and a curse.\n\n**Remember**, Daddy chen\u2019s primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other??? And these smart monkes who were retained \u2013 Well, no need to make a job posting for that role anymore, right?\n\n# IMPLICATION #2 \u2013 BLACKBERRY HAD &gt; 20K EMPLOYEES. UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS. HAVING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES QUICKLY LIKE CERTAIN COMPETITORS\n\nThis brings me to the final part of our headcount analysis. Let\u2019s look at those endpoint security comparables again. Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Let\u2019s look at two two non-retard quotes \u2013\n\n***\"I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company.\" Steve Jobs***\n\n***\u201cIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it\u2019s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.\u201d Peter Thiel***\n\nI was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BB\u2019s Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales. See below\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9s89num7wxe61.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5361754f68b831f3ad044aba2fed88c6f93c7849\n\nEven as a $BB bull, I didn\u2019t expect the discrepancy to be so large.\n\n# IMPLICATION #3 \u2013 BLACKBERRY ACTUALLY IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING / IT FOCUSED COMPANY RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS. IN MANY WAYS IT IS MORE OF A \u201cSTART-UP\u201d. EVEN WITH FINANCIAL PRESSURE, JOHNNY CHEN RETAINED TECHNICAL TALENT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE, AND VALUATION ???\n\n**TLDR: BB IS NOT A ROCKET SHIP. IT IS A LONG RANGE SHUTTLE, CAPABLE OF BURSTS OF SPEED, PACKED TO THE GILLS WITH RETARDS AND TERRAFORMING EQUIPMENT AND HEADING TO MARS.**",
