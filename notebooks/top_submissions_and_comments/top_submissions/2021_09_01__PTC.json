        "selftext": "Good morning degenerates, autists, and intellectually deficients.\n\nI have been lurking on this sub for the longest time, occasionally making some money on the juicy DDs posted here. Today, I felt like giving back by shining some light on 2 companies that have seemingly been forgotten by our community (retards typically have poor working memory, so you are forgiven). I can't write for shit, so here are some facts in bullet points detailing each play (fundamentals and catalysts/reason to bag hold).\n\n# Proterra\n\n**Fundamentals :**\n\n* NTM TEV / Revenues = 4.88\n* NTM TEV / EBITDA = 23.10\n* Liabilities as a percentage of TEV = 34.1%\n* Mean street target (tip ranks) = 15.50 (46,78% upside, backed by BofA and Citigroup)\n\n**Catalyst :**\n\n* Infrastructure bill baby. $39 billion USD for public transit, with around $7.5 going directly towards replacing buses. Biggest competitor of PTRA on the EV bus market is a chinese company. Thankfully, a NDAA that was passed in a bipartisan fashion a year ago provides a restriction on funding to be used from a federal transit agency to a Chinese owned or operated company.\n* What specific aspects of the infrastructure bill might advantage PTRA (according to John Allen in the 08-11-2021 press release) :\n   * $800 million a year for 5 years guaranteed\n   * $2.5 billion, up to $5 billion for electric school buses\n   * $2.25 billion to electrify the ports\n   * $7.5 billion for charging infrastructure\n\n**Good reasons to buy in general :**\n\n* Only american EV bus company that also sells charging infrastructure, batteries, and powertrain\n   * Partnership with Thomas (school buses), LG (battery components), Vanhool (coaches), Frieghtliner (delivery trucks), Optimal EV (airport and hospital transit), Komatsu (construction equipment), Lightning motors (sprinter vans)\n* 2 decades of experience in a very young market with plenty of space to grow\n   * Bus with the biggest battery capacity and milage (300-ish miles compared to european buses with 100-200 miles)\n* Politically indifferent\n   * Conservative = protectionism = good for American PTRA\n   * Liberals = weird taxes on carbon emitting businesses = good for PTRA\n\n**The play :**\n\n* Expect a bump in price and price targets when the infrastructure deal passes.\n* Hold that shit till 2035\n\n# Paya Holdings, Inc.\n\n**Fundamentals :**\n\n* NTM TEV / Revenues = 5.05\n* NTM TEV / EBITDA = 18.22\n* Liabilities as a percentage of TEV = 61.7%\n* Mean street target (tip ranks) = 14.50 (44.71% upside, backed by Morgan Stanley, Truist, BTIG)\n\n**Catalyst :**\n\n* Voting to cut warrant-sponsored dilution from 17.7 mil shares to 4.6 mil shares happening on september 10.\n\n**Good reasons to buy in general :**\n\n* Very good multiples for a double digit growth company compared to peers (Paypal, Square, etc.).\n* Profitable as fuck @ 25.7% EBITDA margins\n* Institutions buying up like crazy with zero institution holding a net short position.\n* IV low as hell.\n\n**The play :**\n\n* Expect a bump in price on September 10.\n* Hold or sell that shit after it pops to 15$. You do you.\n\nProof of positions in comments.\n\n**8000 shares of PAYA @ 10.42 + 100 Sep17'21 10C @ 1.05**\n\n**6000 shares of PTRA @ 11.08**",

        "selftext": "**Summary:**\n\n* Affirm is a major player in the booming \u201cpoint of sale financing\u201d or \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d niche.\n* Affirm lets online shoppers choose an installment plan at checkout.\n* The point of sale financing market exploded during the pandemic and is expected to keep growing fast.\n* Competitor Afterpay was recently acquired by Square, and there is speculation that Affirm may be an acquisition target.\n\n**What they do:**\n\nAffirm operates a point-of-sale payment solution for consumers. Its payment network allows consumers to pay for purchases with an installment plan.  \n \n\nAffirm pays the merchant the full amount upfront. They charge an APR of 10 to 30 percent, depending on the plan and on the buyer\u2019s credit. The Affirm app makes it easy for buyers to keep track of payments and sends reminders.  \n \n\nAffirm also receives a fee from merchants. Online sellers have found that point-of-sale financing increases sales volume and reduces cart abandonment, so they are willing to pay for the service.  \n \n\nThere were over 12,000 active merchants using the Affirm platform in March 2021, more than double the number in the same quarter of 2020. Active consumers grew 60% to 5.4 million in the same period. Gross merchandise volume grew 83% to $2.3 billion.  \n \n\nAffirm has an exclusive relationship with Shopify ($SHOP), and provides point-of-sale financing to Shopify merchants.  \n \n\nShopify is a leading competitor to Amazon. They are growing at a wild rate: gross merchandise volume was up 119% in the last reported quarter and the number of merchants with Shopify stores has been rising at 126% a year. Shopify now powers over 1.7 million businesses in more than 175 countries.  \n \n\nAffirm\u2019s relationship with Shopify allows them to offer their services to an enormous and rapidly growing customer base.\n\n**Why they\u2019re spiking in interest:**  \n \n\nReddit mentions of $AFRM in the last 8 days leaped 875% from the previous 8-day period.  \n \n\nThe surge was kicked off by the August 3 news that Affirm will work with Apple ($AAPL) to provide installment plans for Apple device purchasers in Canada.  \n \n\nThat announcement was followed on August 5 with news that Square ($SQ) is acquiring Australian buy-now-pay-later provider Afterpay for $29 billion. Affirm shares gained 18% on the combined news.  \n \n\nThe Square/Afterpay combination will provide competition for Affirm, but it also brought attention to the sector.  \n \n\nThere has been speculation that another major player seeking to move into the buy-now-pay-later space will acquire Affirm rather than develop their own system.  \n \n\nShopify (which already owns 7.6% of Affirm), PayPal, and even card giants like Visa and Mastercard have been suggested as potentially interested in acquiring Affirm.  \n \n\nNotable comments from Reddit:  \n \n\n\"I\u2019m long on $AFRM. The financial sector is dinosaurs through and through. If you\u2019ve ever applied for (and received) a mortgage, it\u2019s a nightmare. It requires little imagination on my part for Affirm or \u201cGreen Sky\u201d to open up to home and auto loans.\"\n\n\\- PinBot1138  \n \n\n\u201cPeople should probably get AFRM for when it gets acquired for a free 30%.\u201d  \n \\- Lukebreit  \n \n\nSignal: Over 77% of the $AFRM float is held by institutions. Scottish investment management firm Baillie Gifford is the largest institutional holder, with over $75 million worth of shares.\n\n \n\n**Why $AFRM could be valuable:**\n\nThe buy-now-pay-later has enormous upward momentum. Sales have increased dramatically and the increase is expected to continue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMcKinsey &amp; Company\u2019s annual POS Financing Survey found that about 60% of consumers are likely to use point-of-sale financing over the next six to 12 months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAffirm founder and CEO Max Levchin has a record of developing successful and innovative payment systems: he\u2019s one of the founders of PayPal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAffirm does not charge late payment fees and has a fixed monthly payment system. This feature is attractive to users who are concerned with the complexities of credit card billing and payment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAffirm\u2019s Net Promoter Score - a measure of customer loyalty - places the company at 78, above Amazon and just below Apple. 64% of transactions are from repeat users, and repeat customers spend an average of $2,200 per year. Delinquency rates were just over 1% in 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSix of 10 analysts covering the stock rate it \u201cBuy\u201d, with the other 4 placing it at \u201cHold\u201d. The consensus price target is $76.71, 14% above the current level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRapid user growth, high customer retention, and a rapidly expanding market add up to very strong growth prospects for $AFRM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe stock has dropped to under 50% of its post-IPO surge of $140 per share and has settled into a steady band in the $60-$70 range.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPost-IPO hype often drives new listings to unrealistic valuations. When they drop back to a more realistic level many retail investors become frustrated and drop out. That leaves a core of institutional holders and a strong base for appreciation of positive news.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What the risks are:**\n\nAffirm is not profitable and is not expected to achieve profitability soon. The Company also has a high debt/equity ratio of 87.95%. The Company has adequate working capital but the combination of debt and losses is still a concern.  \n \n\nAffirm operates in a highly competitive market. Right now that market is dominated by relatively new companies like Afterpay, and Klarna. The sector\u2019s rapid growth could attract competition from larger companies with greater financial capacity than Affirm.  \n \n\nAffirm faces credit risk. Default rates have been extremely low, but unexpected events could drive them high enough to affect the Company\u2019s results.  \n \n\nAffirm is exposed to a potential economic downturn. A recession could reduce the discretionary purchases that drive much of the Company\u2019s gross merchandise volume and increase default rates.  \n \n\nThe buy-now-pay-later sector could attract increased government regulation, which could affect the Company's results and stock price.  \n \n\n***Bottom line:***\u00a0*Affirm\u2019s lack of profitability makes it a speculative play. But its rapid revenue growth and established position in an exploding market make it an interesting speculative play. There is strong potential for acquisition and for medium to long-term growth. Watch for the release of Q4 and full FY 2021 results, scheduled for Sept. 9.*",

The MACD looks bullish with potentially indicating this reversal will become a rally. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n However, the fundamentals are also insanely undervalued right now. I'm talking this thing has a mufuckin current PE ratio of 28 only considering the first 2 quarters this year i.e. NOT COUNTING any estimates from q3 and q4 this year. I'm talking they made rev of about a billion dollars in FY2020 with about 350 mill in net income, Q1 2021 they made over 1.6 billion in revenue and more than doubled net income relative to the ENTIRE PREVIOUS YEAR.  Q2 2021 they made revenue of 2.23 billion netting 1.6 fucking billion in a damn quarter. They're literally reaching exponential growth as we speak and lets be honest the industry they're in is primed to grow substantially in the foreseeable future. Now if you look at their guidance for q3 and q4 they are not expecting to beat the net income of q2 but they also expect continued profitability and could potentially beat forecasts IF certain coins that are traded on their platform rally hard. For comparison, Square is trading at a FORWARD PE (2024) of 73, PayPal FORWARD PE 2024 of 32, I could go on and on. So really their current annual PE is considerably less than 28 once earnings come in for q3 and q4.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a cash cow of a company fundamentals and technicals seem to be aligning nicely. I think you can't go wrong with far out leaps however you must know that I am retarded and you would be an even bigger retard if you listened to me, jk you prolly can't even read so I'm not worried.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR COIN to the moon fam!!!\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not currently in a position but considering loading the $300 calls exp dec 21",

        "selftext": "Just wondering what people's thoughts are on Affirm earning's on Sep 9th? \n\nSome things I've been considering...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. There is a possibility that earnings could miss estimates... even though they estimated low, around 225 M for this quarter. This would be due to Peloton shitting the bed. Before the Amazon deal... Peloton was Affirm's largest customer. The Peloton collapse will affect Affirm.\n2. According to a Simply Wall Street article anything below $270 M will not be seen by the street as a surprise. So if Affirm beats... it has to be substantial.\n3. So much depends on the guidance they will offer and more info about the Amazon deal. I'd like to see what they predict. I believe the guidance regarding this will determine whether or not the SP rises or sinks. Amazon is a monster... and this deal was huge for Affirm.\n4. It will be really interesting to see Apple's performance in Canada with PayBright. A company that Affirm acquired. I called my local Apple store (in Canada) and spoke with sales supervisor. They told me approximately 2/10 purchases are funded via Paybright! Anecdotal yes... small sample size.. yes... but you can extrapolate this... something to think about.\n5. There is a lot of momentum in this space. We saw this with SQ's all stock offering worth 29 B for After pay.\n6. Affirm has been in business since 2012. Think about all that data and analysis they have collected on borrowers! That's a gold mine and in this day and age data analytics is everything. \n7. Which leads me to potential suitors for Affirm... Apple, Shopify, Amazon, WallMArt... hell I bet even JPM is interested. Considering traditional banking will be taken to the cleaners if they don't do anything... soon. My money is on Shop to take them out as they own 8% already.\n8. Max Levchin the CEO is switched on. He's been here before and can execute. Just look at PayPal.\n\nSo your turn... what do you think?\n\nFull disclosure... 23 calls. Nov $70's and Jan $85's.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 8, 2021**\n\n*Hey Psychos! So there was no recap yesterday, got mixed up and didn't have the time*\n\nStocks fell today, extending the previous day\u2019s decline in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) as market participants continue to digest the recent August Job Report and concerns surrounding rising coronavirus infections across the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) 0.33% down while the SPY and DIA fell 0.11% and 0.2% respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 1.10%.\n\nYung-Yu Ma. Chief Investment Strategist at BMO Capital said, \u201cWe think the fundamental drivers of strong earnings, an accommodative Fed, and a still healthy appetite for risk taking are really what\u2019s going to support the market for the rest of the year.\u201d \n\nThe Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly \u2153 of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous month\u2019s numbers. Here are the numbers.\n\n* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \\+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July\n* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July\n* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July \n* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July\n\nPresident Biden said of the report, \u201cWhile I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what we\u2019ve seen this year is continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially closely at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the \u201csubstantial further progress mark\u201d the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, \u201cI think that one more good job report if it\u2019s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.\u201d August was not the report they were looking for. \n\nIn its latest Beige Book, which is basically a report by the Federal Reserve on current economic conditions, members said the economy downshifted slightly due to Delta variant concerns. The report stated, \u201cThe deceleration in economic activity was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel, and tourism in most Districts, reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the Delta variant, and, in many cases, international travel restrictions.\u201d \n\nIn the US, the surge in infections in certain parts of the nation continues unabated, with hospitalizations this weekend roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people travelled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge)\n\n[https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html](https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html)\n\nIn other news, the battle between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos is heating up! Last week, SpaceX sent a filing to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accusing Amazon of using regulatory and legal means to stifle and slowdown competition. SpaceX said, \u201cWhile SpaceX has proceeded to deploy more than 1,700 satellites, Amazon has yet to even attempt to address the radiofrequency interference and orbital debris issues that must be resolved before Amazon can deploy its constellation\u201d and suggested \u201cas it falls behind competitors \\[Amazon\\] is more than willing to use regulatory and legal processes to create obstacles designed to delay those competitors from leaving Amazon even further behind\u201d (ouch).\n\nIn response, Amazon said, Whether it is launching satellites with unlicensed antennas, launching rockets without approval, building an unapproved launch tower, or re-opening a factory in violation of a shelter-in-place order, the conduct of SpaceX and other Musk-led companies makes their view plain: rules are for other people, and those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks. If the FCC regulated hypocrisy, SpaceX would keep the commission very busy.\u201d SpaceX won this one IMO, that was a nasty burn. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Job openings in July as measured by JOLTS soared by a staggering 749,000 \u2014 hitting yet another all-time high just shy of 11 million open jobs, enough to eliminate most of the current slack in the labor market.\n* El Salvador became the first country in the world to roll out a digital currency as a form of legal tender, allowing businesses and customers to transact using blockchain. There are some initial teething problems with the launch of the Chivo, the country\u2019s wallet app and locals being unfamiliar with the technology. Digital currencies also fell, though I don\u2019t know unknown if the drop is correlated to the launch in El Salvador\n* Damn, the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) market is red-hot right now. Following Sqaure\u2019s (SQ) acquisition of Afterpay for $29 billion and Amazon (AMZN) partnering up with Affirm (AFRM) to offer BNPL on Amazon, PayPal (PYPL) is now stepping into the arena by acquiring Japanese BNPL firm Paidy for $2.7 billion\n* Twitter (TWTR) launched a global test of a tool it calls Communities, a feature similar to Facebook Groups that gives users a way to tweet to people with similar interests. This follows the recent launch of Super Follows, where content creators can charge their followers for their content. \n* Applied Materials (AMAT) announced it was releasing two new tools aimed at improving efficiency of making a new class of chips for electric vehicles. The machines announced on Wednesday are designed for chips made from a material called silicon carbide. Such chips are gaining traction in electric vehicles like those made by Tesla Inc because they are more efficient and lighter in weight than standard silicon chips for transmitting power from a car's battery to its motors, helping improve range. Silicon carbide chips are difficult to manufacture because the material is very hard\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* ASML target raised by Wells Fargo (WFC) from $800 to$975 at Overweight. Stock currently around $856. ASML is probably the most important and influential tech company you\u2019ve never heard of.\n* Chipotle (CMG) with two target raises. Stock c currently around $1905\n   * Cowen from $2080 from $2250 at Overweight\n   * BTIG Research from $1850 to $2150 at Outperform\n* Coupa Software with a host of target raises following earnings. Average price target $300 at Overweight. Stock currently around $250\n* Microsoft (MSFT) target raised by Jefferies Financial from $335 to $345 at Buy. Stock currently around $300\n* Netflix (NFLX) target raised by JP Morgan from $625 to $705 at Overweight. Stock currently around $605\n* UiPath (PATH) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $72 to $74 at Overweight. Stock currently around $56\n* State Street (STT) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $117 to $122 at Overweight. Stock currently around $87\n* Atlassian (TEAN) target raised by Robert W Baird from $345 to $400 at Outperform. Stock currently around $382\n* Upstart (UPST) target raised by Piper Sandler from $192 to $300 at Outperform. Stock currently around $274\n\n\u201cNumberless are the world's wonders, but none More wonderful than man.\u201d - Sophocles",

        "selftext": "Living in today\u2019s word is quite different than growing up in the 80s. For example you can find a job by picking up your phone and possibly be at work within the same day or even hours. If you want to know where a friend or loved one is you do not have to go looking for them or wait until you know they are going to be home you can simply look at their location, and if you need to talk to them you don\u2019t have to go through an operator you can simply just call or text them. Today the amount of work abundance and money making opportunities is honestly quite incredible. But what about money, there was no e-currency or tokens back then, heck the only thing there was were stocks, gold and money. As time went on we started seeing the internet come out and with that is when the e-currencies started being developed like PayPal and such. Now we are developing into a time where your cash is starting to become annoying and the governance of a currency is becoming more widespread known as fraud money. My point is that over a period of only 40 years or so, we have evolved passed using certain pieces of technologies and other every day items that at the time we thought we would never be able to live without, but as time went on these objects became obsolete and other newer, more efficient objects are now the new normal. I believe this is the way the new currency is moving into our world, just in an even expedited manner. Only time will tell though.",

America\n* Opera FY' 21 Forecast(high end) - $247M revenue, $20M AEBITDA\n   * **Trading at \\~1.7 x FY'21 Est. Revenue**\n\n**The recent $400M Opay funding round from Softbank at $2B valuation and subsequent monetization of 29% of Opera's preferred share in OPay at $50M shows how undervalued Opera minority investments are on the books**.\n\n* Opay is valued at \\~$2B post money, and although Opera has not officially disclosed its latest stake, as per my calculations, Opera\u2019 stake of 13.1%(10.24% Preferred shares + 2.86% Ordinary shares) got diluted to \\~10.5% after the latest $400M funding round from Softbank. Since then, Opera sold 29% of its preferred shares, its latest stake dropped to \\~8% which is now worth \\~$160M compared to $49M which they have on the books.\n* Starmaker\u2019s 19.6% stake is valued on the books at $55M valuing starmaker at \\~$280M. Similar to Opay, Starmaker,  which is profitable and has Q1 FY '21 revenue run rate of \\~$180M -- 41% sequential increase from $127M run rate at end of 2020 -- , is valued on Opera\u2019s book at massive discount.\n* Nanobank, where Opera has 42% stake and valued on books at $266M,  has been sequentially growing at 10-15% since its covid bottom and should reach pre-covid run rate of $120M during Q1 2022.\n\nWhichever multiple one is comfortable with for Opera Core business, which has gross margins of 95% with 25-30% AEBITDA margin profile, growing at 48% YoY in FY'21 and should continue to grow between 20-25% for next several years due to investments into growing new legs in fintech/cashback and gaming and also expanding in Europe and America where advertising impression are 10x better monetized compared to Africa and Asia, where majority of its 400M users are currently located, it is hard not to see how undervalued Opera is.\n\n* If you use 4x revenue multiple with the book valuation on minority stakes, Opera should be valued at \\~1.6B ( \\~$15 per ADS) -- 66% appreciation potential based on $9 SP.\n* If you use 6x multiple with book valuation on minority stakes, Opera should be valued at \\~2.1B ( \\~20 per ADS) --122% Appreciation potential\n* If you use 8x multiple with book valuation on minority stakes, Opera should be valued at \\~2.6B ( \\~25 per ADS) -- 177% Appreciation potential\n* If you start applying growth multiples to Opera with the assumption that Opera can grow faster than 20-25% with modest success in Gaming and Fintech initiatives and get to 20-30% AEBITDA margin profile by FY\u201923, you can assign a 10x-12x revenue multiple to Opera and valuation would be much higher.\n\n**Opera History**\n\nOpera Ltd, the Opera browser company, was established in Norway in 1996  and is one of the few survivors from the Internet Explorer era of early 2000 . It was bought by a consortium led by Yahui Zhou in 2016 for $600M. In 2018, It was listed on Nasdaq as OPRA.\n\nNow, Opera is no longer just a browser company. In fact, its core browser business only contributes about half of its revenue through search and ad monetization. The other half of revenue is contributed by advertising, mostly via its Opera news app which is now a top 10 news app on both android and iOS in all of Africa, Germany, France, UK and now in the US. What Opera has done successfully is to take its browser user base of 300 million MAUs and then get them to other services like News, Fintech and Gaming. Opera calls it Browser+ strategy.\n\nIt also used its browser user base to spin off 2 very successful businesses:\n\n* OPay, a leading mobile wallet and mobile money operator in Nigeria where it had 13.1% stake(as of FY\u2019 20) which most recently raised $400M at $2B valuation.\n* Nanobank, a micro credit provider in emerging markets of Africa, Asia and Latin America where it has 42% stake. Nanobank was doing $117M quarterly revenue at 30% AEBITDA margin pre-covid, but it is still recovering from covid impact in its biggest market - India and had Q2' 21 revenue of $57M at \\~3% AEBITDA margin. Opera merged its fintech business in India and Kenya with Mobi Magic to form Nanobank with 42% stake in August 2020.\n\nIt also opportunistically invested $30M for 19.35% stake in starmaker -- a social network for music lovers and Karaoke artists -- and is growing like a wildfire, 250% YoY growth to $180M run rate in Q1' 21 with sequential acceleration of 41% from $127M revenue run rate in Q4'20.\n\n**Opera Products**\n\n**Opera browser :** Amongst the giants, Apple Safari and Google Chrome, Opera has built a niche and cult following of users who like Opera browser for many of its differentiated features - Integrated Messaging apps, Integrated music players, built in VPN, ad blocker and many more. Opera browser for desktop is available on  MacOS, Windows and Linux and has seen install base growing from 42 million MAUs in 2016 to 80 million MAUs in 2020, a CAGR of 17%. Opera Mobile browser and its data saving browser Opera Mini, have grown from 164 million to 190 million MAUs, a CAGR of 4%.\n\n**Opera GX :** Opera GX, the gaming browser which Opera launched for Gamers with differentiated features like CPU and RAM limiter, Gaming aesthetics, discord integration and Gaming corner which surfaces deals and news related to Games. Since its launch in June 2019, It has grown to over 10 million MAUs in just over 2 years.\n\n**Opera News App :** Opera News is AI based News aggregator which personalizes the news based on their browsing history. It is #1 news app in all of the major African economies  - Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, Kenya and Ghana. Since its launch in Germany, France, UK and US in Q4'20, It has become #1 or #2 news apps in Germany, France and the UK and in the top 10 in the US. It has grown at 42% CAGR -- from 72 million MAUs in Q4'17 to 211 million MAU in Q4'20 and is growing revenue at 160% YoY as of Q4'20.\n\n**Opera Ad Network :** Opera is one of the top 10 publishers of media impression given its scale in browser and its news app. Instead of relying on 3rd party ad networks, Opera has launched its own ad network, primarily to serve its own ad inventory and since its launch 2 years ago, it has grown at 130% YoY. It is tracking to $80 million in FY'21 revenue, 50% growth in daily revenue run rate year to date.\n\n**Dify :** Opera acquired 2 small companies in 2020 - Pocosys and Fjord bank and used Pocosys to build a new fintech product called Dify which was launched in Spain in Feb '21. Initially Dify will provide an integrated mobile wallet, Debit Card and Cashback for its users with plans to launch additional services like BNPL/Credit and fractionalized share investing to its 50M active users in Europe.\n\n**Opera Gaming :** Early 2021, Opera acquired leading 2D gaming engine company, YoYo Games and launched a Gaming division combining it with its gaming focused browser Opera GX, which has grown quite rapidly to 10M active users since its launch in June 2019. Opera plans to build a gaming community around these 10M+ users and its thousands of GameMaker developers and has plans to launch a steam like service --Gamebox-- to offer gaming publishers a platform to monetize their games.\n\n**Business Model**\n\n* **Search revenue :** Opera primarily makes money from its 80 million desktop MAUs when they conduct searches from its search bar.  Opera has revenue sharing contracts with Google and Yandex.\n* **Advertising revenue :**  Opera makes advertising revenue 2 ways:\n   * Revenue shares from book marked link, speed dials and other forms of affiliate advertising on its browser. Each million Opera GX users bring $2.8M in yearly revenue and Opera is in early innings of monetizing this gaming user base.\n   * Native advertising in its Opera News App, growing at 160% YoY.\n* **Other revenue :** This low margin revenue comes from providing professional services to Opay. This is being phased out completely by FY'21 as Opay has scaled its operation with its own staff.\n\n**Financials**\n\nOpera Search and Advertising revenue have grown at \\~22% CAGR, from $33.5M in Q2' 18 to $60.2M in Q2' 21. This revenue comes at \\~95% gross margin and has AEBITDA margin profile of 20-30%. Opera has been investing for growth so it's AEBITDA margin have fluctuated from 0% to 41% since its IPO.\n\nOpera has forecasted FY' 21 revenue of $242-247M , 48% growth over FY \u201820. It has forecasted FY \u201821 AEBITDA of $10-20M, despite its stated objective of investing up to $100M into scaling its fintech initiative, Dify in FY' 21 and investing for growth in Opera News, Dify and Opera Gaming.\n\nWith covid recovery, momentum in its advertising business, over 10% browser growth in EU, and ramp up of Opera News App in US and Europe, Opera has projected to grow its search and advertising revenue at 25% YoY for next several years.\n\nOpera has always taken a very conservative approach with its forecast and has not assumed any significant contributions from its Fintech(Dify) and Gaming(YoYo Games) initiatives in its FY '21 guidance. Assuming moderate success from these initiatives where Opera is investing over $100M, Opera should easily grow at upwards of 30% YoY for the next several years and reach around $500M revenue in FY \u201823 at 25%+ AEBITDA margins.\n\n**Opera's Minority Stake**\n\n* **Opay -** Opay is leading mobile money wallet in Nigeria and has expanded to Egypt in early '21. In 2019, Opay raised $170M at a valuation of $500M in external funding from Softbank, Meituan and was doing $300M in transaction processing volume(TPV) per month. Since then it has grown to over 10 million MAUs. In 2020, Opay TPV/month grew 4.5 times -- from $450M in Jan to $2B in December. Most recently in June'21, Opay raised $400M at a $2B valuation. Opera also monetized 29% of its preferred share stake for $50M and has left around 8% of stake to participate in future growth of Opay.\n* **Starmaker -** Starmaker app, which has an installed base of over 100 million users,  is a social network for music lovers and Karaoke artists and is top 5 grossing music app in google play store in South East Asia, Middle East, South Asia and Europe.  When Opera invested $30M for a19.35% stake in Nov'18, it had a $17M run rate.  Since then it has been growing like a wildfire -- a CAGR of 157% in 2.5 years --  with YoY growth accelerating recently to 250% to  $180M Q1 '21 run rate and with sequential acceleration of 41% from $127M Q4'20 run rate.\n* **Nanobank -** Nanobank offers Micro lending and other financial services to the underbanked and underserved population in India, Indonesia, Kenya and Mexico via its mobile apps. Last year, Opera merged its micro lending operations in India and Kenya with Mobi Magic to form Nanobank for a 42% stake. Nanobank collectively has over 50 million users of its mobile app and has recently expanded into Mexico with credit card features for its underbanked population. Nanobank was growing revenue at a CAGR of 295% pre covid - scaling from $22M Q1 '19 revenue at 24% AEBITDA margin to $92M  Q4 '19 revenue at 41% AEBITDA margin. It has not yet completely recovered from covid in its largest market India and had $57M Q1 \u201821 revenue at 3% AEBITDA margin. Opera has stated that, with the expansion of Nanobank in Mexico and other Latin American countries, they expect Nanobank to come to pre covid quarterly revenue run rate of $120M at 30%+ AEBITDA margin next year.\n\n**Opera SUM-OF-PART valuation**\n\n1. **Conservative/Bear Case**\n\nStarmaker announced 3x growth in 2020 and $127m run rate at the end of Q4 \u201820. In Q1 \u201821, it has revenue run rate of $180M. I am using $45M as Q1 revenue and applying sequential growth of 25%, 15% and 5% to get to Q4 revenue of $68M.  Using arithmetic series sum over $45M Q1 \u201821 revenue and $68M Q4 \u201821 revenue gives 2021 revenue of $226m \\[ 4\\*(45+68)/2 \\]\n\nOpay does not report revenue run rate but TPV. Since Opay reported 4.5x TPV growth in 2020, TPV grew from $445M in January 2020 to $2B in December 2020. I am taking arithmetic series sum to get the total TPV of $14.7B for 2020 \\[12 \\* (445 + 2000)/2 \\] . Although Opera did not reveal the TPV for March 2021, they stated that the TPV is growing nicely. Along with additional product launches in additional countries, I am projecting 2x growth in TPV in 2021(a deceleration from 4.5x growth in 2020), with a TPV of $2B for Jan 2021 and $4B for Dec 2021. Taking the arithmetic series sum gives an expected 2021 TPV of $36B. I have looked at airtel Mobile Money and M-pesa revenue to TPV ratio ( 0.008 for airtel and 0.006 for M-pesa). Applying the average of 0.007 revenue to TPV ratio, gives Opay 2020 revenue of $103M and 2021 revenue of $252M. Currently Opay services are heavily discounted so their take rate is much lower than more established players like airtel and M-Pesa. Opay reported 2020 revenue of $69M and I am forecasting $21M as Q1 \u201821 revenue and applying 20% sequential growth rate through FY \u201821 gives Q4 \u201821 revenue of $37M. Using Arithmetic series sum, gives forecasted FY \u201821 revenue of $116M.\n\nBefore we do the sum of the part valuation of Opera, let's look at comparable companies :\n\n* Upstart holding(UPST), which is growing 200% YoY in FY \u201821,  is trading at 20x revenue multiple. It has a lower margin profile than Nanobank though . However, I am using only 6x multiple for Nanobank since it is projected to grow revenue at 29% compared to 100% for UPST. Nanobank is expected to achieve pre covid revenue run rate of $120M in Q1 \u201822 and as per my estimate, it should grow more than 100% YoY in FY\u201922.\n* Pinterest and Snap commanded a 50-70x revenue multiple during their 150% growth phase. I am using 8x multiple for starmaker.\n* Klarna, AfterPay, Square commanded 30-40x revenue multiple during 200+% revenue growth, I am using 8x revenue multiple for Opay\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\nThe above sum of part analysis is done using a super conservative valuation just to highlight the massive disconnect in market valuation of Opera\u2019s stock price. Opera and all its minority stakes are in hyper growth mode, and if one were to apply growth multiples, it can easily more than double this conservative sum-of-part valuation.\n\n1. **Base Case**\n\nThe base case assumes the market will give Opera\u2019s high gross margin(\\~95%) and 25-30% AEBITDA business, a higher multiple with a revenue forecasted to grow at 25% for next several years and valuing Opay and Starmaker which are growing upwards of 150% YoY a 30 to 40 multiple which similar companies have commanded during their hyper growth phase.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n1. **Bull Case**\n\nAs if Opera is not undervalued enough, Opera also has 2 new growth initiatives which could offer \\*significant\\* additional upside to base case.\n\n* Opera has ambitious growth plans with a new fintech initiative, called Dify, in Europe. What I like is the tight coupling of Cashback/Coupons/Payment/CryptoWallet in the browser. Imagine 10% of 50M users of opera browser in Europe use dify, and spend an average of $500/year, Opera could get $2.5B/year of transactions/payment through them. If average cashback is 5% of transaction amount and Opera\u2019s take rate is 30%, dify\u2019s revenue will be $38M/year. Although too soon, if Opera\u2019s is successful in getting 10% of its browser users in Europe to use Dify or gain additional browser users due to popularity of Dify and launch additional product like BNPL, one could argue that Dify, in itself, can grow into $1-2B business in next couple of years. You can see how Klarna, Afterpay are valued in private/public valuations today. For comparison, think Honey, which Paypal bought in 2018 for $4B dollars, for 14 million users generating $100M of revenue and the Cashback aspect of Dify is just one part of the overall Dify value proposition.\n* Opera also recently bought YoYo Games, makers of the popular indie 2D game engine, game maker. Time will tell if they can compete against powerhouses like Unity or Roblox, but you have to give the benefit of doubt to Yahui Zhou, the 60% owner of Opera. He has a knack for identifying boring assets and turning them into growth engines. Who would have thought that the Opera Browser business, which he bought for $600M, can launch many new and exciting businesses and also grow its core with differentiated offerings. We just need to wait and see what the future brings for this.\n* Opera also bought a bank in Europe, Fjord Bank. They have not shared their plans on what they are going to do here, but if they have ambition to be neobank like N26 or revolut, Opera can quickly scale this neobank given its large user base. They can offer investment services once they reach critical mass as part of this fintech offering.\n\nAssuming Dify and Gaming takes off, I do expect significant revenue expansion of Opera Core from $250M-260M in FY \u201821(55% YoY growth), to $360-380M in FY \u201822( 45% YoY growth), and to $480-520M in 2023(26% YoY). This growth would be at 20-30% AEBITDA margin. This type of growth commands a revenue multiple of 20+.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**Catalyst**\n\n* Continued momentum in Opera Ads, improved monetization of Opera News in US and Europe can provide upside to conservative FY '21 guidance of $245M by $10-$15M\n* Scale out of its fintech initiative Dify to Germany and France to its 50 million MAUs in Europe at low CAC will yield additional revenue upside. Paypal bought Honey for $4B for its 14 million users generating $100M in annual revenue in 2018. If Opera can convert 10-15% of its 50 million users to its Dify/Cashback product, It can contribute $50M+ of incremental revenue in FY '22.\n* Continued growth in its minority stakes - Nanobank, Starmaker and OPay will provide additional upside to already low valuation.\n* A funding event/IPO of Nanobank and Starmaker can further unlock value of its minority stakes.\n* Continued momentum in Opera GX along with launch of Gamebox service will bring a viral effect and can help Opera double its Opera GX MAUs from 10 million to 20 million by early next year, bringing in additional $30M of FY'22 revenue.\n* A potential partnership with Oprah, and marketing Opera as Oprah's browser could bring in visibility and brand awareness in the US and can help Opera gain additional 10+ million users of its product in the US)\n* Continued scrutiny and regulation of big tech in the US and Europe is positive for smaller players like Opera.\n* Once Opera gets institution visibility, I think it can easily trade into $50+ after getting growth multiple.\n\n**Short Report**\n\nOpera was the target of [Hindenburg short report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/opera-phantom-of-the-turnaround/) back in Jan 2020. more than 18 months have passed since then time has proven that short thesis wrong. With the benefit of time on my side, following is the rebuttal to that short report.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F\\_3HbFJ2\\_vQeKWl\\_JEzgbH7fJXZzniAtMSm80pqBows/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F_3HbFJ2_vQeKWl_JEzgbH7fJXZzniAtMSm80pqBows/edit)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOverall, I think risk-reward weigh heavily on Opera long side and offer significant upside opportunity to patient investors.\n\n*Disclosure/Disclaimer : \\*\\*\\*This is not investment advice or recommendation.

They are chinese so hard to trust. Company could be taken private and nobody knows if they will be relisted.

A place where degens can be degens by going jacked to the tits in leverage up to 100X on any amount.\n\nso I got \"lucky\" on a few beginner calls and used 100X Leverage on 2,000 to trade 200,000 futures positions that I closed out every 10-15 mins for CRAZYY GAINS.\n\n4 Hours Later.....\n\nI had $30,000 and FUCK YEAH BAYBEE WE ARE SOO CLOSE TO $1 million USD to fuel our WhenLambo Dreams.\n\nThen I went long on this decentralize currency platform again with 30k but now at 10x Leverage so essentially it is 10x less risk than 100x leverage. Ohh yeah baybee I was Chad the investor you only hope to be...\n\nMy legal middle name was \"Risk Management\" and I can already hear the Lambo engine RoAr!\n\nThen the FUCK train comes along and the whales dump almost $3 Billion USD of El Salvadors National Currency in 1 go and FUUUUCK it hit my liquidation price of 41k FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK\n\nnow I only have 10k left, but hey I started with 2k loan from Paypal so who gives a shit.\n\nI shut down the computer and sleep for 20 hours to kill the Trading Depression.\n\n20 Hours Later....\n\nI go on a montage of WallStreetBets Youtube videos and get the ballz to YOLO my last 10k into DeFi Lottery tickets.\n\nHere we Are now:\n\nI lost all my holdings when said national currency of El Salvador has a candle wick down to 41k a few days ago\n\nso I just YOLOed the last 9k I had on a Defi lottery in which I can win double or nothing.\n\n(I will know if I won in 1 hour, update coming soon!)\n\nTHIS IS MY OFFICIAL APPLICATION TO DEGEN-APE STATUS @ WSB",

        "selftext": "Good morning degenerates, autists, and intellectually deficients.\n\nI have been lurking on this sub for the longest time, occasionally making some money on the juicy DDs posted here. Today, I felt like giving back by shining some light on 2 companies that have seemingly been forgotten by our community (retards typically have poor working memory, so you are forgiven). I can't write for shit, so here are some facts in bullet points detailing each play (fundamentals and catalysts/reason to bag hold).\n\n# Proterra\n\n**Fundamentals :**\n\n* NTM TEV / Revenues = 4.88\n* NTM TEV / EBITDA = 23.10\n* Liabilities as a percentage of TEV = 34.1%\n* Mean street target (tip ranks) = 15.50 (46,78% upside, backed by BofA and Citigroup)\n\n**Catalyst :**\n\n* Infrastructure bill baby. $39 billion USD for public transit, with around $7.5 going directly towards replacing buses. Biggest competitor of PTRA on the EV bus market is a chinese company. Thankfully, a NDAA that was passed in a bipartisan fashion a year ago provides a restriction on funding to be used from a federal transit agency to a Chinese owned or operated company.\n* What specific aspects of the infrastructure bill might advantage PTRA (according to John Allen in the 08-11-2021 press release) :\n   * $800 million a year for 5 years guaranteed\n   * $2.5 billion, up to $5 billion for electric school buses\n   * $2.25 billion to electrify the ports\n   * $7.5 billion for charging infrastructure\n\n**Good reasons to buy in general :**\n\n* Only american EV bus company that also sells charging infrastructure, batteries, and powertrain\n   * Partnership with Thomas (school buses), LG (battery components), Vanhool (coaches), Frieghtliner (delivery trucks), Optimal EV (airport and hospital transit), Komatsu (construction equipment), Lightning motors (sprinter vans)\n* 2 decades of experience in a very young market with plenty of space to grow\n   * Bus with the biggest battery capacity and milage (300-ish miles compared to european buses with 100-200 miles)\n* Politically indifferent\n   * Conservative = protectionism = good for American PTRA\n   * Liberals = weird taxes on carbon emitting businesses = good for PTRA\n\n**The play :**\n\n* Expect a bump in price and price targets when the infrastructure deal passes.\n* Hold that shit till 2035\n\n# Paya Holdings, Inc.\n\n**Fundamentals :**\n\n* NTM TEV / Revenues = 5.05\n* NTM TEV / EBITDA = 18.22\n* Liabilities as a percentage of TEV = 61.7%\n* Mean street target (tip ranks) = 14.50 (44.71% upside, backed by Morgan Stanley, Truist, BTIG)\n\n**Catalyst :**\n\n* Voting to cut warrant-sponsored dilution from 17.7 mil shares to 4.6 mil shares happening on september 10.\n\n**Good reasons to buy in general :**\n\n* Very good multiples for a double digit growth company compared to peers (Paypal, Square, etc.).\n* Profitable as fuck @ 25.7% EBITDA margins\n* Institutions buying up like crazy with zero institution holding a net short position.\n* IV low as hell.\n\n**The play :**\n\n* Expect a bump in price on September 10.\n* Hold or sell that shit after it pops to 15$. You do you.\n\nProof of positions : [https://imgur.com/gallery/Ch54jd6](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ch54jd6)\n\n**8000 shares of PAYA @ 10.42 + 100 Sep17'21 10C @ 1.05**\n\n**6000 shares of PTRA @ 11.08**",

        "selftext": "Listen up you autistic retards this shit is serious. Coinbase has basically been hoeing hardcore since its direct listing in April. This bitch has been getting reamed 4 and a half months and counting but \\*cue picture\\* let's take a look at the chart and see what's up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CB Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/aqjaxo37nvk71.png?width=2358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=478a56b2d64a8f5278121224d85d13646b93ade2)\n\nNow i ain't no fucking artist and i may have a learning disability but I know a cup when i see one and if you look at this chart, even in ur peripheries you'll notice a small cup and handle that's formed in between the support lines, you'll also notice the middle support line recently did an r/S flip i.e. went from being a resistance line to support line.\n\nNow with the small cup in place it may be high time for Coinbase to continue this trend up and fill up the bigger cup by flying back to the 420-450 range. Also the velocity at which alt currencies move if there is a decent rally in the next few weeks, there's potential this sees an even bigger push to go back up where it came from. The MACD looks bullish with potentially indicating this reversal will become a rally. \n\n However, the fundamentals are also insanely undervalued right now. I'm talking this thing has a mufuckin current PE ratio of 28 only considering the first 2 quarters this year i.e. NOT COUNTING any estimates from q3 and q4 this year. I'm talking they made rev of about a billion dollars in FY2020 with about 350 mill in net income, Q1 2021 they made over 1.6 billion in revenue and more than doubled net income relative to the ENTIRE PREVIOUS YEAR.  Q2 2021 they made revenue of 2.23 billion netting 1.6 fucking billion in a damn quarter. They're literally reaching exponential growth as we speak and lets be honest the industry they're in is primed to grow substantially in the foreseeable future. Now if you look at their guidance for q3 and q4 they are not expecting to beat the net income of q2 but they also expect continued profitability and could potentially beat forecasts IF certain coins that are traded on their platform rally hard. For comparison, Square is trading at a FORWARD PE (2024) of 73, PayPal FORWARD PE 2024 of 32, I could go on and on. So really their current annual PE is considerably less than 28 once earnings come in for q3 and q4.\n\nThis is a cash cow of a company fundamentals and technicals seem to be aligning nicely. I think you can't go wrong with far out leaps however you must know that I am retarded and you would be an even bigger retard if you listened to me, jk you prolly can't even read so I'm not worried.\n\nTL:DR COIN to the moon fam!!!",

        "selftext": "Hey gang!\n\nMarkets were cruising for a good portion of the day before pulling back a bit. Really kind of a muted day for the markets as a whole, with the exception of the IWM charging nearly a full percent. That's good for our small caps! With markets stagnating and the VIX rising, tomorrow's market movement will depend on the nonfarm payroll numbers, which are released before the market opens. \n\nSome analysts are expecting the ending of expanded federal unemployment benefits to surge job numbers. If this month's payroll numbers disappoint, I expect next months to obliterate expectations as people will go back to work in some capacity and seasonal hiring will start picking up. \n\nObligatory: these are not stock recommendations, **this does not constitute financial advice - if you need that kind of advice contact your broker**, I'm just analyzing unusual option data, (so if you don't see your favorite stonk, don't take it personally) please do you own DD, replaying the best Star Wars game ever made Knights of the Old Republic (someone commented about this yesterday but it got swept away), etc. etc. etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|STOCK|PRICE|VOLUME (AVG)|CALLS% - PUTS%|MOST ACTIVE|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|BBIG|7.99|458.3K (74K)|89 - 11|Sept 20c (33.7K)|\n|RAAS\\*|5.68|28.4K (681)|86 - 14|Sept 7.5c (11.3K), Sept 5p (2.8K)|\n|KPLT\\*|5.53|96.2K (7.1K)|94 - 6|Sept 7.5c (20K)|\n|NXE\\*|5.44|3.7K (933)|91 - 9|Sept 5c (471)|\n|MMAT\\*|5.76|71.7K (30.1K)|89 - 11|Sept 5c (12.6K)|\n|GSAT|2.08|146.5K (24.1K)|89 - 11|Sept 2.5c (40.4K)|\n|MILE|4.44|43K (3.2K)|96 - 4|Sept 5c (14.6K)|\n|DNN|1.40|37.9K (7.7K)|95 - 5|Oct 2c (8K), Jan 23 2c (6.1K)|\n|INFI|3.82|30.5K (2.8K)|99 - 1|Oct 5c (16.5K)|\n|SWN|4.89|25.2K (7.6K)|89 - 11|Sept 4.5c (9.7K)|\n|PROG|1.05|21.8K (2.5K)|95 - 5|Sept 1c (4.8K), Jan 1.5c (2.9K)|\n|HIPO|4.39|16.1K (2.3K)|57 - 43|Oct 6c (3.1K), Sept 4p (1.9K)|\n|YVR|2.05|12.5K (1.2K)|100 - 0|Sept 2.5c (8.8K)|\n|CRVS|2.72|10.6K (84)|100 - 0|Sept 2.5c (5.3K), Sept 5c (5K)|\n|WTRH|1.28|9.6K (2.5K)|97 - 3|Sept 1.5c (2.2K)|\n|UEC|2.84|8.1K (3.3K)|96 - 4|Sept 2.5c (1.1K)|\n|HMY|3.53|4.9K (1.3K)|88 - 12|Jan 4c (3.7K)|\n|ADTX|1.80|3.8K (1K)|96 - 4|Oct 2.5c (1.5K)|\n|ALZN|3.35|3.7K (1K)|98 - 2|Sept 5c (2.4K)|\n|AMPE|1.73|3.4K (1.5K)|84 - 16|Sept 2c (987)|\n|CBIO|4.75|3.3K (614)|92 - 8|Oct 5c (780)|\n|WWR|3.92|3.1K (1.7K)|95 - 5|Feb 5c (1K)|\n|CRTD|3.37|3K (765)|97 - 3|Sept 5c (1.9K)|\n|JG|2.36|3K (375)|79 - 21|Oct 5c (762)|\n|REPH|2.45|2.9K (569)|99 - 1|Apr 2.5c (1.4K), Apr 7.5c (872), Apr 5c (600)|\n\n\\* denotes the stock started the day below $5/share\n\nNotes:\n\n**BBIG -15%** Experienced the inverse of yesterday, as there wasn't enough gas to keep on the upward pressure. 781.7K calls vs 173.5K puts in the OI heading into the trading session. 407.9K calls, 50.4K puts, and over 105 million shares traded today. BBIG just opened up weekly options, which I'm sure is going to blow up several people's accounts. If you're in the play for the \"proxy\", I wouldn't go with short term options, as theta will eat you alive. OI numbers are starting to shift heavily toward September expiration. \n\n**RAAS +21.8%** Was trading at $5.91 in the mid-day report. No news for the cloud-based communications company from China. Interesting that with a super bullish day, the second most active option are puts. Will they print tomorrow?\n\n**KPLT +15.8%** Was trading at $5.43 in the mid-day report. No news. Very popular stocks across social media right now. \n\n**NXE +10.3%** No news. Apparently uranium demand has been rising for months, according to u/Epraksemet_Nalej**.** Always interesting when a stock has elevated option activity, but one option hardly stands out from the rest. \n\n**MMAT +16%** In the mid-day report, MMAT was trading at $5.18. No news. \n\n**GSAT +11.1%** Was trading at $2.27 in the earlier report.  GSAT filed an 8-K update describing receipt of \"an additional advance payment of $37.5 million from a customer...\". The company will use the funds to repay some debt. Saw some saying \"Is this coming from Apple?\" Most likely no, as Apple isn't a customer of theirs. The Apple news was tied to the iPhone having Qualcomm chips. QCOM is a GSAT customer. \n\n**MILE +6.2%** Traded at $4.41 in the early report. I hate the amount of mail this company sends me. I don't want your pay-per-mile auto insurance, thx.  Big sweeps for ATM calls. \n\n**DNN +8.5%** Was trading at $1.36 in the early report. Again, apparently uranium is entering a super cycle. Multiple large (2,000+) orders for options at the $2 strike in both October and January 2023.\n\n**INFI +6.4%** In the mid-day edition, was trading at $3.80.  Announced they will participate in Wells Fargo's Healthcare Conference and H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference, both virtually. Notable that the most activity is for October calls. \n\n**SWN +4%** In the mid-day edition, was trading at $4.88. Completed acquisition of Indigo Natural Resources and updated 2021 free cash flow guidance. \n\n**PROG +7.4%** Traded at $1.02 in the early report. No news that I could find. Large sweeps for LEAPS. \n\n**HIPO -14.7%.** Traded at $4.38 in the early report. Has fallen 60% since it's SPAC-based IPO in January. Today marks the day private investment in public equity investors are able to unload their shares as per the merger agreement. Still a lot of call traders. \n\n**YVR +12%** Traded at $2.12 in the early report. Has given back 4.8% AH. Signed an agreement to acquire iNDIEFLIX, an \"edutainment\" company. \n\n**CRVS +16.7%** No news that I could find. Half of the unusual volume came from 5,000 bear call spreads with September options - sell the $2.50 call, buy the $5 call for upside protection. \n\n**WTRH -7.25%** Traded at $1.33 in the early report.  Supposedly one of the most shorted penny stocks, but these rumors are unsubstantiated. Perhaps someone can dig up the ortex numbers. \n\n**UEC +10.94%** Traded at $2.78 in the early report. Uranium stocks getting a lot of love today. Through UEC's finviz page I did find an interesting write up about uranium stocks that cited GLJ Research raised its price target on uranium mining company Cameco. The analyst for GLJ sees massive upside for uranium spot prices. Hmm if all of these uranium stocks hopped one one analysts recommendation, will the gains hold/continue or revert back a little bit? Worthwhile to note that the article I pulled this information from was published by notorious hedge fund The Motley Fool, who very well could be short uranium. \n\n**HMY -4.34%** Traded at $3.47 in the early report.  Released earnings either yesterday or the day before, I can't tell (conflicting sources). Two orders each for 1,750 Jan $4 calls under the \"Stock Contingent\" condition. \n\n**ADTX -1.64%** Back on the list after a brief absence. No news. \n\n**ALZN +5.68%** Traded at $3.32 in the early report. No news that I could find. Single order for 1,061 September $5 calls. \n\n**AMPE +6.13%** No news driving option/price movement that I could find. \n\n**CBIO -1.45%** Finally some different stocks other than the March bear call spreads as the most active. No news.  \n\n**WWR +1.29%** No news, and I don't think I've ever heard of this company before. They hold interests in a graphite project in Alabama. Formerly known as Uranium Resources, Inc, so potential Uranium sympathy play? Most popular options are pretty far out, could be a big short hedging their position. \n\n**CRTD -0.59% (+2% AH).** No news that I could find. \n\n**JG +15.12%** I couldn't find a direct reason for JG's big gain today. First time hearing about this Chinese mobile developer service provider. Always interesting when there's elevated option activity but not a single one stands out. \n\n**REPH -0.81%** Traded at $2.55 in the early report.  Apr ratio spreads continue to be the most active. \n\nIf anyone has any questions about anything, by all means, don't hesitate to reach out either here or by DM. I float the DM option out there because you might think something is too embarrassing to ask about, or you're new or whatever, but please just ask someone. Knowledge is the best weapon. \n\n*To reiterate - I DON'T PICK THESE STOCKS. They qualify by having elevated (at least 1.4x) option activity compared to normal. I'll be more than happy to check a stock's option activity for you, but save the \"wHaT aBoUt mY sToNk iTs gOiNg mOoN!\" type comments.* \n\nShout out to \"random ticker comment with no context\" gang!\n\nboom",

The original version can be found [here](https://babbl.substack.com/p/labor-day-weekend-and-more-bullish)\n\n**TLDR:** stock market news sentiment remains significantly bullish for yet another week in a row, driven by optimistic monthly reports released for the month of August and continued upward trends from the SP500 and global cryptocurrency market.\n\n# 1. This Week\u2019s News Sentiment \ud83d\udcf0\n\nAs we commence our first week of Autumn 2021, stock market news remains just as bullish as it was to end the summer. News coverage this week was relatively unchanged in terms of sentiment compared to last week. Overall, the average finance article written this week scored a 0.35 in terms of sentiment (meaning that just over 1-in-3 sentences written about the markets this week leaned optimistically) and a 0.63 in terms of time-sense expressed (meaning that almost 2-in-3 sentences published this week were written in future tense). Here\u2019s a look at the major news events driving the continued all-time high bullish sentiment this past week:\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Stocks: The major U.S. stock indexes traded in a narrow range all week, but the S&amp;P 500 managed to post a modest gain for the second week in a row.1 The NASDAQ outperformed its peers for the second consecutive week while the Dow fell slightly. Despite sustaining a mid-month decline, the S&amp;P 500 recovered to record its seventh positive month in a row, posting a return of about 3% in August. The index reached 12 record closing highs in the month versus 7 in July.\n\n\u20bf Cryptos: Much of this week\u2019s news optimism can be attributed to the continued meteoric rise in cryptocurrency prices. Global cryptocurrency market capitalization grew 11.5% this week to $2.4T dollars to cap off the largest month in history in terms of cryptocurrency trading volume. The majority of crypto-related headlines this week came on the back of Ethereum ($ETH) which rose more than 20% to $3,935.17 per coin this week at the time of this writing; other big crypto movers this week include Solana ($SOL) and Bitcoin ($BTC) as it eyes its first \u201cgolden cross\u201d since May 2020.\n\n\ud83e\udd85 Economy: While news optimism remains relatively high overall, time-sense fell slightly this week as a slew of monthly economic reports were released for the month of August. A private report showed that the U.S. economy recorded its 15th consecutive monthly gain in manufacturing activity in August. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index rose 0.4% to 59.9. Any reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing activity. We also saw August\u2019s monthly job report this week. The economy generated 235,000 new jobs last month, far short of economists\u2019 expectations and trailing gains of nearly 1.1 million in July and 962,000 in June.

The most mentioned tickers in this week\u2019s news and the tickers with the biggest volume increase compared to last week are shown here: [most mentioned tickers 8/30-9/3](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d976bee-76fb-40f8-b7b7-1a97515e6ff3_1230x753.png)\n\n\ud83c\udf4e Apple ($AAPL): For the second consecutive week, $AAPL was mentioned more in news coverage than any other ticker in finance articles scraped this week. A mainstay of our weekly most-mentioned list, Apple Inc. churns news headlines, whether or not there\u2019s actually significant news to report about the company or its stock. Following the 10-year anniversary of Tim Cook\u2019s tenure as Apple CEO last week \u2014 as part of which he received $750M in $AAPL share value under the terms of his contract \u2014 headlines this week centered around an open letter written to Cook by Apple employees presenting a litany of grievances including concerns about privacy and diversity within the company. Apple also saw headlines from outside the workplace this week, as regulators from around the world mount pressure on the company\u2019s current App Store policy, accusing Apple of exerting too much control (ex. a 30% commission on in-app purchases) on developers who use it to sell products.\n\n\u201cWhat is Apple Thinking?\u201d | The New York Times\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd27 Automatic Data Processing Inc. ($ADP): The ticker with the biggest increase in news headlines this week compared to last week was $ADP. The stock fell a slight -0.86% last week and has now dropped nearly 3% over the past month to $207.38 per share as the company plans to go ex-dividend on September 9th. This means investors who purchase and settle shares of $ADP before this upcoming Thursday will be eligible to receive the company\u2019s $0.93 dividend payment per share, which will be paid out on October 1st. Automatic Data Processing\u2019s previous dividend payment consumed approximately 61% of the company\u2019s free cash flow last year, and while this is in the normal range for most dividend-paying organizations, analysts seem to agree that the decision bodes well for the company\u2019s long-term strategy by freeing up some space on their margins during a relatively lean period in its history as a business. Overall news sentiment for $ADP scored a +41.05% on a scale from -100% to +100%, signaling relatively bullish sentiment to boot over the past week.\n\n\u201cAutomatic Data Processing, Inc.

Even though we saw relatively low amounts of pessimism in this week\u2019s news coverage across the board, $SHIB saw more pessimism expressed in articles this week than any other ticker, as the fringe cryptocurrency reached its lowest price of the past month on Tuesday (a whopping $0.000006735 per coin \u2014 yes, that\u2019s five zeroes after the decimal) as its developers announced that they\u2019d be removing a portion of the existing $SHIB supply from circulation. Though $SHIB price rose considerably heading into the weekend and continues to trend upwards at the time of this writing, it\u2019s still down 11% in value over the past month. Keep in mind that the coin \u2014 which was created in April as a blatant meme and borderline Ponzi scheme in response to the meteoric rise in the price of Dogecoin early this year \u2014 has grown 45x in value since its inception four months ago. In other words: a $1,000 investment in Shiba Inu Coin back in April is now worth somewhere around $42,000.

($FE): The stock with the most speculative (ie. future-tense) sentiment measured in the news coverage this week was FirstEnergy (speculation score: 95.4%). $FE stock 2.86% this week to $39.59 to cap a 34.16% run in share price year-to-date as the energy utility company has benefited from improving electricity demand in recent months. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. retail electricity sales are likely to inch up 2.7% in 2021 after sliding 3.9% in 2020. Given the growth in demand, coupled with FirstEnergy\u2019s 96.5% earnings growth this year and given that its stock is still trading 52.8% below its estimated fair value (according to Simply Wall St.), analysts speculate that its stock is set to remain a handsome mid- to long-term investment. Analysts also cite $FE\u2019s 14% return on equity (ROE) as a reassuring sign that the company is growing in value and effectively managing investors\u2019 money.

Presented below are the tickers that saw the biggest change in each of our four sentiment metrics this week compared to last: [image](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68ffb0c2-1e95-4b38-b913-cf5a9e81061e_2038x769.png)\n\n\ud83d\udcbd Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) saw the largest increase in optimism expressed this week compared to last week after $AMD stock broke resistance above $109 per share early in the week; analysts at Benzinga say the stock has now settled into its second bullish pattern of the past month. On Wednesday, it was reported the U.S. Department of Energy was nearing a deal worth $500 million to purchase a supercomputer made with AMD and NVIDIA Corp.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Coinbase Inc. ($COIN) recorded the largest increase in pessimism expressed this week despite the stock rallying 8.62% to $278.44 per share. This increase in pessimism can be widely attributed to a handful of contrarian, negative articles published by the likes of the Motley Fool and SeekingAlpha arguing that the underlying volatility of digital assets makes Coinbase an inherently risky stock to invest in.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Hewlett Packard Enterprises Co. ($HPE) posted the biggest increase in speculative language expressed this week compared to last as the stock remained relatively flat over the trading period, rising just 0.06% to $15.67 per share. Much of the speculation surrounding the company\u2019s lackluster earnings report released early in the week, in which the company\u2019s continued supply chain issues showed through. Analysts wonder if HP\u2019s component supply concerns will continue.\n\n\ud83d\udc89 Moderna Inc. ($MRNA) received the biggest increase in reactive language expressed after increasing in stock price by more than 13% to $416.70 per share on strong trading volume and new research released this week suggesting that the company\u2019s COVID-19 shot may offer longer-lasting protection that Pfizer\u2019s amid growing conversation about the importance (or lack thereof) of booster shots.\n\n# 4. Market Mood Outlook \ud83c\udf21\ufe0f\ud83d\udd2d\n\nThis past week brought a close to the month of August and commenced the unofficial start of Fall 2021. In terms of market action, August was the 7th consecutive month of stock market growth, and the largest month in history in terms of cryptocurrency trade volume. This past week was no exception to the tremendous momentum in both realms, and news sentiment reflected this: stock market news articles published this week saw more optimism expressed on average than any other week this year except for one (the first week of August, the height of Q2 earnings).\n\nLooking ahead into September and October, the extreme optimism is showing no signs of slowing down as Wall Street expectations for the next stock market earnings season continue to rise. Over July and August, forecasts for third-quarter earnings of companies in the S&amp;P 500 rose 3.8%, according to FactSet. That\u2019s the fourth-largest such increase during the first two months of a quarter since 2009.\n\nWhile market bulls are currently reveling in the continued outperforms of stocks, market bears may be quick to point out that we are growing more and more due for some sort of correction. The S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t suffered a 5% pullback since October 2020. The last time the index experienced such a long period without a big drop was from June 2016 to early February 2018. With that in mind, we will continue to watch the progression of international economic factors like the COVID-19 Delta variant and the transition to Taliban rule in Afghanistan for any inkling of adverse impact on the U.S. stock market. That\u2019s all for today\u2019s report; good luck this week everyone, and thanks for reading. \ud83d\ude4f",

The CRM stock was from the result of Slack acquisition. \n\nFor Intel, I'm waiting to see how their big.Little CPUs and ARC GPUs will perform in reviews. If the reviews are good, I'm going big in Intel. There is usually a huge lag between a reviews of CPUs/GPUs to Wallstreet reacting. For example, AMD Zen2 was going to be a massive success if you read the reviews. Wallstreet didn't react until many months later. In addition, the government will keep Intel alive no matter what because they need a domestic chip manufacturer. Lookout for a ton of government subsidies to Intel.\n\nFor Qualcomm, I'm betting that their Nuvia acquisition will allow them to move into the laptop/desktop market but it's a small bet right now. Again, I will wait for reviews of their first Nuvia product before deciding if I want to buy more because of the lag between reviews and Wallstreet reacting.\n\nSo far, I've beaten S&amp;P500 last year and this year so far.",
