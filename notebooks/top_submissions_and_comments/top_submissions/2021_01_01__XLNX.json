        "selftext": "AMD is reporting their Q4 2020 results on the 26th. As a long-term investor and given all the events in the past months I believe AMD is still undervalued at $90. I\u2019ve made a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kwfxp7/amd_still_undervalued_at_95/) about this but there was some news last week which I incorporated in here is well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Intel struggles**\n\nLast week Intel has announced that they will replace Bob Swan with Pat Gelsinger as their CEO. This has led to Intel stock going up 13% and AMD dropping 5-6%. Intel is trading above(!) above the stock price they were when they announced the delays in 7nm/5nm. I think this reaction is severely overdone. Note that Pat used to be CTO at Intel for many years and is not the fresh blood they need to turn this colossal company around. Also in the time he was CEO of VMware (since 2012) the stock only rose 60% which is not a great performance comparing it to competitors. Intel has already announced their Q4 ER will beat estimates but that was a given. The only thing that is relevant is their outlook, which is still going to be meager since a CEO impact the company over years time (see AMD themselves) . AMD popped 12% on Intel Q2 report when they first announced their delays. We could see something similar if Intel gives a weak guidance for the coming year(s)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMD Q4 and FY**\n\nEPS Q4 consensus estimate is 0.47 with a range between 0.43 to 0.58. I believe revenue will be higher than expected, mainly due to the huge demand in the console market (PS5/Xbox) but also the PC/notebook market in general since half of the world was in (semi) lockdown for some parts of Q3/Q4. The main thing I am hoping for is that profit margin stays (roughly) the same at 44%, even though margins on consoles are very thin. If they manage to maintain a margin above 40%, EPS could end up 0.55, which would be a 360% increase with respect to Q4 2019 and 280% year on year. That would be very impressive, given the fact that AMD is considered to still be in their growth stage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2021&amp;2022 Outlook**\n\nBut the main thing to look out for is the guidance for the coming years. Given the continuing lockdowns, the fact that all the market segments they are in (consoles/PC\u2019s/laptops/servers) are booming and the fact that they have GPU\u2019s that can go head to head with NVDA\u2019s I think they could raise their outlook for the coming year as well as 2022. Especially when the Xilinx merger goes trough and they have an increased TAM (total Accessible Market). Estimated EPS for the coming years are 1.83 and 2.42 but with all the mentioned tailwinds EPS targets of 2.00+ and 2.75 are not crazy. This would imply P/E\u2019s off 34 for 2022 which is lower than ASML\u2019s for example (50). Hence a stock price of 105-115 is a fair target in the short term and 137,50-145 as a long-term target.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Booming Market**\n\nFinally, we have been in the biggest bull market in a long time, mainly driven by central bank money. Biden is planning a 2.8T stimulus package in the coming weeks. The rising tide has lifted all boats, leading to insane PE valuations across the markets (Lemonade trading at 150x FORWARD P/E for example). A forward PE of 34 for AMD is a way better bet in my opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPosition:\n\n2750 shares, 5000 LT warrants, 200 29Jan\u201921 100Calls.",

        "selftext": "**In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of AMD\ud83d\ude80, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone! Let\u2019s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles &amp; PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.\n\nThe company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.\n\nSo, guys, let\u2019s go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.\n\nThe [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing &amp; Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn\u2019t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can\u2019t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.\n\nBoth of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing &amp; graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn\u2019t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation &amp; amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation. \n\nThey have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest &amp; tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.\n\nThe company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 &amp; Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nTheir product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel\u2019s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.\ud83d\ude80\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world\u2019s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.\n\nThey have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also [working](https://ibb.co/D9dDDYs) with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings &amp; Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.\n\nAMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/N2YQFS9) \ud83d\ude80, which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/QH8RTCN) has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would [create](https://ibb.co/qJM6Gn4) synergies. [They](https://ibb.co/PcNhH58) are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it\u2019s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.\n\nAMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they [expect](https://ibb.co/RpcwXYr) an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nI used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA. \n\nFor the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.\n\nSo, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach. \n\nIf we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nFor my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.\n\nI think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high [demand](https://ibb.co/vQFwyRd) the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage &amp; digital currency mining.\n\nFor their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.\n\nThis means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest &amp; other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax. \n\nI [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.\n\nSo, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.\n\nI like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.   \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \n\nI think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, [THIS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40. \n\nSo [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nI think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more &amp; more chips that also keep advancing in technology. \n\nThe company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/NCtxnFq), with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once [Intel](https://ibb.co/pjHdVFQ) also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it\u2019s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years &amp; a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all. \n\nAMD hasn\u2019t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it\u2019s a psychological resistance rather.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it\u2019s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nOne last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their [shares](https://ibb.co/zZcxm95) held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.\n\nSo, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think [Lisa SU](https://ibb.co/X2nVGTF) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the [company](https://ibb.co/WtBf4yF) has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel\u2019s performance.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "I don't know much, but I know tech and AMD has A LOT going for it right now.\n\n[*Obligatory do your own research and draw your own conclusions statement.*]\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\n- Both Sony and Microsoft are using custom AMD APUs in their latest consoles. (APU = CPU + GPU combined into one.) In case you've been living under a rock for the past 8 weeks, both the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X have been selling like hotcakes, with fresh inventory being depleted within minutes. \n\n- AMD has been the underdog vs Intel in the consumer desktop CPU space for as long as I can remember. But for the first time in 15 years, [AMD is winning in terms of market share](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-overtakes-intel-in-desktop-cpu-market-share-for-the-first-time-in-15-years). Intel has been able to stay competitive with their latest generation of CPUs by offering significant discounts. Despite this, AMD's CPUs still remain in higher demand and sell out almost instantly (at MSRP). \n\n- AMD owns Radeon, which is their brand of Graphics Cards. These compete directly with Nvidia's RTX GPUs. Performance wise, they're up there with NVDA, but still lagging a bit in the ray tracing department which most will agree is the future. Key word being future, it's not a big deal *yet*. And thanks to the pandemic these too also sell out super quick. \n\n- AMD's next generation of mobile CPUs will be launching soon. Just like their desktop lineup, you can expect these to outperform their Intel counterparts as well. AMD's previous mobile generation of 4000 series chips crushed Intel - the biggest problem was availability. People wanted the AMD chips but for whatever reason, they were found mostly in the mid-range and lower end gaming laptops. I expect the availability issue to improve greatly this year. As we can see, certain manufacturer's like Asus are already featuring the AMD SKUs in their [top of the line gaming laptops](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ROG-Strix-Scar-17-ditches-Comet-Lake-H-for-an-unlocked-Ryzen-9-5900HX-with-liquid-metal-and-RTX-3080-Mobile.514702.0.html). \n\n**RISK FACTORS**\n\n- While speaking purely from a monetary standpoint, overall I think the pandemic has been a net positive for tech companies like AMD. However, AMD's own fearless leader Lisa Su recently said: [\"...the COVID environment has increased shipping and freight costs, which are hard to avoid. As we get into a more normal environment, this should improve. This also matters for our planned graphics updates through the first half of the year, as we have a lot of product coming to market.\"](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16409/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-interview-on-2021-demand-supply-tariffs-xilinx-and-epyc)\n\n- Unable to keep up with demand: [AMD and NVIDIA confirm that GPU stock levels will remain non-existent for the foreseeable future](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-and-NVIDIA-confirm-that-GPU-stock-levels-will-remain-non-existent-for-the-foreseeable-future.514957.0.html).\n[Microsoft has asked AMD for help in combating Xbox Series X stock shortages](https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-has-asked-amd-for-help-in-combating-xbox-series-x-stock-shortages)\n\n- Apple has already started producing their own in house ARM processors for both their laptops and desktops. This doesn't really affect AMD (yet) because [Apple has been using Intel chips in their laptops and desktops for the past 15 years.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/why-apple-is-breaking-a-15-year-partnership-with-intel-on-its-macs-.html#:~:text=Menu-,Apple%20is%20breaking%20a%2015%2Dyear%20partnership%20with,on%20its%20Macs%20%E2%80%94%20here's%20why&amp;text=Apple's%20new%20laptops%20and%20desktop,can%20improve%20laptop%20battery%20life.) And despite being a massive company, Apple only makes up about [13% of the PC market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/576473/united-states-quarterly-pc-shipment-shareapple/#:~:text=In%20the%20fourth%20quarter%20of,the%20fourth%20quarter%20of%202020.). AMD is still Apple's partner for discrete graphics, but that could change soon. This is definitely something you'll want to keep your eye on though because other titans like [Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/article/microsoft-processors-int/microsoft-working-on-in-house-chips-for-its-servers-pcs-idUSKBN28S2Y1), [Google](https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/04/google-is-making-its-own-chips.html), and Amazon are all either working on, or producing their own in house chips. In my opinion, this is not nearly as bad as it sounds. Let's break it down by company.\n\n - [Microsoft currently uses Intel-based processors for the majority of its Azure cloud services, and most of the company\u2019s Surface lineup run on Intel chips, too.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report#:~:text=Microsoft%20has%20worked%20with%20AMD,move%20away%20from%20just%20Intel.&amp;text=Microsoft%20co%2Dengineered%20an%20ARM,a%20couple%20of%20months%20ago.)

        "selftext": "Achronix is a fabless semiconductor company that sells FPGA, eFPGA, system level products and supporting design tools. With Xilinx acquired by AMD and Altera acquired by Intel (not really a competitor right now cause everything Intel touches turns into a pile of shit) , Achronix is currently the only independent high end FPGA and the only company providing both FPGA and eFPGA. It is estimated that in the future, we will see more FPGA nodes than CPU nodes. The ratio might be something like 1 CPU to 16 FPGAs as acceleration will outweigh general compute in the CPU. With FPGA being able to be implemented into data acceleration in AI, Cloud, 5G and autonomous driving, Achronix is well positioned and is capable to compete in multiple lucrative sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8gdur7umdqc61.png?width=1668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef15151c9d44d31430a0d33bcaab77798c190045\n\nFPGA is a highly valuable business due to its unlimited potential. Intel acquired Altera back in 2015 for $16.7 billion and with the latest acquisition of Xilinx by AMD for $35 billion. Achronix is currently sitting at around $2 bil valuation and is very undervalued given the competitive landscape (we might see an overpriced acquisition of Achronix in the future as both Intel and AMD paid well over the market valuation for both Altera and Xilinx and Achronix being the last one standing could help with the valuation as well). Ever since the acquisition of Altera, Intel has struggled to push for breaking through progress despite having to drop $30 bil on M&amp;As with very little return. The struggle has gone so far that Intel has been ordering chips from Achronix to produce accelerators. With the latest released Speedster 7t chips fabbed by TSMC on the 7nm nodes, Achronix is bringing serious threat to the top end FPGA market as the chip is able to go head to head with Xilinix\u2019s offerings at a considerably cheaper price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s0aqoi8pdqc61.png?width=1677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcceea136ee28b3a7f6eee5c6ae42000e9b5e161\n\nWhile a lot of the revenue comes from selling chips, Achronix also generates revenue from licencing IP. With the Gen 4 eFPGA IP, Achronix was able to increase performance by 60%, reduce power by 50%, shrink die area by 65% while retaining and building upon all of the original functional capabilities which makes it primed to be integrated into data acceleration in AI, Cloud, 5G and autonomous driving by incorporating it into design. eFPGA is said to be the future in many ways because of the advantages that it brings to the table because by adding an eFPGA to an SOC, it can achieve a more flexible design, lower power, higher performance and lower overall system costs compared to standalone FPGA. With Achronix being the only company providing high end eFPGA, the future is definitely looking bright for Achronix.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zdnffnrrdqc61.png?width=1803&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27ddfd1b4fddcd00ca3b426c3b55ba543314be77\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9kwrpq1vdqc61.png?width=1890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f09787bad7e9431568ea168efced6a782aa21135\n\nSince 2017, Achronix has experienced seven-fold growth and is still expanding rapidly. It received $238 mil orders in 2020 and has $162 mil orders of non-cancellable and non-refundable orders in backlog. It is projected to have a 30% yoy growth, retain a 76% margin and a 32% EBIT margin. Compared to other players in the fabless semiconductor industries, Achronix has the highest projected yoy growth with one of the highest gross margins.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dwcacy00eqc61.png?width=1791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=233758ee492c6c1047d7b688d880444a91867608\n\nTo put it in another perspective, outside for the industry, Acrhonix projected growth rivals the growth of a fintech company while having a margin like a SAAS company.  Average growth of a fintech company is projected to be around 25% through 2022 with paypal at around 19%, square at around 40% and sofi at around 30% ( I'm just listing a few here ) On the margin side, Saas companies usually has a gross margin of around 60% to 70% which makes them a really compelling sector to invest in cause once the demand picks up, income will increase significantly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, Achronix is going to be one hell of a long term play because\n\n1. It's the only company that sells eFPGA\n2. The only independent company that sells high end FPGA  chips\n3. Exposure to bleeding multiple edge high growth and high potential industries with high demand\n4. Potential overvalued acquisition from another company \n5. Growth like a fintech, Gross Margin like a Saas company (Literally can't get better than this)",

        "selftext": "Looks like after early rumors this week, the DA is officially out, so I thought I'd share some insights about Achronix's merger with $ACEV. It is currently trading \\~15% above NAV, and I consider it a strong buy right now. Please enjoy this quickly compiled post about ACEV/Achronix and why I think it's a great opportunity right now.\n\n[Achronix's position in the market serves as an attractive investment opportunity. Ridiculously strong financials at 76&amp;#37; gross margin.](https://preview.redd.it/ful5pypkr6a61.png?width=1277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1512d4d40dceaaa53a38507139f21081cc10a8d3)\n\n[Achronix already has 55 patents and $400M+ in CUMULATIVE ORDERS lined up.](https://preview.redd.it/o8za6bfpr6a61.png?width=1279&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e27e7741689a78f0b331b5dde67d06aa8700d78)\n\n[Achronix's management team is filled with experienced veterans in the industry.](https://preview.redd.it/u9ukproxr6a61.png?width=1277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77b6dc618db4f4f9c27a805dcd36741ae659acc1)\n\n[The company is poised to grow at \\~30&amp;#37; CAGR over the next 3 years.](https://preview.redd.it/ox3ms901s6a61.png?width=1278&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27d089e63c5c6361f507400d0d6b4eb95aed263d)\n\nFun facts:\n\n* It marks the **first time for a Korean PE firm** to set up a SPAC on the Nasdaq to acquire a US-based company. They don't plan to f\\*\\*\\* this up.\n* Founded in 2004, Achronix is one of the top five global fabless semiconductor companies and the **only independent supplier of high-performance field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)**. The profitable company is a key player in the global FPGA market alongside Intel Corp. and Xilinx.\n* The Silicon Valley-based FPGA maker's revenue in 2018 stood at around 67 billion won ($61.2 million), which surged to 115 billion won in 2020. This year, Achronix is expected to post 173 billion won in revenue. **Achronix will post \\~$160M in revenue for this year.**\n* Achronix's major clients include **Intel, Google, Microsoft and Samsung**. Achronix also licenses its intellectual property to **General Motors** for its advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). What a strong base of clients set-up for this company. Once the merger goes through, Achronix will gain more funding to scale their business.\n* Given its specialty in high volume and high speed data processing, **FPGAs are widely used for data centers, artificial intelligence, machine learning and 5G.** These industries are poised to grow significantly over the next few decades. Despite the buzzwords, they aren't buzzwords without validity. Achronix is positioned to serve these markets well.\n* The FPGA industry grabbed investors\u2019 attention when **Intel acquired programmable chip maker Altera in 2015 for approximately $16.7 billion**, followed by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) acquiring the leading FPGA maker Xilinx for $35 billion last year. As of today's writing, ACEV/Achronix's market cap sits at \\~$330M. In my opinion, it is severely undervalued right now.\n\nAlthough the initial rumors and Definitive Agreement came out this week across major publishers, the hype riding clean energy in SPACs overtook this announcement across the markets. **I expect this to be a strong long-term hold over the next decade. Currently, the SPAC trades at \\~15% above NAV.**\n\n[More details surrounding the merger.](https://preview.redd.it/waf6127ks6a61.png?width=985&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b48fb1bb2e5098cc9162e805e2071960388f8b6a)\n\nSource:\n\n(1) [https://www.achronix.com/sites/default/files/docs/Achronix\\_Ace\\_Merger\\_Presentation\\_VF.pdf](https://www.achronix.com/sites/default/files/docs/Achronix_Ace_Merger_Presentation_VF.pdf)\n\n(2) [https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202101080005?lang=us](https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202101080005?lang=us)\n\n(3) [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210107005892/en/Achronix-to-List-on-Nasdaq-Through-Merger-With-ACE-Convergence](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210107005892/en/Achronix-to-List-on-Nasdaq-Through-Merger-With-ACE-Convergence)\n\n(4) [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/achronix-is-said-in-talks-for-merger-with-blank-check-firm-ace](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/achronix-is-said-in-talks-for-merger-with-blank-check-firm-ace)",

        "selftext": "\\[I couldn't post yesterday: had to remove a link\\]\n\nAMD is reporting their Q4 2020 results on the 26th. As a long-term investor and given all the events in the past months I believe AMD is still undervalued at $90. I\u2019ve made a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kwfxp7/amd_still_undervalued_at_95/) about this but there was some news last week which I incorporated in here is well.\n\n**Intel struggles**\n\nLast week Intel has announced that they will replace Bob Swan with Pat Gelsinger as their CEO. This has led to Intel stock going up 13% and AMD dropping 5-6%. Intel is trading above(!) above the stock price they were when they announced the delays in 7nm/5nm. I think this reaction is severely overdone. Note that Pat used to be at Intel for many years and is not the fresh blood they need to turn this colossal company around. Also in the time he was CEO of VMware (since 2012) the stock only rose 60% which is not a great performance comparing it to competitors. Intel has already announced their Q4 ER will beat estimates but that was a given. The only thing that is relevant is their outlook, which is still going to be meager since a CEO impact the company over years time (see AMD themselves) . AMD popped 12% on Intel Q2 report when they first announced their delays. We could see something similar if Intel gives a weak guidance for the coming year(s)\n\n**AMD Q4 and FY**\n\nEPS Q4 consensus estimate is 0.47 with a range between 0.43 to 0.58. I believe revenue will be higher than expected, mainly due to the huge demand in the console market (PS5/Xbox) but also the PC/notebook market in general since half of the world was in (semi) lockdown for some parts of Q3/Q4. The main thing I am hoping for is that profit margin stays (roughly) the same at 44%, even though margins on consoles are very thin. If they manage to maintain a margin above 40%, EPS could end up 0.55, which would be a 360% increase with respect to Q4 2019 and 280% year on year. That would be very impressive, given the fact that AMD is considered to still be in their growth stage.\n\n**2021&amp;2022 Outlook**\n\nBut the main thing to look out for is the guidance for the coming years. Given the continuing lockdowns, the fact that all the market segments they are in (consoles/PC\u2019s/laptops/servers) are booming and the fact that they have GPU\u2019s that can go head to head with NVDA\u2019s I think they could raise their outlook for the coming year as well as 2022. Especially when the Xilinx merger goes trough and they have an increased TAM (total Accessible Market). Estimated EPS for the coming years are 1.83 and 2.42 but with all the mentioned tailwinds EPS targets of 2.00+ and 2.75 are not crazy. This would imply a P/E off 34 for 2022 which is lower than ASML\u2019s for example (60). Hence a stock price of 105-115 is a fair target in the short term and 137,50-145 as a long-term target.\n\n**Booming Market**\n\nFinally, we have been in the biggest bull market in a long time, mainly driven by central bank money. Biden is planning a 2.8T stimulus package in the coming weeks. The rising tide has lifted all boats, leading to insane PE valuations across the markets (Lemonade trading at 150x FORWARD P/E for example). A forward PE of 34 for AMD is a way better bet in my opinion.\n\nPosition:\n\n2750 shares, 5000 LT warrants, 200 29Jan\u201921 100Calls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl:dr; buy AMD \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "**In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of AMD, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone! Let\u2019s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles &amp; PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.\n\nThe company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.\n\nSo, guys, let\u2019s go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.\n\nThe [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing &amp; Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn\u2019t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can\u2019t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.\n\nBoth of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing &amp; graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn\u2019t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation &amp; amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation. \n\nThey have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest &amp; tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.\n\nThe company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 &amp; Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.\n\nTheir product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel\u2019s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world\u2019s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.\n\nThey have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also [working](https://ibb.co/D9dDDYs) with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings &amp; Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.\n\nAMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future\n\nThe one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/N2YQFS9), which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/QH8RTCN) has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would [create](https://ibb.co/qJM6Gn4) synergies. [They](https://ibb.co/PcNhH58) are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it\u2019s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.\n\nAMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they [expect](https://ibb.co/RpcwXYr) an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.\n\nI used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA. \n\nFor the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.\n\nSo, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach. \n\nIf we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.\n\nFor my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.\n\nI think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high [demand](https://ibb.co/vQFwyRd) the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage &amp; digital currency mining.\n\nFor their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.\n\nThis means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest &amp; other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax. \n\nI [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.\n\nSo, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.\n\nI like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.   \n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets\u2026 I think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, [THIS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40. \n\nSo [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nI think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more &amp; more chips that also keep advancing in technology. \n\nThe company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/NCtxnFq), with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once [Intel](https://ibb.co/pjHdVFQ) also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it\u2019s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years &amp; a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all. \n\nAMD hasn\u2019t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it\u2019s a psychological resistance rather.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it\u2019s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.\n\nOne last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their [shares](https://ibb.co/zZcxm95) held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.\n\nSo, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think [Lisa SU](https://ibb.co/X2nVGTF) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the [company](https://ibb.co/WtBf4yF) has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel\u2019s performance.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": " In the past 2 months, discourse in r/SPACs has progressively degraded. Nowhere is that more true than for CCIV and ACEV. In an attempt to contribute to meaningful conversation on the topic and valuation of SPACs, I\u2019ve decided to try my hand at a DD. While I do not know if Michael Klein will give you Lucid or DirectTV, I do know a thing or two about the tech industry, particularly involving machine learning and consumer-focused services at scale. Despite that, I am not a hardware engineer, and instead of depend on these smart people in order to write efficient code that performs and scales.\n\nThis post began with an attempt to explain semi-conductors, ASICs, FPGAs, and more, but I figured that most people aren\u2019t interested in the precise technology that underpins Achronix. Instead, all the background information can be summarized into the following points:\n\n* Achronix makes FPGAs\n* Moore\u2019s Law is the observation that the number of transistors in a chip roughly doubles every two years, thereby increasing the processing power of chips\n* Moore\u2019s Law has been progressively dying, as we reach the practical limit on the number of transistors that can fit in any given chip. Increases in processing power are expected to slow to just 3% per year for the next twenty years\n* The rate of data collected and processed is expected to triple in the next five years. Global connectivity is also ever-increasing\n* FPGAs are an attractive option for hardware acceleration to help remedy the processing power problem that arises from the end of Moore\u2019s Law\n* Microsoft has applied an FPGA-based approach to Azure, Bing, and Microsoft 365 for big performance gains\n* AWS, Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu also all offer products supported by FPGAs in their cloud computing services\n* Custom FPGAs provide the opportunity to bridge some of the performance gaps with ASICs \n\nYou can find out more in the following two articles, which indicate compelling reasons to use FPGAs in hardware acceleration, but the discussion is more technical in nature ([here](https://www.networkcomputing.com/data-centers/using-fpgas-survive-death-moore%E2%80%99s-law-part-1) and  [here](https://www.networkcomputing.com/data-centers/using-fpga-survive-death-moore%E2%80%99s-law-part-2)).\n\nWhere does this put Achronix? Well, Achronix achieved profitability for the first time in 2016, the first year it began licensing its IP, which was a first in the industry. This offered an attractive option to consumers, as it allowed them to pay for exactly the specifications that they needed, instead of paying large amounts for Specs they ultimately did not need. These licenses, branded as Speedcore, allowed custom FPGAs to be placed on in System on a Chip (SoC) designs. Aside from being more cost-efficient, this customization also leads to increases in speed and power efficiency. If you\u2019re one of the few people around here that cares about fundamentals, the BusinessWire article states that Achronix has \u201can *estimated 2020 revenues of approximately $105 million, 79% gross margins and 35% operating margins with migration to next-generation products driving an estimated revenue CAGR of 20% to 25% from 2020 to 2025\u201d*\n\nNext, we enter the realm of Machine Learning. In a number of benchmark tests, FPGAs outperform GPUs in machine learning training and inference. As we move towards online systems that do machine learning and image analysis at real time, small differences in latency will represent big increases in performance. \n\n* Bench mark FPGA vs GPU: [source](https://inaccel.medium.com/faster-inference-real-benchmarks-on-gpus-and-fpgas-fa3df04d51d7)\n* Cool, unrelated example of a robot with a 100% win-rate in rock, paper, scissors as an example of hyper-low latency tasks: [source](https://www.wrpsa.com/university-of-tokyo-create-rock-paper-scissors-playing-robot/)\n* Market-size for FPGAs in artificial intelligence will grow by 3x in the next four years to $5.2 billion: [source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/achronix-introduces-ground-breaking-fpga-family-delivering-new-levels-of-performance-with-adaptability-for-high-bandwidth-data-acceleration-applications-300853464.html))\n\n This is one manner in which custom chips will represent a huge advantage. The benchmark indicates higher performance, and it was conducted on a non-customized chip. Further, even the standardized Speedster series is designed to support AI/ML applications, and is likely to be particularly performant in those applications for that reason ([source](https://www.eejournal.com/article/punching-above-their-weight-achronix-beats-the-odds/)). This is excellent for their positioning to take on outsized market share of the growth of the FPGA applications in AI.\n\nHaving already discussed machine learning, here are some of the other catalysts for significant growth in the FPGA industry\n\n* Growth of Edge Computing\n   * Edge computing is a form of distributed compution\u00a0that's done at or near the source of the data, instead of using remote data centers\n   * The edge computing market is anticipated to be worth $43.4 billion by 2027, indicating a CAGR of 37% from its base value of roughly $4 billion in 2020.\n   * FPGAs have strong applications for Edge Computing: ([source](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8485850)), ([source](https://ren-fengbo.lab.asu.edu/content/are-fpgas-suitable-edge-computing-0))\n   * Edge computing has applications related to 5G, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things\n* The creation of a library to support machine learning on FGPAs by traditional developers\n   * This is a black swan event, and it would do for FPGAs what CUDA did for GPUs. It would open up formerly niche technology that chip-makers focused on to a consumer technology that machine learning enthusiasts could leverage. \n   * This would change the way we view FPGAs and serve as a Black Swan event. This would allow one of the FPGA companies to rise to the standing of Nvidia. While there is no guarantee that it would be ACEV, this rising tide would certainly lift all ships. As with all Black Swan events, this will look obvious in hindsight.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s great that ACEV is profitable, and it\u2019s great that it has Intel as a customer, but with the growth of the FPGA in the computing industry, ACEV resembles QS and BFLY more in potential upside than it does THBR (which although is in the same industry will have growth correlated with a totally different set of catalysts). \n\nFun facts: \n\n* The coworker that told me that Moore\u2019s Law was dead was one of the primary contributors to the first GPU at Nvidia\n* I gave up on writing this early to play with my dog \n\nTldr: FPGAs have the potential to support \u201cthe next big thing\u201d in half a dozen domains. From 5G and ML to Internet of Things and Edge Computing, the application of this technology for performance gains across networks is massive. These chips are optimized for AI/ML, but they also license custom chips to companies, which has been highly lucrative, as well as more performant from the companies in question. More and more companies will be interested in FPGAs, and when they are, they will have an incentive not to support a competitor in Intel and instead get high performance chips from Achronix. ACEV is the rare company that has survived the Xilinx/Intel duopoly, and this is not a coincidence. The growth of FPGAs will allow them to thrive, caused by their size-agility advantage, novel approach to licensing their technology, and top notch IP.\n\nTldr if you\u2019re from WSB: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "TLDR:\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 $ACEV\n\nIf you like all the buzzwords like EV, autonomous driving, LiDAR etc, you will like ACEV. I think this is one of few long term plays. I might hold it pfor long time. \n\n**How does a Chip Company has anything to do with EV**\nIt will benefit all the cars including EV. One of the challenges that autonomous driving cars face is the huge amount of Data coming from sensors and cameras for self-driving. Traditional CPUs are bad at processing these data(that\u2019s why you need GPU to play fortnight or roblox). Neutral networks require huge computing power and the computation has to be done locally. Therefore cars need something more powerful to handle the data crunching. That\u2019s where FPGA comes in. FPGAs are specialized chips that will speed up the computation of Data and AI. Achronix is one of the few if not only upcoming player in the high-end FPGA space. If FPGA is indeed the future, then every car on the street will have a FPGA chip. Achronix has something called embedded-FPGA, which is specialized for this type of application due to high integration capability with other chips and lower power consumption.\n\n**Is FPGA the only solution to Autonomous Driving**\nNvidia and AMD have different opinion on this subject matter. Jensen Huang thinks ASIC will dominate self-driving while AMD\u2019s 35B Xilinx purchase signals a different approach. Xilinx has a platform that\u2019s dedicated to self-driving cars. I personally stand with Su Bae because confirmation bias. \n\n**How does the Financial Look**\n100m 2020E revenue with 160m uncancellable orders. Billions more in potential pipeline. High gross margin(2021E 76%)  and Ebit Margin(2021E 32%). Even if we take into account high R&amp;D cost, Anchronix is already a profitable company. On contrast, It will take a Normal EV company many many year to reach profitability. The proceeds of the SPAC transaction will fund their further R&amp;D which will further their revenue and profit. Achronix has 37mm estimated net income for 2020. Assuming a 2 billion valuation at 10$. The company is trading at 2020 P/E of 54. This is pretty insane. I haven\u2019t seen a SPAC with positive P/E. (Besides the retarded mortgage play) Nvidia is trading at P/E of 90, AMD is trading at 126 and they are established companies. WTF is going on here. However I do have to admit their revenue is jumping around for the past years. My take is that they did not smooth out their financial like the public companies. With larger adaption of self-driving cars and 5G, I do see the revenue will explode. I do not think the lack of diversity of customer base is cause of concern. If QS can moon without a single customer for the next 5 years, why shouldn\u2019t ACEV moon? \ud83e\uddd0\ud83e\uddd0 Besides they are already diversifying their customer base as we speak.\n\n**What can Anchronix Chips do besides Autonomous Driving acceleration?**\nHere are more buzzwords you will like AI, cloud, 5G infrastructure, cyber security etc. In the age of big data, FPGA is critical for these applications that require flexibility and intense computation. Equity and Futures market makers use FPGA for the trading due to its superior speed. \n\n**Price Target**\nIf the scammy THBR can reach 13. Then 13 will be the floor for ACEV. I do see it go to 30 (at 200 2020P/E multiple) easily as soon as we have some catalysts and people start to notice this hidden gem. The only reason THBR gets some traction is because they mentioned a lot about EV. I do see ACEV will go a lot farther than THBR.\n\n**Catalysts for Moon**\n1.\tCathie Wood is buying all sort of SPACs. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if she buys some ACEV given acev\u2019s industry and applications\n2.\tSigning big contracts (this would diversity their revenue risks due to concentration) \n3.\t5G and other EV/Cars related plays will trigger ACEV to moon. The LiDAR companies are not specially EV related but they are also part of the EV play.\n4.\tFundamental is solid. With 20-25% CAGR growth, P/E aka the valuation will get cheaper and cheaper\n5.\tBig buyout by big corporation like Nvidia or even some Chinese company that doesn\u2019t give a fuck about price tag. ACEV is valued at 2b. Xilinx got bought our at 35B (way bigger revenue tho) \n\nDisclaimer: \nI am not an expert of chips but I know a rocket when I see it. You just gotta trust the rockets \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nI am holding about 2000 shares. I will not add more because THCB will moon very soon. ACEV is a long term play \nIf you remember my previous posts, I haven\u2019t sold my THCB holdings yet and I will continue to add THCB until It reaches 120k USD.",

        "selftext": "*Heads up: This is gonna be a long one, so grab a drink and a snack.*\n\n**TLDR:** I got a bunch of money to invest. I invested near the all-time highs, and now I'm scared that we're gonna see a big correction because of what's happening with GME, and I don't know what to do.\n\nHi everyone! I'd firstly like to say thank you to anyone who's taking their time to read this. I really appreciate it! So without further ado, here's my situation:\n\nAround 2 weeks ago, I got a large sum of money (at least to me) of $20,000. I was told that I could do anything I wanted with it and of course, I decided that it would be a good idea to invest! I've never invested with this much money before, so I was, and still am, very nervous about losing it. I decided to invest in what I consider to be \"safe\" stocks (obviously, there's risk in everything, but I think the stocks I chose are not too awfully risky). Unfortunately, I had no idea what would happen with GME, and I've missed out on that rocket ship since I didn't have any cash left when it took off, and I had no clue what was happening with it at the time. So far, these are the stocks I've invested in:\n\n**AMD: 33 shares @ $96**\n\n**APPL: 24 shares @ $132**\n\n**AAL: 100 shares @ $14**\n\n**DAL: 31 shares @ $38**\n\n**MSFT: 15 shares @ $231**\n\n**NVDA: 7 shares @ $517**\n\n**XLNX: 21 shares @ $150**\n\n**and VOO: 3 Shares $347**\n\n**Total (including leftover cash): $19,891 (down $1000 from $20,891 last week.** ***ouch*****)**\n\nMy investment \"strategy\" that I had in my head when I was choosing all of these stocks a few weeks ago was that I'm just starting college, and I'm fortunate to have all of my expenses covered. Because of this, I don't really have anything to spend money on right now, so instead of just having $20K sitting in my bank account, I thought it'd be a good idea to invest it. I plan to hold onto these stocks for the next 5 years while I'm in school so that by the time I graduate, I'll have a nice sum of money to start my life with.\n\n**Here is my concern:** I've seen some talk on this sub recently that we might see a correction to the markets as a result of this whole GME thing. This worries me because when I bought all of these stocks (2-ish weeks ago), I got most of them (except for AAL, and DAL) at/or really close to their all-time highs. I'm sure that in 5 years, I'll have made a decent amount of money from this investment, but I'm wondering if it might not be worth it to cover my $110 loss and sell some of my stocks so that I can buy back in if the market ends up dropping. If I were to do this, I'd sell everything except AAL, DAL, MSFT, and APPL.\n\nThis is where I'd like your guy's advice. I have no idea what to do right now, and I'm worried that my emotions are making decisions, which never ends well. I keep going back and forth in my head on whether or not I should hold onto what I have and wait or if I should sell and re-invest in the dip. If I do sell, I'll have roughly $10,200 to work with. My thought is to split that into two $5k portions. I'll split one evenly back into AAL, DAL, APPL, and MSFT and the other $5k that I'd put into much higher risk stuff with the chance of making some big returns on them at the risk of losing it all.\n\nI'd love to hear what you guys have to say about this, and if you guys have any suggestions on stocks you think will do very well, I'd love to hear about it! (obviously, anything I invest in is my own responsibility, and I'll do my own research on any suggestions given) Thanks!!",

        "selftext": "AMD is reporting their Q4 2020 results on the 26th (estimated). As a long-term investor and given all the events in the past months I believe AMD is still undervalued at $95.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Intel struggles**\n\nAs is known, Intel has been struggling to keep up with AMD when it comes to the CPU market. Intel is reporting their Q4 on the 21th. There is a chance that they announce any kind of further delays in their 7nm or an even weaker outlook than expected. This has been reinforced by the fact that Intel\u2019s CES presentation was disappointing to many. This could obviously be beneficial to AMD in the runup to their earnings. AMD popped 12% on Intel Q2 report when they first announced their delays. We could get a glimpse off production capacities (and issues) tomorrow when TSMC FY report comes out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMD Q4 and FY**\n\nEPS Q4 consensus estimate is 0.47 with a range between 0.43 to 0.58. I believe revenue will be higher than expected, mainly due to the huge demand in the console market (PS5/Xbox) but also the PC/notebook market in general since half of the world was in (semi) lockdown for some parts of Q3/Q4. The main thing I am hoping for is that profit margin stays (roughly) the same at 44%, even though margins on consoles are very thin. If they manage to maintain a margin above 40%, EPS could end up 0.55, which would be a 360% increase with respect to Q4 2019 and 280% year on year. That would be very impressive, given the fact that AMD is considered to still be in their growth stage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2021&amp;2022 Outlook**\n\nBut the main thing to look out for is the guidance for the coming years. Given the continuing lockdowns, the fact that all the market segments they are in (consoles/PC\u2019s/laptops/servers) are booming and the fact that they have GPU\u2019s that can go head to head with NVDA\u2019s I think they could raise their outlook for the coming year as well as 2022. Especially when the Xilinx merger falls trough and they have an increased TAM (total Accessible Market). Estimated EPS for the coming years are 1.83 and 2.42 but with all the mentioned headwinds EPS targets of 2.00+ and 2.75 are not crazy. This would imply P/E\u2019s off 34 for 2022 which is lower than ASML\u2019s for example (50). Hence a stock price of 105-115 is a fair target in the short term and 137,50-145 as a long-term target.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Booming Market**\n\nFinally, we have been in the biggest bull market in a long time, mainly driven by central bank money. Biden is planning a 2.8T stimulus package in the coming weeks. The rising tide has lifted all boats, leading to insane PE valuations across the markets (Lemonade trading at 150x FORWARD P/E for example). A forward PE of 34 for AMD is a way better bet in my opinion.\n\ntl;dr: Buy AMD before we go 100+ \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nPosition:\n\n2750 shares, 5000 LT warrants, 200 29Jan\u201921 100Calls.",

        "selftext": "This post contains no numbers and no news. This I is about my experience with AMD and what I think the future holds for them based on what I see in the industry. \n\nIn 2013 I bought a gaming PC from my neighbor at a garage sale. The PC had an AMD FX 8350 in it. I spent around $1k on the PC upgrading everything. To this day, the PC still has that same AMD FX processor. Before everyone jumped on the Ryzen hype, I was there, believing. When I got the PC I told my dad to buy $100 worth of AMD stock for me. They were worth a dollar something at the time. They are now worth around $100 a share. Sadly, I didn\u2019t make the Tendies from then investment when I was a kid who saw potential in AMD. \n\nOn July 6th of this 2020, I bought in myself because i knew how great the company was from year of experience. I have been holding ever since and will continue to hold and buy in. AMD, in my mind, is undervalued. Not because of technical analysis or earnings. But because of what I see in the real world. Friends of mine who bought and built PC\u2019s back when I did, had Intel CPU\u2019s in their PC\u2019s. Some of them have never even heard of AMD processors. Between then and now. All of my friends who have upgraded their PC\u2019s have switched to AMD. Everyone who knows a thing or two about PC\u2019s at least considers going AMD instead of Intel. \n\nYou might be thinking it\u2019s too late to buy now, too late to invest in AMD. Your loss. AMD is starting to do the same thing with Graphics Cards, laptops and Server parts that they did with gaming CPU\u2019s. I foresee them having the same takeover they had with gaming CPU\u2019s in the laptop, GPU, and server chip space. The potential is huge. Big cloud  companies like Amazon, Google etc. are starting to switch their servers from Intel Xeon to AMD Epyc. This can make AMD much more money than gaming processors. I don\u2019t know much about Xilinx but i believe if AMD follows the same philosophy they do with their other chips, they can bring Xilinx to the top. AMD had a lot further to go. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAMD Gang 2013- forever",

GME, AMD, PLTR, AAPL, TSLA, NVIDIA, CRSR, etc. \n\nThere is a stock that almost all the big tech companies, EV companies, and meme stocks had in common. TSM\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing) makes computer chips. You definitely own at least one TSM chip, whether you know it or not. \n\nHere is a list of a few of the companies that manufacture their chips with TSMC: (from [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20leading%20fabless%20semiconductor%20companies%20such,such%20as%20Allwinner%20Technology%2C%20HiSilicon%2C%20Spectra7%2C%20and%20Spreadtrum.))\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD), Apple Inc., Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx,  Altera,Texas Instruments. \n\nIt would take me years to research every single product that TSMC manufactures, but here are a few of the most significant ones that I found:\n\n\nAMD:All AMD chips are manufactured by TSM any reason to buy AMD is also a reason to buyTSM \n   AMD CPU\u2019s: This also includes AMD Ryzen Processors which are the most bought CPUS on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189) As well as the processors that go into many laptops. \n   AMD Graphics Cards: Apple uses AMD Graphics card in their Mac products. They are also in many windows PC\u2019s and laptops, and they are used by miners. \n   Xbox/PlayStation Internals: The PS5 and Xbox Series both use AMD CPU\u2019s and Graphics, which are manufactured by TSM. \n\nApple: Apple manufactures All of its processors at TSM. TSM made chips are in every iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, Air Pod, etc. the new M1 Apple in house silicon Macs are also made by TSM. \n\nNvidia: Nvidia is the world largest GPU company. They also make self driving processors for Tesla, Nio and other companies. \n\nQualcomm: Qualcomm makes Arm processors. Qualcomm processors power everything from Samsung phones to smart TV\u2019s to Amazon Alexa. \n\nXilinx: they make most of the 5G processors that go in towers and phones. Samsung Phones use Xilix cellular chips. \n\nTexas Instruments: they make your fucking calculator. \n\nThere are many many more companies that TSM manufactures chips for. They are also on a more advanced process mode than any other company in the world. Do some of your own research and find out what other products TSM makes. \n\nSee how many products in your life are powered by TSM. \n\nChances are, A TSM manufactured chip could be inside your phone, your computer, your TV, your smart speaker and other smart home devices, your wifi router, your cars radio/gps, your cars self driving system (if your car has it). Your wireless headphones, the cell tower in your neighborhood. Even your calculator.\n\nThe \u201ccloud\u201d is also powered by TSM. The servers that google, Amazon, one drive, Spotify, Palantir, etc. \n\nIf you can find just one area of technology that does not, at some point, use TSM manufacturing, comment it below. \n\nIf you can\u2019t then buy some fucking shares. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Bottom line up front: assuming the deal goes through at the stated timeline and price point, and using conservative estimates of both companies' growth trajectories, AMD will be trading at no less than $150/share by spring 2023, representing 24% gain per year for 2.5 years, using the January 7 closing price of $95.16. If its price multiples increase to fall within the range of NVDA, QCOM, QRVO, upside is $300 to $450 per share by mid-2023 (or higher, if you want to use a more aggressive growth trajectory). \n\n \\-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are two assumptions in play that are by no means a done deal that are serving as the basis for my calculations. They are:\u00a0\n\n1) They will complete the deal as planned by the end of 2021, meaning they will meet unspecified pre-conditions and receive regulator approval  \n2) The all-stock purchase will be completed for the stated price of $35 billion.\u00a0\n\nIf those assumptions hold true, then the following is also true:\u00a0\n\nThe current fair market value for AMD stock, if XLNX's current market cap and outstanding shares are folded into the mix, is $100.96/share, based on today's XLNX price, or $101.14 based on the year-end $35 billion purchase price. The latter represents a 6.33% increase over the 7 January 2021 AMD closing price of $95.16/share. This is only based on up-to-date market cap figures and most-recent-quarter earnings figures, which are a good three months out of date at this point.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, in the press releases and earnings calls where the CEOs discussed the merger, one of the points that came out was that the companies have a lot of overlap when it comes to their business operations and R&amp;D. Within 18 months of the merger, or late spring 2023, that means they will be able to [cut $300 million in annual expenses](https://www.crn.com/slide-shows/components-peripherals/the-35b-amd-xilinx-acquisition-7-big-things-to-know/2), simply through synergy of eliminating functional overlap. Given the following from the most recent quarterly reports, covering 3 months of operations ending 26 Sep 2020:\u00a0\n\n1) XLNX net earnings were $193.8m, or $775.2m annualized  \n2) AMD net earnings were $390m, or $1.56b annualized  \n3) Combined earnings are $2.33b\n\nThat means that net earnings will be increased by 13%, just in cutting overlapping expenses. That means that, assuming today's earnings and today's share prices, and combining the financials of both companies, the fair market value for AMD as of early- to mid-2023 is $114, based on annualized earnings numbers that are already three months old.\u00a0\n\nUsing conservative extrapolation of recent growth trajectories, and using today's price multiples\\*, it's conservative to estimate that AMD will be trading for $150/share by June 2023. Based on the current share price of 95.12, that's an annualized growth of 23.96%.\u00a0\n\n\\*If for whatever reason there's a market downturn in this time, AMD's performance could live up to these numbers, but the price multiples could decrease. This represents nearly all remaining risk of inaccuracy, outside the stated assumptions.\n\nPlease fire away at this. Poke your holes and make your arguments. I'm getting ready to heavily shift my portfolio's center of gravity into AMD based on all this, so if any of you know a good reason not to, I'd love to hear it.",

        "selftext": "**In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of AMD, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone! Let\u2019s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles &amp; PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.\n\nThe company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.\n\nSo, guys, let\u2019s go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.\n\nThe [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing &amp; Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn\u2019t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can\u2019t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.\n\nBoth of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing &amp; graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn\u2019t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation &amp; amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation.\n\nThey have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest &amp; tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.\n\nThe company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 &amp; Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.\n\nTheir product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel\u2019s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world\u2019s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.\n\nThey have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also [working](https://ibb.co/D9dDDYs) with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings &amp; Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.\n\nAMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future\n\nThe one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/N2YQFS9) , which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/QH8RTCN) has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would [create](https://ibb.co/qJM6Gn4) synergies. [They](https://ibb.co/PcNhH58) are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it\u2019s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.\n\nAMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they [expect](https://ibb.co/RpcwXYr) an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.\n\nI used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA.\n\nFor the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.\n\nSo, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach.\n\nIf we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.\n\nFor my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.\n\nI think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high [demand](https://ibb.co/vQFwyRd) the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage &amp; digital currency mining.\n\nFor their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.\n\nThis means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest &amp; other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax.\n\nI [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.\n\nSo, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.\n\nI like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168. \n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets\n\nI think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, [THIS](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40.\n\nSo HERE \\[ [1](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) / [2](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) / [3](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) / [PT](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) \\] is  the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nI think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more &amp; more chips that also keep advancing in technology.\n\nThe company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/NCtxnFq), with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once [Intel](https://ibb.co/pjHdVFQ) also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it\u2019s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years &amp; a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all.\n\nAMD hasn\u2019t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it\u2019s a psychological resistance rather.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it\u2019s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.\n\nOne last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their [shares](https://ibb.co/zZcxm95) held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.\n\nSo, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think [Lisa SU](https://ibb.co/X2nVGTF) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the [company](https://ibb.co/WtBf4yF) has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel\u2019s performance.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, January 28, 2021**\n\nStocks rose today, with the indices shaking of yesterday\u2019s decline after new economic data showed a larger dip in new unemployment claims than expected. Each of the S&amp;P 500, Dow and Nasdaq gained more than 1% intraday on Thursday after logging their biggest drops since October on Wednesday. \n\nWeekly unemployment dipped below 900,000 for the first time in three weeks, with claims pulling back by almost 70,000 compared to last week. However, new unemployment claims remain at a historically high level when compared to pre-pandemic levels. Other economic data disappointed, however. US growth domestic product (GDP) grew for the second straight quarter, albeit with slowing momentum. All told, the US economy contracted at a 3.5% annualized rate in 2020, for the biggest drop in GDP since 1946.\n\nEarnings season has also been chugging along, and shares of some heavily weighted companies that reported results after the closing bell on Wednesday dipped. Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) stock dropped more than 5% after the company posted profit that fell short of estimates, though revenue hit a quarterly record of more than $10 billion. Apple\u2019s (AAPL) stock fell after CEO Tim Cook said during the company\u2019s earnings call that he expected a second-quarter deceleration in wearables and services sales growth, overshadowing fiscal first-quarter revenue and earnings that topped expectations. Facebook (FB) shares gained, however, after the company topped user growth, sales and profit estimates, but warned about \u201csignificant uncertainty\u201d over the ad environment in 2021 amid the pandemic.\n\nThe frenzy over Gamestop (GME) has led TD Ameritrade, Robinhood, Interactive Broker, any other brokerages to freeze any new purchases of stocks that are popular in Reddit (GME, BB, NOK, AMC just to name a few). The response has been swift. Retail traders have taken to social media to voice their anger and politicians from both sides of the aisles have publicly criticized Robinhood for restricting an investor\u2019s right to buy. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who also sits on that committee, said she would support a hearing if necessary, condemning Robinhood\u2019s move as \u201cunacceptable.\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz, a conservative Republican from Texas, seized on Robinhood\u2019s branding in a post Thursday morning on Twitter. Using a bemused face emoji, Cruz posted a March 2016 tweet from Robinhood declaring, \u201cLet the people trade,\u201d alongside its statement announcing restrictions on GameStop and AMC. Even Elon Musk, Tesla CEO and the richest person in the world has publicly supported the retail traders. Truly we have never seen anything like this in the market and will be paying close attention to how the situation unfolds. There is now a class-action lawsuit against Robinhood filed in the Southern District of New York that claims that Robinhood \u201cpurposefully, willfully, and knowingly removed the stock \u2018GME\u2019 \\[GameStop\\] from its trading platform in the midst of an unprecedented stock rise thereby depriving retail investors of the ability to invest in the open-market and manipulating the open-market.\u201d Shares of GME, AMC and other \u201cmeme stocks\u201d pulled back sharply today. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Webull, another popular broker, maintained trading of GME and other stocks open\n* After earnings, (AAPL) with a host of target increases by analysts.

        "selftext": "Conclusions: \n\n1) Current fair market price for AMD, if we fold in XLNX's outstanding shares worth $35bn, is $101.14/share.   \n2) AMD will be trading at no less than $150/share by spring 2023, representing 24% gain per year for 2.5 years. (Personally I'm putting it at $175, or 31.6%/yr for 30 months.)\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKey assumptions that are by no means a done deal:\u00a0\n\n1. They will complete the deal as planned by the end of 2021, meaning they will meet unspecified pre-conditions and receive regulator approval\n2. The all-stock purchase will be completed for the stated price of $35 billion.\u00a0\n\nIf those assumptions hold true, then the following is also true:\u00a0\n\nThe current fair market value for AMD stock, if XLNX's current market cap and outstanding shares are folded into the mix, is $100.96/share, based on the 7 Jan closing price, or $101.14 based on the year-end $35 billion purchase price. The latter represents a 6.33% increase over the 7 January 2021 AMD closing price of $95.16/share. This is only based on up-to-date market cap figures and most-recent-quarter earnings figures, which are a good three months out of date at this point.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, in the press releases and earnings calls where the CEOs discussed the merger, one of the points that came out was that the companies have a lot of overlap when it comes to their business operations and R&amp;D. Within 18 months of the merger, or late spring 2023, that means they will be able to [cut $300 million in annual expenses](https://www.crn.com/slide-shows/components-peripherals/the-35b-amd-xilinx-acquisition-7-big-things-to-know/2), simply through synergy of eliminating functional overlap. Given the following from the most recent quarterly reports, covering 3 months of operations ending 26 Sep 2020:\u00a0\n\n1. XLNX net earnings were $193.8m, or $775.2m annualized\n2. AMD net earnings were $390m, or $1.56b annualized\n3. Combined earnings are $2.33b\n\nThat means that net earnings will be increased by 13%, just in cutting overlapping expenses. That means that, assuming today's earnings and today's share prices, and combining the financials of both companies, the fair market value for AMD as of early- to mid-2023 is $114, based on annualized earnings numbers that are already three months old.\u00a0\n\nUsing conservative extrapolation of recent growth trajectories, and using today's price multiples\\*, it's conservative to estimate that AMD will be trading for $150/share by June 2023. Based on the current share price of 95.12, that's an annualized growth of 23.96%.\u00a0\n\n\\*If for whatever reason there's a market downturn in this time, AMD's performance could live up to these numbers, but the price multiples could decrease. This represents nearly all remaining risk of inaccuracy, outside the stated assumptions.\n\nPlease fire away at this. Poke your holes and make your arguments. I'm getting ready to heavily shift my portfolio's center of gravity into AMD based on all this, so if any of you know a good reason not to, I'd love to hear it.",

RBTX,\nEV\u2019s, ECAR\n\nAll of these stocks and ETF\u2019s have very high growth in the past and have a bright future ahead of them. \n\nLithium is one of the worlds most important elements in batteries. As a result of our transition to electric transportation, lithium demand will increase significantly over the next 10 years. These 3 lithium stocks have operations which are located in germany(ZNWD), Argentina(LAC), mexico(BCN) and the usa(LAC). All 3 are still relatively cheap, but risky as ZNWD and LAC are waiting for project approval before starting production, but could become very lucrative investments if approved. \n\nWind stocks are some of the worlds best to invest in currently due to their long term rapid growth, and long term future rapid growth as the world transitions over to sustainable energy. The majority of these firms have operations which are located in the USA, which is an untapped growing energy market. Biden will back large scale wind power in his upcoming bill. A great stock is Tpicomposites which manufactures blades for companies such as vestas, GE and siemens GA. As a result of the high demand for wind power, i see this company being heavily backed by the Biden administration as it is a domestic company. Nextera energy and orsted are 2 very high growth stocks, with orsted\u2019s main operations being located in europe, which they are rapidly expanding into with the worlds largest offshore wind farm, Hornsea in the first of 4 stages of development. Orsted have significant plans for operations in the USA, with 7 wind farms planned along the eastern seaboard, which will undoubtedly be backed by the biden administration. Orsted also have 3 under development and 2 under construction in taiwan, with the production of 2 of the wind farms solely going towards taiwan semi conductor. Nextera are a US based company with 50-55B in investments into infrastructure planned by 2022, with large numbers of solar, wind and battery storage facilities under development/construction, on top of its already extensive portfolio of projects. \n\nThe 3 ETF\u2019s that i have selected have all experienced significant growth in the past year. ICLN is an excellent tracker for sustainable companies and is not new to WSB so i will save my breath. RBTX is an ETF that tracks automation technology, which is a growing industry globally, especially in countries such as china, india and other countries where manufacturing represents s significant portion of the economy. Automation is also being increasingly used in developed countries which are trying to keep manufacturing at home, whilst staying competitive with developing countries. ECAR tracks all the major and minor automakers along with chip manufacturers and software companies and has experienced significant growth in the past year, with its largest weights being Tesla and XILINX which specialises in logic devices and chips which will be increasingly used in assistive driving technology. The company has reported YoY significant growth in revenue. \n\nI feel that if you are looking for green, sustainable growth stocks, this list may be the list for you.",

        "selftext": "**In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of AMD, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone! Let\u2019s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles &amp; PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.\n\nThe company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.\n\nSo, guys, let\u2019s go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.\n\nThe [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing &amp; Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn\u2019t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can\u2019t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.\n\nBoth of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing &amp; graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn\u2019t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation &amp; amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation.\n\nThey have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest &amp; tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.\n\nThe company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 &amp; Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.\n\nTheir product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel\u2019s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world\u2019s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.\n\nThey have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also [working](https://ibb.co/D9dDDYs) with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings &amp; Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.\n\nAMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future\n\nThe one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/N2YQFS9), which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/QH8RTCN) has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would [create](https://ibb.co/qJM6Gn4) synergies. [They](https://ibb.co/PcNhH58) are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it\u2019s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.\n\nAMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they [expect](https://ibb.co/RpcwXYr) an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.\n\nI used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA.\n\nFor the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.\n\nSo, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach.\n\nIf we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.\n\nFor my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.\n\nI think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high [demand](https://ibb.co/vQFwyRd) the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage &amp; digital currency mining.\n\nFor their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.\n\nThis means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest &amp; other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax.\n\nI [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.\n\nSo, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.\n\nI like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.\n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets\u2026 I think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, [THIS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40.\n\nSo [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nI think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more &amp; more chips that also keep advancing in technology.\n\nThe company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/NCtxnFq), with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once [Intel](https://ibb.co/pjHdVFQ) also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it\u2019s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years &amp; a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all.\n\nAMD hasn\u2019t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it\u2019s a psychological resistance rather.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it\u2019s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.\n\nOne last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their [shares](https://ibb.co/zZcxm95) held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.\n\nSo, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think [Lisa SU](https://ibb.co/X2nVGTF) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the [company](https://ibb.co/WtBf4yF) has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel\u2019s performance.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 25th, 2021.\n\n# **Apple and Tesla earnings, along with the Fed and GDP will drive markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/apple-and-tesla-earnings-vaccine-news-and-the-fed-will-be-focus-of-markets-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stimulus euphoria may be waning, but investors will have plenty to focus on in the week ahead, as a blast of earnings news hits, the Federal Reserve meets and new data will show the state of the economy at the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks gained in the past week on optimism for a $1.9 trillion stimulus package, proposed by President Joe Biden. But by Friday, the market lost steam amid increased concerns about the pandemic\u2019s economic impact, and as it seemed Biden would not have an easy time getting the stimulus plan approved.\n*****\n&gt; Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Tesla and more than 100 other S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings in the biggest rush of earnings reports this quarter.\n*****\n&gt; The pandemic will also be a factor as travel restrictions and lockdowns threaten the global economy, and worries remain over the speed of vaccine distributions.\n*****\n&gt; But there is hope that Johnson and Johnson will release positive news on its vaccine results soon, and if that\u2019s the case it could signal another source of vaccines will be available. The J&amp;J vaccine would be a single shot, as opposed to the currently available double-shot vaccines.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe expect to see their results,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cThat could be super bullish.\u201d The company reports earnings on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said the market may also respond to Covid news. He said the seven-day average in new Covid cases fell below the 14-day average this past week for the first time since Thanksgiving, and if that continues, it could indicate a peak.\n*****\n&gt; If the virus news improves, the market could resume its grind higher in the coming week, said Hogan.\n*****\n&gt; # Economy\n&gt; As for the economy, the first look at fourth quarter real gross domestic product comes Thursday, and it is expected to show growth of 4.7%, according to the CNBC/Moody\u2019s Analytics Rapid Update survey. For the year, the economists surveyed expect GDP contracted by 3.5%. The economists forecast 5% growth for 2021.\n*****\n&gt; Consumers pulled back at the end of the fourth quarter, evidenced by a surprise 0.7% decline in December retail sales reported this past week, after a negative November.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou\u2019re really going to see a loss of momentum throughout the quarter,\u201d said Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets. \u201cIt\u2019s a set up for a really weak Q1.\u201d PMI data shows manufacturing activity has been strong, but labor market data is weak and consumer spending is disappointing.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou\u2019ve got to juxtapose what\u2019s happening with the vaccine and the virus with what\u2019s happening with underlying data. We\u2019ve definitely seen a lot of the things that could spark a pullback,\u201d said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equity strategist at RBC.\n*****\n&gt; Calvasina and other strategists expect a sell-off early in the year.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks hit new highs across the major indices Wednesday, as Biden was inaugurated, and many technicians see the market as overbought. The catalyst for a pullback is not clear, but strategists expect the market to gain this year and say a buying opportunity would open up with any decline.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cDo we start to see stuff showing up in that data that makes us question that recovery?\u201d said Calvasina. \u201cMy assumption is we\u2019re going to get a lot of volatility in that data, and we\u2019re going to get some downdrafts but it\u2019s not going to be bad enough to erase this upward trajectory we\u2019ve seen in the economy since the second quarter.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\nThe Fed is also a powerful backstop for the market, and economists don\u2019t expect the Fed to take any action or change in its dovish tone when it releases its statement Wednesday afternoon, following its two-day meeting.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t see them making many changes,\u201d said Cummins of NatWest. \u201cThey\u2019ll probably acknowledge just the fact that employment was weak.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s going to be pretty clear cut,\u201d he added. \u201cI think Powell will sound similar to what he sounded like in September.\u201d Cummins said the Fed chairman is likely to say the economic outlook depends on the course of the virus and vaccine.\n*****\n&gt; There is also durable goods data Wednesday and personal income and spending data on Friday. The Fed\u2019s favorite inflation gauge, the PCE deflator is also released Friday, and Powell will surely be asked Wednesday afternoon about inflation, which is increasingly being priced into market expectations.\n*****\n&gt; Powell is also likely to be asked his views on fiscal stimulus, which could end up being smaller than some expect.\n*****\n&gt; Hogan of National Securities said the market traded lower on Friday on expectations the package could be smaller and take longer than expected to gain approval.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the realism of saying $1.9 trillion and doing $1.9 trillion are two different things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe fall into that trap all the time.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now is there is no magic wand here,\u201d Hogan added. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say there\u2019s no stimulus. It\u2019s just a matter of how long it will take and how much there will be. There\u2019s a little bit of realism.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, said a pullback could be sparked if bitcoin starts to fall more sharply, since some investors would sell stock in response. \u201cWhen there\u2019s no bid in bitcoin they have to sell something, and they sell stock,\u201d said Maley.\n*****\n&gt; Bitcoin has had a wild early ride in 2021. The cryptocurrency hit a record high of $41,973 on Jan. 12, according to data from Coin Metrics. Days later, it fell about 15%, wiping out as much as $200 billion in just 24 hours.\n*****\n&gt; Bitcoin then regained some of its losses, surging to near $40,000 before another reversal. On Friday, it was trading at $33,200 after dipping below $30,000.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf this thing starts tanking again, it\u2019s going to cause some forced selling and it\u2019s going to cause some selling in the stock market,\u201d said Maley, adding it will be important to hold the low from Thursday night.\n*****\n&gt; He said the short position in the dollar is also an overcrowded trade that could turn quickly. A resulting short squeeze could cause a dollar rally that would be negative for the stock market. He also is watching Tesla, which reports earnings on Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think whether it be bitcoin, the dollar, Tesla, one of these crowded trades...it\u2019s going to turn the narrative that\u2019s permeating right now, and if we don\u2019t get a surprise the market will continue to push higher,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/eO7d7Zq.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/1GWbub4.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/tyhAE90.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/vbOa37l.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8HqdRsR.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NZeUiVr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6E5RdpT.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/3Igc9Mf.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hBm7jZ6.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6jxbrCb.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5SrZWIY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/PwdsNDj.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/nseHMnr.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # February Almanac: Worst S&amp;P 500 Month of Post-Election Years\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.0% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; February\u2019s post-election year performance since 1950 is miserable, ranking dead last for S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000. Average losses have been sizable: -1.5%, -3.3% and -1.6% respectively. February ranks tenth for DJIA in post-election years with an average loss of 1.1%. February 2001 and 2009 were exceptionally brutal. NASDAQ dropped 22.4% in February 2001, its third worst monthly loss ever.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/d4b3e8cda0a49d76ee55a9768e6c579a/153e22faa5d70761-e1/s400x600/32c0464083a6087a711ac381b9350a1420626ac6.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Housing Closes Out 2020 on a Positive Note\n\n&gt; Housing closed out 2020 on an extremely positive note as both Housing Starts and Building Permits topped forecasts by more than 100K. Since 2002, there have only been ten other months where both reports topped forecasts by more than 100K, and today's report was the third time it happened in the last 12 months!\n\n&gt; The table below breaks down the details of the December report in terms of both single and multi-family units and regions. One of the clear areas of strength was in single-family starts and permits. On a y/y basis, both were up over 25%, and relative to November, starts were up 12% while permits rose 7.8%. Multi-family units, meanwhile, both saw declines with notable weakness in multi-family starts. On a regional basis, most areas of the country saw strength although starts and permits were down m/m and y/y in the Northeast.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-Details.png))**\n\n&gt; Given its overall size, you can easily make the case that as goes the housing market, so goes the economy, and history tends to bear this out. The top chart shows the 12-month average of Housing Starts going back to 1967 with recessions overlaid in gray. With the exception of the latest downturn, every prior recession was preceded by a rollover in Housing Starts. Given the sudden onset of the pandemic, housing played no role in the current recession, but once the lockdowns started, the residential housing market wasn't immune to the weakness. Whatever weakness there was didn't last long. As shown in the second chart below, less than a year after the recession started, both the 12-month average of Housing Starts and Building Permits have now moved back above their pre-pandemic highs.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-and-Business-Cycle.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-and-Business-Cycle-Last-10-Years.png))**\n\n&gt; While Housing Starts and Building Permits are both at new multi-year highs, on a population-adjusted basis, they're still closer to levels typically associated with recessions than expansions. After adjusting for population growth, Housing Starts would need to come in above 1.9 million just to keep up with population growth.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-Population-Adjusted.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the stocks of homebuilders, the performance of the iShares Home Construction ETF (ITB) tends to track trends in Housing Starts and Building Permits pretty closely, so it's no surprise that it also traded to a new all-time high on Thursday for the first time in three months. As long as interest rates don't see a sudden spike higher, trends in place for the residential housing market remain positive.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-vs-ITV.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Building-Permits-vs-ITV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Impressive Reading From The Philly Fed\n\n&gt; Of the several strong economic data points to have been released today, perhaps the strongest relative to expectations was the Philadelphia Fed's monthly survey on the region's manufacturing sector. The headline index was expected to rise from 11.1 to 11.8. Instead, it more than doubled expectations rising to 26.5. That is the highest reading since last February just before the pandemic's full impact was felt. Overall, the report showed the region's manufacturing sector experienced strong growth in January with accelerating growth in demand, prices, and employment.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-HL.png))**\n\n&gt; In the table below, we break down the various sub-indices of the report. Nearly every component experienced a month over month increase that ranks in the top few percentiles of their respective histories. That also left most indices in the top decile of their historic ranges. That compares to last month in which most readings were far more moderate. Although most indices for current conditions saw impressive readings, the indices for expectations were much more mixed with a larger number falling than rising MoM. Given every one of these indices remains positive, though, the region's manufacturers still have an overall optimistic outlook.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Table1.png))**\n\n&gt; Of all the sub-indices, the New Orders index saw one of the most significant increases in January rising 28.1 percentage points from a barely expansionary reading of 1.9 to a much stronger reading of 30. Going back over the past couple of years, the only times this index was higher was in October (32.9) and February (30.7) of last year. That indicates very strong new order growth after a slowdown in December.\n\n&gt; Similarly, the index for unfilled orders was the only index in contractionary territory (those below zero) last month, but there was a massive improvement this month as the index surged to a reading of 25.6. Both the level of the index and the monthly change stand in the top 1% of all readings going back through the history of the survey which began in 1968. The only times the index has been higher was in August of 1972 (26) and January (29.6) and March (45.1) of 1973. In other words, New Orders remain strong while Unfilled Orders are bouncing back at a historic rate.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Orders.png))**\n\n&gt; While the unfilled orders index reached one of the highest readings on record, the index for Delivery Times actually hit a new record. The index rose 12.7 points to a record high of 30; surpassing the previous record of 21.3 from October of 2017. Higher readings in this index indicate that supplier lead times are longer and vice versa for lower readings. That means a historic number of respondents are seeing delays in their supply chains.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Deliveries.png)**\n\n&gt; Perhaps to get ahead of the growing demand and longer lead times, businesses are also reporting higher inventories. That index rose to the highest level since September of 2019 which also stands in the top 5% of all readings in the history of the data.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Inv.png)**\n\n&gt; Given the stronger demand and tighter supply lines, prices have also been accelerating. Both Prices Paid and Prices Received experienced some of their largest monthly increases on record after rising 20.5 points in January. At 45.4, the index for Prices Paid is at its highest level since August of 2018. Those price increases are also getting passed along to customers as the index for Prices Received is at the highest level since February of 1989. These results echo some other hints of more inflationary conditions like the New York Fed's readings last week and the ISM services and manufacturing report earlier this month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Prices.png)**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Real-time COVID-19 Data Suggests Final Peak May Be Here\n\n&gt; It has been exactly one year since the first COVID-19 case in the United States was reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and to say the world as we know it has been completely changed would be an understatement. Thankfully, we may finally be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n&gt; With the rollout of multiple approved vaccines underway, some real-time COVID-19 indicators and mobility-related data points have put in their final highs (or lows). As shown in the LPL chart of the day, restrictions implemented at the end of 2020 appear to be helping to curb the spread of the virus, as new COVID-19 cases and those currently hospitalized have been on the decline.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, the positive rate has also declined despite daily tests near all-time highs.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; However, while COVID-19 data has been improving, real-time economic indicators like OpenTable reservations show businesses continue to struggle as restrictions on activities to curb the late-2020 surge remain in place.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Similarly, the number of people getting on airlines has fallen back to mid-October levels after the holiday bump. Domestic air travel activity remains 64% below pre-pandemic levels.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThe good news is that cases are declining and vaccine distribution is increasing, but service industries and air travel are clearly still under a lot of pressure,\u201d said LPL Research Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhile manufacturing and housing data remain firm, recent data on the job market and consumer spending have been choppy.\u201d\n\n&gt; It\u2019s very encouraging to see COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations improving, a trend we hope will continue until this pandemic ends for good. In the meantime, we will continue to follow high-frequency data to gauge the recovery\u2019s progress. The next report card comes next week with the release of fourth quarter 2020 gross domestic product (GDP).\n\n&gt; We\u2019ll also be closely watching developments in Washington, DC. The economy\u2019s bridge to the other side will likely get stronger in the coming weeks with more stimulus\u2014potentially to the tune of another $700 billion to $1 trillion.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 22nd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.24.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$JNJ** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$VZ** \n&gt; * **$DHI** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$FCX** \n&gt; * **$KMB** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$RTX** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$XLNX** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$LRCX** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$OFG** \n&gt; * **$NOW** \n&gt; * **$NDAQ** \n&gt; * **$NVS** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$PII** \n&gt; * **$MKC** \n&gt; * **$BMRC** \n&gt; * **$ALK** \n&gt; * **$SHW** \n&gt; * **$TXN** \n&gt; * **$NEP** \n&gt; * **$LUV **\n&gt; * **$BOH** \n&gt; * **$LLY** \n&gt; * **$SWKS** \n&gt; * **$PGR** \n&gt; * **$PHG**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hBm7jZ6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/X2a6Awd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/eACodIM.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR FINANCIAL COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/aC5hzkZ.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR NASDAQ 100 COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/zIQniHK.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.25.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8R46aDj.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.25.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/f3YFp1i.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  1.26.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dU2uEBa.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.26.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NnafTFh.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.27.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5cGqHaC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.27.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/83z1Sc4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.28.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/awFue6C.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.28.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/INHVHTh.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.29.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/j11gRzS.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.29.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Apple, Inc. $139.07\n**Apple, Inc.

RBTX,\nEV\u2019s, ECAR\n\nAll of these stocks and ETF\u2019s have very high growth in the past and have a bright future ahead of them. \nLithium is one of the worlds most important elements in batteries. As a result of our transition to electric transportation, lithium demand will increase significantly over the next 10 years. These 3 lithium stocks have operations which are located in germany(ZNWD), Argentina(LAC), mexico(BCN) and the usa(LAC). All 3 are still relatively cheap, but risky as ZNWD and LAC are waiting for project approval before starting production, but could become very lucrative investments if approved. \n\nWind stocks are some of the worlds best to invest in currently due to their long term rapid growth, and long term future rapid growth as the world transitions over to sustainable energy. The majority of these firms have operations which are located in the USA, which is an untapped growing energy market. Biden will back large scale wind power in his upcoming bill. A great stock is Tpicomposites which manufactures blades for companies such as vestas, GE and siemens GA. As a result of the high demand for wind power, i see this company being heavily backed by the Biden administration as it is a domestic company. Nextera energy and orsted are 2 very high growth stocks, with orsted\u2019s main operations being located in europe, which they are rapidly expanding into with the worlds largest offshore wind farm, Hornsea in the first of 4 stages of development. Orsted have significant plans for operations in the USA, with 7 wind farms planned along the eastern seaboard, which will undoubtedly be backed by the biden administration. Orsted also have 3 under development and 2 under construction in taiwan, with the production of 2 of the wind farms solely going towards taiwan semi conductor. Nextera are a US based company with 50-55B in investments into infrastructure planned by 2022, with large numbers of solar, wind and battery storage facilities under development/construction, on top of its already extensive portfolio of projects. \n\nThe 3 ETF\u2019s that i have selected have all experienced significant growth in the past year. ICLN is an excellent tracker for sustainable companies and is not new to WSB so i will save my breath. RBTX is an ETF that tracks automation technology, which is a growing industry globally, especially in countries such as china, india and other countries where manufacturing represents s significant portion of the economy. Automation is also being increasingly used in developed countries which are trying to keep manufacturing at home, whilst staying competitive with developing countries. ECAR tracks all the major and minor automakers along with chip manufacturers and software companies and has experienced significant growth in the past year, with its largest weights being Tesla and XILINX which specialises in logic devices and chips which will be increasingly used in assistive driving technology. The company has reported YoY significant growth in revenue. \n\nI feel that if you are looking for green, sustainable growth stocks, this list may be the list for you.",

        "selftext": "**In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of AMD, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone! Let\u2019s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles &amp; PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.\n\nThe company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.\n\nSo, guys, let\u2019s go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.\n\nThe [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing &amp; Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn\u2019t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can\u2019t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.\n\nBoth of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing &amp; graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn\u2019t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation &amp; amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation. \n\nThey have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest &amp; tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.\n\nThe company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 &amp; Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.\n\nTheir product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel\u2019s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world\u2019s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.\n\nThey have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also [working](https://ibb.co/D9dDDYs) with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings &amp; Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.\n\nAMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future\n\nThe one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/N2YQFS9), which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/QH8RTCN) has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would [create](https://ibb.co/qJM6Gn4) synergies. [They](https://ibb.co/PcNhH58) are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it\u2019s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.\n\nAMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they [expect](https://ibb.co/RpcwXYr) an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.\n\nI used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA. \n\nFor the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.\n\nSo, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach. \n\nIf we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.\n\nFor my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.\n\nI think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high [demand](https://ibb.co/vQFwyRd) the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage &amp; digital currency mining.\n\nFor their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.\n\nThis means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest &amp; other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax. \n\nI [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.\n\nSo, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.\n\nI like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.   \n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets\u2026 I think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, [THIS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40. \n\nSo [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nI think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more &amp; more chips that also keep advancing in technology. \n\nThe company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/NCtxnFq), with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once [Intel](https://ibb.co/pjHdVFQ) also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it\u2019s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years &amp; a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all. \n\nAMD hasn\u2019t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it\u2019s a psychological resistance rather.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it\u2019s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.\n\nOne last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their [shares](https://ibb.co/zZcxm95) held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.\n\nSo, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think [Lisa SU](https://ibb.co/X2nVGTF) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the [company](https://ibb.co/WtBf4yF) has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel\u2019s performance.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "Achronix is a fabless semiconductor company that sells FPGA, eFPGA, system level products and supporting design tools. With Xilinx acquired by AMD and Altera acquired by Intel (not really a competitor right now cause everything Intel touches turns into a pile of shit) , Achronix is currently the only independent high end FPGA and the only company providing both FPGA and eFPGA. It is estimated that in the future, we will see more FPGA nodes than CPU nodes. The ratio might be something like 1 CPU to 16 FPGAs as acceleration will outweigh general compute in the CPU. With FPGA being able to be implemented into data acceleration in AI, Cloud, 5G and autonomous driving, Achronix is well positioned and is capable to compete in multiple lucrative sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bqgmuccezqc61.png?width=1668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00124359eec865012eb829ffab65a063bb521940\n\nFPGA is a highly valuable business due to its unlimited potential. Intel acquired Altera back in 2015 for $16.7 billion and with the latest acquisition of Xilinx by AMD for $35 billion. Achronix is currently sitting at around $2 bil valuation and is very undervalued given the competitive landscape (we might see an overpriced acquisition of Achronix in the future as both Intel and AMD paid well over the market valuation for both Altera and Xilinx and Achronix being the last one standing could help with the valuation as well). Ever since the acquisition of Altera, Intel has struggled to push for breaking through progress despite having to drop $30 bil on M&amp;As with very little return. The struggle has gone so far that Intel has been ordering chips from Achronix to produce accelerators. With the latest released Speedster 7t chips fabbed by TSMC on the 7nm nodes, Achronix is bringing serious threat to the top end FPGA market as the chip is able to go head to head with Xilinix\u2019s offerings at a considerably cheaper price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8216bfbgzqc61.png?width=1677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c1a2232cdc62e26710ddd7cff57991abd6c65a4\n\nWhile a lot of the revenue comes from selling chips, Achronix also generates revenue from licencing IP. With the Gen 4 eFPGA IP, Achronix was able to increase performance by 60%, reduce power by 50%, shrink die area by 65% while retaining and building upon all of the original functional capabilities which makes it primed to be integrated into data acceleration in AI, Cloud, 5G and autonomous driving by incorporating it into design. eFPGA is said to be the future in many ways because of the advantages that it brings to the table because by adding an eFPGA to an SOC, it can achieve a more flexible design, lower power, higher performance and lower overall system costs compared to standalone FPGA. With Achronix being the only company providing high end eFPGA, the future is definitely looking bright for Achronix.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4t0le92izqc61.png?width=1803&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffcc11abcd6a56fe77edf2c53fa0ac0ed0a8bc21\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ghumf98jzqc61.png?width=1890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bcfab20d8a6cff37461f7022e45211f14cb6e67\n\nSince 2017, Achronix has experienced seven-fold growth and is still expanding rapidly. It received $238 mil orders in 2020 and has $162 mil orders of non-cancellable and non-refundable orders in backlog. It is projected to have a 30% yoy growth, retain a 76% margin and a 32% EBIT margin. Compared to other players in the fabless semiconductor industries, Achronix has the highest projected yoy growth with one of the highest gross margins.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/63vs5etmzqc61.png?width=1791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=589d4b0981344c59ee8e206748ce98d6fcfc7dd2\n\nTo put it in another perspective, outside for the industry, Acrhonix projected growth rivals the growth of a fintech company while having a margin like a SAAS company.  Average growth of a fintech company is projected to be around 25% through 2022 with paypal at around 19%, square at around 40% and sofi at around 30% ( I'm just listing a few here ) On the margin side, Saas companies usually has a gross margin of around 60% to 70% which makes them a really compelling sector to invest in cause once the demand picks up, income will increase significantly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, Achronix is going to be one hell of a long term play because\n\n1. It's the only company that sells eFPGA\n2. The only independent company that sells high end FPGA  chips\n3. Exposure to bleeding multiple edge high growth and high potential industries with high demand\n4. Potential overvalued acquisition from another company\n5. Growth like a fintech, Gross Margin like a Saas company (Literally can't get better than this)\n\nTICKER IS ACEV",

        "selftext": "I trade semiconductor vol because the options are liquid despite their core businesses perplexing most of the middle-aged lacrosse bros on Wall Street. The basic idea of my most recent trade is to get long gamma and express a view on relative valuation spread by buying a call on INTC and buying a put on AMD, while also expressing a bullish view on legacy lithography machines by buying a call on CAJ into their earnings print.\n\nHere's the trade that I am carrying into AMD and CAJ earnings this week, with roughly equal amounts of premium allocated to each:\n\n* Long INTC 05Feb 56c\n* Long AMD 05Feb 89.5p\n* Long CAJ Feb 22.5c\n\n|*Name*|*Earnings Date*|*Implied Move for AMD earnings*|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|INTC|[Last Thursday PM](https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1439/intel-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020-financial)|3.2%|\n|AMD|[26Jan PM](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/987/amd-to-report-fourth-quarter-fiscal-year-2020-financial)|9.9%|\n|CAJ|[28Jan 3PM Tokyo](https://global.canon/en/ir/calendar/)|5.3%|\n\nThis trade is long delta overall but somewhat agnostic to overall sector valuation; if the floor falls out of the whole market, it is protected by long skew and long gamma. However, the inverse correlation of the AMD-INTC pair has been very strong in the past 10 trading days or so, so ignoring general market moves I expect the AMD-INTC spread to either widen or tighten on AMD's earnings print. This trade sells growth versus buying value within a very specific sub-sector. The CAJ component seems like a wildcard but it's a targeted play on lithography; I'll address that.\n\nAMD and Intel have become matched competitors in the CPU space. A few years back, Intel's over-eagerness to roll out the 10nm process node, combined with a slavish obsession with Moore's Law, caused them to avoid waiting for upcoming technologies that would have made their work much easier. As a result, [Intel ate 10nm shit](https://www.eetimes.com/intels-10nm-node-past-present-and-future/).\n\nAMD has gobbled up market share over the past several quarters, and Intel's most recent numbers show a decline in the Data-Center Group, indicating that the market share attrition may not be constrained to the consumer market. AMD stock has enjoyed a six-year bull market that began after Silver Lake attempted to buy a large chunk of equity and restructure the company; [ultimately, the Silver Lake deal didn't materialize](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/215353-amd-talks-with-private-equity-firm-silver-lake-fell-through-report), but the stock is up 4400% now versus where it was at that time. AMD is fabless, which means that their chips aren't made in-house, but rather by pure-play foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor.\n\nIn terms of performance, Intel's 10nm is roughly comparable to Taiwan Semiconductor's 7nm. Similarly,  Intel's upcoming 7nm is roughly comparable to Taiwan Semiconductor's 5nm. As you may know, [those numbers aren't direct measurements of transistor gate length](https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/). It's kind of like the iPhone 12 vs the Galaxy S21, where the two competing phones are from the same generation despite a difference in the numbers that each company uses to name them. Still, Intel has fallen behind by one node.\n\nRecently, [Third Point bought a stake in Intel and is pushing for a strategic reshaping of the company](https://www.yahoo.com/now/third-point-full-letter-intel-220753103.html), including the possible decoupling of Intel's foundry and design businesses, that is reminiscent of what AMD underwent in 2008 when it jettisoned GlobalFoundries to avoid bankruptcy. I think Third Point is smart to invest in Intel, but the strategic recommendations are foolish. After spinning off GlobalFoundries, AMD was a pariah stock for seven more years. AMD's renaissance came about largely due to market positivity regarding GPUs for parallel computing applications (in line with NVDA), and began with an earnings short squeeze in 2015. Promisingly, Intel has signed on a veteran engineer-manager-executive, a man whom [Intel assisted in obtaining an advanced academic education](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/pat-gelsinger-coming-home-to-intel-will-be-the-greatest-honor-of-my-career-) during his prior stint with the company, as CEO starting in the middle of February. Gelsinger understands the technology and -- having run VMWare as CEO -- he also understands the big customers.\n\nNowadays, AMD is a crowded long. INTC has been on the ropes in part because [pundits who don't understand the sector tell investors that there's no reason to buy the stock](https://youtu.be/lQvkjJW7wYk?t=284). True, AMD is an amazing company run by brilliant people, arguably a David that has grown to be Goliath's equal through decades of passion and perseverance. Even so, looking at the multiple spread between INTC (P/E 11) and AMD (P/E 130), it's hard to explain the width of that spread purely by blaming Intel's fabrication business (which is very much alive) or loss of market share (the whole market is growing and INTC is still the largest player).\n\nDespite the challenges presented by M1 and Zen 3, Intel is still king for fully-specced flagship notebooks if you look at who moves product; for example, [Dell's XPS13 uses 11th-Gen Intel](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/help-me-choose/cp/hmc-intel-processor-xps), [Apple's Macbook Pro 13 uses 10th-Gen Intel](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP819?locale=en_US), and [Lenovo's upcoming Thinkpad X1 Carbon Gen9 uses 11th-Gen Intel](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/coming-soon/X1-Carbon-G9/p/22TP2X1X1C9). AMD has copycatted some of Intel's strategic moves, notably [acquiring Xilinx for $35B a few years after Intel bought Altera for $17B](https://semiengineering.com/amd-wants-an-fpga-company-too/). (Xilinx and Altera were the two major producers of FPGAs, chips that can alter their logic structure based on instructions from the end user.)\n\nIntel also dominates the server market with something in the ballpark of [90% market share despite losing ground](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/318217-amd-arm-both-increased-their-server-market-share-in-q3-2020) to the competition.\n\nAny move that Intel makes to outsource chips to Taiwan Semiconductor's 5nm process would put pressure on gross margins for Apple and AMD, because [more competition for 5nm fab allocation reduces availability](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmc-prioritizing-apple-consoles) and eventually drives prices higher. That's an aggressive move in today's high-demand fab environment. Intel putting some CPUs on Taiwan Semiconductor's 5nm process doesn't mean Intel has given up on its own 7nm, but rather that Intel wants to suck oxygen out of the room where its competitors breathe, while it gets its own technology ready for prime time. Also, AMD is an important customer for TSMC, but if their allocation of TSMC fab capacity undershoots demand, then my assumption is that AMD would have to compete with other important TSMC customers for whatever additional capacity they attempt to book. INTC may not have this problem because it's an IDM.\n\nMy view is that Taiwan Semiconductor's [5nm isn't the central driver of the semiconductor market right now; it made up only 20% of the company's wafer revenue](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/14/taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-company-limited/) in the most recent quarter, and semiconductor demand nowadays is overwhelming across the board. Surprisingly, the present shortage is not entirely due to work-from-home and distance learning. The legacy end of the market, ie 22nm and larger, is [a more reasonable choice for automotive applications and was actually experiencing overcapacity prior to the pandemic](https://semiengineering.com/foundries-prepare-for-battle-at-22nm/). Even [Bosch, which owns a number of its own fabs, may have to pay damages because it is unable to deliver some orders to automakers](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-chips/volkswagen-looks-to-claim-damages-from-suppliers-over-chip-shortages-idUSKBN29T09I) due to chip shortages. More broadly, [auto industry experts say that chips are hard to find across the board](https://barrons.com/articles/auto-chip-shortage-will-slow-down-car-makers-analog-devices-ceo-says-51610499262) \\-- including chips fabricated on legacy process nodes. [Automakers are scrambling to acquire](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35228204/microchip-shortage-car-production-disruption/) chips for conventional and electric vehicles, which have different functional requirements than a PC or smartphone. ASML (which dominates the semiconductor lithography machinery market with 80+% market share) stated last quarter that they had excess inventory in anticipation of greater demand, and this quarter they shipped 9 EUV machines and booked 6 net orders for future EUV shipments, but those leading-edge machines aren't particularly critical for production of devices like control units and power ICs. ASML saw the demand coming, but in contrast the back end of the market got caught off guard.\n\nIn other words, the semiconductor market requires greater *legacy* process node production (again, 22nm and above) right now. [Toyota, Ford, Nissan, and Fiat-Chrysler are cutting production](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-honda-output/chip-shortage-forces-ford-toyota-nissan-fca-to-cut-vehicle-production-idUSKBN29D1NF) because they need more bread-and-butter semiconductors to do basic important things like run traction control systems and tell the injectors how much fuel to deliver. In my view, the semiconductor shortage at legacy process nodes is only going to get more relevant as time passes and electric vehicles become more and more mainstream. Compound the electrification of the auto market with the pandemic boom in auto sales, and it's easy to imagine a resurgence of chip production at legacy process nodes. It's not hard to imagine that automakers and parts suppliers will buy some of their own chip machinery for upcoming EVs, but it takes years to set up a new fab so there will be broad-based demand for all the technologies involved. My bet is that some of the demand has already progressed into the order books of makers of semiconductor machinery -- in other words, the middle-aged lacrosse bros will be sifting through the semiconductor equipment names pretty soon.\n\nEnter Canon. Despite [recent improvements in demand for mirrorless cameras and inkjet printers](https://global.canon/en/ir/release/2021/p2021jan14e.pdf), this company has been forgotten by investors for many reasons, but it makes DUV (Deep UV, in other words not as low wavelength as EUV) machines too. Think of lithography machines as room-sized laser printers for semiconductors. They employ very precise optics, and that's why optics manufacturers like Canon are involved ([ASML works with Zeiss](https://www.asml.com/en/news/press-releases/zeiss-and-asml-strengthen-partnership-for-next-generation-of-euv-lithography-(54430))). Canon only holds about 5% of the lithography machine market. One difference between EUV and DUV is that you can't use lenses for EUV because the lens glass would absorb all the light, so you have to use extremely specialized mirrors (which still absorb 90+% of the light) instead. Canon's DUV machines are not as good as ASML's DUV machines, and right now ASML is the only supplier of EUV. Canon isn't a dedicated lithography house, but it makes about 20% of its profits from the segment that makes and sells photolithography equipment.\n\nDUV lithography is not an appropriate tool for the newest process nodes like TSMC's 5nm. It uses lasers from wavelengths (248nm, 198nm, 157nm) that can't reliably be resolved to features in the 5nm range even if you use a bunch of tricks (aka Resolution Enhancement Techniques). In contrast, EUV employs 13.5 nm lasers that can do so, in theory down to 6.75nm (half the wavelength) without RETs.\n\nEUV and the leading-edge nodes enabled by it, eg Taiwan Semiconductor's 5nm process, are amazing for mobile devices because they fit lots of little units onto a single silicon wafer (higher wafer efficiency), and produce chips that use less power per unit of computation (better battery life and less heat generation). All of this is important for CPUs, GPUs, and RAM, but extremely tiny features are not necessary for every semiconductor application. Power electronics, control systems, and other chips that you might find on a car or truck have different functional requirements from an iPad or PS5. There's good money to be made using legacy semiconductor processes; by all appearances, GlobalFoundries (remember them?) doesn't even have plans to go down into the single-digit process nodes for the time being, with its leading-edge node being [12LP+](https://www.eenewsanalog.com/news/globalfoundries-12lp-finfet-process-ready-production) after [having cancelled its 7nm plans](https://www.anandtech.com/show/13277/globalfoundries-stops-all-7nm-development) in 2018.\n\nI can't stress how big the impact of semiconductor demand from automakers has become. Imagine: several major automakers have slowed or stopped production just as [EVs are entering the mainstream](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/22/electric-vehicles-close-to-tipping-point-of-mass-adoption), and [even the aluminum market is feeling the effects](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alcoa-slides-warning-higher-costs-214731067.html). I think the market has overlooked DUV demand because, again, most people on Wall Street don't really understand the different products and technologies within the chip sector, and even those who were knowledgeable about the sector didn't foresee broad-based demand for legacy chips.\n\nCAJ trades at a 37 P/E. (Nikon is another name similarly involved in DUV, but I don't trade options on OTC stocks.) Last quarter, [Canon made 20.2% of its overall sales revenue from the business unit that includes lithography machines and other industrial devices](https://global.canon/en/ir/results/2020/rslt2020q3e.pdf). Given the fact that Canon has a mature lithography business with minority market share in the sector, the potential for market share expansion due to higher demand for DUV would really transform the company's role in the segment.\n\nIf the AMD/INTC pair gamma trade goes well, I may take it off and roll the premium into more CAJ calls.",
