        "selftext": "I know /r/stocks is retard, but check this dudes post to justify my title: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/5u09c2/aes\\_corp\\_renewable\\_energy\\_storage/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/5u09c2/aes_corp_renewable_energy_storage/)\n\nSIX (three) years ago, this guy had tsla, said it was not just a car company. But see, how he says AES does the same thing and isnt getting as much hype?\n\n I'm not saying AES will go to $1000, but I think it deserves a $23 price target, the one morgan issued BEFORE earnings. If they issue a new, higher one, AES has a chance of moving even further. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Heres a random picture for the retards who dont want to read, dont know how to read, are retarded.](https://preview.redd.it/q2h0vvskjaz51.png?width=303&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69e013c001c457fbc7da63be40455828d66f1619)\n\nFurthermore, AES has had massive call buying, if you check CVS, FISV, they had the same and ended up breaking out to the upside. Now, I'm no technical analyst, but AES is EXACTLY at its pre-covid highs, and just check the options chain for yourself on yahoo, or barchart. The volume and open interest is OUTSTANDING. \n\nThere is a serious chance for this stock to break out, wallstreet is waiting for a break to $23 based on the options. I have $1800 on the company!!! I can post screenshots if u really want. this is not a pump and dumb, tis is LEGIT DD! \n\n**TLDR**: **read the stocks link post i gave, do you**r own DD, check analyst price targets in thinkorswim and compare how morgan price targets have risen and actually changed and accurately predicted price.\n\ncurrent price target from morgan is $23, calls that are crazy is like 22k in nov 20 (WEEKLY NOW!! WOW) $22 and 22k in dec 18 $22. So this option buyer predicts $22 AT LEAST? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhmmmm?? you do the math boys.",

        "selftext": "[https://imgur.com/a/3PGzrsz](https://imgur.com/a/3PGzrsz) at RSI support\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/FuXyCmu](https://imgur.com/a/FuXyCmu) Bollinger band, closing in on a good support. really suggest buying at these levels. If you don't trust technical, read for further fundamentals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDG is a great stock to buy. They are continuously growing and have opened their 17,000 store just today.\n\nThey are very neoliberal and take advantage of low minimum wage laws, and in fact provide goodm cheap,  food to those who live in food deserts.\n\nThey have earnings on 12/3, possibly melt up catalyst.\n\nYes I know stock gets little volume, and the spreads are meh, but if you manage to cop weeklies for the $210 call, you will profit no matter what. The Bollinger Bands and RSI show this stock is at a good price.\n\nFurther more, looking at price history you can see this stock has a strong support at $208. So again, I urge you, if you want a play to make money, buy weekly $DG calls at open, **(or any strike date for that matter, as long as it is ATM)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know, there is no volume, there is no whale leading the way on Dollar General options. But this is a great stock, and at a $208 price, I think it is very likely we rebound to at least $210. if not $212.5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwith a rebound like that, weekly calls with print 2x. again this is an just an adversary message for those who like free 2x-4x money. DG is a strong company and severally undervalued\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy is DG undervalued? Well look at finviz.com and [mcoscillator.com](https://mcoscillator.com). One, fin viz, shows a decline in retail sales by .3%. However, we cannot not know for sure this is due to DG, and even if so, its not a huge decline. I honestly believe DG true price, post earnings, to be $224. However, since we are before the earnings. I really suggest betting on it holding this $208 price. If it even goes up to $210 you will 1.5x your money\n\nAgain, I cannot stress this enough, no matter how the market moves, DG has been gaining strong and looking at price history, $210 is probably the true value of the stock (moderate estimate)\n\nTherefore, I think buying at this price give  you good odds to make money. Lower risk, higher reward.\n\nThank you for reading\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonal Positions: end of day copped $210 calls for $180 each (bought 2), long i have 1/15/2021 $260 calls ($2000 premium, bought 4 for 2.20 at the absolutely wrongest time and averaged down).",

        "selftext": "Payments stocks Square  \ufffcand Fiserv \ufffc are looking more attractive to Wall Street, while PayPal \ufffc may be facing more pressure to maintain its exceptional growth.\n\nShares of Square (ticker: SQ) have surged 215% this year to around $197. The valuation looks steep, as Barron\u2019s has noted. But the stock has defied skeptics, and Mizuho sees the shares gaining more than 50% over the next year. Analyst Dan Dolev raised his price target to $300 this week, largely on the strength of Square\u2019s highly profitable and fast-growing Cash App.\n\n\u201cLike good wine\u2014and in theory, marriage too\u2014Cash App\u2019s cohorts are improving over time,\u201d Dolev writes, referring to Cash App\u2019s active user base.\n\nDolev argues that Square is finding attractive new ways to monetize Cash App, which competes with PayPal\u2019s (PYPL) Venmo and other peer-to-peer payment services. Square makes money off the app by charging fees for instant deposit, which accounted for 54% of the app\u2019s gross profits in the third quarter, Dolev estimates. But that is down from 80% in 2018, reflecting faster growth in other areas, including a debit card, business payments, and trading of coin.\n\nDolev increased his gross profit estimates from the app from $2.8 billion in 2020 to $7.7 billion by 2023 as its user base jumps from 32 million to 66 million active users. Cash App is also gaining on Venmo in the 15 most populous states, based on Google searches, he adds. Cash App accounted for 60% of searches in key markets since April, up from 39% in 2018.\n\nOne caveat to all this is coin. Square acts as a broker for coin, buying the digital currency and selling it to customers, who store and trade it on Cash App. Square benefits when coin prices rise and volume increases. Coin prices have more than doubled this year, including a surge of more than 80% since September. But if demand and pricing plummet, so too will Square\u2019s gross profits.\n\nOne other headwind for Square\u2019s stock is valuation: Shares trade at 174 times estimated 2021 earnings. PayPal trades at 42 times earnings. Adyen  \ufffc(ADYEY), a Dutch digital payments stock that is growing rapidly, trades at 121 times earnings, making Square perhaps the most richly valued.\n\nNonetheless, Dolev argues that the shares are undervalued, saying they\u2019re worth $300 or 15 times 2023 sales. That would be more than double Square\u2019s already steep price to sales of 7 times, which may be a stretch even for fans of high-growth stocks.\n\nOne payments stock that\u2019s more of a value play is Fiserv (FISV). The company runs a \u201cmerchant acquiring\u201d business for retailers, setting up and managing their payment systems, and it handles e-commerce and payment processing for banks. The stock is down 2% this year due to pressure on merchant acquiring as retail sales volume shifted further into online channels during the pandemic.\n\nBut that\u2019s the opportunity, argues MoffettNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis. She upgraded Fiserv stock to a Buy with a $145 price target this week and raised her earnings estimates for 2021.\n\nWhy get bullish now? Fiserv\u2019s earnings are holding up surprisingly well, she writes, expecting the company to post $4.44 a share this year and $5.44 in 2021, a gain of 23% The stock\u2019s valuation looks appealing at 21 times estimated 2021 earnings, a slight discount to the S&amp;P 500. And merchant acquiring is in a healthier competitive position, she argues, noting that Fiserv should maintain its market share and grow revenues 14% in 2021. Fiserv is making headway with small and midsize businesses with its Clover payments platform, and the company has a \u201cstrong international presence in high growth countries\u201d such as Brazil and India.\n\nEllis expects the stock to earn a higher multiple as earnings and revenue growth reaccelerate, fueled partly by ongoing cost-savings from its big 2019 merger with First Data. Fiserv also has new CEO, Frank Bisignano, who is likely to push the company into new e-commerce areas. And more mergers are likely, Ellis argues, partly because Fiserv looks relatively under-leveraged. Acquisition targets include Worldline \ufffc (WLN.FR) or Nexi  \ufffc(Nexi.IT) in Europe, she notes, along with PagSeguro Digital \ufffc (PAGS) or StoneCo \ufffc (STNE), both based in Brazil.\n\nSource: Barron's",

        "selftext": "Trade it, don't marry it.\n\nI've been saying this for years, but Chinese ADRs are notoriously shit. BABA? A shell company in the Caymans. NIO? CCP boy toy Elon clone to get you to buy-in. Chinese ADRs don't give you any ownership in the firm and Chinese stocks, because it's a \"communist\" country, actually don't even have the concept of ownership. Stocks in China are 'tracking' stocks.\n\nFor even more spice, try small-cap Chinese reverse mergers. Garbage Chinese companies buy some company in America that is already listed on a stock exchange, merge with them, and then are able to list without going through the regulatory scrutiny.\n\nDefrauding foreign investors in China is completely legal. Forging financial documents is unenforceable. Research groups that physically visit these companies often find they are abysmal compared to their PR / marketing claims.\n\nDon't believe me? Watch [The China Hustle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55892jT06aI) for actual cases and documentation of widespread financial fraud in Chinese companies that trade on American stock exchanges.\n\nHappy trading.",

        "selftext": "Back in September 2019, Michael Burry predicted an index fund bubble. Since I invest index funds and write about them with relish, I was intrigued. But I quickly moved on.\n\nThen another headline caught my eye. It was an episode of Odd Lots podcast titled,  [**\u201cWhy Passive Investing Might Be Distorting the Market.\u201d**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2020-02-07/why-passive-investing-might-be-distorting-the-market-podcast)   I immediately listened to the episode, featuring investor and fund manager Mike Green. And then I listened again. Considering a lot of my net worth is currently tied up in index funds, I want to understand why some people think index funds are fools\u2019 gold.\n\nSo today, I\u2019m going to play devil\u2019s advocate and talk about both sides of the conversation. Is there an index fund bubble? A market crash around the corner? Or is passive investing still the winning strategy it\u2019s always been?\n\nBelow, you\u2019ll find compelling arguments from investors Mike Green and Michael Burry, who both say there is a bubble. Then I\u2019ll follow up with comments from financial analyst Ben Carlson and portfolio manager Ben Felix, both of whom see no bubble . It\u2019s #TeamMike vs. #TeamBen. I\u2019ll also pull some soundbites from Raoul Pal, a former hedge fund manager who now produces financial videos with a silky British accent. And then I\u2019ll add in my own thoughts at the end.\n\n# Quick reminder: what\u2019s an index fund?\n\nAn index fund owns a wide assortment of assets (e.g. stocks), and owns those assets in proportion to their market share. Uh\u2026that\u2019s a lot of FinSpeak. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nFor an example, let\u2019s look at an S&amp;P 500 index fund. An S&amp;P 500 index fund would own all of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500. Since Apple and Microsoft each make up about 5% of the S&amp;P 500, this index fund would be comprised of about 5% Apple and 5% Microsoft. But Chipotle would only compose about 0.08% of the index, because it\u2019s 0.08% of the S&amp;P. In this way, the index fund is benchmarked to the S&amp;P, like a shadow that follows all of the body\u2019s movements.\n\nSimilarly, a \u201ctotal stock market fund\u201d would own every stock in the market. There are tons of options in the index fund world.\n\nLet\u2019s get into the arguments that claim indexing is now in a bubble.\n\n# Part I \u2013 Bubble! \u2013 \u201cThe tail is now wagging the dog\u201d\n\nOne of Mike Green\u2019s first points on Odd Lots is this: the original idea behind indexing is that active traders and actively managed funds will dictate how the market behaves, and that a small number of passive investors (e.g. index funds) can simply go along for the ride. The large majority active traders are the dog; the minority passive investors are the tail. The dog does what it wants. The tail only follows.\n\nIf dogs don\u2019t do it for you, I like the boat analogy. Think of actively managed funds and active traders as large cruise liners and passive investors as a small canoe. The cruise liner picks its course. The canoe ropes onto the cruise liner and gets a free ride. The cruise liner doesn\u2019t notice the small canoe\u2019s drag whatsoever; its course is unaffected. This big-small relationship is the original assumption behind passive investing. Market behavior is dictated by the active majority, and the passive minority gets a free ride.\n\nHowever, asserts Green, we now live in a paradigm where active and passive investing are too close in size. Therefore, the fundamental assumption no longer rings true.\n\nMillions of Average Janes and Joes\u2013individual investors\u2013are using index funds to invest huge portions of their income and savings. After all, that\u2019s how many 401(k)s and their non-American equivalents are set up. Green points out how recent U.S. legislation changes are pushing 401(k)s and passive investing even further into the mainstream.\n\nPassive investing is no longer the \u201csmall tail.\u201d It\u2019s no longer the canoe. It\u2019s now a fairly large boat, and the active management cruise liner is impacted by towing such a large passive boat.\n\nThe past 30 years have seen index funds grow and grow. Index fund inflows are the \u201csingle largest transactors in the market by far\u201d Therefore, by definition, they are not passive. Index funds have to be influencing the market. What might this influence look like?\n\n# Passive investing influences the market\n\nLet\u2019s go back to our S&amp;P 500 index fund from before. The S&amp;P 500 went up \\~30% in 2019. Where does this gain come from?\n\nSome of it probably comes from fundamental growth in the S&amp;P companies. They\u2019re doing better! Active investors respond by saying, \u201cIf the company is better, then these stocks are now worth more!\u201d\n\nAlternatively, what happens when millions of individual investors put their retirement savings into S&amp;P 500 index funds? It\u2019s simple supply and demand. Joe and Jane are increasing the demand for S&amp;P stocks, therefore the price will increase.\n\nWhen Joe and Jane were the \u201csmall canoe,\u201d their demand didn\u2019t affect the market. But these passive investors are no longer \u201cjust along for the ride.\u201d They are actively impacting the ride. Last year\u2019s 30% price increase is not based only on fundamental growth. Instead, the Average Janes and Joes are artificially increasing the price of the S&amp;P 500 via their demand for index funds.\n\n# The effects of \u201cindex inclusion\u201d\n\nWhat about \u201cCompany 501;\u201d that is, the first company not in the S&amp;P 500? Well, it does not receive the benefits of being a part of the S&amp;P 500 index funds. It does not receive the demand that occurs from inclusion in that index fund, and this exclusion affects Company 501\u2019s price.\n\nMike Green says that historical data clearly shows this growing impact on asset values\u2013it\u2019s called \u201cindex inclusion.\u201d This is true for all sorts of index funds. They include some stocks, exclude others, and there\u2019s a recognizable delineation between those included and excluded.\n\nGreen says there\u2019s a \u201cdistinct and permanent shift in the valuation and price levels associated with these securities\u201d when they are included or ejected from an index. Companies inside of indices are receiving more attention than they fundamentally deserve. Companies outside of indices, therefore, are getting the cold shoulder. This lack of true valuation is one of the formative factors of a bubble.\n\n# \u201cFire!\u201d in a theater\n\nIn the past 40 years, passive investing has done nothing but grow. But eventually, that growth will end. Individual investors will retire. Withdrawals will take place. What happens when you take the money out?\n\nAt that point, Green states that the artificial inflation of index funds will cease, and quickly turn south. As more retail investors sell, prices will drop. When investors see prices dropping, they\u2019ll get scared and sell more. The vicious cycle will continue\u2013sell, drop, sell more, drop more\u2013into a index fund crash. It\u2019ll be an old-fashioned bank run.\n\nOr, as Nicholas Nassim Taleb has written, \u201cthe market is like a large movie theater with a small door.\u201d If everyone is looking to get out, the only way to do so is to offer the doorman a better price than the other people. Prices will plummet. Pop goes the index fund bubble.\n\n# Is it the British accent?\n\nRaoul Pal looks the part, sounds the part, and produces his videos while sitting in front of monitors chock full of financial data. My bulls\\*\\*\\* detector is whirring to life, but something about that accent is just so factual.\n\nPal\u2019s argument is that baby boomers\u2013through no fault of their own\u2013have been dumping too much money into passive funds (pensions, 401(k)\u2019s, etc). When they start selling en masse\u2013which will happen soon!\u2013then pop goes the index fund bubble.\n\nThere are 76 million baby boomers in the U.S., and their average age is now 65 years old. The wave of retirees is about to crest. And when they start to pull money out for retirement, we will see the large theater/small door issue. Prices will plummet.\n\nBut, says Pal, index funds aren\u2019t the only issue. Boomers will also face issues trying to sell their houses. They\u2019ll have issues trying to sell their material goods. Baby Boomers were such prolific consumers that the economy will be overwrought will all their stuff, and prices everywhere will fall. Growth will cease as markets are flooded with goods. A vicious cycle will ensue.\n\nAnd then \u201cthe doom loop of corporate debt will get ignited.\u201d Oh no, not a doom loop! In short, says Pal, corporations have recently gotten into the habit of:\n\n1. Borrowing money (this is the corporate debt)\n\n2. Buying shares of their own stock\u2014a.k.a \u201cstock buy backs\u201d\n\n3. \u2026which drives the price of their stock higher (P.S. this is an artificial price increase)\n\n4. \u2026which makes the company appear more valuable, and usually lets the biggest stockholders (e.g. the executives) get extra rich\n\nAnd Pal\u2019s right. Corporations have been gluttons for their own stocks in recent years. Just read about Apple\u2019s buyback tactics.\n\nEventually, these corporations will have to pay back their debts. And their artificial valuations will come back to Earth. Stock prices will plummet. Indexes and pension funds will plummet. And Baby Boomers\u2019 selling will cause further pricing drops.\n\nAnd thus, claims Pal, the third Baby Boomer crash will occur. And every good story has the symmetry of threes.\n\n# Problems with Pal\n\nMy core issue with Pal is that he\u2019s as much a story teller as he is fact teller. And therefore, it\u2019s hard to tell if he\u2019s selling olive oil or snake oil.\n\nFor example, this sounds impressive: \u201cThe baby boomers accumulated the greatest concentration of wealth the world has ever seen. And they\u2019ll destroy it too.\u201d Whoa! Rise and fall. The double-edged sword. The boomer giveth, and the boomer taketh away.\n\nPal provides facts to back up his claims. But most of his facts are arguable at best.\n\nThe 2000 Dot Com bubble? It happened because Boomers flooded the stock market with their investments, says Pal. And then \u201ceverything got dashed on the rocks, as those markets collapsed.\u201d\n\nThe Baby Boomers\u2013then age 45 on average\u2013turned to real estate, says Pal. Can you guess what happened next? The 2008 Subprime Mortgage and Financial Crisis! Baby Boomers are so many in number, says Pal, that their sum-total behavior can\u2019t help but create bubbles.\n\nAfter 2000 and 2008, the Boomers were worried about their retirement savings, goes Pal\u2019s argument. So now they\u2019ve got to take risk, and they were forced to do so in the stock market. Well, what\u2019s the easiest way to invest in stocks? Through passive investing! And as we\u2019ve now learned twice\u2013according the Pal\u2013where the Boomer money goes, a bubble will soon follow.\n\nIt\u2019s a nice story. It has symmetry. It has foreshadowing. It\u2019s narrated with a silky British accent.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it has an iota of truth. Euphoric day-trading of \u201c.com\u201d companies led to the 2000 Dot Com bubble. Passive investing is the exact opposite of that kind of behavior! Perhaps the money is coming from some of the same people, but that\u2019s not evidence for the existence of an index fund bubble. Pal is grasping at straws.\n\n# Michael Burry: Big Short to Big Bubble\n\nMichael Burry is an investor and hedge fund manager who correctly foresaw the 2008 financial crisis, and managed to make a boat-load of money for himself and his customers through his correct prediction. If you\u2019ve seen the movie The Big Short, Michael Burry is played by Christian Bale.\n\nBurry\u2019s argument for an index fund bubble is a less scary than Green\u2019s, and certainly less apocalyptic than Pal\u2019s.\n\nBurry\u2019s claim is that indexing has caused an artificial bubble that\u2019s inflating stocks inside the index, and thus leaving stocks outside the index ripe for the picking. It\u2019s the \u201cindex inclusion\u201d argument again.\n\nBut where Green sees a dangerous bubble, Burry sees more of an opportunity. Ready for another metaphor?\n\nImagine a pair of identical twin basketball all-stars. Everything about them is the same, including their skills. Except that one twin plays college ball for Duke\u2013he\u2019s always on TV\u2013while the other plays for Harvard\u2013a good academic school, but not a basketball Mecca.\n\nThe average basketball fan would be biased towards the Duke player. He\u2019s on a better team, he gets more media coverage, and has more post-season success. The average fan would certainly believe that the Duke twin has better long-term prospects, and therefore would deserve a bigger professional contract.\n\nBut since I built this strawman hypothetical, you and I know the truth! The two twins have the same exact skill set. Therefore, signing the Harvard twin at his lower price would actually be quite the financially efficient move.\n\nMichael Burry\u2019s claim is that this is what\u2019s happening with passive investing. Near-identical companies are being over- or under-valued due to their index inclusion or exclusion.\n\nStocks that are inside of index funds are like the Duke twin\u2013they are being over-valued simply because of where they are. While stocks not in the index are like Harvard twin\u2013they are under-valued, and therefore should be targeted by smart people looking to make more money.\n\nIn my opinion, this is less of a \u201cindex fund bubble\u201d and more of an \u201canti-index opportunity.\u201d\n\nBurry is simply saying, \u201cThere\u2019s an inefficiency here, I\u2019ve discovered it, and I plan on making money off it. P.S.\u2013come invest with me so we can both make money together.\u201d\n\nGood work, Mike! Go exploit that inefficiency!\n\n# Price Discovery is becoming fragile\n\nBurry\u2019s second claim is that price discovery is becoming fragile. \u201cPrice discovery\u201d is a fancy term for \u201cbuyers and sellers determining a price where they\u2019re willing to make a deal.\u201d\n\nThink about Craigslist. Someone wants $200 for a used snowblower. Snow?! Yes, in Rochester it helps to have a snowblower. So, you take a look at the snowblower and counteroffer $150. The owner haggles back to $175\u2026and you have a deal! That\u2019s price discovery.\n\nTypically, stock market price discovery involves many buyers and sellers conducting detailed analyses of a company\u2019s holdings and profits and cash flows\u2013all of the fundamental business metrics.\n\nBut passive investing doesn\u2019t care about those fundamental metrics. Instead, passive investing simply follows the leader. It assumes that others in the market have already done the fundamental research, and that the current price of a stock is \u201cright.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a little bit like saying, \u201cThe last Craigslist used snowblower went for $200, so I\u2019ll buy the next one for $200 sight unseen.\u201d Are you sure you want to trust the last buyer and seller? What if they were dopes? Don\u2019t you want to look at the snowblower and make a decision for yourself?\n\nSince passive investing doesn\u2019t rely on price discovery, Burry argues that prices are now dangerously skewed from what traditional price discovery would suggest. This cannot go on forever, and eventually the prices will snap back to where they fundamentally belong.\n\nOr, you could say, the index fund bubble will pop. This, Burry says, is very similar to how housing and CDO pricing behavior malfunctioned before the 2008 crisis. It will be a painful, painful snap.\n\n# Part II \u2013 The other side: Index funds are fine\n\nWhile I appreciate the logic behind Misters Green and Burry and Pal, there\u2019s plenty of good money still betting on index funds\u2019 future success. Let\u2019s start with [**Ben Carlson**](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2019/09/debunking-the-silly-passive-is-a-bubble-myth/). . Ben is financial analyst, author and blogger (nice!), and podcast host. I\u2019m a big fan of A Wealth of Common Sense (the blog) and Animal Spirits (the podcast). Thanks for sharing all the good work, Ben.\n\nAnyway, what does Ben have to say about the index fund bubble and passive investing?\n\n# The tail is not wagging the dog.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s get back to dogs and tails and boats. Carlson writes, \u201cIndex funds hold less than 15% of shares in public companies.\u201d While this is a growing number\u2013it was 3.3% in 2002 and 6.8% in 2009\u2013passive investing is neither a majority nor plurality.\n\nIf we combine all exchange traded funds and all mutual funds, that percentage rises to about 35% ownership of all shares. That means that active investors\u2013the dog\u2013own at least 65% of the equity market, and therefore are still wagging the tail. All is well in the dog/boat metaphor universe, says Carlson.\n\n# Bias! Bias! Read all about it!\n\nAnother of Carlson\u2019s arguments is that active investing, by nature, is biased against passive investing. Passive is stealing active\u2019s business share, and now active is biting back.\n\nPassive investing shadows what the active investors are doing. But rather than spending money on research and trades, passive investing keeps expenses\u2013and fees\u2013to a minimum. Passive has all the profits of active investing, but none of the costs: ipso facto, passive investing is better. And the active investors don\u2019t like it! The \u201cindex fund bubble\u201d is their propaganda technique.\n\nBesides, let\u2019s consider any and all claims that passive investing is doing something \u201cwrong.\u201d Logically speaking, anything that passive investing is \u201cdoing wrong\u201d first has to be done by active investors.\n\nYou can\u2019t blame your shadow for flipping you the middle finger\u2013the shadow only copies the source. Similarly, passive investing only copies what active investors are doing. It\u2019s a simple argument in logic.\n\n# The price discovery argument\n\nPrice discovery is a cop-out, says Carlson. There is way more trading occurring today than most times in the stock market\u2019s history. In the book Index Revolution, author Charley Ellis writes that about 95% of all trades today are done by active managers\u2013there\u2019s plenty of opportunity for price discovery. It\u2019s all about trading volume.\n\nThis means that the prices aren\u2019t skewed. The prices aren\u2019t a stretched rubber band, ready to snap back. There\u2019s no index fund bubble, waiting to pop. Instead, the active investors are setting the prices and price discovery is healthy.\n\n# So what\u2019s Michael Burry worried about?\n\nBesides, Carlson says, when else in life do we expect individuals to actively partake in price discovery? Do you haggle with the grocery cashier about the cost of oranges? No! All over our economy, prices are set and individual consumers simply choose to buy, or not. They don\u2019t barter or bargain.\n\nI\u2019m not sure I agree with Ben\u2019s point here. It\u2019s true: we don\u2019t haggle at grocery stores. Instead we\u2019re presented with Hobson\u2019s choice\u2013we either take it, or leave it. If you don\u2019t want to pay $12 for a bag of oranges, you don\u2019t have to.\n\nBut are people thinking about Hobson\u2019s choice when they passively invest in index funds? I don\u2019t think so. I think a lot of people are \u201cblindly\u201d putting their bi-weekly 401(k) contributions into index funds, regardless of the price. There\u2019s not much \u201ctake it, or leave it\u201d going on. It\u2019s just \u201ctake it.\u201d\n\nMy conclusion: index investors might be blindly buying in, but they\u2019re still buying at a price that was intelligently discovered through the fundamental analyses of active investors.\n\n# Ben Felix from YouTube\n\n [**Ben Felix**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv0pJh8mFk0) is a portfolio manager at PWL Capital, and popular creator of YouTube financial/investment videos.\n\nI really like one of Felix\u2019s foundational arguments against the idea of the bubble. That idea is: assets under management do not set prices; instead, trading sets prices.\n\nSo Green and Burry should not be asking, \u201cHow much money is in indexes?\u201d Instead, the question should be, \u201cHow much trading is done by indexing?\u201d This means that the size of the boats doesn\u2019t matter. In fact, it means the boat metaphor doesn\u2019t really make sense.\n\nSo let\u2019s relate it back to the quote from Charley Ellis: 95% of all trades today are done by active managers. That means that price discovery is dominated by active trading. And it means that there shouldn\u2019t be any bubble driven by price discovery.\n\nBlackrock, another investment management firm, estimates that for every $1 of passive trades, there are $22 of active trades. Again, this points to the same conclusion: there is no issue with price discovery.\n\n# Some ideas from the academics\n\n Felix quotes a couple serious economics papers\u2013one by [**Fama/French**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=502605), another from [**Palia/Sokolinksi.**](https://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/Paper_P%26S_Darius.pdf) \n\nFama &amp; French came to the conclusion that it doesn\u2019t take much active investing to create an efficient (i.e. non-bubble) market. Passive investing, they say, is pushing bad active managers out of the market. And those who remain? Only the skilled active managers. It\u2019s survival of the fittest. Culling the weak should only make the market more efficient. More efficient = better price discovery = no bubble.\n\nPalia and Sokolinski have a really interesting theory. In brief, they claim that index funds drive down the cost of short selling, which makes short selling more efficient, and that leads to better price discovery.\n\nThey start with the simple truth that index funds hold onto lots of stocks. And since the supply of stocks is high, index funds can easily lend out those stocks to short sellers (people betting that a stock will go down). The short seller pays the index fund a small fee, which gets passed onto the passive investor in the form of low costs.\n\nHowever, since there are so many index funds out there, the short sellers have many different options of where they borrow stocks from. With high supply comes low prices. They can find their short sources very cheaply. This makes the cost of shorting go down.\n\nAnd thus, conclude Palia and Sokolinski, passive investing is creating a more efficient market for short sellers, and a more efficient market leads to better price discovery.\n\n# Part III \u2013 Home-grown arguments and takeaways\n\nNow that you\u2019ve heard the smart people talk, let me bless you with my pro-index ideas.\n\nFirst, index investing is self-corrective.\n\nTo wit, let\u2019s take another look at Michael Burry\u2019s argument: \u201cpassive investing has an inefficiency in undervaluing non-indexed companies, and I plan on taking advantage of that.\u201d\n\nIf Burry is correct, then more active managers will follow his lead and make their money. And right behind them will be their shadow a.k.a. passive investing. The market is a self-correcting system, where money flows towards the best values. Passive investing simply follows that flow of money.\n\nIf passive gets too influential, then the smart active managers will exploit the problem. Inefficiencies will balance themselves out in the long-term. And passive investing is a long-term technique.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s easy to avoid the pitfalls of index inclusion.\n\nIndex funds don\u2019t have to exclude stocks. Many investment managers (like Fidelity and Vanguard) offer total market index funds. They include high and mighty S&amp;P companies and all of the \u201ccompany 501\u2019s\u201d out there that might be excluded from other index funds.\n\nTherefore\u2013if there is an index inclusion bubble\u2013the total market index funds own both sides of that bubble.\n\nA total market fund would only be exposed to a bubble that includes entire asset classes. For example, one could claim that stocks in their entirety are overvalued, but that commodities are undervalued. Therefore, a total U.S. stock market index fund would still expose you the bad outcomes of bursting bubble!\n\nIf this concerns you, then diversify your index investing via a lazy portfolio. There are indexes that track bond markets, international markets, different sized companies, commodities, REITs, etc. You can spread out your investments across multiple asset classes to reduce your risk.\n\n# Takeaways\n\nGreen and Burry both make good points. Pal tells a nice story. I\u2019m really glad I took some time to understand those ideas. Carlson and Felix support the ideas I\u2019ve always heard: the wisdom of people like Jack Bogle and Burton Malkiel. What actions am I taking after all this conversation?\n\nReading. Lots more reading. I want to learn more about Mike Green, Michael Burry, and their anti-passive compatriots. After all\u2013they did compel me to type up 4000 words of arguments that go against my investing strategy. But I also want to remind myself of the reasons why I started indexing in the first place: Malkiel, Bogle, and people like Ben Carlson and Ben Felix.\n\nBut I will be staying my course, at least for now. I have not been convinced to move away from indexing, or that there\u2019s an index fund bubble. Indexes still float my boat, and I think the bubble argument has more bark than bite. I\u2019m in it for the long run. I do not think hand-picking individual stocks is the way to go.",

        "selftext": "Hey all, \n\nRead through the 10-K filings and figured I would highlight the risk catalysts and manufacturing agreements NIO is currently involved with to give you a better idea of their output forecast and so you can research yourself as to whether or not they can be sustainable: \n\n&gt; We have entered into an arrangement with Jianghuai Automobile Group Co., Ltd., or JAC, for manufacturing the ES8 for five years. In April 2019 and March 2020, we entered manufacturing cooperation agreements with JAC for the manufacture of the ES6 and the EC6, respectively.\n\n---\n\n&gt; The ES8 and ES6 are manufactured in partnership with JAC at its Hefei manufacturing plant. JAC is a major state-owned automobile manufacturer in China and it constructed such Hefei manufacturing plant for the production of the ES8 (with a modified production line for the ES6) and potentially other future vehicles with us.\n\n---\n\n&gt; **we pay JAC for each vehicle produced on a per-vehicle basis monthly for the first three years.**\n\n---\n\n&gt; In addition, for the first 36 months after the start of production, which commenced on April 10, 2018, to the extent the Hefei manufacturing plant incurs any operating losses, we have agreed to compensate JAC for such operating losses. Cooperation after the first 36 months will be subject to further negotiation between the parties.  As of December 31, 2019, we had paid JAC a total of $90,310,656.80, including $49,772,468.20 as compensation for losses incurred in 2018 and 2019 and $40,538,188.60 for manufacturing and processing fees.\n\n---\n\nRisk catalysts mentioned: \n\n&gt; Beginning July 1, 2018, the tariff on imported passenger vehicles (other than those originating in the United States of America) was reduced to 15%. As a result, our pricing advantage could be diminished.\n\n*(In English: The trade war between the US and China is killing any chances of NIO achieving market share in places outside of China.)*\n\n---\n\n&gt; Pursuant to the 2018 Negative List, the limits on foreign ownership of auto manufacturers were lifted in 2018 for NEVs and will be lifted by 2022 for ICE vehicles. As a result, foreign EV competitors could build wholly-owned facilities in China without the need for a domestic joint venture partner. For example, Tesla has started constructing a factory in Shanghai without a joint venture partner. These changes could increase our competition and reduce our pricing advantage.\n\n*(In English: China is incentivizing FDI (Foreign Domestic Investment), which is leading to competition from corps like Tesla who are much more established and have the funds to outpace NIO.)*\n\n---\n\n&gt; We believe that our sales performance of ES8 and ES6 in 2019 was negatively affected by the reduction in the subsidy standard. The current 2020 subsidy standard, effective from April 23, 2020, (i) reduces the base subsidy amount in general by 10% for each NEV, (ii) sets subsidies for 2 million vehicles as the upper limit of annual subsidy scale; and (iii) provides that national subsidy shall only apply to an NEV with the sale price under $44,826.60 or equipped with battery swapping module. Further, the 2021 and the 2022 subsidy standard are expected to be reduced by 20% and 30% respectively as compared to the standard of the immediate preceding year.\n\n*(In English: Less government incentive = lower operating margin = less revenue growth.)* \n\n---\n\n&gt; Our servicing will primarily be carried out through third parties certified by us. Although such servicing partners may have experience in servicing other vehicles, we and such partners have very limited experience in servicing our vehicles. Servicing electric vehicles is different from servicing ICE vehicles and requires specialized skills, including high voltage training and servicing techniques\n\n*(In English: NIO cannot afford to achieve [vertical integration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/verticalintegration.asp) yet and relies heavily on outsourcing to other, much smaller companies to get certain jobs done. Their supplier network is likely to be inefficient at times and falter under macroeconomic headwinds like government intervention (think trade war and tax credits) and covid-19 and this makes NIO's operations all the more compromised.)*\n\n---\n\nSome outside data to look at: \n\n[China Total Vehicle Sales: 1997 - 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/total-vehicle-sales)\n\n*Overall seems incredibly cyclical but in an upward trend over the next 5 years. Long term investors shouldn't worry about demand.* \n\n[China GDP Annual Growth Rate: 1989 - 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/gdp-growth-annual)\n\n*China believe it or not is still considered a developing country which is defined by its high GDP growth rate and low standard of living. It averages 6% a year but due to covid fell harshly. Right now it is sitting at 4% but is expected to return to 6% within the next two years.* \n\n[China Consumer Confidence Index: 1991 - 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/consumer-confidence)\n\n*Consumer confidence forecasts are predicted to rise as the world recovers from covid-19. This in turn can translate to increased spending and economic stimulation (aka more potential demand and orders for NIO vehicles.)*\n\n[China Car Production: 2005-2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/car-production)\n\n*China is set to return to the 25 Million vehicle production milestone it often flirted with over the past decade. Should it overcome the impact on manufacturing from covid and the trade war, it may very well achieve even higher historical output although that is a very optimistic outlook given the current geopolitical situation.*",

        "selftext": "**Biden wins the election, what does this mean for the economy and the stock market, what Buffen\u2019s Berkshire has done in the last quarter and more, let\u2019s talk about everything** \n\nHey everyone and welcome, I am going to react to the latest news from the election, the economy and in the stock market from last week and what to expect next\n\nSo late Saturday the victory of Biden was announced as networks finally started to predict that he won the election. I have no partisan view as i am not a resident or citizen of the US, but i believe that the results of this election (the Biden win and the Republicans keeping the Senate) is the best the stock market could have hoped for, as many experts were predicting a Blue Sweep. There still will be two important runoff elections in Georgia at the beggining of 2021, where the Democrats could still end up winning the Senate. Biden currently has a projected 290 electoras votes but i believe he will also keep the lead in Georgia and end up with 306 electoral votes, the same number as Trump had 4 years ago [VOTE MAP](https://ibb.co/LZ5dnzt) . Important leaders like the German Chancellor, Uk\u2019s prime minister, Canada\u2019s prime minister, France\u2019s president and many more welcomed and congratuled the win of Biden, which seems to be favored internationaly by the world leaders as they were tired of the whipsaw that came with Trump tweeting non-stop. So this probable grid-lock in Congress is loved by the stock market, as there are no iminent tax raises and a stimulus bill is far more likely if not by the end of the Trump mandate surely at the very start of Biden\u2019s.\n\nSo this scenario that is playing out seems to be the most profitable one for wall street as the average annual return since 1933 is about 14% with a Democractic President and a split Congress [Historical CHART](https://ibb.co/SJGP97P)\n\nYesterday Biden also announced how they will try to combat the illness with Better testing and tracing, a increase in PPE production, National guidance for schools, business and families, Investments of 25 bilion in vaccine development and distribution and mask mandates. While also trying to make the higher risk individuals more safe.\n\nP.S. Here\u2019s a funny meme that LeBron James posted with a throwback to his big block of an opponent. [MEME](https://ibb.co/2hmQk6R)\n\nSo all 3 big indices had the best week since early April with the Nasdaq composite being up just over 9% [NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/rpgWtJH), the SP500 was up 7,32% [S&amp;P CHART](https://ibb.co/Ss7FWVN) and the DOW gained almost 7%.[DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/j3bB0P8) The Nasdaq and Sp were flat for the day, pairing loses from the begining of the day while the down fell 0,23% mostly based on profit taking in my opinion.\n\nThere were more companies that were declining on Friday with over 60% of the companies in the red but with a disproportional number of almost 90% of new highs while the volume fell again way below average [MARKET CHART](https://ibb.co/k0kY7Z1) . There weren\u2019t any significant leaders in the market on Friday but energy traield again being more than 2% down [SECTOR CHART](https://ibb.co/VDFksR8) while small caps under-performed the market especialy the value plays.  [CHART](https://ibb.co/9ndqFLC)\n\nThe fear in the market seems to have completly gone away as we have seen another 10% decline in the VIX indicator to drop below 25. [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/8MjSd1f)\n\nHere is a heat map of Friday, you can see this was quite a slow day, not to many green companies but not that big of a red day either. [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/nsCvwVz)\n\nThe US economy added more than 638 thousand jobs [NEWS](https://ibb.co/hDrrTXs) more than 503 thousand that were expected [CHART](https://ibb.co/C6fD3Sh), while the unemployment rate fell to 6,9% way better than the 7,7% expected this is the sixt straight month of jobs recovery.[CHART](https://ibb.co/RBZzdVG) As they seem to be in a big V shape recovery, overall  [V- SHAPE](https://ibb.co/HN6n9dH)\n\nThe market should now turn they\u2019re attention to the samshing of the earnings season amid the election with 2 thirds of the SP500 beating the estimates both the top and bottom line, that is almost double the 38% historical average. \n\nBank of American release a chart for q3 earnings and as you can see earnings have increased 6,7% in the SP500 year over year and 21,5% quarter over quarter. [EARNINGS CHART](https://ibb.co/C6zfWZR)\n\nAnd as the fed announced that it will keep the benchmark rate between 0 and 0,25% [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/vjNy43D)this continues to stimulate the economy of the US, with the fed beeing probably more responsible for the recovery in the last months as stimulus has been staled in congress. Also they continue to have a target of a running inflation of 2% and will continue to buy assests worth around 120 billion dollars montly to pump money in the economy  [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/wBxn56S). If a stimulus bill will eventualy pass, households will probably continue to use the money the same way as last time with over 70% of the money being used for savings and debt payments. But thay may go down a little as people may tend to spend a little more on essentials and non essentials with a better outlook in the near future than last time. [HOUSEHOLD SPENDING](https://ibb.co/dbbKCj6)\n\nHere are some interesting economic events for next weeks as we continue to closely watch how to recovery is going. [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/gMX5XH5)\n\nNvidia saw a pop in the stock finally as they announced that Fornite will join the GeForce gaming cliud, that could mean a return for the game in ios devices with GeForce currently available on Mac,Windows,Android and Chromebooks. The company has almost reteurn to it all time highs after this weeks strong gains. [NVIDIA CHART](https://ibb.co/1qxmphB)\n\nBuffets Berkshire announced on Saturday that they bought back around 9 billion of the company\u2019s stock,bringing the total to around 16 bilion for the year so far.[BUYBACK CHART](https://ibb.co/ysw5bkx) That was around 4 billion more than in the second quarter. the operating earnings also decrease a little since last quarter and are almost 3 billion or 32% less then last year. [BUYBACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/fSWCvdQ)The only segment that improved since last year was Railroad,utilities and enegery, while insurance was the biggest loser.\n\nThe company has almost the same amount of cash and short term investemtns like the previos quarter at around 146 billion dollars with 70% of the investments concentrated in 4 big companies (Apple , Bank of America, Coca-Cola and American Express) up from the 60% these company represented at the end of 2019. [INVESTMENTS](https://ibb.co/Dps2f95)\n\nThe buybacks of the company exced any full year amount in Berkhsire\u2019s history and far exeded the analysts expectation of around 3,2 billion in buybacks. As the strategy for Buffet and Charlie Munger is to buyback the company\u2019s stock as long as they believe it\u2019s undervalued and they will still have ample cash after the buybacks. AS the only other major investments made last quarter were about 6 billion invested in the five big Japenese trading houses and the data storage company Snowflake.\n\nI just saw some interesting news as NetFlix announced they will launch a offering named NetFlix Direct in France that will come with a linear feed of content from Netflix\u2019s library, so the company that is the biggest reasons for the decline of old TV programming made quite a twist as they seek to expand more and more.  [NETFLIX NEWS](https://ibb.co/gWzmKKs)\n\nHere is a list with some of the most important earnings next week, some companies that i like that are reporting are: McDonalds, Datadog, Tencent, Corsair, Purple, Lemonade and DraftKings.

        "selftext": "**Section** **I.  The Election**\n\na.  A Republican Senate:\n\nFirst and foremost, to explain why puts got melted this week, the republican senate was a key component of the bull-run we've seen over the past few days.  When you think of the 2020 US election from the perspective of the major equities in weighted indices (like the SPY), what they were most worried about going into the election was the end of an era of low taxes and deregulation.  Sure, a Biden/Trump win was what people were thinking about most, but in the case of a Biden win, the continuation of a republican senate is what is key in keeping company valuations steady for the next 2 years.  This will keep taxes low, deregulation extended, and new legislation slow to pass.\n\n[Betting Odds for Control of the Senate.  Republicans \\(Red\\) vs Democrats \\(Blue\\).](https://preview.redd.it/1kpa2m0znkx51.png?width=573&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce1d7774d22188467451350a9983150c43f801f8)\n\nShown above are the senate control betting odds as of last night.  They are sitting around 75-25 in favor of the republicans.  If this shifts in the favor of the democrats, we are very likely to see a negative reaction from the markets (though this is unlikely).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb.  The Implications of a Disputed Election:\n\nNow, on the uniqueness of 2020, this is going to be the first election in a long time where a ton of people on both sides are confident that they're winning.  Shown below are the presidential betting odds since right before the start of the election.  You can see that during the first night, Trump's odds nearly hit 80% as all of the initial votes being counted were from in-person voters. \n\n[Presidential Betting Odds Since Nov 2.  Biden \\(Blue\\) vs Trump \\(Red\\).](https://preview.redd.it/wvf1pf2knkx51.png?width=574&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=335e7a06beb2e7efccc6636cb12a3d7661eaf9ed)\n\nThe sudden shift back to Biden (currently around 97% chance to win) from mail-in voters is what he has partly (but not exactly) been citing as evidence for voter fraud, and many of his followers are completely with him on the issue.  Invalidating the results of the election is his last stand, but the impact on equities markets is not going to end once the election is called.  The consequence of the apparent invalidity of the entire electoral process is that there will soon be mass confusion, protests, and other civil conflict and unrest around the country.  \n\nSomething that's worth noting is that **during the Bush v Gore election (2000) which was also contested, equities markets sold off 7-8%** within the weeks following the election.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nc.  Stimulus:\n\nOne final point about the election worth noting is that it has distracted both legislators as well as the general public away from other issues.  One of those issues is the lack of a new stimulus bill from congress; **it is likely that we are going to have to last through the winter until February without a new stimulus bill being passed**.  Trump losing the election will only make him less likely to focus on the issue, as his focus will rather be on taking the best evidence for voter fraud he can find to the Supreme Court.  We may start seeing people defaulting on loans in the middle of the winter, and consequently, we may also start to see small businesses struggling to stay afloat (we will talk about this more when we look at economic data).  On top of this, the initial jobless claims are still sitting around 750,000 people each week (down 7000 from last week); these are people that rely on these stimulus checks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Section II.  Covid-19:  Winter is Coming, Is a Vaccine?**\n\na.  R0 and Cold, Dry Weather:\n\nSo we're headed into the winter months, and one of the other things the election has distracted us all from is the coronavirus.  Its fairly common knowledge that the cold, dry weather of the winter months is primarily responsible for facilitating flu seasons that are worse than they are during any other months of the year.  If you look into some of the early research done on the same topic for Covid, you find exactly what you would expect.  Pictured below are two visuals from a study done in late January in China that aimed to seek the effects of temperature and humidity on the coronavirus.\n\n[A City-Level Visualization of China's Average Temperature from Jan 19 - Feb 10](https://preview.redd.it/pmi8nzd7qkx51.png?width=749&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=116cd149c7322aa0315961682259e7f9bc854e26)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A City-Level Visualization of China's Observed r0 Value of Covid-19 From Jan 19 - Feb 10](https://preview.redd.it/mz2nz9a2qkx51.png?width=820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50583687dd093959ab1c1c388c7bc7a4a0dc4351)\n\nSource: [https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2003/2003.05003.pdf](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2003/2003.05003.pdf)\n\nWhat we see is a fairly **strong correlation between a decrease in temperature and an increase in the observed r0 of the disease**.  Simply, the r0 is just a measure of the contagiousness of a disease.  What we can expect is that during these next few months, Covid is going to reach new highs of contagiousness in the United States.  As we will see below, the current case rates in the US do not seem to set us up for a calm winter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb.  The Data:\n\n[Daily Coronavirus Cases in the United States.  7-Day MA Overlaid in Blue.](https://preview.redd.it/az26jsexmkx51.png?width=692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fce6317132ab8e3275a2550218f2d77d4a959d92)\n\nNow to look into the number of infections, during the first wave of cases in the US, we peaked at around 30,000 daily cases and started trending back down as we entered lockdowns and started social distancing.  **Yesterday, we hit 120,000 cases in a single day**, and this barely broke the news as everyone is still entirely focused on the election.  \n\nThese insanely high case numbers, coupled with the effect on r0 of the winter weather, and possibly coupled with massive gatherings that are soon to come from election protests paint a grim picture for the winter to come.  It's never been a better time to stay inside, but we aren't seeing that sentiment or concern  being expressed from the country as a whole.  It's going to get bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nc.  The Euro Countries:\n\nAs a response to a similar issue, we have seen Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and some other countries instantiate lockdowns to combat their rapidly rising case numbers.  \n\nSource: [https://www.cntraveler.com/story/european-countries-enter-second-lockdowns-as-cases-spike](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/european-countries-enter-second-lockdowns-as-cases-spike)\n\nThis is something that Trump has repeatedly said he would not do, but that's not necessarily the case with Biden; he has simply said that he will follow the science.  Soon enough we are going to start seeing regulation on social gatherings tightening up again.  A solution to stopping the current wave of Covid is unavoidable at this point, once the election news slows down, this is what people are going to be focused on.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nd.  Waiting on a Vaccine:\n\nAt the moment, we have Remdesivir which is able to reduce the infection period of Covid by a few days, but we have yet to discover something that reduces the mortality rate.  Something import to note about the Covid vaccines under development, however, is that **the US government has opted to protect pharmaceutical companies from any lawsuits related to unintended symptoms/damages caused by a vaccine**.  The purpose of doing this is to enable pharmaceutical companies to create a vaccine at a significantly faster pace, but the downside is that people are going to be skeptical of taking it.  It's also very likely that once a vaccine is available, it will be primarily given to high-risk patients as it will be in such a short supply, and it will take months (or possibly even a year) until there is enough supply/distribution underway that it can be given to everyone in the country.\n\nThe takeaway here is that we don't have much to help us get through the winter.  The market's are not going to like another economic slowdown, even if it is significantly smaller than the one we saw back in March/April.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Section III.  The Invisible Economic Data**\n\na.  Banks, Loans, and What They're Telling Us:\n\nOnce again, due to all of the news and drama about the results of the election, something that is being overshadowed is economic data.\n\nTo take a look at some interesting trends, something that should catch your eye is that we are seeing a continuation of banks tightening their lending standards.  In a booming economy with the \"V-Shaped Recovery\" we are always hearing about, this is not something that we would see continuing to rise.  Especially during a time when people are talking about inflation fears, something to note is that banks tightening their lending standards is deflationary.  If people can't take out loans, and there is less money circulating around the economy, the dollar starts to increase in value.\n\n[Percentage of Banks Tightening Their Lending Standards \\(From the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey On Bank Lending Practices\\)](https://preview.redd.it/2uwn3takuox51.png?width=1150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c67d0594ce6f5c4996281475cf72cd0be53d0c09)\n\nShown above, we are seeing around **70% of banks tightening their lending standards to small firms**, and we have not seen this number start to turn around yet.  These levels are comparable to what they were at the peak of the 2008 financial crisis, and what is shows is that the banks, for whatever reason, are **really not comfortable lending money to people right now**.  It should also be noted that typically, when banks tighten their lending standards, long-term treasuries decrease in yield and increase in price.  This is consistent with the fact that banks purchased around $30b in mortgage backed securities this past week alone to make up for their decrease in outgoing loans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb.  Imports and Exports:\n\nTaking a look at US month-over-month imports and exports, what we would expect to see during a V-Shaped recovery are values falling rapidly during the initial shock, and then linearly approaching pre-Covid levels by the end of the recovery.  However, what we can see now is that after imports started to recover rapidly in July and August, **the demand has already started to taper off**.  Similarly, exports still have a long way to recover to reach pre-Covid levels, but we are even seeing export demand taper off.  This is likely due to our main export-countries also struggling to regain their pre-Covid levels of demand.\n\n[US MoM Imports \\(USD\\)](https://preview.redd.it/03sdum9c9px51.png?width=657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a065043f449bb5da971e40940a48e8c2925ff1eb)\n\n[US MoM Exports \\(USD\\)](https://preview.redd.it/0tpsoudeapx51.png?width=659&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e71fc897e2643b99090d295c7ac12f56350a4f3b)\n\nThe key takeaway here is that with rising Covid cases, a typical economic slowdown during winter months, decreasing import and export demand, and tighter lending standards, the economic data does not portray the country as being in a strong position right now.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Section IV.  The Market and The VIX**\n\na.  Nasdaq, SPY, and DOW's Melt-Up:\n\nFinally, to take a look at where the markets are positioned, the S&amp;P 500 has rallied about 6% in the past 5 days, the DOW has rallied about 5.6%, and the Nasdaq has rallied about 7.9%.  This last trading day, we saw each index fail to break through it's current level, which is just about at market all-time-highs for each of them aside from the DOW (which has not yet fully recovered since March).  Today's volume was also significantly less than it was 2 days prior.\n\n[QQQ 3-Month With Volume](https://preview.redd.it/jget31s6epx51.png?width=814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01ccd4903bd0314f83818ed7b0a1488ae40540fc)\n\n[DIA \\(Dow Jones\\) 3-Month With Volume](https://preview.redd.it/hcdavds8epx51.png?width=812&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=939b2795c4812448859c35b0b157b6aeb02a557d)\n\n[SPY 3-Month With Volume](https://preview.redd.it/2qyjkpwaepx51.png?width=819&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ac2b71a8c136e37ef5f97238331388465c3c1ce)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nc.  The VIX:\n\nTaking a look at the VIX we are sitting at an all-time low since the start of Covid.  With so many people going long on vol and puts right before the election and then selling out of their positions once the next two years appeared to be stable due to the likelihood of a republican senate, the VIX has gotten absolutely crushed.  \n\n[VXX 6-Month With Volume](https://preview.redd.it/dcsglrtrepx51.png?width=810&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c00193cc466a62ac0b5ace19262dfb60c5144a71)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:**  Given the incoming political unrest of the country, the lack of stimulus for another several months, relatively persistent jobless claims, a likely increasing contagiousness of Covid coupled with possible social distancing regulations coming back into effect, ATH daily Covid case numbers (still rising), economic slowdown associated with winter months, 08-level tightening of banks' lending standards, tapering and slowing demand for imports and exports in the US, and the huge market rally and volatility crush we have just witnessed, the market seems to be gifting us a volatility trade.\n\nAs for the timing of it, once people look away from the election, once people start protesting the results, once people start focusing on Covid again, and once people take a closer look at the economic data, they will feel a lot less comfortable valuing markets at ATH levels.  These valuations will not last.\n\n**TL;DR of TL;DR:**  Volatility spike is likely.  A long-vol play seems appropriate, it's very cheap.\n\n**Positions:  34x (VXX 11/20 $24C)** \n\nLet me know if I missed anything or if you have any ideas of your own.  I may roll-back the options next week to the 27th to buy some more time.",

        "selftext": "My post [last Sunday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jmbuff/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_this/) where I talk about my positions. [On Wednesday I did a follow up](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jo3up7/4k_in_realized_gains_from_sunday_positions_next/) and discussed why I held some, closed others, and also why I opened up cash-secured-puts on QCOM right before earnings for a $450 pay-day.\n\nKeep in mind I only sell puts and buy shares. I made $4k on putting roughly $80k of collateral down for buying shares if I end up getting assigned. My true profit was about 5% last week with relatively low-risk positions where if they went against me I would bag-hold until profitable. When you are willing to bag-hold for months you literally cannot lose on any position (not financial advice). If you're ready to take your trading to the next level and do some technical ANAL(ysis) with me, then follow along. For those of you that hate money close this thread immediately.\n\nLastly, before I start. This is my game-plan for tomorrow's open. A lot depends on the price action in the morning. If market is down big or flat in the morning it will help me sell puts or buy shares, if we open hulk green then I just may need to wait. I haven't entered any of these positions yet. Normally I don't do this many positions, but it's earnings so its time to YOLO on some theta decay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore we start, when you look at my charts:\n\n**PINK = CHANNEL LINES** where the stock bounces between that range. When a stock exits a channel it either:\n\n1. Comes right back down into the channel or\n\n2. Begins to form a new channel.\n\nYou will never know which option happened until after-the-fact.\n\n**BLUE = SUPPORT OR RESISTANCE LINES**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll positions listed should be expected to expire this Friday the 13th of November. You can always go out further to collect more premium. It all depends on your strategy and what you are comfortable with.\n\n**DDOG - Earnings on Tuesday**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9quq9wx0i3y51.png?width=1964&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91186ec0288bd562ee7a4fc31f96f4de3591efc7\n\nDDOG provides cloud-based services. They shit the bed last earnings and the stock tanked 20% the next day. Am I worried about that happening again? Of course. Do I think it will? No. They are currently trading 10% higher than they were from market-close of their last earnings call. For any of you that have been following the stock, they landed a huge deal with Microsoft and we are about to find out just how much value that contract will bring. For that reason I think it will put a hard floor on where the stock might drop to.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$95p strike for $4.25 premium expiring this week will net you a return of about 4.5%. \n\nBreak-even only reached if stock drops to $90.75.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RKT - Earnings on Tuesday**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1r6vebe2i3y51.png?width=1968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a41d32126ce49e2e91ec8b05af193af5bfd916a\n\nRKT is somewhat of a recent IPO so the stock price is all over the place. What I do see on the chart is some strong support at the $18 and $20 level. The trend is currently down, but it looks like the stock might be reversing and breaking into a new channel through earnings this week. Good earnings will rocket this stock back to $25+, poor earnings we can re-test the $20 level. I like the upside on this one relative to what the downside might be. I'll be selling puts here.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$20p strike for $0.75 premium will have a return of 3.75%\n\nBreak-even is reached if the stock drops below $19.25\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RVLV - Earnings on Wednesday**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dx4hk495i3y51.png?width=1954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e262fb8fd220ac069fb0b822e6b2030c88392ec9\n\nRevolve crushed earnings on their last report and the stock went up 25%. You can see the stock has been trading in channel (pink lines) and is sitting comfortably somewhere near the high portion of the channel. Each time the stock price exited the channel to the upside it was rejected and pulled right back down. Generally it takes a break-through of the supply zones (resistance) or a big event to exit a channel and form a new trend. If we see some downside from earnings we might get a bounce off the $18 level. I'll be selling some puts there.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$18p for $0.85 premium will have return of $4.7%\n\nBreak-even reached if the stock drops below $17.15\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PTON - Earnings last week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tqfvpvl6i3y51.png?width=1956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f4a5802a15a0769523eee117083da0b6805d19f\n\nPeloton reported earnings last week. Management summarized to us that demand was still very high and they had trouble keeping up with it. Pretty fucking solid. This stock is literally a meme, but I do think it will be bought up on any dips. IV is also pretty high so I'll be selling weekly puts at the $115 or $120 level when I get a chance.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$120p at $2.25 premium for a return of 1.9%, break-even at $117.75\n\n$115p at $1.00 premium for a return of 0.85%, break-even at $114\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**V - Not earnings play**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ppd3x268i3y51.png?width=1836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58093caef63d46861d8751d5ea4826d9c69135f0\n\nVisa is one of the more predictable stocks. The dip to $180 two weeks ago was an early Christmas gift. I didn't draw any channel zones with my magical crayons here because this thing just bounces back and forth between resistance and support zones. V is currently trading at the pinnacle of the resistance line. If it gets rejected expect another dip back to $195 or even $190. If it breaks through we might see a continuation in momentum all the way up to $215. Why? We might see some follow through on last week's move. All the other times it was rejected by $200 from July through August it was on small moves and lower volume.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nIV is low on Visa, personally I would just outright buy the shares here. You can sell the weekly $210 covered call for some extra pocket money. I doubt this will break-through by end of next week and if it does you've already won on your shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pro Tip:** Cash-secured-puts are a much \"safer\" way to make money. There is a misconception about selling higher volume of credit spreads instead of 1 or 2 cash-secured-puts because when you lose on a credit spread you are realizing and accepting the loss. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nListen here folks, we will NEVER accept defeat. We might lose the battle and get assigned some shares of these ultra high-quality stocks, but we will ALWAYS win the war and come out profitable. See how I am aiming here for 1-3% on each of these plays. We are winners baby so lets make that bread.",

Props to him:\n\nSome facts about this game and why it is so exciting:\n\n* The Witcher 3 was CD Projekt Red's last title and it sold [impressively enough to hit 25 in best selling games of all time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games). This was largely due to it being masterfully crafted as an RPG, with extensive and beautiful environments and a detailed, branching story. This is also a MASSIVE growth from their last two notable titles [which you can see the comparison for here](https://www.dualshockers.com/witcher-sales-ps4-xbox-one-pc/#:~:text=Sales%20of%20The%20Witcher%2C%20The%20Witcher%202%3A%20Assassins,fiscal%20year%202017%2C%20and%20they%20were%20very%20positive.)\n* CDProjektRed also has a fantastic track record for satisfying gamer customers. DLC/Expansion content has been devoid of crazy overionization and have strong content. The company is known for going that little extra mile, like putting out free updates that playfully make fun of the player for abusing a bug, or including extra items in the physical releases of their games (Witcher 2, for instance, had an art book and some merchandise included).\n* Cyberpunk2077 is a game that has been in development for more than 7 years -- The first teaser was shown in 2013. Usually this can be concerning (unless its a studio known for long development cycles like Square Enix or Hideo Kojima's projects), but combined with the high level of craftsmanship of the Witcher 3 and the VERY promising gameplay dives, people's hype and expectations have only grown spectacularly.\n* Gameplay shown off has been very positive - it's a great mix between a game series like Fallout (open world with quests to follow and an overarching story to complete) and GTA (freedom in your open world gameplay allows you to travel the entire map using a variety of vehicles and weapons).\n* One of the biggest draws to the game is as OP mentioned - the nerd fascination with Cyberpunk/dystopian futuristic settings. The game is based off of an [established branded pen and paper game series Cyberpunk 2020](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberpunk_2020). Not many people were really aware of it outside of pen-and-paper geeks, but the aesthetic and overall depiction of a futuristic sci-fi haven America is exciting the hell out of people.\n* The inclusion of Keanu Reeves was a huge surprise that hyped people up further due to the massive success of the John Wick movies.\n\nIs it guaranteed to be a success? Well, the possibility is EXTREMELY strong. It will probably be a success off of sales alone - the newest consoles aren't going to be in stock enough to satisfy everyone, the game is one of the last huge titles for modern consoles (with a free upgrade to the next consoles), and it's been one of the most hotly anticipated games over the last decade. Gameplay shown so far has been promising and there isn't too much competition for the game in mid-november (the most notable of which is the new Call of Duty, which has had a SHITSHOW of a beta). That all being said, as titles like No Mans Sky or Mass Effect Andromeda have shown, nothing is guaranteed. I have no reason to suspect the game will suffer as badly as these, and there is not a single thing that indicates this could go that way, but you never know!\n\n**What does this mean for the Company?** Well, as I said, CDProjektRed is one of the beloved companies out there. The only real blemish on their public image is an allegation that they engage in crunch culture, but by their own words it doesn't seem to be remotely the worst case and even serves as one of the better cases in an industry that just needs to overall improve. My personal gut feeling is that they're only improving as a company -- I played Witcher 2 and hated it despite it looking beautiful. Witcher 3 was a clear demonstration that they're very competent at making a satisfying, beautiful game that can hold its own with the biggest companies. There is very little doubt Cyberpunk 2077 will push their success further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n===============================================================\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR CD projekt red $OTGLY is going to be transformed.",

Full article below: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is now more than 20 years since the Nasdaq, an index of technology shares, crashed after a spectacular rise during the late 1990s. The peak in March 2000 marked the end of the internet bubble. The bust that followed was a vindication of the stringent valuation methods pioneered in the 1930s by Benjamin Graham, the father of \u201cvalue\u201d investing, and popularised by Warren Buffett. For this school, value means a low price relative to recent profits or the accounting (\u201cbook\u201d) value of assets. Sober method and rigour were not features of the dotcom era. Analysts used vaguer measures, such as \u201ceyeballs\u201d or \u201cengagement\u201d. If that was too much effort, they simply talked up \u201cthe opportunity\u201d.\n\nPlenty of people sense a replay of the dotcom madness today. For much of the past decade a boom in America\u2019s stockmarket has been powered by an elite of technology (or technology-enabled) shares, including Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. The value stocks favoured by disciples of Graham have generally languished. But change may be afoot. In the past week or so, fortunes have reversed. Technology stocks have sold off. Value stocks have rallied, as prospects for a coronavirus vaccine raise hopes of a quick return to a normal economy. This might be the start of a long-heralded rotation from overpriced tech to far cheaper cyclicals\u2014stocks that do well in a strong economy. Perhaps value is back.\n\nThis would be comforting. It would validate a particular approach to valuing companies that has been relied upon for the best part of a century by some of the most successful investors. But the uncomfortable truth is that some features of value investing are ill-suited to today\u2019s economy. As the industrial age gives way to the digital age, the intrinsic worth of businesses is not well captured by old-style valuation methods, according to a recent essay by Michael Mauboussin and Dan Callahan of Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\n\nThe job of stockpicking remains to take advantage of the gap between expectations and fundamentals, between a stock\u2019s price and its true worth. But the job has been complicated by a shift from tangible to intangible capital\u2014from an economy where factories, office buildings and machinery were key to one where software, ideas, brands and general know-how matter most. The way intangible capital is accounted for (or rather, not accounted for) distorts measures of earnings and book value, which makes them less reliable metrics on which to base a company\u2019s worth. A different approach is required\u2014not the flaky practice of the dotcom era but a serious method, grounded in logic and financial theory. However, the vaunted heritage of old-school value investing has made it hard for a fresher approach to gain traction.\n\n## Graham\u2019s cracker\n\nTo understand how this investment philosophy became so dominant, go back a century or so to when equity markets were still immature. Prices were noisy. Ideas about value were nascent. The decision to buy shares in a particular company might by based on a tip, on inside information, on a prejudice, or gut feel. A new class of equity investors was emerging. It included far-sighted managers of the endowment funds of universities. They saw that equities had advantages over bonds\u2014notably those backed by mortgages, railroads or public utilities\u2014which had been the preferred asset of long-term investors, such as insurance firms.\n\nThis new church soon had two doctrinal texts. In 1934 Graham published \u201cSecurity Analysis\u201d (with co-author David Dodd), a dense exposition of number-crunching techniques for stockpickers. Another of Graham\u2019s books is easier to read and perhaps more influential. \u201cThe Intelligent Investor\u201d, first published in 1949, ran in revised editions right up until (and indeed beyond) Graham\u2019s death in 1976. The first edition is packed with sage analysis, which is as relevant today as it was 70 years ago.\n\nUnderpinning it all is an important distinction\u2014between the price and value of a stock. Price is a creature of fickle sentiment, of greed and fear. Intrinsic value, by contrast, depends on a firm\u2019s earnings power. This in turn derives from the capital assets on its books: its factories, machines, office buildings and so on.\n\nThe approach leans heavily on company accounts. The valuation of a stock should be based on a conservative multiple of future profits, which are themselves based on a sober projection of recent trends. The book value of the firm\u2019s assets provides a cross-check. The past might be a crude guide to the future. But as Graham argued, it is a \u201cmore reliable basis of valuation than some other future plucked out of the air of either optimism or pessimism\u201d. As an extra precaution, investors should seek a margin of safety between the price paid for a stock and its intrinsic value, to allow for any errors in the reckoning. The tenets of value investing were thus established. Be conservative. Seek shares with a low price-earnings or price-to-book ratio.\n\nThe enduring status of his approach owes more to Graham as tutor than the reputation he enjoyed as an investor. Graham taught a class on stockpicking at Columbia University. His most famous student was Mr Buffett, who took Graham\u2019s investment creed, added his own twists and became one of the world\u2019s richest men. Yet the stories surrounding Mr Buffett\u2019s success are as important as the numbers, argued Aswath Damodaran of New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business in a recent series of YouTube lectures on value investing. The bold purchase of shares in troubled American Express in 1964; the decision to dissolve his partnership in 1969, because stocks were too dear; the way he stoically sat out the dotcom mania decades later. These stories are part of the Buffett legend. The philosophy of value investing has been burnished by association.\n\nIt helped also that academic finance gave a back-handed blessing to value investing. An empirical study in 1992 by Eugene Fama, a Nobel-prize-winning finance theorist, and Kenneth French found that volatility, a measure of risk, did not explain stock returns between 1963 and 1990, as academic theory suggested it should. Instead they found that low price-to-book shares earned much higher returns over the long run than high price-to-book shares. One school of finance, which includes these authors, concluded that price-to-book might be a proxy for risk. For another school, including value investors, the Fama-French result was evidence of market inefficiency\u2014and a validation of the value approach.\n\nAll this has had a lasting impact. Most investors \u201calmost reflexively describe themselves as value investors, because it sounds like the right thing to say\u201d, says Mr Damodaran. Why would they not? Every investor is a value investor, even if they are not attached to book value or trailing earnings as the way to select stocks. No sane person wants to overpay for stocks. The problem is that \u201cvalue\u201d has become a label for a narrow kind of analysis that often confuses means with ends. The approach has not worked well for a while. For much of the past decade, value stocks have lagged behind the general market and a long way behind \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks, their antithesis (see chart 1). Old-style value investing looks increasingly at odds with how the economy operates.\n\nIn Graham\u2019s day the backbone of the economy was tangible capital. But things have changed. What makes companies distinctive, and therefore valuable, is not primarily their ownership of physical assets. The spread of manufacturing technology beyond the rich world has taken care of that. Any new design for a gadget, or garment, can be assembled to order by contract manufacturers from components made by any number of third-party factories. The value in a smartphone or a pair of fancy athletic shoes is mostly in the design, not the production.\n\nIn service-led economies the value of a business is increasingly in intangibles\u2014assets you cannot touch, see or count easily. It might be software; think of Google\u2019s search algorithm or Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system. It might be a consumer brand like Coca-Cola. It might be a drug patent or a publishing copyright. A lot of intangible wealth is even more nebulous than that. Complex supply chains or a set of distribution channels, neither of which is easily replicable, are intangible assets. So are the skills of a company\u2019s workforce. In some cases the most valuable asset of all is a company\u2019s culture: a set of routines, priorities and commitments that have been internalised by the workforce. It can\u2019t always be written down. You cannot easily enter a number for it into a spreadsheet. But it can be of huge value all the same.\n\n## A beancounter\u2019s nightmare\n\nThere are three important aspects to consider with respect to intangibles, says Mr Mauboussin: their measurement, their characteristics, and their implications for the way companies are valued. Start with measurement. Accounting for intangibles is notoriously tricky. The national accounts in America and elsewhere have made a certain amount of progress in grappling with the challenge. Some kinds of expenditure that used to be treated as a cost of production, such as r&amp;d and software development, are now treated as capital spending in gdp figures. The effect on measured investment rates is quite marked (see chart 2). But intangibles\u2019 treatment in company accounts is a bit of a mess. By their nature, they have unclear boundaries. They make accountants queasy. The more leeway a company has to turn day-to-day costs into capital assets, the more scope there is to fiddle with reported earnings. And not every dollar of r&amp;d or advertising spending can be ascribed to a patent or a brand. This is why, with a few exceptions, such spending is treated in company accounts as a running cost, like rent or electricity.\n\nThe treatment of intangibles in mergers makes a mockery of this. If, say, one firm pays $2bn for another that has $1bn of tangible assets, the residual $1bn is counted as an intangible asset\u2014either as brand value, if that can be appraised, or as \u201cgoodwill\u201d. That distorts comparisons. A firm that has acquired brands by merger will have those reflected in its book value. A firm that has developed its own brands will not.\n\nThe second important aspect of intangibles is their unique characteristics. A business whose assets are mostly intangible will behave differently from one whose assets are mostly tangible. Intangible assets are \u201cnon-rival\u201d goods: they can be used by lots of people simultaneously. Think of the recipe for a generic drug or the design of a semiconductor. That makes them unlike physical assets, whose use by one person or for one kind of manufacture precludes their use by or for another.\n\nIn their book \u201cCapitalism Without Capital\u201d Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake provided a useful taxonomy, which they call the four Ss: scalability, sunkenness, spillovers and synergies. Of these, scalability is the most salient. Intangibles can be used again and again without decay or constraint. Scalability becomes turbo-charged with network effects. The more people use a firm\u2019s services, the more useful they are to other customers. They enjoy increasing returns to scale; the bigger they get, the cheaper it is to serve another customer. The big business successes of the past decade\u2014Google, Amazon and Facebook in America; and Alibaba and Tencent in China\u2014have grown to a size that was not widely predicted. But there are plenty of older asset-light businesses that were built on such network effects\u2014think of Visa and Mastercard. The result is that industries become dominated by one or a few big players. The same goes for capital spending. A small number of leading firms now account for a large share of overall investment (see chart 3).\n\nPhysical assets usually have some second-hand value. Intangibles are different. Some are tradable: you can sell a well-known brand or license a patent. But many are not. You cannot (or cannot easily) sell a set of relationships with suppliers. That means the costs incurred in creating the asset are not recoverable\u2014hence sunkenness. Business and product ideas can easily be copied by others, unless there is some legal means, such as a patent or copyright, to prevent it. This characteristic gives rise to spillovers from one company to another. And ideas often multiply in value when they are combined with other ideas. So intangibles tend to generate bigger synergies than tangible assets.\n\nThe third aspect of intangibles to consider is their implications for investors. A big one is that earnings and accounting book value have become less useful in gauging the value of a company. Profits are revenues minus costs. If a chunk of those costs are not running expenses but are instead spending on intangible assets that will generate future cashflows, then earnings are understated. And so, of course, is book value. The more a firm spends on advertising, r&amp;d, workforce training, software development and so on, the more distorted the picture is.\n\nThe distinction between a running expense and investment is crucial for securities analysis. An important part of the stock analyst\u2019s job is to understand both the magnitude of investment and the returns on it. This is not a particularly novel argument, as Messrs Mauboussin and Callahan point out. It was made nearly 60 years ago in a seminal paper by Merton Miller and Francesco Modigliani, two Nobel-prize-winning economists. They divided the value of a company into two parts. The first\u2014call it the \u201csteady state\u201d\u2014assumes that that the company can sustain its current profits into the future. The second is the present value of future growth opportunities\u2014essentially what the firm might become. The second part depends on the firm\u2019s investment: how much it does, the returns on that investment and how long the opportunity lasts. To begin to estimate this you have to work out the true rate of investment and the true returns on that investment.\n\nThe nature of intangible assets makes this a tricky calculation. But worthwhile analysis is usually difficult. \u201cYou can\u2019t abdicate your responsibility to understand the magnitude of investment and the returns to it,\u201d says Mr Mauboussin. Old-style value investors emphasise the steady state but largely ignore the growth-opportunities part. But for a youngish company able to grow at an exponential rate by exploiting increasing returns to scale, the future opportunity will account for the bulk of valuation. For such a firm with a high return on investment, it makes sense to plough profits back into the firm\u2014and indeed to borrow to finance further investment.\n\nPicking winners in an intangible economy\u2014and paying a price for stocks commensurate with their chances of success\u2014is not for the faint-hearted. Some investments will be a washout; sunkenness means some costs cannot be recovered. Network effects give rise to winner-takes-all or winner-takes-most markets, in which the second-best firm is worth a fraction of the best. Value investing seems safer. But the trouble with screening for stocks with a low price-to-book or price-to-earnings ratio is that it is likelier to select businesses whose best times are behind them than it is to identify future success.\n\n## Up, up and away\n\nProperly understood, the idea of fundamental value has not changed. Graham\u2019s key insight was that price will sometimes fall below intrinsic value (in which case, buy) and sometimes will rise above it (in which case, sell). In an economy mostly made up of tangible assets you could perhaps rely on a growth stock that had got ahead of itself to be pulled back to earth, and a value stock that got left behind to eventually catch up. Reversion to the mean was the order of the day. But in a world of increasing returns to scale, a firm that rises quickly will often keep on rising.\n\nThe economy has changed. The way investors think about valuation has to change, too. This is a case that\u2019s harder to make when the valuation differential between tech and value stocks is so stark. A correction at some stage would not be a great surprise. The appeal of old-style value investing is that it is tethered to something concrete. In contrast, forward-looking valuations are by their nature more speculative. Bubbles are perhaps unavoidable; some people will extrapolate too far. Nevertheless, were Ben Graham alive today he would probably be revising his thinking. No one, least of all the father of value investing, said stockpicking was easy.",

        "selftext": " So Friday we saw the stock market down again as the dow fell almost 0,6% percent while the s&amp;p fell over 1% and the nasdaq was crushed being down almost 2and a half percent as This last week we saw the dow fell 6,5% the s&amp;p 5,6% and the nasdaq 5,5% as all 3 ended the month of october down more than 2,3%\n\nOne good thing for the US economy is that the retail stores sales has recovered and consumers are still spending excess cash especially with the holidays and black Friday up next. I believe that as much as Tuesday is important for the economy, the events that will come later in the week as the FED holds two important meatings and the latest jobs report comes in at the end of the week far outweight that\n\nAs you can see the New York Federal bank economic index is still rising, that sugests a V-Shaped recovery is continuing in the US. This index takes into consideration lots of important data from the economy.\n\nThe unemployment in the US has been decling but that rate has sharply slowed down in the last months as it\u2019s still more than double the 3,5% at the start of the year as the latest number from September was almost 8% rate of unemployment.\n\nAs you can see the most affected people are still the middle and low wage under 60k/year. As the high wage jobs unemployment rate is barely down 0,5% since January.\n\nSo the fear in the stock market saw a huge pop in the last week as the VIX (the volatility index) rose from 27,55 more than 10 points to close at over 38 this last week. This next week is probably the last with such high volatility as the upcoming big events will pass and more certainty will be in front of us . The volatility was so high as we retested the June highs and have seen a pullback 3 times after hiting those levels.\n\nDespite strong earnings last week from all big tech companies (Alphabet,Amazon,Apple, facebook and Microsoft) the companies stocks dropped amid the broader stock market sell-off with the exception of Google which posted terrific numbers to crush analysts expectation.\n\nApple is down almost 19% since the highs of September and has lost 450 billion dollars in market cap since then.\n\nThis dropped in the company has been caused by a broader stock market sell off as well as missed iphone revenues. I do believe that iphone revenues will see a huge spike in the next coming quarters as apple customers as myself will finally upgrade from older iphone to this next generation iphone which is the first to have 5G technology as well as other great improvements in capability as well as camera.\n\nA couple analysts have recently changed they\u2019re target to between 132-140 which is over 20$ from where it sit\u2019s today. That is quite good upside for the company.\n\nAs you can see they are barely down 2,7% year over year in product revenue despite not having the new iphone launch included in this financials, and overall the company still saw a 1% increase in revenue due to the huge spike in services revenue that I believe will continue especially with the Apple One bundle just being launched at the end of last week. The Total Gross margin also increase slightly but I expect this to be just a small drawback in the short-term.\n\nAlso I believe that Amazon was dragged down because of the next quarter predictions of huge costs while they only forecasted a operating income of 1 to 4 point 5 billion dollars which is below what was anticipated despite amazon web services continuing to be the largest player in cloud spending. With a 32% share of total market and a revenue of 11,6 billion dollars which Is up 29% year over year, while Azure from Microsoft comes in second and google cloud in third. There is still a lot of room to grow for all of this companies as there is still over 37% of the market provided by other companies. Also this is a great company to own for the long term as digitazation and online commerce will continue to grow, some are estimating that by 2030 amazon could have annual revenues of 1 trillion dollars $ while using conservative projections of compound annual growth for e-commerce of 10%, for the cloud services of 15% and for ad revenue of 20%, amazon could hit that mark by then. But I believe this is possible even faster than that.\n\nFacebook is the one company that I will have to analyze more in this group. They will be hit with privacy issues do to the regulatory risk and Apple\u2019s announced privacy changes. But I still do believe this to be a great company as they also own Instagram, and I really like how that part of the company is innovating and growing.\n\nWhile google seems to be back on track as the company was the laggard in the group. They have become less reliant on the search ad revenue as growth in Youtube ads and Google cloud will push the company to renewed growth in the future.\n\nAlibaba will see two big events this week as they will kick off the singles day event next week, extending the event with 3 more days rather than the usual 24-hour event, in which they will also double the products on offer. Also another big event will be the IPO of ant Group in which Alibaba will still have a big stake. I believe they are a great company the forward revenue growth estimates of 31% are higher than other tech companies like amazon, google and Microsoft while the P/E for the company is the most attractive of the group also.\n\nFord just announced that late next year they will introduce a lower priced competitor for Tesla AutoPilot and GM\u2019s super cruise, this is great news for the company as they seem to be improving the company continuasly.\n\nSome important earnings coming this week are :\n\nPaypal on Monday, which I believe is the greatest fin-tech company, on\n\nWednesday Qualcomm will announce that will be a great insight to see what Apple\u2019s iphone 12 is doing as Qualcomm is the biggest supplier for apple and on Thursday Alibaba (with ant group ipo) coming also on the same day this stock could see a surge in value.",

        "selftext": "~@FrankPeelen (Not me, but DD checks out.)\n\nBased on data I gathered from 13F filings, a large number of TSLA shares seem to have gone missing during Q3, to the tune of 50M shares. \n\nThis is a large number of shares that can't be explained away by retail buying, delta hedging, and smaller institutional investors increasing their stakes.\n@s17_scott and Thekiwi on TMC pointed out to me that $BRK omitted one company from its 13F, and instead disclosed this newly acquired stake separately in a confidential filing, because it was worried that making the position public would move the market too much.\n\nAccording to this BI article: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-buying-secret-stock-revealed-coming-weeks-2020-11-1029813523, there is a $25B difference between the value of the portfolio $BRK declared in its 13F and its 10-Q ($220B vs $245B). In actuality, they declared $245.5B in their 10-Q and $229B in their 13F, a difference of $16.5B.\n\nThe BI article also mentions a $6B investment into 5 big Japanese trading companies made over a 12 month period, which was made public in early August, and which supposedly explains part of the disparity between the 13F and 10-Q.\n\nIndeed, there is also a disparity of $5B between $BRK's Q2 13F and 10-Q. In other recent quarters, the differences were:\n\nQ2'20: $202.5B vs $207.5B = $5B\nQ1'20: $175.5B vs $180.5B = $5B\nQ4'19: $242B vs $248B = $6B\n\nSo the current $16.5B difference is not normal.\nThe BI article also mentions this has happened once before in Q2'15, when $BRK reported $110.5B in equity holdings in its 10-Q vs $107B in its 13F, a difference of $3.5B, only to file an amendment 3 weeks later, worth $2.5B.\n\nAssuming that $5-6B of the current $16.5B disparity is due to the investment in the Japanese trading giants, what can the other $11B be attributed to? Could $BRK's currently confidential new investment be $TSLA?\n\nAnother important piece of information is the size of this position, and implications it has on 13D/13G filings. Companies have to disclose an acquisition of a 5%+ stake in a company within 10 days to the SEC. So unless $BRK was also allowed to keep this confidential...this means the $11B must be less than 5% of the company in which it was invested. That means the company's market cap must be &gt;$220B, which really limits the options. There are only 25 such companies listed on US exchanges: https://www.dogsofthedow.com/largest-companies-by-market-cap.htm\n\nFurthermore, $BRK already owns stock in 9 of them, and is 1 of them:\n\n1) $AAPL\n2) $AMZN\n3) $BRK\n4) $V\n5) $JNJ\n6) $JPM\n7) $PG\n8) $MA\n9) $BAC\n10) $KO\n\nThere are only 15 other $220B+ companies listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ\n\nNone of this proves anything, but when combined with the ~50M $TSLA shares that went missing in Q3, there are some strong signs showing $BRK's mystery new investment could be $TSLA.\n\nIf it is $TSLA, this $11B would amount to ~25M shares at the stock price at the end of Q3 ($429), and would go a long way towards explaining the ~50M missing $TSLA shares. 50M shares can't be explained away by retails, small institutions, and delta hedging, but...\n25M can, especially with 25M shares worth of buying pressure pushing up the stock price as much as it did in Q3, because a rising stock price requires a lot of shares to be bought for delta hedging purposes, as I've explained in my blog previously:\n\nhttps://teslainvestor.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-mechanisms-that-fueled-tslas.html\n\nSo did $BRK acquire a large stake in $TSLA? There's no proof, but it seems very plausible. We should find out for sure what $BRK's mystery new acquisition is over the next few weeks or months.",

        "selftext": "Visa stock has made investors more than 1,000% over the past decade -- peppy for an organization that dates back to the Eisenhower administration. But here comes a gaggle of app-based hopefuls eyeing not just the toll roads that make credit cards work, but also the $2 trillion in worldwide revenues collected for payments of all kinds.\n\nYou know about PayPal (ticker: PYPL) and maybe Square (SQ) and Venmo. How about Remitly, Stripe, Circle, and Bolt? There are dozens more with Seussian names. To skip out on a dinner check with under-30s, just mock the encryption protocol of their favorite fintech platform, and tell them you'll froop them ticklecoins.\n\nI spoke this past week with Visa (V) chief Al Kelly about the competitive landscape in payments. That's a sensitive subject now, because Visa is trying to buy a company called Plaid, which serves as a data go-between for banks and apps. For example, Venmo uses Plaid. This month, the Department of Justice sued to block the deal, alleging that it would deprive consumers of a potential alternative to Visa. Kelly calls the deal pro-consumer and says Visa will fight the suit vigorously. \"We feel very, very good about that,\" he says.\n\nVisa was spawned from the first true credit card -- the paper, $300-limit BankAmericard, launched in 1958. Bank of America kept the credit business but licensed the financial plumbing for cards to other banks. This eventually became Visa, and a rival system launched in 1966 became Mastercard (MC). Today, Visa links 70 million sellers with 3.5 billion account credentials issued by 13,000 banks. It collects fees per transaction for authorization, clearing, and settlement, and it sells add-on services for things like detecting fraud and increasing customer loyalty.\n\nThis year, I've come to view paying in cash and receiving change as the financial equivalent of shaking hands during a bilateral sneeze. Giving over a credit card for swiping, or sliding my own and pawing a number pad, is more like an elbow bump -- better, but do we really have to? Tap-to-pay is the norm in most of the world, but not the U.S. -- yet. Kelly says it will be common here soon. If past patterns from other markets repeat, tap-to-pay will bring a big jump in the percentage of U.S. transactions done with cards.\n\nCard adoption is already climbing -- to 82.1% of in-store transactions from 78.7% in January, according to industry researcher The NPD Group. But opportunities for spending have shriveled. So, during Visa's fiscal year ended in September, revenues decreased 5%, to $21.8 billion, and earnings per share fell 7%, to $5.04. Visa is larger than Mastercard and is particularly dominant in debit cards, but Mastercard has been growing faster, especially in Europe. Both have been smaller for years than China's UnionPay.\n\nAnalysts call these networks card rails, and the bank-controlled Automated Clearing House, or ACH, system for money transfers, bank rails. Many upstart players operate as digital wallets that depend in part on card or bank rails, or else use cryptocurrency. Kelly says the payments industry is filled with \"frenemies.\" For example, PayPal, the best-known digital wallet for online purchases, used to steer customers to cheaper ACH rather than Visa cards. Now, under a partnership, Visa gets equal footing with ACH, and PayPal makes inroads at stores using Visa's contactless mobile-payment technology.\n\nStocks in general trade at elevated valuations now, and growth stocks especially. Even so, Visa's price of 38 times this fiscal year's estimated earnings suggests that investors feel confident about its future role in payments, and its return to speedy growth. This fiscal year, earnings-per-share growth is pegged at just 9%, as the pandemic continues and then hopefully lifts. Early estimates for next year's growth put it at 24%. Beyond the tap-to-pay rollout and spending rebound, Visa is hoping to win over push transactions that use bank rails -- like tuition, rent, and wages. Banks will have a say, but they make good money on card businesses, and ACH is a nonprofit.\n\nChina is a wild card. Visa doesn't have a license to operate there domestically, so it partners with local players like AliPay to create new uses for travelers' Visa cards. But phase one of the trade deal between China and the Trump administration is supposed to open China to foreign payment companies like Visa. We'll see. For now, Kelly calls cash his biggest competitor. I'm Purelling just thinking about all that market share up for grabs.\n\nThe stock market is said to be driven by the battle between greed and fear. Right now, it looks more like hope and stupidity. The vaccine results announced this past week by Pfizer (PFE) are the best hope yet that the pandemic's end is in sight. That vaccine and perhaps others could receive emergency-use authorization within the next two months, and much of America could receive needle pokes in the first half of next year. Life could look normal by Thanksgiving 2021.\n\nBut the virus is raging like never before. We've turned simple advice -- keep a bit of distance or wear masks -- into a culture war. And Washington is distracted. That President Donald Trump is denying clear election results is folly. That an overwhelming majority of his party's senators won't speak up is dangerous. If it doesn't damage our democracy, it could kill us by the tens of thousands this winter from inaction on the virus. And it could cripple our economy again.\n\n\"Sell the vaccine,\" wrote Bank of America in an investment strategy note on Friday. It means to reduce holdings of risky assets ahead of what could be a difficult stretch before the economy reopens in earnest. Like Goldman Sachs, BofA is recommending a barbell strategy, with cyclicals on one side, but not distressed ones, and the sort of virus-immune tech stocks that have been flourishing all along on the other.\n\nI know; I dipped too far into politics there for a moment. Media bias, a few will say, and they're right. I don't endorse politicians or parties, but secretly, I'm in the tank for science and representative democracy.\n\n**Source: Barron's Article**",

Well if not, Google, \"Robinhood trader debt\" I can't post the link because automod deletes it because it has sensitive words in it. \n\nI'm two years older than him (RIP), and I usually consider myself pretty calm and collected in stressful situations, but even I shit myself today. After about 30 minutes of watching my account blow up to nearly minus 3 million, it finally returned to normal. First image is when it was only\\* at 700k.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... lawyers, should I sue?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iqv3odfkvby51.png?width=1151&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=629e52387c854b2d269d5dee49904afc601da8a8\n\nBefore I get into what likely caused this, let me go through some details about the Schwab client on this particular day.\n\nFirst, at market open, Schwab went down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nmfh7sfmvby51.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57a31b579e9eec748d60b753389200a78a4a46f5\n\nLots of people were complaining that they couldn't login to their accounts, and that they couldn't make any trades. This persisted for about 1 hour before people could finally log into their accounts. I wanted to place an order to buy some calls, but whenever I put in an order for review, it just came up blank. Seemed that this was happening to others at the time as well. Finally, after another ten minutes or so, I got an order to go through.\n\nI had been looking to enter a deep OTM call for ACB ($20 call, 12/18 expiration). Yes, thanks for asking, I'm dumb and I think weed will pop off.\n\nI entered in my limit order at $0.84 cents a share with max loss of \\~20k (250 contracts). The order went through, and suddenly my accounted started plummeting for no reason, until I eventually hit nearly 3 million in loses. Here is an image of my account going back to normal with proof of the position.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pu92zjdovby51.png?width=1149&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40a38b0e5617a42e0c6cb5b269a4d4c8336bfda1\n\nThe position itself kept showing up as two -- for the price that I was filled at. See the video link that I posted on YouTube for proof of that. (This isn't self promotion, I just didn't know how to post a video directly into this post).\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dugw3mVYbYg&amp;ab\\_channel=MatthewHarwit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dugw3mVYbYg&amp;ab_channel=MatthewHarwit)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want to go too much into the details of how I was feeling watching this unfold, but let's just say I was fucking scared shitless - it took me a while to calm down and figure out that this was probably some bug. If I happened to have a weaker mental... well, let's not go there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways fellow autists, just know that if you ever find yourself in this kind of situation, just try to relax and think things through logically. If you didn't fuck up, then don't panic. If you did... take out a loan and go long on TSLA calls and you will be back in no time!",

        "selftext": "Vinny Daniel thinks Cathie is a fraud. Vinny never talks about his past. This makes Vinny a trustworthy character. \n\n[https://twitter.com/vd718?lang=en](https://twitter.com/vd718?lang=en)\n\n\u201cVincent Daniel had grown up in Queens, without any of the perks Steve Eisman took for granted. And yet if you met them you might guess that it was Vinny who had grown up in high style on Park Avenue and Eisman who had been raised in the small duplex on Eighty-second Avenue. Eisman was brazen and grandiose and focused on the big kill. Vinny was careful and wary and interested in details. He was young and fit, with thick, dark hair and handsome features, but his appearance was overshadowed by his concerned expression--mouth ever poised to frown, eyebrows ever ready to rise. He had little to lose but still seemed perpetually worried that something important was about to be taken from him. His father had been murdered when he was a small boy--though no one ever talked about that--and his mother had found a job that--and his mother had found a job as a bookkeeper at a commodities trading firm. She'd raised Vinny and his brother alone. Maybe it was Queens, maybe it was what had happened to his father, or maybe it was just the way Vincent Daniel was wired, but he viewed his fellow man with the most intense suspicion. It was with the awe of a champion speaking of an even greater champion that Steve Eisman said, \"Vinny is dark.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcerpt From: Michael Lewis. \u201cThe Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine.\u201d iBooks. \n\nOn April 21st, Vinny retweets Porter Collin\n\n[https://twitter.com/Seawolfcap/status/1252762091972419586](https://twitter.com/Seawolfcap/status/1252762091972419586)\n\n\u201cAn Olympic rowing career had left Porter Collins a bit inured to the pain of others, as he assumed they usually didn't know what pain was.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcerpt From: Michael Lewis. \u201cThe Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine.\u201d iBooks. \n\nPLEASE DO NOT JUST BUY WHATEVER CATHIE BUYS. \n\nPorter Collins is not afraid to voice his opinion using explicative expletives or pull a muscle in his back from yelling. Here is a video of Porter Collins telling Ryan Gosling that he has a matching little butler boy because he is a butt-fuck.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMMfiX9\\_peg&amp;t=90s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMMfiX9_peg&amp;t=90s)\n\nUsing first principles to invest/trade is pseudo-scientific. The development of First Principles dies with Kant in 1804.\n\nGoogles People Also Ask:  \nA **first principle** is a basic assumption that cannot be deduced any further. Over two thousand years ago, Aristotle defined a **first principle** as \u201cthe **first** basis from which a thing is known.\u201d **First principles thinking** is a fancy way of saying \u201c**think** like a scientist.\u201d Scientists don't assume anything.\n\nHere are some quotes from legendary philosopher of science, Karl Popper.\n\n*Those who promise us paradise on earth never produced anything but a hell.*  \n\n\n*Science must begin with myths, and with the criticism of myths.*  \n\n\n*No rational argument will have a rational effect on a man who does not want to adopt a rational attitude.*\n\nARKK is an actively managed fund. If the idea behind ARKK is based on an idea that stopped developing after 1804 - likely prior - then it stands to reason Cathie is lucky and not skilled. \n\nHere is a study by Nobel Prize winning, Chicago Economist, Eugene Fama titled Luck versus Skill in the Cross-Section of Mutual Fund Returns.\n\n[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.479.3099&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.479.3099&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf)\n\nAnd now you may think, well Elon Musk talks about first principles! Well, here is a article, Taleb - the legendary options trader who cost Mr. Market 1 trillion dollars in 2009 and the thinker behind the hedge fund with the biglyist returns in 2020 as well as the originator of Black Swan theory - discusses how Elon is no Steve Apple. \n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/03/motley-fool-interview-nassim-nicholas-taleb.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/03/motley-fool-interview-nassim-nicholas-taleb.aspx)\n\nPlease do not just buy whatever Cathie is buying. When the market has a major correction or crash, you do not want to be holding her bags or the same bags she is holding.",

        "selftext": "[I found this video interesting by Meet Kevin.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPVdOtieC48) I am not trying to publicize it, but wanted to discuss what his argument was. The summary of his video is as follows:\n\n\n* The Vanguard study comparing DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) vs Lump Sum investing was flawed. The flaw is that Vanguard assumed 12 month DCA periods and did not consider shorter DCA periods.\n\n* Even with this flaw, the ending portfolio balance difference between DCA and Lump Sum was only 1-2%. \n\n* Kevin suggests shorter DCA periods of 4-8 weeks, specifically buying on days when the market is red, claiming that this strategy would more than make up for the 1-2% difference observed by Vanguard\n\n* He also noted the psychological aspect of market dips, basically that when you have cash, it feels good to buy on red days. By lump sum investing all at once, you rob yourself the opportunity to get the feeling of being able to buy on red days as they occur.",

        "selftext": "So we have a [**free twitter bot**](https://twitter.com/TradyticsAIbot) that posts intraday alerts for options contracts. They've been quite successful, so I thought why not share them here too with more explanation and my own thoughts. There are no strings attached, it's a free bot that you can follow on twitter. We had some huge winners last week with [500% gains on $NFLX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdeKyIXUF4), [400% on $SPY](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-Ky2Hn-O9kyo-LYyf4-R6KOj-Aslkb), and plenty more. Twitter page has everything detailed.\n\n# $BABA\n\n**Alert:** Buy $310 Call with Expiration 2-3 Weeks Away\n\nBABA has a good price action right now with [support at around $300](https://www.tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=BABA). With all the volatility this week, it's better to go with contracts where you have a tight stop loss. If this breaks support, you'll know to exit immediately.\n\n# $AMZN\n\n[**Alert:**](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-lVtkD-wzJ59-Ig64T-O9Iiq-uS47P) Buy $3500 Call with Expiration 1 Week Away\n\nAMZN dipped hard as did plenty of other tech stocks. However, our bot gave tons of CALL alerts. When that happens, there's a reversal coming the next day. This alert did not work on Friday, but I am expecting this to pan out in the next 1-2 days.\n\n# $TWTR\n\n[**Alert:**](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-d03l5-HXntU-unLMV-M6GDV-kFnc7) Buy $55 Call with Expiration January 15, 2021\n\nAgain, this one is seems like a safe bet considering how much TWTR dipped on Friday. The fact that the price stopped right at the support gives me more confidence. ([https://i.imgur.com/yZgsc9i.png](https://i.imgur.com/yZgsc9i.png)). Also, market tends to fill gaps and there is a huge gap up which needs filling. Given that this alert is far off in the future, it seems like an excellent one. Will keep an eye on this one.\n\n# Miscellaneous\n\nThere were tons of tech CALL alerts on Friday which makes me think tech might go up for atleast a day tomorrow. If you see any bullish signs, you can also try the following contracts:\n\n**$NFLX:** Go one or two weeks ahead from the expiration date of this alert since this one has already expired: [https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-3GH9w-uOIyX-Jnx0P-xx6As-9t28w](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-3GH9w-uOIyX-Jnx0P-xx6As-9t28w)\n\n**$CCL, NCLH, RCL:** They usually move opposite to the market and went up quite a bit on Friday. Since PUTs are not that costly, go out 2-3 months and buy PUTs,\n\n# Risk Management\n\nIf you buy some of these contracts, **hedge them with an SQQQ or** [**VXX Call**](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-tpoCB-2BxBJ-P7hS0-PrJI9-vUMzG) just to stay safe. You'll find a few alerts on SQQQ Calls on the twitter bot. Stay safe everyone!\n\nLet me know your thoughts!",

How did this historically struggling industry become a top performer during the COVID-19 Pandemic? The answer is seen in the massive gains electric vehicle stocks have seen. The best performers of the past year are NIO at 1911% gains, TSLA at 540% gains, WKHS at 492% gains, and GP at 377% gains.\n\nThe valuation of EV companies has been controversial, with many institutional investors believing EV valuations are unreasonable. Furthermore, the rise of SPACs has provided zero revenue companies easy access to investors, most notably Nikola Corporation. Many EV stocks have become popular with retail investors, with TSLA, GM, NIO, PLUG, NKLA, and WKHS ranking among the most popular tickers on Robinhood.\n\nThe table below consists of 22 popular EV stocks and relevant data.

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: I'm a BAM shareholder with about 15% of my portfolio.\n\nGreat interview two days ago from one of the great asset managers of all time (IMO): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PXxqCc24q4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PXxqCc24q4)\n\nSince March I rotated into 80% tech stocks (QQQ, ARK, some individual picks). However, I still kept holding my BAM shares. Bruce Flatt is a legendary value investor.\n\nIn this interview he says a number of interesting things:\n\n\\- BAM has up to $80B in dry powder and will look for distressed opportunities over the next 18 months\n\n\\- He thinks retail is going through a consolidation, but that strong will get stronger. They want to own the best mall in any given city, and its likely that the bottom half of malls will be bulldozed.\n\n\\- Bullish on return to office (boomer comment from him IMO)\n\n\\- Very interesting: Thinks that real estate prices should be 1.5x - 2x now due to the low interest rate environment, and this is starting to happen for BAM. But he also thinks people aren't quite comfortable doing these transactions yet and things are trading at big discounts\n\nI really agree with him on the last comment. Bruce Flatt knows how to smell a good deal. Buying Real Estate may be the best value opportunity in the market today.\n\nI'm primarily (80%) invested in tech (QQQ/ARK/individual picks). But I have been building up some dry powder since August or so, since values got out of hand.\n\nAs a complete side note, I went to a \"top\" mall today to go to the Apple Store. The mall was absolutely packed.\n\nDoes anyone else agree? Are public REITs currently a deep value opportunity?",

        "selftext": "Hello value investing community,  \n\nI hope you had a great weekend!\n\nI think it is fair to say that Twitter is THE most powerful news, learning, and curation tool in the world. And as an investor, it is your responsibility to constantly look for opportunities, to be informed about current events, and to expand your mental models. Everybody wants to gain an edge in the markets and Twitter might be the tool that allows you to get access to information that you would otherwise not have considered in your investment process.\n\nBut who are the most important people for investors to follow on Twitter? I think that for Twitter to unfold its full potential, it\u2019s important to keep your Twitter feed clean and learn and so it is important that you only follow quality people.\n\nI have just released a video on this subject and mention four Twitter accounts that every value investor should follow. But obviously, this list is far from exhaustive and I wanted to ask you if you have any additional recommendations? Maybe you can share a brief summary of what this account is recognized for.  \n\nBest regards\n\nRene\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhw7Dn5aUWw&amp;feature=youtu.be",

(\"Harvest One\" or the \"Company\") (TSX-V: HVT; OTCQX: HRVOF) announced today that the United States Patent and Trademark Office has granted its wholly-owned subsidiary Satipharm Ltd. (\u201cSatipharm\u201d) US Pat No. 10,555,906 covering Satipharm\u2019s proprietary\u00a0Gelpell\u2122\u00a0technology.\n\u00a0\nThis issued patent, titled \u201cOral solid cannabinoid formulations, methods for producing and use thereof\u201d, protects Satipharm\u2019s licenced Gelpell\u2122\u00a0technology in the United States with respect to diverse cannabinoid formulations, including pure CBD products and combinations of cannabinoids such as full spectrum products. The patent covers compositions including oral solid dosage forms and also covers therapeutic applications for the treatment of various disorders and conditions.\n\u00a0\nThe need for effective oral delivery of cannabinoids is essential for the development of stable and predictable therapeutic treatments. The patented compositions feature the high bioavailability of the Gelpell\u2122\u00a0technology, as well as prolonged stability at room temperature, two critical factors in achieving predictable treatments.\n\u00a0\n\u201cReceipt of this patent represents an important milestone for Satipharm, completing the patenting process for key jurisdictions,\u201d said Gord Davey, President and Interim Chief Executive Officer of Harvest One. \u201cThis patent, combined with our published Phase I and II clinical trials, further emphasizes the strength of the Satipharm brand as we pursue commercial partners for various pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and recreational applications. The issuance of this patent comes at an important time following the recent US election and the anticipated federal legalization of cannabinoids in the US.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Company has obtained patents covering Gelpell\u2122\u00a0technology in the key markets, including the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and countries of the European Union.\n\u00a0\nSatipharm products are currently on sale in major pharmacy chains and retailers throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland, including Boots, Lloyds and Holland &amp; Barret. Satipharm\u2019s suite of products includes their flagship \u2018Advanced\u2019 capsule range, powered by Gelpell\u2122\u00a0technology, \u00a0consisting of the original 10mg\u00a0CBD\u00a0capsule, the Focus and Active co-formulation variants, the high strength 50mg\u00a0CBD\u00a0\u00a0capsule, plus a range of CBD oils providing a differentiated market offering to satisfy a large consumer base.\n\u00a0\nSatipharm Gelpell\u2122\u00a0Capsules\nSatipharm produces CBD capsules powered by proprietary Gelpell\u2122\u00a0technology. These capsules take a different approach to other cannabinoid products currently on the market. Gelpell\u2122\u00a0capsules embed the full spectrum hemp extract CBD in seamless gelatine microspheres.\u00a0These tiny beads have been clinically proven to increase the bioavailability of CBD, maximising the delivery of CBD to the body. Manufactured in Switzerland and GMP certified, every Gelpell\u2122\u00a0capsule delivers a consistent dose of\u00a0cannabinoids.\n\u00a0\nSatipharm CBD Gelpell capsules have 3.5 times higher bioavailability compared to standard CBD oils. This unique product has undergone both Phase I and II clinical trials with the results published in two peer-reviewed international medical journals.\n\u00a0\nFor further details on the clinical trials, please visit our website;\nhttps://www.harvestone.com/portfolio/satipharm/#clinical-trials.\n\n\nAbout Harvest One\n\u00a0\nHarvest One is a global company that develops and distributes premium health, wellness and selfcare products with a market focus on sleep, pain, and anxiety. Harvest One is a uniquely positioned company in the cannabis space with a focus on cannabis-infused and non-infused consumer packaged goods.\u00a0 Harvest One owns and operates three subsidiaries;\u00a0Dream\u00a0Water Global,\u00a0LivReief\u00a0(consumer) and\u00a0Satipharm\u00a0(medical and nutraceutical).

Someone with just enough knowledge to endanger himself who made a few good bets in his time thought he found the key to riches and convinced others to follow. \n\nNot only did James Cordier author a book on options selling and was dubbed \"the king of options\" by who the fuck knows, but he also amassed a small following of upper-middle-class clients who opened accounts to be managed by Cordier's fund OptionSellers through a separate clearinghouse. Cordier's strategy for managing those accounts? mostly short strangles on commodity futures options, including /NG options, varied in time and strikes.\n\nInto the cold months with a market spooked by low nat gas supply, how could the tits ever point to the heavens? Then, it happened.\n\nBAM\n\nIn early Nov 2018, /NG absolutely ripped from 3.200 to a hair under 5.000, only to later stabilize under 3.000 by Feb 2019; such a wild move is visible on the 5Y/1M chart from deep orbit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ROGUE WAVE](https://preview.redd.it/zdy4bgn1ahz51.png?width=1255&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=889c2e0659b37f4af592e53874358db7f3555776)\n\nMost of the trade's short strikes were not breached\\* and the trade would have been a winner by Feb, but already by Nov 15 it was too late...  \n\nRING RING\n\nMargin requirements exploded, and margin came a calling. OptionSellers' clearing firm force liquidated the clients' accounts. They lost everything and owed the clearing firm millions in additional margin debts plus running interest. This will likely remain in arbitration and litigation for years. \n\nThis catastrophic loss lead Cordier to post a [video recap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LI395YShGRQ) in which he appealed to fellow seafaring enthusiast clients by likening the nat gas market action to the fluid dynamics phenomenon of a \"ROGUE WAVE that capsized our boat\" while mentally breaking down(?) and addressing clients personally in other *interdasting* ways. \n\n[From CNBC:](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/21/a-risky-natural-gas-bet-gone-awry-leads-to-weepy-youtube-confessional.html) \n\n*Cordier spent several minutes of the video apologizing to individual clients for everything from missing out on bass fishing with them to no longer being able to visit them on the French Riviera. He owes someone a Cuban sandwich, he said, and thanked another client from Kansas City for the barbecue sauce.*\n\n*To another client, who is a big hockey fan, he said, \u201d All I wanted to do was sit with you and watch a game. Next time I\u2019m at the arena, I know you\u2019ll be there and I\u2019ll pretend that i\u2019m sitting next to you.\u201d*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA true legend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Trade particulars: \n\nThe relevant side of the nat gas trade was short Feb, March, Apr 2019 /NG calls between 4.250 and 6.500.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 16th, 2020.\n\n# **Tug of war between value and growth stocks may drive the market again in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/13/tug-of-war-between-value-and-growth-stocks-may-drive-the-market-again-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The stock market is caught between the rapidly spreading virus and the promise of a vaccine.\n*****\n&gt; That is likely to drive trading in the week ahead, as it did in the past week. Investors have been weighing cyclical plays that will do better when the economy reopens fully, against the big tech and growth names that weathered the virus shutdowns in the spring and benefit from the stay-at-home trend.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, that trade resulted in a mixed performance with the Dow up 4% but the Nasdaq down about 0.5%, as investors sold off technology and communications services stocks. The S&amp;P 500 finished up 2.2% at a record close of 3,585, its first since Sept. 2. The renewed spread of the virus by mid-week had tamped down the exuberance over news from Pfizer Monday that its vaccine has proven highly effective and could be broadly distributed next year.\n*****\n&gt; The election is still uncertain though the market has responded well to the idea that a Democratic president and a mixed Congress will likely result in gridlock. President Donald Trump refuses to concede while his campaign challenges election results. Former Vice President Joe Biden was declared the presumptive president-elect last Saturday and has been moving to organize a cabinet.\n*****\n&gt; # Next hurdle for market\n&gt; \u201cWe largely put the election in the rear view mirror. The next hurdle for this market to contend with will be the path of the virus, and that will be the chief focus. It means a less strident rotation,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cGrowth has actually outperformed value for the last 17 years. That\u2019s a lot of inertia to break...If this is a pivot point, it\u2019s a long-term pivot point.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The surging virus is raising renewed concerns about the economy as some cities are likely to put new limits on activities to slow the spread. In the U.S. there were a record 153,400 new cases Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the virus headlines, investors will be watching economic data, particularly retail sales Tuesday and existing home sales Thursday. There are a flurry of Fed speakers, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida Monday.\n*****\n&gt; Retailers report earnings in the week ahead with reports from Walmart and Home Depot Tuesday and Target Wednesday. NVIDIA also reports on Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; The Pfizer news and the election outcome combined to unleash a new wave of bullishness early in the past week. Goldman Sachs, for instance, put a target of 4,200 on the S&amp;P 500 for 2021, and JPMorgan said the benchmark could rise to as high as 4,500 next year.\n*****\n&gt; # Value vs growth\n&gt; Hogan said the value play trend had actually been underway before the Pfizer news and is what helped take the Russell 2000 to close at a new high for the first time Friday since August, 2018.\n*****\n&gt; Small caps in the Russell 2000 have been outperforming for the past three months. Since Oct. 1, the Russell is up 15.5%, compared to just under 6.6% gain for the S&amp;P 500. In the past week, the Russell was the best performer, up 6% for the week on Friday, compared to the 2.2% gain in the S&amp;P 500.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, energy stocks surged 16.5%,and airlines were up 10.5%, The S&amp;P financial sector was up 8.2%, with commercial banks gaining 11.2%. At the same time, information technology declined 0.4% and consumer discretionary stocks were down 1.1%. Communications services was among the weak performers, up just 0.8%\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s just a constant tug of war...based on what we see with the virus headlines and such. I think that\u2019s driving a lot,\u201d said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. \u201cWhen you get the bad headlines, you start seeing the growth stocks do well. When you get the good headlines, you start seeing the value stocks doing better.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hickey expects to continue seeing vaccine developments from other manufacturers. \u201cSome of these high-flying Covid stocks are going to get hit as the headlines get better. We\u2019ve been rotating out of the large cap tech stocks, but we don\u2019t think they\u2019re necessarily going to go down, so to speak,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just think there\u2019s better opportunity in some of the more cyclical parts of the market. It\u2019s more a function of underperformance than decline.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9S768Dt.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/5lit5Af.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/iKz3nnz.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/o6eSwEM.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/a6mAWdZ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HTDyGOz.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CkiRCt8.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Tiesuhz.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iH1ju0y.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MpPXu3M.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HGFYBcG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1QuKIAi.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Very Good Ten\n\n&gt; With nearly ten trading days under its belt for November, the S&amp;P 500 is putting together quite a month. Through early morning Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was up just over 9% which ranks as the best first ten trading days for a month since January 1987. In the entire history of the S&amp;P, there have only been 17 other months where the S&amp;P 500 was up over 9% in the first ten trading days of the month, and in the post-WWII period, there have only been five.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111320-First-Ten-Days-Copy.png))**\n\n&gt; So, when a month starts off strong, does it usually finish that way? Or is there some sort of reversion to the mean? Unfortunately, prior experience isn't particularly consistent in one direction of the other. The table below shows each month since 1928 where the S&amp;P 500 was up at least 7.5% in the first ten trading days of a month. Overall, the S&amp;P 500's average rest of month performance has been a gain of 0.96%. That sounds good, but on a median basis, the rest of the month typically sees a decline of 0.2% with positive returns less than half of the time.\n\n&gt; In looking at the chart above and the table below, you'll notice that most of the strong starts for the S&amp;P came during the Depression in the pre-WWII period. In 1932 and 1933, for example, there were five occurrences each year! Looking at the post-WWII period where the frequency of occurrences wasn't nearly as common, strong starts to a month typically saw a more positive but still not a very consistent trend. In the ten prior months since the end of WWII, the S&amp;P 500's average rest of month performance was a gain of 1.27% (median: 1.69%) with gains 60% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111320-First-Ten-Days-Rest-of-Month.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # November Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 &amp; DJIA Stronger\n\n&gt; DJIA has been up 11 of the last 16 years on Monday of expiration week and Friday is up 14 of the last 18 years with an average gain of 0.56%. By the way, it is not a mistake that November Op-Ex day has the same point change and percent change in 2014 and 2015. It was triple checked and its correct. If you go out 2 more decimal places in the percentage calculation, it\u2019s different.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have not been as bullish as DJIA around or on November option expiration. S&amp;P 500 has advanced only 17 times during options expiration week while NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have climbed only 16 and 14 times respectively over the past 26 years. All four indices have posted average losses on Monday and aside from DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have been essentially mixed on options expiration day. Friday\u2019s solid average gains across the board are largely due to a sizable gain in 2008. Any weakness next week could be a good entry point for new longs ahead of the historically bullish Thanksgiving holiday.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/13265e8eff0782bd041e1e0a067dc3fe/7883f89830a49be6-29/s500x750/2885f1dc67e4228626741cb7343d992817ec5583.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/d6a7fb10dbb1b8380672d5944d48644f/7883f89830a49be6-b5/s500x750/39e1a2f390dbf489cf5bb9ea3384c0d5807cfc51.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9201ade7e11162142381783f8156173b/7883f89830a49be6-c5/s500x750/b4b5afb73ee7a109663d4019f6cbfa31a7c5aa1e.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/61cf940fbf5dad46c8daa54942793f48/7883f89830a49be6-32/s500x750/7cedc50f07edc9418f507d890a648ad42db916ef.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Week before Thanksgiving DJIA Up 19 of 27, But\u2026\n\n&gt; DJIA has a solid track record over the last 27 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.46%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks are not as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 17 years with a median gain of 0.10%.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.35% and down 9 of the last 17, \u20130.13% median loss. NASDAQ is up 15 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.33% and down 9 of the last 17, \u20130.004% median loss. Russell 200 is up 14 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.36% and down 10 of the last 17, \u20130.27% median loss.\n\n&gt; This sets up well for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b30ef3831a0d9fba86495cdc148b2c22/83c3c7d6350c9827-a4/s540x810/ae0bba2b8a4208ad3cd1434bfd8aab7932046617.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # New High in New 52 Week Highs\n\n&gt; As equities and other risk assets surge, a massive number of S&amp;P 500 stocks are hitting new 52 week highs today. As shown in the chart below, as of midday 27.92% of S&amp;P 500 stocks have reached new 52 week highs today and just one stock, Biogen (BIIB), is reaching a new 52 week low. The net reading of 27.72% is the highest reading for net new highs since January of 2018. Prior to that, you would need to go all the way back to May 22nd of 2013 to find the last time there was such a high reading.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Net-New-Highs-2.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at the best-performing stocks in the index today, the list is mostly comprised of the stocks that have been extremely beaten down in the COVID economy like energy, travel, and retail/retail real estate names. Despite this, some still find themselves as some of those furthest below their 52-week highs. Take for example Carnival Cruiselines (CCL). The stock is seeing a phenomenal 35% gain just in today's session, but even at today's highs it was still well over 60% below its high for the year. It is a similar story for CCL's peer, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) which is up 27.78% but was 61.4% from its highs at its best price today. On the other hand, there are 28 stocks that have come within 1% of their 52-week highs at their high prices today. Another 80 stocks have come within 5% of their 52-week highs at their intraday highs today.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Distance-from-52-week.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Milestone For Small Stocks\n\n&gt; No US equity index has reacted more strongly since Election Day than the Russell 2000 small-cap index. As shown in the chart below, the index finally broke out above its highs from earlier in the year following Monday's positive vaccine news. After that move on Monday, the Russell 2000 was up over 10% in just the last six trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/1110-RTY.png))**\n\n&gt; In just about any other year besides 2020, a 10%+ move in the Russell 2000 would be an extraordinary move, but this year the most recent move is actually the sixth one of at least that much. In fact, coming out of the March lows, the Russell saw three six-day moves of 19.1%, 16.3%, and 14.8%, respectively. The frequency with which we've seen these 10%+ moves in the Russell 2000 over a six-day period has been unlike any other year in the Russell's history. Behind 2020, the year with the next highest total of 10%+ moves was 2011 (4) and then 2008 (3), and the most there has been in any twelve-month rolling basis is five spanning late 2008 through the first half of 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-Russell-2000-Six-Days.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3 Election Charts That Caught Our Attention\n\n&gt; Stocks just had their best week since April, with the S&amp;P 500 Index incredibly a chip shot away from new all-time highs. Joe Biden will be the next President of the United States, but markets are confident Republicans will maintain the Senate, and this means gridlock in Washington. Remember, gridlock is good, as it pulls policy towards compromise and avoids extremes. Also, any legislative changes to taxes, regulation, and capital gains will have meaningful input from both parties.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, a split Congress tends to mean stronger stock returns, almost ignoring whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House. The most likely outcome from the election at this point is a Democratic president with a divided Congress\u2014a scenario that historically has produced solid S&amp;P 500 returns of 15.9% a year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Assuming President-elect Joe Biden takes over in January 2021, it is important to note that historically stocks haven\u2019t done as well the first and second years of a new president compared with an incumbent winning. This makes sense though, as historically voters may have chosen new leadership in part because of economic weakness, and the uncertainty of a new president\u2019s policies could also hold things back some. If things are good, the president tends to win reelection. Things turn around significantly by the third year in office, though, if there\u2019s new leadership. Of course, it\u2019s worth noting that the first year of a new president has seen the S&amp;P 500 higher recently, with stocks up nearly 20% the first year under President Donald Trump (2017) and 23% under President Barack Obama (2009).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-2-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the strength from stocks around the election has been rather historic. \u201cThe S&amp;P 500 added 1% on four consecutive days, which hasn\u2019t happened since late 1982,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAlthough there are only three other times this rare blast of strength happened since WWII, it is worth noting that strong returns going out a year took place after each instance.\u201d The bottom line: Extreme buying pressure has a funny way of resolving higher, and we don\u2019t anticipate this time being any different.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3 The Biggest Winners Are Still Big Losers\n\n&gt; With household names like Carnival (CCL), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Simon Property (SPG), and Royal Caribbean (RCL) all up over 20% today, more than a few people out there are probably kicking themselves for not owning any of them. But before you start ripping your hair out, keep in mind that just about all of these stocks are down (and in a big way) on the year. Of the 33 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are up over 20% following today\u2019s vaccine news, all but one of them are still down year to date. The only exception is Expedia (EXPE), which even after a 20%+ gain is still up just 18% on the year.\n\n&gt; In terms of sector representation, Energy tops the list with more than a third of the names (12) on the list. Behind Energy, Real Estate (8), Consumer Discretionary (6), and Financials (6) are the only other sectors with multiple stocks listed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Best-Stocks-1109.png))**\n\n&gt; Just as the best-performing stocks are all still underperforming the S&amp;P 500 on a year to date basis, the biggest losers today are among the year\u2019s biggest winners. There are 25 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that were down on the day as of the middle of the afternoon, but the only one that is down on the year is Biogen (BIIB), a stock whose decline has nothing to do with the vaccine news. Including BIIB, the 25 biggest losers are still up an average of 41% YTD (median: 31%). Behind BIIB, the two worst-performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 today are Pool (POOL) and Etsy (ETSY). Both stocks are down over 10% on the day, but for the year are still holding onto gains of 56.4% and 190.5%, respectively.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Worst-Stocks-1109-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Policy Uncertainty Spiked Into the Election\n\n&gt; For the month of October, the NFIB's reading on small business sentiment was unchanged at the headline levels but many of the sub-indices broadly pointed to further improvements in business conditions. That is not to say small businesses do not have their share of concerns. As shown in the chart below, the NFIB's index on Economic Policy Uncertainty rose another 4 points in October to 98 which is the second-highest reading on record behind November of 2016; around the time of the last presidential election.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-NFIB-Uncert2.png))**\n\n&gt; The election played a role in the uncertainty as 31% of small businesses surveyed reported government-related concerns as their biggest problem in October (lower chart). That was up for the second month in a row and is around the high end of the past couple of year's range. Additionally, as discussed earlier, labor also dominates the minds of small businesses as small businesses report struggles in filling roles. 30% reported cost or quality of labor as the single most important problem (top chart). That is unchanged since August.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-NFIB-Problem-govt-labor.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Tech Fades and Small Caps Soar\n\n&gt; Pfizer\u2019s announcement that its vaccine for covid-19 appears to be 90% effective on Monday morning also gave new life to small-cap stocks, many of which have struggled throughout the pandemic. The announcement has also triggered an exodus from mega-cap tech stocks that had been the \u201cgo-to\u201d positions throughout most of the pandemic.\n\n&gt; The chart above is based upon a similar chart from page 112 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020. It shows the typical one-year seasonal pattern of the ratio of the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000 from July through June (scale on right). Overlaid on top of this pattern is the performance of this ratio in 2020 so far through today\u2019s close (left scale). When the ratio is declining, large-cap stocks are outperforming small cap stocks. When the ratio is climbing, small caps are outperforming. In a typical year, small-caps will lag until around late-September or early October and then take off right around mid-December.\n\n&gt; Covid-19 related shutdowns and unemployment had kept small caps essentially sidelined this year. There were bouts of strength in late-July to mid-August and a brief surge in mid-September and again in early October. The recent surge higher could be an early start to the major move higher that typically begins around mid-December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/86b0c38fda06a991b0dff788e125ad8d/b50bde8b92d0b3a1-5b/s500x750/7dbabf47c90b7da6961e2d23f94a9abb1e8d4287.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 13th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltQP6MFIkfo))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.15.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NIO** \n&gt; * **$NVDA** \n&gt; * **$JD** \n&gt; * **$WMT** \n&gt; * **$HD** \n&gt; * **$SE** \n&gt; * **$TGT** \n&gt; * **$LOW** \n&gt; * **$TSN** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$KSS** \n&gt; * **$SDC** \n&gt; * **$CODX** \n&gt; * **$BJ** \n&gt; * **$M** \n&gt; * **$SOHU** \n&gt; * **$VBLT** \n&gt; * **$NEPT** \n&gt; * **$TJX** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$FL** \n&gt; * **$MARK** \n&gt; * **$MGIC** \n&gt; * **$WDAY** \n&gt; * **$IQ** \n&gt; * **$CSPR** \n&gt; * **$NTES** \n&gt; * **$SOGO** \n&gt; * **$ACM** \n&gt; * **$CLSN** \n&gt; * **$AVYA** \n&gt; * **$VERO** \n&gt; * **$SR** \n&gt; * **$NTWK** \n&gt; * **$AZUL** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$BOXL** \n&gt; * **$ARMK** \n&gt; * **$LODE**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/iH1ju0y.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ntRgt4A.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.16.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BPYsDg8.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/Q0M8ILC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.17.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NoHPXKo.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EqCY7lq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lw83hhF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FFUyg9w.png))\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/R78y9vB.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bKdqcYL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.20.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Fff0sUp.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.20.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # NIO Inc. $44.56\n**NIO Inc.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 16th, 2020.\n\n# **Tug of war between value and growth stocks may drive the market again in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/13/tug-of-war-between-value-and-growth-stocks-may-drive-the-market-again-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The stock market is caught between the rapidly spreading virus and the promise of a vaccine.\n*****\n&gt; That is likely to drive trading in the week ahead, as it did in the past week. Investors have been weighing cyclical plays that will do better when the economy reopens fully, against the big tech and growth names that weathered the virus shutdowns in the spring and benefit from the stay-at-home trend.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, that trade resulted in a mixed performance with the Dow up 4% but the Nasdaq down about 0.5%, as investors sold off technology and communications services stocks. The S&amp;P 500 finished up 2.2% at a record close of 3,585, its first since Sept. 2. The renewed spread of the virus by mid-week had tamped down the exuberance over news from Pfizer Monday that its vaccine has proven highly effective and could be broadly distributed next year.\n*****\n&gt; The election is still uncertain though the market has responded well to the idea that a Democratic president and a mixed Congress will likely result in gridlock. President Donald Trump refuses to concede while his campaign challenges election results. Former Vice President Joe Biden was declared the presumptive president-elect last Saturday and has been moving to organize a cabinet.\n*****\n&gt; # Next hurdle for market\n&gt; \u201cWe largely put the election in the rear view mirror. The next hurdle for this market to contend with will be the path of the virus, and that will be the chief focus. It means a less strident rotation,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cGrowth has actually outperformed value for the last 17 years. That\u2019s a lot of inertia to break...If this is a pivot point, it\u2019s a long-term pivot point.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The surging virus is raising renewed concerns about the economy as some cities are likely to put new limits on activities to slow the spread. In the U.S. there were a record 153,400 new cases Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the virus headlines, investors will be watching economic data, particularly retail sales Tuesday and existing home sales Thursday. There are a flurry of Fed speakers, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida Monday.\n*****\n&gt; Retailers report earnings in the week ahead with reports from Walmart and Home Depot Tuesday and Target Wednesday. NVIDIA also reports on Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; The Pfizer news and the election outcome combined to unleash a new wave of bullishness early in the past week. Goldman Sachs, for instance, put a target of 4,200 on the S&amp;P 500 for 2021, and JPMorgan said the benchmark could rise to as high as 4,500 next year.\n*****\n&gt; # Value vs growth\n&gt; Hogan said the value play trend had actually been underway before the Pfizer news and is what helped take the Russell 2000 to close at a new high for the first time Friday since August, 2018.\n*****\n&gt; Small caps in the Russell 2000 have been outperforming for the past three months. Since Oct. 1, the Russell is up 15.5%, compared to just under 6.6% gain for the S&amp;P 500. In the past week, the Russell was the best performer, up 6% for the week on Friday, compared to the 2.2% gain in the S&amp;P 500.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, energy stocks surged 16.5%,and airlines were up 10.5%, The S&amp;P financial sector was up 8.2%, with commercial banks gaining 11.2%. At the same time, information technology declined 0.4% and consumer discretionary stocks were down 1.1%. Communications services was among the weak performers, up just 0.8%\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s just a constant tug of war...based on what we see with the virus headlines and such. I think that\u2019s driving a lot,\u201d said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. \u201cWhen you get the bad headlines, you start seeing the growth stocks do well. When you get the good headlines, you start seeing the value stocks doing better.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hickey expects to continue seeing vaccine developments from other manufacturers. \u201cSome of these high-flying Covid stocks are going to get hit as the headlines get better. We\u2019ve been rotating out of the large cap tech stocks, but we don\u2019t think they\u2019re necessarily going to go down, so to speak,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just think there\u2019s better opportunity in some of the more cyclical parts of the market. It\u2019s more a function of underperformance than decline.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9S768Dt.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/5lit5Af.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/iKz3nnz.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/o6eSwEM.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/a6mAWdZ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HTDyGOz.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CkiRCt8.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Tiesuhz.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MpPXu3M.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HGFYBcG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1QuKIAi.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Very Good Ten\n\n&gt; With nearly ten trading days under its belt for November, the S&amp;P 500 is putting together quite a month. Through early morning Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was up just over 9% which ranks as the best first ten trading days for a month since January 1987. In the entire history of the S&amp;P, there have only been 17 other months where the S&amp;P 500 was up over 9% in the first ten trading days of the month, and in the post-WWII period, there have only been five.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111320-First-Ten-Days-Copy.png))**\n\n&gt; So, when a month starts off strong, does it usually finish that way? Or is there some sort of reversion to the mean? Unfortunately, prior experience isn't particularly consistent in one direction of the other. The table below shows each month since 1928 where the S&amp;P 500 was up at least 7.5% in the first ten trading days of a month. Overall, the S&amp;P 500's average rest of month performance has been a gain of 0.96%. That sounds good, but on a median basis, the rest of the month typically sees a decline of 0.2% with positive returns less than half of the time.\n\n&gt; In looking at the chart above and the table below, you'll notice that most of the strong starts for the S&amp;P came during the Depression in the pre-WWII period. In 1932 and 1933, for example, there were five occurrences each year! Looking at the post-WWII period where the frequency of occurrences wasn't nearly as common, strong starts to a month typically saw a more positive but still not a very consistent trend. In the ten prior months since the end of WWII, the S&amp;P 500's average rest of month performance was a gain of 1.27% (median: 1.69%) with gains 60% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111320-First-Ten-Days-Rest-of-Month.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # November Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 &amp; DJIA Stronger\n\n&gt; DJIA has been up 11 of the last 16 years on Monday of expiration week and Friday is up 14 of the last 18 years with an average gain of 0.56%. By the way, it is not a mistake that November Op-Ex day has the same point change and percent change in 2014 and 2015. It was triple checked and its correct. If you go out 2 more decimal places in the percentage calculation, it\u2019s different.\n\nS&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have not been as bullish as DJIA around or on November option expiration. S&amp;P 500 has advanced only 17 times during options expiration week while NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have climbed only 16 and 14 times respectively over the past 26 years. All four indices have posted average losses on Monday and aside from DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have been essentially mixed on options expiration day. Friday\u2019s solid average gains across the board are largely due to a sizable gain in 2008. Any weakness next week could be a good entry point for new longs ahead of the historically bullish Thanksgiving holiday.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/13265e8eff0782bd041e1e0a067dc3fe/7883f89830a49be6-29/s500x750/2885f1dc67e4228626741cb7343d992817ec5583.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/d6a7fb10dbb1b8380672d5944d48644f/7883f89830a49be6-b5/s500x750/39e1a2f390dbf489cf5bb9ea3384c0d5807cfc51.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9201ade7e11162142381783f8156173b/7883f89830a49be6-c5/s500x750/b4b5afb73ee7a109663d4019f6cbfa31a7c5aa1e.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/61cf940fbf5dad46c8daa54942793f48/7883f89830a49be6-32/s500x750/7cedc50f07edc9418f507d890a648ad42db916ef.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Week before Thanksgiving DJIA Up 19 of 27, But\u2026\n\n&gt; DJIA has a solid track record over the last 27 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.46%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks are not as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 17 years with a median gain of 0.10%.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.35% and down 9 of the last 17, \u20130.13% median loss. NASDAQ is up 15 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.33% and down 9 of the last 17, \u20130.004% median loss. Russell 200 is up 14 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.36% and down 10 of the last 17, \u20130.27% median loss.\n\n&gt; This sets up well for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b30ef3831a0d9fba86495cdc148b2c22/83c3c7d6350c9827-a4/s540x810/ae0bba2b8a4208ad3cd1434bfd8aab7932046617.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # New High in New 52 Week Highs\n\n&gt; As equities and other risk assets surge, a massive number of S&amp;P 500 stocks are hitting new 52 week highs today. As shown in the chart below, as of midday 27.92% of S&amp;P 500 stocks have reached new 52 week highs today and just one stock, Biogen (BIIB), is reaching a new 52 week low. The net reading of 27.72% is the highest reading for net new highs since January of 2018. Prior to that, you would need to go all the way back to May 22nd of 2013 to find the last time there was such a high reading.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Net-New-Highs-2.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at the best-performing stocks in the index today, the list is mostly comprised of the stocks that have been extremely beaten down in the COVID economy like energy, travel, and retail/retail real estate names. Despite this, some still find themselves as some of those furthest below their 52-week highs. Take for example Carnival Cruiselines (CCL). The stock is seeing a phenomenal 35% gain just in today's session, but even at today's highs it was still well over 60% below its high for the year. It is a similar story for CCL's peer, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) which is up 27.78% but was 61.4% from its highs at its best price today. On the other hand, there are 28 stocks that have come within 1% of their 52-week highs at their high prices today. Another 80 stocks have come within 5% of their 52-week highs at their intraday highs today.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Distance-from-52-week.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Milestone For Small Stocks\n\n&gt; No US equity index has reacted more strongly since Election Day than the Russell 2000 small-cap index. As shown in the chart below, the index finally broke out above its highs from earlier in the year following Monday's positive vaccine news. After that move on Monday, the Russell 2000 was up over 10% in just the last six trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/1110-RTY.png))**\n\n&gt; In just about any other year besides 2020, a 10%+ move in the Russell 2000 would be an extraordinary move, but this year the most recent move is actually the sixth one of at least that much. In fact, coming out of the March lows, the Russell saw three six-day moves of 19.1%, 16.3%, and 14.8%, respectively. The frequency with which we've seen these 10%+ moves in the Russell 2000 over a six-day period has been unlike any other year in the Russell's history. Behind 2020, the year with the next highest total of 10%+ moves was 2011 (4) and then 2008 (3), and the most there has been in any twelve-month rolling basis is five spanning late 2008 through the first half of 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-Russell-2000-Six-Days.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3 Election Charts That Caught Our Attention\n\n&gt; Stocks just had their best week since April, with the S&amp;P 500 Index incredibly a chip shot away from new all-time highs. Joe Biden will be the next President of the United States, but markets are confident Republicans will maintain the Senate, and this means gridlock in Washington. Remember, gridlock is good, as it pulls policy towards compromise and avoids extremes. Also, any legislative changes to taxes, regulation, and capital gains will have meaningful input from both parties.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, a split Congress tends to mean stronger stock returns, almost ignoring whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House. The most likely outcome from the election at this point is a Democratic president with a divided Congress\u2014a scenario that historically has produced solid S&amp;P 500 returns of 15.9% a year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Assuming President-elect Joe Biden takes over in January 2021, it is important to note that historically stocks haven\u2019t done as well the first and second years of a new president compared with an incumbent winning. This makes sense though, as historically voters may have chosen new leadership in part because of economic weakness, and the uncertainty of a new president\u2019s policies could also hold things back some. If things are good, the president tends to win reelection. Things turn around significantly by the third year in office, though, if there\u2019s new leadership. Of course, it\u2019s worth noting that the first year of a new president has seen the S&amp;P 500 higher recently, with stocks up nearly 20% the first year under President Donald Trump (2017) and 23% under President Barack Obama (2009).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-2-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the strength from stocks around the election has been rather historic. \u201cThe S&amp;P 500 added 1% on four consecutive days, which hasn\u2019t happened since late 1982,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAlthough there are only three other times this rare blast of strength happened since WWII, it is worth noting that strong returns going out a year took place after each instance.\u201d The bottom line: Extreme buying pressure has a funny way of resolving higher, and we don\u2019t anticipate this time being any different.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3 The Biggest Winners Are Still Big Losers\n\n&gt; With household names like Carnival (CCL), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Simon Property (SPG), and Royal Caribbean (RCL) all up over 20% today, more than a few people out there are probably kicking themselves for not owning any of them. But before you start ripping your hair out, keep in mind that just about all of these stocks are down (and in a big way) on the year. Of the 33 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are up over 20% following today\u2019s vaccine news, all but one of them are still down year to date. The only exception is Expedia (EXPE), which even after a 20%+ gain is still up just 18% on the year.\n\n&gt; In terms of sector representation, Energy tops the list with more than a third of the names (12) on the list. Behind Energy, Real Estate (8), Consumer Discretionary (6), and Financials (6) are the only other sectors with multiple stocks listed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Best-Stocks-1109.png))**\n\n&gt; Just as the best-performing stocks are all still underperforming the S&amp;P 500 on a year to date basis, the biggest losers today are among the year\u2019s biggest winners. There are 25 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that were down on the day as of the middle of the afternoon, but the only one that is down on the year is Biogen (BIIB), a stock whose decline has nothing to do with the vaccine news. Including BIIB, the 25 biggest losers are still up an average of 41% YTD (median: 31%). Behind BIIB, the two worst-performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 today are Pool (POOL) and Etsy (ETSY). Both stocks are down over 10% on the day, but for the year are still holding onto gains of 56.4% and 190.5%, respectively.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Worst-Stocks-1109-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Policy Uncertainty Spiked Into the Election\n\n&gt; For the month of October, the NFIB's reading on small business sentiment was unchanged at the headline levels but many of the sub-indices broadly pointed to further improvements in business conditions. That is not to say small businesses do not have their share of concerns. As shown in the chart below, the NFIB's index on Economic Policy Uncertainty rose another 4 points in October to 98 which is the second-highest reading on record behind November of 2016; around the time of the last presidential election.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-NFIB-Uncert2.png))**\n\n&gt; The election played a role in the uncertainty as 31% of small businesses surveyed reported government-related concerns as their biggest problem in October (lower chart). That was up for the second month in a row and is around the high end of the past couple of year's range. Additionally, as discussed earlier, labor also dominates the minds of small businesses as small businesses report struggles in filling roles. 30% reported cost or quality of labor as the single most important problem (top chart). That is unchanged since August.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-NFIB-Problem-govt-labor.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Tech Fades and Small Caps Soar\n\n&gt; Pfizer\u2019s announcement that its vaccine for covid-19 appears to be 90% effective on Monday morning also gave new life to small-cap stocks, many of which have struggled throughout the pandemic. The announcement has also triggered an exodus from mega-cap tech stocks that had been the \u201cgo-to\u201d positions throughout most of the pandemic.\n\n&gt; The chart above is based upon a similar chart from page 112 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020. It shows the typical one-year seasonal pattern of the ratio of the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000 from July through June (scale on right). Overlaid on top of this pattern is the performance of this ratio in 2020 so far through today\u2019s close (left scale). When the ratio is declining, large-cap stocks are outperforming small cap stocks. When the ratio is climbing, small caps are outperforming. In a typical year, small-caps will lag until around late-September or early October and then take off right around mid-December.\n\n&gt; Covid-19 related shutdowns and unemployment had kept small caps essentially sidelined this year. There were bouts of strength in late-July to mid-August and a brief surge in mid-September and again in early October. The recent surge higher could be an early start to the major move higher that typically begins around mid-December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/86b0c38fda06a991b0dff788e125ad8d/b50bde8b92d0b3a1-5b/s500x750/7dbabf47c90b7da6961e2d23f94a9abb1e8d4287.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 13th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltQP6MFIkfo))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.15.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/wtHIr7r.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.16.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BPYsDg8.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/Q0M8ILC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.17.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NoHPXKo.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EqCY7lq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lw83hhF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FFUyg9w.png))\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/R78y9vB.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bKdqcYL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.20.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Fff0sUp.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.20.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",

My conservative side thinks gold is a better investment, but bitcoin has been so hugely profitable for me. \n\nFrom a 30000 foot view, when comparing the two, the real long-term question is whether bitcoin could ever compete with gold or replace gold. I'm not talking in the next 10 years, but in the next 30 years. 100 years? Are we still going to be valuing gold the way we do in the future? Why or why not? If not gold, then what? And why not bitcoin? \n\nAny thoughts? I know this isn't the typical short-term discussion.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 9th, 2020.\n\n# **After sharp bounce, market may take a \u2018breather\u2019 on lingering election uncertainty, virus outbreak  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/06/after-sharp-bounce-market-may-take-a-breather-on-lingering-election-uncertainty-virus-outbreak.html)**\n*****\n&gt; After an initially exuberant election reaction, stocks may trade more cautiously in the week ahead, as investors watch election developments unfold and track the course of the coronavirus. \n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up more than 7.3% in the past week, at 3,509, and the Nasdaq rose 9%, the best weekly performance since April. Stocks slid Friday, but technology, communications services, health care and discretionary stocks had the biggest gains for the week, after it appeared Democrat Joe Biden could be the next president but with a split Congress.\n*****\n&gt; The election was still unresolved heading into the weekend, but even if Biden is declared winner, close votes and lawsuits are likely to result in recounts. The Senate appeared to be in Republican hands, but the margin of control is likely to be tight, and runoff elections are required for two Senate seats in Georgia in early January.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the uncertainty is going to catch up the market on a short-term basis,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, BNY Mellon\u2019s Wealth Management chief investment officer. \u201cPerhaps next week could be a drifting lower kind of week.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ahead of the election, the market had been betting on a \u201cblue wave,\u201d where Biden would take the White House and Democrats would get control of the Senate, giving them total control of Congress. But when it appeared the Senate would stay in Republican hands, stocks surged on the idea of gridlock, which would keep Biden from implementing tax increases and lots of new regulations.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, there has been a surge in daily new coronavirus cases to more than 122,000. Economists are concerned that the economic recovery could suffer as some states could restrict activities and consumers may pull back heading into the important holiday season.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed, in its post-meeting statement Thursday, repeated that the course of the virus could help determine the path of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; There are a few economic reports in the week ahead, including consumer price index inflation data Thursday and the producer price index Friday. More than a dozen Fed officials are on the speaking circuit, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who speaks Thursday on central banking at a European Central Bank forum.\n*****\n&gt; The earnings season is beginning to slow down, but there are still dozens of reports, including from McDonald\u2019s on Monday and Walt Disney, Applied Materials and Cisco on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is just setting up to be a breather. There\u2019s still a lot to figure out here,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cThe equity market\u2019s reaction has been I think understandable and probably better than many might have expected.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said there may be uncertainty for awhile. \u201cWhat I\u2019m thinking about is the Senate races. Part of the market reaction has been relying on this divided government.\u201d After the votes are all in or recounted, \u201ca sweep is unlikely but possible.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the longer this stays uncertain and messy, the more the post-election bounce comes into question,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Different than 2000\n&gt; It would not be unusual for the stock market to sell off before rallying into year end, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall does not expect the type of turbulence there was in 2000, when former Vice President Al Gore lost to George W. Bush in a tight race that ultimately went to the Supreme Court.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn 2000, they were not expecting hanging chads. But they do expect a contested election this time. I think in many ways the market anticipated this,\u201d said Stovall.\n*****\n&gt; But the market, after its election week surge, could pull back. \u201cHistorically, the market goes down in the month of November, after a Democratic victory,\u201d said Stovall. Since World War II, Democrats won the White House nine times, and the market fell an average of 0.5% in November in those years, compared to the average gain for all Novembers of 1.4%, he said.\n*****\n&gt; After those Democratic victories, stocks then rose 1.9% in December on average, more than the normal 1.5% gain for all Decembers.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said they currently do not expect the kind of lockdowns that states ordered when the pandemic started to spread in March. But there could still be some impact that could be negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said he sees some signs of optimism for the market. Strong data, like third quarter GDP, October\u2019s drop in unemployment to 6.9%, and the better-than-expected earnings are all positives for the market.

Our analysis here is based on historical market performance during the most likely political alignments for next year. We ran these likely scenarios through the Almanac database software to create this graph.\n\n&gt; We are either going to have the fifth year of a two-term republican president or a first year of a new democratic presidency. It appears the democrats will hold the house and the republicans will hold the senate, but that is not a forgone conclusion either. So we also examined both presidential outcomes with a democratic, republican and split congress.\n\n&gt; Our study uses the S&amp;P 500 from 1949 to 2017. We start in 1949 because it is the first full 4-Year Presidential Stock Market Cycle since the end of WWII. The Twenty-Second Amendment that implemented presidential term limits for a max of two terms or eight years was ratified on February 27, 1951. Truman in 1949 was excluded as there was a no change of party in the White House. We gave Bush 41 the same treatment.\n\n&gt; Admittedly, there are limited data points; four each of fifth year republicans and first year democrats. Here\u2019s what we found. A change in party with a new, first year democratic president came with democratic control of Congress and significantly higher performance for the S&amp;P 500, averaging 10.6% with a median gain of 15.1% versus 7.0% for the average post-election year since 1949.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a89421df75f426e1b1ff90cb2c29cb90/b63e1cf962f89fdb-a3/s400x600/f9bde99a9e4ba83b0df266a8d3cc04cd732cc58f.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Fifth year republican presidents in 1957 (Eisenhower) and 1973 (Nixon) had to work with democratically controlled Congresses and the market suffered significant losses. The market did well in Reagan\u2019s fifth year with a split Congress \u2013 a testament to how \u201cThe Great Communicator\u201d was able to work across the aisle with then Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill. Even with republican control of Congress under Bush 43\u2019s fifth year, the market had a tough year with ongoing issues in Iraq, North Korea declaring it\u2019s a nuclear power and the most active and second costliest hurricane season on record.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Job Growth Continues as COVID-19 Cases Rise\n\n&gt; The US labor market shrugged off election uncertainty and continued to add jobs in October. Despite the waning effects of fiscal stimulus and rising COVID-19 cases, per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added 638,000 jobs, ahead of Bloomberg survey estimates calling for 580,000. The headline number was depressed by a 268,000 drop in government employment, including 147,000 temporary census workers. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell from 7.9% to 6.9% despite a rise in the labor force participation rate, a reversal of the dynamic we saw in September when unemployment fell while the labor force participation also declined.\n\n&gt; However, a troubling trend remains beneath the surface. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the number of long-term unemployed\u2014those out of work for 27 weeks or longer\u2014continues to rise as a share of the total unemployed:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11.6.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWhile the labor market has continued to show improvement, there are still many people out there who are having a hard time getting back to work,\u201d noted LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWith total jobs in the US around 10 million below pre-pandemic levels and rising COVID-19 cases, there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement despite the declining unemployment rate.\u201d\n\n&gt; COVID-19 cases in the United States have reached record highs with a weekly trend growth rate above 20%, according to the COVID Tracking Project. As the weather cools and more activity shifts indoors, additional restrictions to limit the spread of the virus could slow the fragile labor market recovery.\n\n&gt; In particular, much of the private sector gains in this month\u2019s jobs report were in the services sector, where previous jobs reports had shown strength in goods-oriented industries. Many countries in Europe have reinstated restrictions or even gone as far as implementing new lockdowns. While we don\u2019t expect lockdowns in the United States like we saw in March, restrictions on activity could limit future job gains.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One Sentiment Survey Soars While Another Sinks\n\n&gt; In an earlier post, we discussed how bullish sentiment in the AAII survey has been on the rise, but looking at another weekly sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence, the opposite is true. The percentage of respondents reporting as bullish fell sharply this week, 7 percentage points, down to 53.6%. While a majority are still optimistic and that reading is in the middle of its range, that was the largest weekly decline since a 7.4 percentage point decline to 41.7% in the first week of March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, the percentage of newsletter writers that are \"looking for a correction\" rose sharply to 25.8% this week following last week's over 5% decline for the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Correction.png))**\n\n&gt; The Investors Intelligence survey has a long history dating back to 1963, and in all weeks in that time, only 5% (174 weeks) have seen bullish sentiment fall 5 percentage points or more while the percentage of respondents looking for a correction has risen at least 5 percentage points in the same week. In the chart below, we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 following these past occurrences when there has not been another in the prior 3 months. The S&amp;P 500 has frequently been higher over the following weeks and months, but there is a slight underperformance relative to all periods since 1963 when the survey begins.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Performance.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2 Post-Election Charts You Need to See\n\n&gt; The election is over, but the questions are mounting. We don\u2019t know who will be the next president as of Wednesday morning, but we do know that stocks tend to do well the final two months of an election year. \u201cOnce the uncertainty is over, stocks tend to rally in November and December, with November the best month of the year during an election year,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOf course, 2020 isn\u2019t like any other year, and we still could be a ways away from who the winner will be.\u201d\n\n&gt; The LPL Chart of the Day shows that the S&amp;P 500 Index tends to do very well the final two months of the year, especially during election years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The modern design of the S&amp;P 500 stock index was first launched in 1957. Performance back to 1928 incorporates the performance of predecessor index, the S&amp;P 90\n\n&gt; One of the big takeaways so far from Tuesday night is that the Senate likely will stay Republican, meaning we may have a divided Congress. The chances of higher taxes and more regulation likely took a hit under this scenario. This could be a nice tailwind for stocks, as the S&amp;P 500 historically has done quite well under a divided Congress, up more than 17% on average. Additionally, in years with a divided Congress, stocks have been higher the past 10 times, with 2020 potentially being the 11th in a row.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-2-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; This election is far from over, so stay tuned to LPL Research as we continue to monitor things!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Emerging Markets Cheering a Potential Biden Win\n\n&gt; The US equity market has seen a massive rally in reaction to what is looking like a Biden victory over President Trump coupled with the Republican party maintianing its majority in the US Senate. None of these results are official at this point, so they are subject to change, but these are the most likely scenarios as of now. Outside of the US, emerging markets have also rallied. In just the last two days, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF (EEM) has rallied 5% and broken above resistance to new 52-week highs. If for no other reason then Biden's campaign slogan isn't America First, the rationale behind the rally makes some sense.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-Now.png))**\n\n&gt; The reaction of EEM in the aftermath of this election is very much different from what happened in 2016. Heading into the 2016 election, EEM had been trending higher, but pulled back in the days leading up to the election and broke its uptrend that had been in place since earlier in the year. Again, Trump's America First approach was understandably viewed as a headwind to emerging market equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-labels.png))**\n\n&gt; While the initial reaction of EEM to Trump's election was negative, that weakness didn't last long. The chart below shows the performance of EEM in the two months before and one year after the 2016 election. The gray box represents the same period shown in the chart above. Within days after breaking its uptrend after the 2016 election, EEM bounced back, rallied to its 50-DMA, tested its November low, and then in the early days of 2017 it was off to the races as EEM. In fact, even accounting for the post-Election Day declines, one year after the 2016 election, EEM was up 25% which was actually more than the 21% return for the S&amp;P 500! The moral of the story here is that first reactions aren't always the right reactions, and as an investor it's not just imperative to know the environment you are operating in, but also when the tides are turning.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-2017.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Winners and Losers During Trump's Presidency\n\n&gt; With Election Day upon us, below we take a look at the biggest winners and losers across financial markets during the Trump Presidency from Election Day 2016 through today. First off, below is a chart of the market cap of the Russell 3,000 since Election Day 2000 which George W. Bush eventually won. The Russell 3,000 makes up more than 98% of the total US equity market cap, so it's a good gauge to use for measuring the overall change in market cap levels. The current market cap of the Russell 1000 is just north of $35 trillion, which is up $11.5 trillion since Election Day 2016. President Obama oversaw US market cap growth of $12.3 trillion over his two terms, while President Bush actually saw market cap decline by $4.1 trillion after his two terms.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/mktcap.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a look at the total return of various asset classes since Election Day 2016 using key ETFs listed on US exchanges. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is up 70.6% since Trump was elected, while the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) more than doubled that at +144.3%. Of the broad index ETFs in the matrix, the Smallcap Value ETF (IJS) is up the least since Election Day 2016 at just +17.2%.\n\n&gt; Looking at US sector ETFs, the Energy sector (XLE) is a huge outlier with a decline of 48.3% since Trump was elected. Technology (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) are up the most with gains of 154% and 97%, respectively.\n\n&gt; Along with Energy stocks, the oil (USO) and natural gas (UNG) ETFs have been more than cut in half since 11/8/16, while gold (GLD) is up 47% and silver is up 29.5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/assetclass1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Not every country has seen stock market gains since Trump was elected. As shown below, Mexico (EWW) is down 28.5%, Brazil (EWZ) is down 19.4%, Spain (EWP) is down 6.8%, and the UK (EWU) is just slightly in the red.\n\n&gt; The US (SPY) is up more than any other country with a gain of 70.6%, while China (ASHR) is up the second most at +51%. Whatever happened with the trade war certainly didn't hurt the US and China versus the rest of the world on a relative basis.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/countryreturns1103.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/sectors1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Within the Russell 1,000 in its current form, there are nine stocks that are up 1,000% or more since Election Day 2016, with Enphase Energy (ENPH) at the top with a gain of 8,590%. Trade Desk (TTD) is up the second most at +2,448%, followed by Novocure (NVCR), SolarEdge Tech (SEDG), and Quidel (QDEL). Square (SQ) ranks sixth with a gain of 1,203%. Other notables on the list of big winners since Trump was elected include Etsy (ETSY), Teladoc (TDOC), Tesla (TSLA), NVIDIA (NVDA), Atlassian (TEAM), Boston Beer (SAM), and Lululemon (LULU).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-since-2016.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of market cap gains for individual stocks, the numbers below are quite eye-popping. Apple (AAPL) has gained the most in market cap since Trump was elected with an increase of $1.257 trillion! Amazingly, both Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have added more than $1 trillion in market cap as well. Prior to the last few years, no company was even close to having a $1 trillion market cap, but at this point, AAPL, AMZN, and MSFT have gained that much in the last four years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/capuse.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 6th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ5sT7SXYTk))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.8.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/gziesWx.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Yme9cXS.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/a6Kp4iF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XOR4bP6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TfDOPZJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/OsrCLIc.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/N7Ibl9s.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/y4tBaZw.png))\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wVnvQZH.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9PnmIUs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uoiA0Bw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",

It goes through what an economic recovery looks like for markets (the \"reflation\" trade) and which asset classes you would expect to outperform in the scenario. It also goes through the real risk of inflation and deflationary scenarios based on past data and trends. \n\nHighlights: \n\n\\- The reflation trade is an expectation that a global economic recovery will take place that takes equities (especially global and emerging market equities) and commodity prices higher due to increased demand. Value and beat up sectors will outperform growth due to a recovery in demand and the relative lag. \n\n\\- Reflation and inflation are not the same. Inflation can happen with or without economic growth, which leads to stagflation and likely a stall in asset price appreciation. \n\n\\-  Reasons for possible inflation: Money supply has exploded higher along with savings rates. While it has not made its way into the economy yet, the impetus of economic growth could make banks more open to lending and people spending their savings; leading to higher money velocity and higher inflation. Fiscal stimulus to combat the slowdown could over reach and cause a spending spree by putting the money directly into the hands of individual who will spend it rather than banks who have been reluctant to lend. \n\n\\- Reasons against inflation: Usually there is deflation historically after recessions due to lack of demand. We are likely entering into a double dip recession with increased lockdowns. \n\n\\- Inflation could be destabilizing : Inflation will lead to higher yields for all debt. At record US debt levels and without higher growth, this could make it difficult for overextended companies to roll over debt increasing default risk. It will also lead to a depreciation in fixed income instruments, causing a domino effect of deleveraging due to asset prices falling. This was seen in taper tantrum of 2018. \n\n\\- Yield curve control will attempt to backstop this possibility if it happens. \n\n\\- Good to own bonds at the long end of the curve (ex. TLT) if you are long equities right now and want to protect against a deflationary response.",

Idea is to split apart the middle legs of the fly rather than having them at the same strike.  As with a BWB, trade is done for a credit so there is no risk to the other direction.

        "selftext": "**Biden wins the election, what does this mean for the economy and the stock market, what Buffen\u2019s Berkshire has done in the last quarter and more, let\u2019s talk about everything** \n\nHey everyone and welcome, I am going to react to the latest news from the election, the economy and in the stock market from last week and what to expect next\n\nSo late Saturday the victory of Biden was announced as networks finally started to predict that he won the election. I have no partisan view as i am not a resident or citizen of the US, but i believe that the results of this election (the Biden win and the Republicans keeping the Senate) is the best the stock market could have hoped for, as many experts were predicting a Blue Sweep. There still will be two important runoff elections in Georgia at the beggining of 2021, where the Democrats could still end up winning the Senate. Biden currently has a projected 290 electoras votes but i believe he will also keep the lead in Georgia and end up with 306 electoral votes, the same number as Trump had 4 years ago [VOTE MAP](https://ibb.co/LZ5dnzt) . Important leaders like the German Chancellor, Uk\u2019s prime minister, Canada\u2019s prime minister, France\u2019s president and many more welcomed and congratuled the win of Biden, which seems to be favored internationaly by the world leaders as they were tired of the whipsaw that came with Trump tweeting non-stop. So this probable grid-lock in Congress is loved by the stock market, as there are no iminent tax raises and a stimulus bill is far more likely if not by the end of the Trump mandate surely at the very start of Biden\u2019s.\n\nSo this scenario that is playing out seems to be the most profitable one for wall street as the average annual return since 1933 is about 14% with a Democractic President and a split Congress [Historical CHART](https://ibb.co/SJGP97P)\n\nYesterday Biden also announced how they will try to combat the illness with Better testing and tracing, a increase in PPE production, National guidance for schools, business and families, Investments of 25 bilion in vaccine development and distribution and mask mandates. While also trying to make the higher risk individuals more safe.\n\nP.S. Here\u2019s a funny meme that LeBron James posted with a throwback to his big block of an opponent. [MEME](https://ibb.co/2hmQk6R)\n\nSo all 3 big indices had the best week since early April with the Nasdaq composite being up just over 9% [NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/rpgWtJH), the SP500 was up 7,32% [S&amp;P CHART](https://ibb.co/Ss7FWVN) and the DOW gained almost 7%.[DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/j3bB0P8) The Nasdaq and Sp were flat for the day, pairing loses from the begining of the day while the down fell 0,23% mostly based on profit taking in my opinion.\n\nThere were more companies that were declining on Friday with over 60% of the companies in the red but with a disproportional number of almost 90% of new highs while the volume fell again way below average [MARKET CHART](https://ibb.co/k0kY7Z1) . There weren\u2019t any significant leaders in the market on Friday but energy traield again being more than 2% down [SECTOR CHART](https://ibb.co/VDFksR8) while small caps under-performed the market especialy the value plays.  [CHART](https://ibb.co/9ndqFLC)\n\nThe fear in the market seems to have completly gone away as we have seen another 10% decline in the VIX indicator to drop below 25. [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/8MjSd1f)\n\nHere is a heat map of Friday, you can see this was quite a slow day, not to many green companies but not that big of a red day either. [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/nsCvwVz)\n\nThe US economy added more than 638 thousand jobs [NEWS](https://ibb.co/hDrrTXs) more than 503 thousand that were expected [CHART](https://ibb.co/C6fD3Sh), while the unemployment rate fell to 6,9% way better than the 7,7% expected this is the sixt straight month of jobs recovery.[CHART](https://ibb.co/RBZzdVG) As they seem to be in a big V shape recovery, overall  [V- SHAPE](https://ibb.co/HN6n9dH)\n\nThe market should now turn they\u2019re attention to the samshing of the earnings season amid the election with 2 thirds of the SP500 beating the estimates both the top and bottom line, that is almost double the 38% historical average. \n\nBank of American release a chart for q3 earnings and as you can see earnings have increased 6,7% in the SP500 year over year and 21,5% quarter over quarter. [EARNINGS CHART](https://ibb.co/C6zfWZR)\n\nAnd as the fed announced that it will keep the benchmark rate between 0 and 0,25% [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/vjNy43D)this continues to stimulate the economy of the US, with the fed beeing probably more responsible for the recovery in the last months as stimulus has been staled in congress. Also they continue to have a target of a running inflation of 2% and will continue to buy assests worth around 120 billion dollars montly to pump money in the economy  [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/wBxn56S). If a stimulus bill will eventualy pass, households will probably continue to use the money the same way as last time with over 70% of the money being used for savings and debt payments. But thay may go down a little as people may tend to spend a little more on essentials and non essentials with a better outlook in the near future than last time. [HOUSEHOLD SPENDING](https://ibb.co/dbbKCj6)\n\nHere are some interesting economic events for next weeks as we continue to closely watch how to recovery is going. [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/gMX5XH5)\n\nNvidia saw a pop in the stock finally as they announced that Fornite will join the GeForce gaming cliud, that could mean a return for the game in ios devices with GeForce currently available on Mac,Windows,Android and Chromebooks. The company has almost reteurn to it all time highs after this weeks strong gains. [NVIDIA CHART](https://ibb.co/1qxmphB)\n\nBuffets Berkshire announced on Saturday that they bought back around 9 billion of the company\u2019s stock,bringing the total to around 16 bilion for the year so far.[BUYBACK CHART](https://ibb.co/ysw5bkx) That was around 4 billion more than in the second quarter. the operating earnings also decrease a little since last quarter and are almost 3 billion or 32% less then last year. [BUYBACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/fSWCvdQ)The only segment that improved since last year was Railroad,utilities and enegery, while insurance was the biggest loser.\n\nThe company has almost the same amount of cash and short term investemtns like the previos quarter at around 146 billion dollars with 70% of the investments concentrated in 4 big companies (Apple , Bank of America, Coca-Cola and American Express) up from the 60% these company represented at the end of 2019. [INVESTMENTS](https://ibb.co/Dps2f95)\n\nThe buybacks of the company exced any full year amount in Berkhsire\u2019s history and far exeded the analysts expectation of around 3,2 billion in buybacks. As the strategy for Buffet and Charlie Munger is to buyback the company\u2019s stock as long as they believe it\u2019s undervalued and they will still have ample cash after the buybacks. AS the only other major investments made last quarter were about 6 billion invested in the five big Japenese trading houses and the data storage company Snowflake.\n\nI just saw some interesting news as NetFlix announced they will launch a offering named NetFlix Direct in France that will come with a linear feed of content from Netflix\u2019s library, so the company that is the biggest reasons for the decline of old TV programming made quite a twist as they seek to expand more and more.  [NETFLIX NEWS](https://ibb.co/gWzmKKs)\n\nHere is a list with some of the most important earnings next week, some companies that i like that are reporting are: McDonalds, Datadog, Tencent, Corsair, Purple, Lemonade and DraftKings. [EARNINGS NEXT WEEKS](https://ibb.co/JFKh6kN)\n\nThank you everyone for reading!  Be sure to leave a comment down below!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

        "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nLooking for some general investment and portfolio advice. 24 year old that makes roughly $80K/year. \n\nBreakdown of net worth: \n\n* $15K in savings accounts (emergency fund) \n* $3.5K in checking for near-term \n* $10K in 401(K) - Vanguard S&amp;P index fund  \n* $10K in personal brokerage account \n   * 50% in S&amp;P index funds \n   * 50% in individual stocks \n\nNo longer saving cash, as I feel comfortable with the amount I have reserved should an emergency arise. I plan to continue to contribute to my 401(K) as well as invest $1K/month into my personal brokerage account, increasing both proportionally with pay raises. \n\n50% of funds invested in my personal account will go straight into index fund shares (SPY, VOO). I'm also planning on opening positions in ARKK, ICLN as I believe in the thesis of these funds. Mama Wood is a genius, and if we don't switch to clean energy soon the world will end anyway. \n\nThe other 50% of funds invested in my personal account go into individual stocks. I'm tech/financials heavy (half of my individual portfolio) - main holdings include AAPL, MSFT, PYPL, MA, V. I also have smaller positions ESTY, NTDOY, O, TMUS. Will likely open a position in BABA next week. \n\nMy plan is to continue the 75% index/25% individual split in equities. For individual stocks I will continue to focus on growth/tech opportunities as a supplement to index returns. At this point in my life, I think the potential gains from growth should take a front seat to any dividend/value investing. \n\nIs this a solid plan going forward? What would you change thesis or allocation wise? \n\nCheers!",

        "selftext": "The Bank for International Settlements (the BIS).\n\n***Possibly the most powerful bank that most people haven't heard of.***\n\nKnown as the central bank for central banks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe BIS was set up in Basel, Switzerland, in 1930 to facilitate World War I reparations payments from Germany.\n\nIt was partly the brainchild of Montagu Norman, the Depression-era Governor of the Bank of England.\n\nNorman, or rather those he was representing, wanted a new bank that would serve as the world\u2019s first *international* financial institution.\n\nA meeting place for central bankers. \n\nAway from the demands of politicians and the prying eyes of nosy journalists, the bankers would bring some much needed order and coordination to the world financial system.\n\nNorman\u2019s proposal gained an eager advocate in Hjalmar Schacht, the Reichsbank president.\n\nThe Reichsbank was the Central Bank of the German Reich at the time.\n\nSchacht saw the BIS as a way of easing Germany\u2019s reparations burden, but it became far more than that:\n\n***The BIS helped to sell gold seized by the Nazis from occupied nations and acted as a conduit of hard currency that allowed the Third Reich to buy raw materials throughout the war - to the point where Emil Puhl, the Reichsbank Vice President, described the BIS as the \"only real foreign branch\" of the Reichsbank.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe BIS's morally tainted wartime experience almost sank it at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference, when Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau and lead American delegate to the conference Harry Dexter White sought to liquidate it while setting up the postwar international system dominated by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.\n\nHowever, the BIS's powerful friends intervened to save it.\n\nSince then the BIS has continually reinvented itself, using the Bank as a place to host a lot of the new architecture of the financial system, specifically the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Petrodollar Era](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjK0nRSUNgU) has had a massive impact on foreign policy.\n\nIt was the CIA who imported a new leader for the so called \"people's rebellion\" in Libya. \n\nIndeed, Khalifa Hafter had spent the past 20 years living with no known source of income just five miles away from the CIA's headquarters in Langley.\n\nCheney expressed great concern in a speech in 1999 that foreign governments were controlling oil.\n\n***\"While many regions of the world offer great oil opportunities, the Middle East, with two thirds of the world's oil and the lowest cost, is still where the prize ultimately lies.\"***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFormer Supreme Allied Commander Europe of Nato, from 1997 to 2000, Wesley Clark claims that in 2001, a general in the Pentagon showed him a piece of paper and said:\n\n***\"I just got this memo today or yesterday from the office of the secretary of defence upstairs. It's a, it's a five-year plan. We're going to take down seven countries in five years. We're going to start with Iraq, then Syria, Lebanon, then Libya, Somalia, Sudan, we're going to come back and get Iran in five years.\"***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis agenda fitted perfectly with the famous think-tank called the Project for the New American Century.\n\nSo how is this all relevant to the BIS?\n\nWell, the Libyan government controlled more of its oil than any other nation on earth and it is the type of oil that Europe finds easiest to refine - OK that seems like incentive enough to impose democracy - but there's more:\n\nLibya also controlled its own finances.\n\n***For the seven countries named by Clark, what did they have in common? None of them were listed among the member banks of the BIS, putting them outside the long regulatory arm of the central banker's central bank in Switzerland.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat about today?\n\nWell, naturally, the BIS is preaching about the importance of Central bank Independence.\n\nAs well as this, they have a new innovation hub, incorporating research into Central Bank Digital Currencies.\n\nThe BIS continues to operate with less disclosure than the central banks that make up its executive committee. \n\nIts assets are protected against seizure. \n\nIts process of establishing capital requirements for banks remains...opaque.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov2vXts0VxQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov2vXts0VxQ)",

        "selftext": "After World War II, a new international monetary system called Bretton Woods was created.\n\nBretton Woods established three main things:\n\n(1) the U.S. dollar was to be an international reserve currency, \n\n(2) the U.S. dollar would be backed by gold at a price of $35 per ounce, and \n\n(3) any country could exchange dollars for gold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCountries running trade surpluses with the US sought to exchange their dollars for gold, and this rapidly shrunk US gold reserves. \n\nThis then led to the so called Nixon shock - President Richard Nixon effectively ending the Bretton Woods system in 1971.\n\nThe world economy entered a new era: the US Dollar became the global reserve currency.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe US made no effort to rein in deficit spending, in fact quite the opposite.\n\nTherefore, the US needed to continue to find ways to sell government debt (i.e. to find buyers of US Treasury Securities) *without* driving up interest rates.\n\nThat is, the US needed more buyers for its debt.\n\nBut by 1974, the enormous flood of dollars from the US into top-oil-exporter Saudi Arabia suggested a solution.\n\nThat year, Nixon sent new US Treasury secretary William Simon to Saudi Arabia with a mission...\n\nThe task: neutralize crude oil as an economic weapon against the US and find a way to persuade a relatively hostile kingdom to finance America's widening deficit with its newfound petrodollar wealth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe basic framework was simple: the US would buy oil from Saudi Arabia and provide the kingdom military aid and equipment.\n\nIn return, the Saudis would plow billions of their petrodollar revenue back into US Treasuries and therefore finance America's spending.\n\nA win-win: the Saudis would receive protection from geopolitical enemies, and the US would get a new place to unload large amounts of government debt.\n\nThis became known as \"petrodollar recycling\".\n\nBy *spending* on oil, the US was creating new demand for US debt and US dollars.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoreover, since Saudi Arabia dominated the OPEC - the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries - this dollar deal was extended to OPEC overall, which meant that the dollar became the preferred currency for oil purchases worldwide.\n\nAnd so the petrodollar era began.\n\nThis petrodollar system has had *massive* implications for US foreign policy, which has essentially involved imposing 'freedom' on any major oil-exporting state that moves towards ending its reliance on dollars.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2000, Saddam Hussein, then-president of Iraq, announced that Iraq was moving to sell its oil in Euros instead of dollars.\n\nFollowing a particular catalyst event in 2001, the US invaded Iraq, deposed Saddam Hussein, and converted Iraqi oil sales back to the US dollar.\n\nOf course, this exact pattern was repeated with Gaddafi when he attempted to create a unified African currency backed by Libyan gold reserves to sell African oil.\n\nShortly after his announcement, rebels armed by the US Government and allies overthrew the dictator and his regime.\n\nAfter his death, the idea that African oil would be sold on something other than the dollar quickly died out.\n\nOther regimes that have called for abandoning the petrodollar include Iran and Venezuela. \n\nThe US has called for regime change in both of these countries...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough they have tried to keep it under wraps, Saudi Arabia is believed to be one of America's largest foreign creditors.\n\nUndoubtedly, Saudi holdings of US debt and other assets are significant.\n\nAll else being equal, the US should be growing less dependent on foreign holders of debt, certainly in terms of Saudi and OPEC-held debt, since the global role of OPEC and the Saudis has been diminishing in terms of global market share.\n\nBut all else *isn't* equal, and the US has been piling on ever-larger amounts of debt in recent years. \n\nIn 2019, for example, the annual deficit topped *one trillion*. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis immense growth in debt obviously makes the US regime more sensitive to changes in demand for US debt, and ever more reliant on foreign demand for both US debt and US dollars. \n\nIn order to avoid a crisis, the US must ensure that interest rates remain low and that foreigners want to acquire both US dollars and US debt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWere petrodollars and petrodollar recycling to disappear, it would have a twofold effect on US government finances: \n\nFirst of all, a sizable decline in petrodollar recycling would put significant *upward* pressure on interest rates. \n\nThe result would be a budget crisis for the US government, as it would have to devote ever-larger amounts of the federal budget to payments on the debt. \n\n(The other option would be to have the US central bank monetize the debt by purchasing ever-larger amounts of it to make up for a lack of foreign demand. But this would lead to growing price inflation.)\n\nFurthermore, if participants began to exit the petrodollar system (and, say, sell oil in euros instead) demand for dollars would drop, exacerbating any scenarios in which the central bank is monetizing the debt.\u00a0 \n\nThis would also generally contribute to greater price inflation, as fewer dollars will be sucked out of the US by foreign holders.\n\nThe result could be ongoing declines in government spending on services, and growing price inflation. \n\nThe US regime's ability to finance its debt would decline significantly, and the US would need to pull back on military commitments, pensions, and more. \n\nEither that, or keep spending at the same rate and face an inflationary spiral.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr...how about another option?\n\nAnyone fancy a Great Reset? \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjK0nRSUNgU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjK0nRSUNgU)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCREDIT: \n\nRyan McMaken\n\n[Huge Debt Got Us Hooked on Petrodollars \u2014 and on Saudi Arabia](https://mises.org/wire/huge-debt-got-us-hooked-petrodollars-%E2%80%94-and-saudi-arabia)",

Visa generated 52% of its volume in the September quarter from debit transactions, compared with 44% for Mastercard MA .\n\nIn normal recessionary times, debit stays strong for a while before a swing back into credit takes place after a few years, Ellis said, but the COVID-19 crisis adds a new dimension. In addition to the cyclical shift toward debit because of the pandemic, there\u2019s also been a step up in cash displacement, which is a secular trend that she expects to continue. Much of that movement from cash to cards seems to be happening through debit.\n\nEllis said that the debit trends are one reason she tilts toward Visa shares over Mastercard\u2019s these days, though she has buy ratings on both names. She\u2019s also upbeat about the company\u2019s Visa Direct platform, which allows for \u201cpush\u201d payments, a popular way for gig economy companies to pay drivers and delivery people. Mastercard has its own version of this, called Send, but Ellis said Visa is investing more in this area and may be benefitting from its larger scale.",

        "selftext": "I am a known massive proponent for the transaction fintechs, and have written a multitude of posts on them in the last 3 years. Apart from diligent financial analysis and modeling, the largest reason for these massive long positions is Sweden.\n\nSweden is a world leader of digital payments, spawning multiple large fintechs platforms, such as Swish (Sweden domestic only), Klarna (Global payments), and iZettle (PayPal acquisition). As one of the world leaders of fintech, I use what works in Sweden to project into the US.\n\nIn the latest Central Bank (Riksbanken) report, Swish (Swedish Venmo/Cashapp) has surpassed total cash usage. It's used eveywhere, by everyone. Combine this potential future with Cashapp and Venmo (both of which show profitable margins), the potential for Square &amp; PayPal is much larger than is currently priced in. These stocks may look very over valued as of now, if you draw a line between where their e wallets are now to where swish is in Sweden, they have very very far to go.\n\nSQ is especially hot as of this week after a smash earnings, but I have a massive conviction that this isn't the last smash quarter they will have. Over the next 5 years I am extremely confident they will both outperform the market in raw e-wallet growth. For the first time, cash will be monitized by private corporations. You don't want to miss it.\n\nI mostly made this post for people who doesn't know how far e wallets have come in frontiers. In 5 years, cash will be very very close to dead in sweden. In 20, it'll be gone. Someone will profit and perhaps become the visa / Mastercard of the new age. \n\nPs: \"hur durr bitcoin &amp; crypto will deseat fiat currencies\". PayPal and Square are the two largest corporations currently investing heavily into crypto. If the stable cryptocurrencies is part of our fintech future, no large company will profit as much as they. Get in.\n\nDisclosure: Gargantuan Square position and large PayPal.",

        "selftext": "\nIn my original cover piece of\u00a0Open Orphan\u00a0(ORPH) on the 30th October 2020 I indicated the company is not a one trick pony play on covid-19. The company has a portfolio of 8 viral challenge study models which are: 2 FLU, 2 RSV, 1 HRV, 1 Asthma, 1 cough and 1 COPD viral challenge models. East London Queen Mary Bio-Enterprise facility is now close to fully booked until the end of 2021. It is the world leader in testing antivirals and vaccines. What makes the company so attractive to the large pharmaceuticals and government agencies is the fact it has the world's largest database for infectious diceases. However, it must be said the Covid-19 part of the business, namely the world's first company to take part in human for the Covid-19 challenge vaccine trial appears to be an area the retail investors is chasing the money. But wait, there is more to Open Orphans as I will explain a little later in the follow-up.\n\n\nIt is worth noting\u00a0no more fundraisers' are expected, the last raise was for \u00a312m in May, of which it still had m of this last week, giving at total of \u00a321.5m plus \u00a310m received on Monday from the UK government, plus \u00a32.5m announced on the 5th November - assuming I have not misheard Cathal's strong Irish accent the company should have somewhere in the region of \u00a334m of cash.\n\n\nWith more \u00a3multi million contract wins anticipated it is likely Open Orphan will offer special dividends to shareholders. I don't believe there are any dilutive share options due in the future to the board. I think Cathal referred to these type of options being granted as theft. I'm not sure I agree with this unless the board are amply renumberated. Thus no liefestyle pay packets for the board, Cathal is on \u00a3140,000 and he is the highest paid member of a well run board.\n\n\nDue to the company's specialist facilities and database which has positioned the company ahead of any other company in the world, which meaning it has become the goto human vaccine challenge company, thus well positioned to become rapid cash-cow, with estimates of \u00a34m worth of contracts each month in Q3, with Q4 looking to accelerate the income stream's which could expand at warp speed if the company has as some of us suspect the unnamed US biotechnology company now partnered by their hVIVO arm are involved with Trumps Warp Speed Project.\n\n\nOperation Warp Speed was introduced in early April 2020, after a round-table meeting with Trump, Pence and industry executives at the White House on March 2. It will promote mass production of multiple vaccines based on preliminary evidence allowing for faster distribution if clinical trials confirm one of the vaccines is safe and effective. As part of the funding the US government has allocated $10 billion for Operation Warp Speed through the\u00a0Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, with $6.5 billion designated by Congress for countermeasure development through\u00a0BARDA, along with $3 billion for\u00a0NIH\u00a0research. For the moment we do not know if Open Orphan is part of this project - For now, Cathal Friel is keeping a tight lip. Imagine how exciting very exciting this project could be for us?\n\n\nProbable M&amp;A Activity (it is no secrete)\n\n\nI will focus on Imutex as this has the most potential in terms of value for shareholders, which I believe will be returned in the form of a dividend. Open Orphan has a 49% owned interest in Imutex - picked up for beans. Earlier this year its hVIVO unit reported successful phase IIb trial of a potential flu vaccine for its FLU-v. This has resulted in a\u00a0joint-venture peer-reviewed article written in a scientific journal. The data from FLU-v 004 challenge study underlined its ability to reduce mild-to-moderate symptoms of the illness. The publication of the results in the periodical ''npj Vaccines'' follows results from a separate field assessment of the drug, which revealed \u201ccellular and humoral immunogenicity\u201d from a single dose of adjuvanted FLU-v.\u00a0Meaning the vaccine immediately provoked an immune response.\n\n\nIf as expected Imutex meetings with FDA regulators in the USA ahead of further trials, this should pique interest from M&amp;A suitors.\n\n\nOpen Orphan chief executive Trevor Phillips: \u201cProgression to larger phase III studies with FLU-v can further describe the cellular immune response and evaluate how the vaccine interacts with influenza disease,\u201d Open Orphan chief executive Trevor Phillips.\n\n\nCEC Cathal Friel: \u201cThe need for better, more broadly protective vaccines against influenza is a high priority worldwide, and few new vaccines have demonstrated efficacy in humans as seen in the results of the challenge study for FLU-v 004. \u201cThis is the first universal influenza vaccine that has shown this protection from influenza and reduction of symptoms\u00a0in late-stage studies and together with the\u00a0highly statistical immune results reported in a peer review article means that the risk of failure in a phase III setting is greatly reduced compared with entering into phase III studies with no efficacy data.\u201d\n\n\nNo doubt revenues are anticipated to grow at pace in the coming months as bed capacity/occupancy increases, if not sooner...probably sooner because the CEO. Cathal Friel is a man on a mission to gets things done. I am sure we all expect news on this front from Holland and the USA soon. All of this I believe to be just c90 per cent of the business if I understand Cathal Friel.\n\n\nIt is fair to say Open Orphan has struck gold with its acquisition of hVIVO shortly followed by the acquisition of CHIMagent for a nominal fee. Leaving aside the relatively poor performance before Open Orphan opportunistic, or should I say insightful vision. Along with VENN, these little beauties have transformed the company in a matter of a few months, moreover, have not proved to be a cash drain on the company, but have fitted into a brilliant strategy almost seamlessly and the bonus, that they are already producing a lot of cash with much more to come. Which means Q4 group profitability I believe to be at a NET cash level.\n\nSmart Us of The World Largest Infection Dicease Database\n\nI am really excited for the monetisation of the world's largest infectious dicease database. The excitement is centered around utilising the data in everyday consumable wearables.\u00a0Previous management did not seem to understand the value they had until Cathal Friel arrived a shrewder Irishman, and these fellas are not known for missing much when it comes to turning muck into brass. I am not sure I can call infectious diceased much, unpleasant perhaps! No matter, they have considerable value as we are already witnessing, yet Cathal appears to have found another way to unlock more value in a way I find even more exciting. Let's face it, we will need to learn to live with Covid-19 for some time to come, and everyday affordable wearables could help the world live with infectious diceased that make us much more aware of them.\u00a0\n\n\nThe talk coming from Open Orphan (not just BB gossip), is Apple and Amazon, plus others, are seeking to use the database for wearable devices, smartwatches, health monitor devices, etc. These are often premium devices, especially if you are Apple or Samsung smartwatches brands. So, what is the market size for smart devices? As investors we shouldn't allow Apple's cash pile reported to be $1900bn to excite us too much - Apple didn't amass that cashpile by giving away money to smaller companies as a charitable donation, these companies a ruthless as I am sure their Chinese workforce would profess to their collective dismay. That said, if anyone thinks Cathal, et al at the company do not realise its worth and do not know how to pitch one corporate off against another are fools. Not many Open Orphan investors strike me as fools.\u00a0\n\n\nGlobal Smart Devices Market - Huge and Growing Fast\n\n\nThe global wearable medical device market size was valued at USD 13.0bn in 2019 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 27.9% over the forecast period. The growth of industries such as\u00a0home healthcare\u00a0and remote patient monitoring devices is anticipated to positively influence the demand for wearable devices. In addition, increasing consumer focus on fitness and efforts toward leading a healthy lifestyle are expected to positively fuel the product demand.\n\nMore from the report\u00a0here.\n\n\nThe Global Smart Healthcare Market size stood at US$ 141bn in 2019 and is expected to grow at 14.5% through 2030. Smart Healthcare is technology integrated diagnostic tool used for treating patients and improving the quality of life using e-health, m-health and ambient assisted living services. Rising government initiatives for the digitization of healthcare infrastructure are driving the growth of the smart healthcare market.\n\nMore from the report\u00a0here.\n\n\nThe number of connected wearable devices worldwide has more than doubled in the space of three years, increasing from 325m in 2016 to 722m in 2019. The number of devices is forecast to reach more than one billion by 2022.\n\n\nTwo important factors to the growth within the wearable devices market is primarily being powered by sales of smartwatches \u2013 shipments of smartwatches worldwide are forecast to surpass 100m in 2020. Apple, who unveiled their first smartwatch in 2015, currently dominate the smartwatch market and have held a share of around 45% since 2018. Another reason for the growth of the wearables market is the rise in popularity of hearable devices. Also referred to as earwear or ear-worn devices, this category is expected to soar over the next few years with shipments of devices forecast to increase by 45% to 105m units by 2023.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAny search you chose to do for smartwatches, or health monitoring devices will vary from the cheap and nasty, to the premium expensive kind. What is important as far as we are concerned, and Open Orphan of course, is the fact the company has a very lucrative database of infectious diceases. Some of the world's largest companies are seeking to supplant in their wearable smart devices. While these devices may have been around for a while, and in some cases become a short-term fad for the post-Christmas fitness bunny, I think, as do Apple and Amazon, probably others, a new more important market has just opened up, one that has the potential to save lives as well as monitor health and wellbeing on an all new level previously only health care professionals had access too.\u00a0\n\n\nAs I understand it. The idea is to license Open Orphan data to smart device manufacturer(s). These devices will have the ability to instantly warn the consumer they have contracted symptoms of an infectious dicease, which will have a variety of alert levels related to the disease offering specific advice, like self isolate, off you pop to hospital, etc. The \u00a3multi million question must be who with?\u00a0\n\n\nOne option is to a global leader as first mover advantage on an exclusivity period - naturally this option would yield significant margins to Open Orphan by virtue of the market it would grab ahead of any other adopter because this would of course add significant value in today's pandemic environments.\u00a0\n\n\nThen the second highest bidder? Or multiple companies and or government agencies. The moral standpoint I have is one of ethics and morality. (I make no apologies for my Master Mason and Christian beliefs) To my mind I think such ground-breaking technology should be made as widely available as possible because the alert system is lifesaving, track and traceability (IF AN OPTION) could become a problem if governments do not put financial safety nets in place for people contracting Covid -19 or ave some symptoms that require isolation, this being the only real negative I see for such devices as this would reduce its effectiveness.\u00a0\n\n\nThe other question is the pricing for such data access and alerts in real time - will this price the ordinary mid to low salary consumers be priced out of the market, thus reduce the effectiveness if it were not made available more widespread at affordable pricing levels? This must be a factor for opening up the world economy again...yes, it really has the potential to be this important.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat price could be put on this new ground-breaking market to Open Orphan? Surely global governments have more buying power than any global Apple, Amazon type business. Hell fire, do they deserve this opportunity!\n\nThank you for reading.

        "selftext": "#**Sector and Industry**\n\nThe communication services sector has seen annual [earnings growth of 19.63%]( https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=sector&amp;v=152&amp;o=-eps5years&amp;c=0,1,11) in the past five years. This makes the sector second only to the consumer cyclical sector in earnings growth. Notably, the consumer cyclical sector includes Yum Brands ([YUM](https://www.vhinny.com/display/YUM)), Amazon ([AMZN]( https://www.vhinny.com/display/AMZN)), and Acushnet ([GOLF](https://www.vhinny.com/display/GOLF)).\n\nThe telecommunication services industry is a subset of the broader communication services sector. Telecom companies provide communication solutions through phones, airwaves, cable infrastructure, satellites, and the Internet. The industry has seen stable earnings growth over the past five years. Telephone communication has been the largest historical source of revenue for telecom companies. However, technological advances have proven that future growth will be focused on Internet communication and mobile networks. \n\nTelecom services is [third in EPS growth](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&amp;sg=communicationservices&amp;v=152&amp;o=-eps5years&amp;c=0,1,11) for the last five years, of the communication services industries. Overall, telecom has seen steady earnings growth in recent years but still underperformed its sector.\n\nVerizon is the largest in the industry, with a market cap of $241B compared to AT&amp;T\u2019s $193B. The two companies make up approximately 30% of the industry\u2019s [$1,345B total market cap](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&amp;sg=communicationservices&amp;v=152&amp;o=-perf52w&amp;c=0,1,2).\n\n#**Descriptions**\n\nVerizon and AT&amp;T are both titans in mobile data plans, internet service, and entertainment. AT&amp;T has a larger exposure to entertainment through its [acquisition of Time Warner in 2018]( https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/att-vs-verizon-stock-which-is-a-better-investment). Time Warner was renamed to WarnerMedia and includes Warner Bros., Turner Broadcasting, HBO, CNN, DC Entertainment, Cinemax, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, TBS and TNT. AT&amp;T has famously struggled to retain customers of its DirecTV services and is currently [attempting to sell the division](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/10/att-loses-another-600000-tv-customers-as-it-seeks-buyer-for-directv/). \n\nVerizon has made the notable acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo\u2019s internet division in the past five years. These acquisitions ended in Verizon [writing off a $4.6 billion loss in 2018](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/verizon-takes-4-6-billion-hit-aol-yahoo-n946486) after failed attempts to integrate the two companies. In September, Verizon [acquired Tracfone\u2014a prepaid mobile phone provider](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/verizon-stock-buy-now/). Verizon has since moved away from entertainment and focused on preparing for the adoption of 5G technology. It is still unclear if Verizon will have a competitive edge over competitor T-Mobile in the 5G space.\n\n#**Valuations**\n\nTicker|Company|Mkt Cap|P/E|PEG|Div %|Payout Ratio\n:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:\nVZ|Verizon|$241B|13.24|3.82|4.29%|55.60%\nT|AT&amp;T|$194B|18.06|6.76|7.58%|103.70%\n\nVerizon and AT&amp;T both carry large debt loads; both are part of the top five most indebted companies. Verizon carries $139B in total debt with a current ratio of 1.10 ([read about current ratios here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentratio.asp)). AT&amp;T\u2019s debt situation is much worse with $181B in total debt and a current ratio of 0.80. A current ratio of less than 1 indicates the Company has short-term debts greater than its total assets. \n\nAT&amp;T is considered a dividend aristocrat as the Company has increased its dividend payout for 36 consecutive years. AT&amp;T currently pays a dividend of 7.58%, with a [payout ratio of 103.70%](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;t=T,VZ&amp;c=0,1,2,14,15). The Company\u2019s large debt and unsustainable payout ratio makes it fundamentally undesirable, although it is attempting to cut cash-burning operations such as DirecTV.\n\nVerizon is not yet a dividend aristocrat, with 16 consecutive years of increased dividend payouts. Verizon\u2019s 4.29% dividend yield at a [payout ratio of 55.60%](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;t=T,VZ&amp;c=0,1,2,14,15) is much more sustainable than its competitor. The lower dividend payout ratio has allowed Verizon to invest into 5G technology and pay down debt, while still growing the dividend in a sustainable way.\n\nFundamentally, Verizon trades at both lower P/E and PEG ratios. AT&amp;T has seen annual EPS growth of  [8.90% the past five years, compared to Verizon\u2019s 14.00%](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;t=T,VZ&amp;c=0,1,2,19). Estimated five-year growth for both companies is low, with [Verizon at 2.27% annual growth and AT&amp;T at -1.74%](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;t=T,VZ&amp;c=0,1,2,20). This estimate will likely change as the impact of 5G on Verizon\u2019s revenues becomes clear and AT&amp;T continues [restructuring efforts](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/03/struggling-att-plans-tens-of-billions-in-cost-cuts-more-layoffs/).\n\n#**Conclusion**\n\nPositive catalysts for Verizon include the adoption of 5G and its low debt compared with AT&amp;T. Verizon recently spent [$1.9B in bidding on 5G mmWave spectrum](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-verizon-dish-became-top-spenders-crbs-spectrum-auction-2020-9), on top of other multi-billion 5G investments. [Open signal data]( https://www.opensignal.com/reports/2020/06/usa/mobile-network-experience-5g) from mid-2020 showed Verizon\u2019s average 5G speed beating AT&amp;T's by as much as eight times.\n\nAT&amp;T would benefit from selling their DirecTV division, which would allow focus on the recently launched HBO Max streaming service. However, even selling DirecTV may not be enough for AT&amp;T\u2019s success in the digital streaming space due to intense competition from Disney, Netflix, Apple, and Amazon. Right now, AT&amp;T is limited by their dividend payout ratio and debt.\n\nIn conclusion, Verizon has stronger fundamentals than AT&amp;T and has made key investments that should serve as positive catalysts in the future. AT&amp;T is weighed down by its dividend payment and debt making innovation difficult. Neither company offers a compelling case for growth investors and the telecom industry fits dividend investing ideals better. Those invested into either company can expect less volatility and consistent dividends but also lower gains than the total market.\n\n---\n\nFinancial data was sourced from [Vhinny](https://www.vhinny.com), [Finviz](https://finviz.com/), and [Yahoo Finance]( https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nI hold no position in VZ or T and do not plan to in the near future.",

        "selftext": "After the crash in March, I read lots of talk on here about predictions of a long recovery and how a V shaped recovery wasn\u2019t likely.

        "selftext": "Hey all, \n\nRead through the 10-K filings and figured I would highlight the risk catalysts and manufacturing agreements NIO is currently involved with to give you a better idea of their output forecast and so you can research yourself as to whether or not they can be sustainable: \n\n&gt; We have entered into an arrangement with Jianghuai Automobile Group Co., Ltd., or JAC, for manufacturing the ES8 for five years. In April 2019 and March 2020, we entered manufacturing cooperation agreements with JAC for the manufacture of the ES6 and the EC6, respectively.\n\n---\n\n&gt; The ES8 and ES6 are manufactured in partnership with JAC at its Hefei manufacturing plant. JAC is a major state-owned automobile manufacturer in China and it constructed such Hefei manufacturing plant for the production of the ES8 (with a modified production line for the ES6) and potentially other future vehicles with us.\n\n---\n\n&gt; **we pay JAC for each vehicle produced on a per-vehicle basis monthly for the first three years.**\n\n---\n\n&gt; In addition, for the first 36 months after the start of production, which commenced on April 10, 2018, to the extent the Hefei manufacturing plant incurs any operating losses, we have agreed to compensate JAC for such operating losses. Cooperation after the first 36 months will be subject to further negotiation between the parties.  As of December 31, 2019, we had paid JAC a total of $90,310,656.80, including $49,772,468.20 as compensation for losses incurred in 2018 and 2019 and $40,538,188.60 for manufacturing and processing fees.\n\n---\n\nRisk catalysts mentioned: \n\n&gt; Beginning July 1, 2018, the tariff on imported passenger vehicles (other than those originating in the United States of America) was reduced to 15%. As a result, our pricing advantage could be diminished.\n\n*(In English: The trade war between the US and China is killing any chances of NIO achieving market share in places outside of China.)*\n\n---\n\n&gt; Pursuant to the 2018 Negative List, the limits on foreign ownership of auto manufacturers were lifted in 2018 for NEVs and will be lifted by 2022 for ICE vehicles. As a result, foreign EV competitors could build wholly-owned facilities in China without the need for a domestic joint venture partner. For example, Tesla has started constructing a factory in Shanghai without a joint venture partner. These changes could increase our competition and reduce our pricing advantage.\n\n*(In English: China is incentivizing FDI (Foreign Domestic Investment), which is leading to competition from corps like Tesla who are much more established and have the funds to outpace NIO.)*\n\n---\n\n&gt; We believe that our sales performance of ES8 and ES6 in 2019 was negatively affected by the reduction in the subsidy standard. The current 2020 subsidy standard, effective from April 23, 2020, (i) reduces the base subsidy amount in general by 10% for each NEV, (ii) sets subsidies for 2 million vehicles as the upper limit of annual subsidy scale; and (iii) provides that national subsidy shall only apply to an NEV with the sale price under $44,826.60 or equipped with battery swapping module. Further, the 2021 and the 2022 subsidy standard are expected to be reduced by 20% and 30% respectively as compared to the standard of the immediate preceding year.\n\n*(In English: Less government incentive = lower operating margin = less revenue growth.)* \n\n---\n\n&gt; Our servicing will primarily be carried out through third parties certified by us. Although such servicing partners may have experience in servicing other vehicles, we and such partners have very limited experience in servicing our vehicles. Servicing electric vehicles is different from servicing ICE vehicles and requires specialized skills, including high voltage training and servicing techniques\n\n*(In English: NIO cannot afford to achieve [vertical integration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/verticalintegration.asp) yet and relies heavily on outsourcing to other, much smaller companies to get certain jobs done. Their supplier network is likely to be inefficient at times and falter under macroeconomic headwinds like government intervention (think trade war and tax credits) and covid-19 and this makes NIO's operations all the more compromised.)*\n\n---\n\nSome outside data to look at: \n\n[China Total Vehicle Sales: 1997 - 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/total-vehicle-sales)\n\n*Overall seems incredibly cyclical but in an upward trend over the next 5 years. Long term investors shouldn't worry about demand.* \n\n[China GDP Annual Growth Rate: 1989 - 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/gdp-growth-annual)\n\n*China believe it or not is still considered a developing country which is defined by its high GDP growth rate and low standard of living. It averages 6% a year but due to covid fell harshly. Right now it is sitting at 4% but is expected to return to 6% within the next two years.* \n\n[China Consumer Confidence Index: 1991 - 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/consumer-confidence)\n\n*Consumer confidence forecasts are predicted to rise as the world recovers from covid-19. This in turn can translate to increased spending and economic stimulation (aka more potential demand and orders for NIO vehicles.)*\n\n[China Car Production: 2005-2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/car-production)\n\n*China is set to return to the 25 Million vehicle production milestone it often flirted with over the past decade. Should it overcome the impact on manufacturing from covid and the trade war, it may very well achieve even higher historical output although that is a very optimistic outlook given the current geopolitical situation.*",

        "selftext": "**Biden wins the election, what does this mean for the economy and the stock market, what Buffen\u2019s Berkshire has done in the last quarter and more, let\u2019s talk about everything** \n\nHey everyone and welcome, I am going to react to the latest news from the election, the economy and in the stock market from last week and what to expect next\n\nSo late Saturday the victory of Biden was announced as networks finally started to predict that he won the election. I have no partisan view as i am not a resident or citizen of the US, but i believe that the results of this election (the Biden win and the Republicans keeping the Senate) is the best the stock market could have hoped for, as many experts were predicting a Blue Sweep. There still will be two important runoff elections in Georgia at the beggining of 2021, where the Democrats could still end up winning the Senate. Biden currently has a projected 290 electoras votes but i believe he will also keep the lead in Georgia and end up with 306 electoral votes, the same number as Trump had 4 years ago [VOTE MAP](https://ibb.co/LZ5dnzt) . Important leaders like the German Chancellor, Uk\u2019s prime minister, Canada\u2019s prime minister, France\u2019s president and many more welcomed and congratuled the win of Biden, which seems to be favored internationaly by the world leaders as they were tired of the whipsaw that came with Trump tweeting non-stop. So this probable grid-lock in Congress is loved by the stock market, as there are no iminent tax raises and a stimulus bill is far more likely if not by the end of the Trump mandate surely at the very start of Biden\u2019s.\n\nSo this scenario that is playing out seems to be the most profitable one for wall street as the average annual return since 1933 is about 14% with a Democractic President and a split Congress [Historical CHART](https://ibb.co/SJGP97P)\n\nYesterday Biden also announced how they will try to combat the illness with Better testing and tracing, a increase in PPE production, National guidance for schools, business and families, Investments of 25 bilion in vaccine development and distribution and mask mandates. While also trying to make the higher risk individuals more safe.\n\nP.S. Here\u2019s a funny meme that LeBron James posted with a throwback to his big block of an opponent. [MEME](https://ibb.co/2hmQk6R)\n\nSo all 3 big indices had the best week since early April with the Nasdaq composite being up just over 9% [NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/rpgWtJH), the SP500 was up 7,32% [S&amp;P CHART](https://ibb.co/Ss7FWVN) and the DOW gained almost 7%.[DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/j3bB0P8) The Nasdaq and Sp were flat for the day, pairing loses from the begining of the day while the down fell 0,23% mostly based on profit taking in my opinion.\n\nThere were more companies that were declining on Friday with over 60% of the companies in the red but with a disproportional number of almost 90% of new highs while the volume fell again way below average [MARKET CHART](https://ibb.co/k0kY7Z1) . There weren\u2019t any significant leaders in the market on Friday but energy traield again being more than 2% down [SECTOR CHART](https://ibb.co/VDFksR8) while small caps under-performed the market especialy the value plays.  [CHART](https://ibb.co/9ndqFLC)\n\nThe fear in the market seems to have completly gone away as we have seen another 10% decline in the VIX indicator to drop below 25. [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/8MjSd1f)\n\nHere is a heat map of Friday, you can see this was quite a slow day, not to many green companies but not that big of a red day either. [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/nsCvwVz)\n\nThe US economy added more than 638 thousand jobs [NEWS](https://ibb.co/hDrrTXs) more than 503 thousand that were expected [CHART](https://ibb.co/C6fD3Sh), while the unemployment rate fell to 6,9% way better than the 7,7% expected this is the sixt straight month of jobs recovery.[CHART](https://ibb.co/RBZzdVG) As they seem to be in a big V shape recovery, overall  [V- SHAPE](https://ibb.co/HN6n9dH)\n\nThe market should now turn they\u2019re attention to the samshing of the earnings season amid the election with 2 thirds of the SP500 beating the estimates both the top and bottom line, that is almost double the 38% historical average. \n\nBank of American release a chart for q3 earnings and as you can see earnings have increased 6,7% in the SP500 year over year and 21,5% quarter over quarter. [EARNINGS CHART](https://ibb.co/C6zfWZR)\n\nAnd as the fed announced that it will keep the benchmark rate between 0 and 0,25% [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/vjNy43D)this continues to stimulate the economy of the US, with the fed beeing probably more responsible for the recovery in the last months as stimulus has been staled in congress. Also they continue to have a target of a running inflation of 2% and will continue to buy assests worth around 120 billion dollars montly to pump money in the economy  [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/wBxn56S). If a stimulus bill will eventualy pass, households will probably continue to use the money the same way as last time with over 70% of the money being used for savings and debt payments. But thay may go down a little as people may tend to spend a little more on essentials and non essentials with a better outlook in the near future than last time. [HOUSEHOLD SPENDING](https://ibb.co/dbbKCj6)\n\nHere are some interesting economic events for next weeks as we continue to closely watch how to recovery is going. [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/gMX5XH5)\n\nNvidia saw a pop in the stock finally as they announced that Fornite will join the GeForce gaming cliud, that could mean a return for the game in ios devices with GeForce currently available on Mac,Windows,Android and Chromebooks. The company has almost reteurn to it all time highs after this weeks strong gains. [NVIDIA CHART](https://ibb.co/1qxmphB)\n\nBuffets Berkshire announced on Saturday that they bought back around 9 billion of the company\u2019s stock,bringing the total to around 16 bilion for the year so far.[BUYBACK CHART](https://ibb.co/ysw5bkx) That was around 4 billion more than in the second quarter. the operating earnings also decrease a little since last quarter and are almost 3 billion or 32% less then last year. [BUYBACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/fSWCvdQ)The only segment that improved since last year was Railroad,utilities and enegery, while insurance was the biggest loser.\n\nThe company has almost the same amount of cash and short term investemtns like the previos quarter at around 146 billion dollars with 70% of the investments concentrated in 4 big companies (Apple , Bank of America, Coca-Cola and American Express) up from the 60% these company represented at the end of 2019. [INVESTMENTS](https://ibb.co/Dps2f95)\n\nThe buybacks of the company exced any full year amount in Berkhsire\u2019s history and far exeded the analysts expectation of around 3,2 billion in buybacks. As the strategy for Buffet and Charlie Munger is to buyback the company\u2019s stock as long as they believe it\u2019s undervalued and they will still have ample cash after the buybacks. AS the only other major investments made last quarter were about 6 billion invested in the five big Japenese trading houses and the data storage company Snowflake.\n\nI just saw some interesting news as NetFlix announced they will launch a offering named NetFlix Direct in France that will come with a linear feed of content from Netflix\u2019s library, so the company that is the biggest reasons for the decline of old TV programming made quite a twist as they seek to expand more and more.  [NETFLIX NEWS](https://ibb.co/gWzmKKs)\n\nHere is a list with some of the most important earnings next week, some companies that i like that are reporting are: McDonalds, Datadog, Tencent, Corsair, Purple, Lemonade and DraftKings.

        "selftext": "**Section** **I.  The Election**\n\na.  A Republican Senate:\n\nFirst and foremost, to explain why puts got melted this week, the republican senate was a key component of the bull-run we've seen over the past few days.  When you think of the 2020 US election from the perspective of the major equities in weighted indices (like the SPY), what they were most worried about going into the election was the end of an era of low taxes and deregulation.  Sure, a Biden/Trump win was what people were thinking about most, but in the case of a Biden win, the continuation of a republican senate is what is key in keeping company valuations steady for the next 2 years.  This will keep taxes low, deregulation extended, and new legislation slow to pass.\n\n[Betting Odds for Control of the Senate.  Republicans \\(Red\\) vs Democrats \\(Blue\\).](https://preview.redd.it/1kpa2m0znkx51.png?width=573&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce1d7774d22188467451350a9983150c43f801f8)\n\nShown above are the senate control betting odds as of last night.  They are sitting around 75-25 in favor of the republicans.  If this shifts in the favor of the democrats, we are very likely to see a negative reaction from the markets (though this is unlikely).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb.  The Implications of a Disputed Election:\n\nNow, on the uniqueness of 2020, this is going to be the first election in a long time where a ton of people on both sides are confident that they're winning.  Shown below are the presidential betting odds since right before the start of the election.  You can see that during the first night, Trump's odds nearly hit 80% as all of the initial votes being counted were from in-person voters. \n\n[Presidential Betting Odds Since Nov 2.  Biden \\(Blue\\) vs Trump \\(Red\\).](https://preview.redd.it/wvf1pf2knkx51.png?width=574&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=335e7a06beb2e7efccc6636cb12a3d7661eaf9ed)\n\nThe sudden shift back to Biden (currently around 97% chance to win) from mail-in voters is what he has partly (but not exactly) been citing as evidence for voter fraud, and many of his followers are completely with him on the issue.  Invalidating the results of the election is his last stand, but the impact on equities markets is not going to end once the election is called.  The consequence of the apparent invalidity of the entire electoral process is that there will soon be mass confusion, protests, and other civil conflict and unrest around the country.  \n\nSomething that's worth noting is that **during the Bush v Gore election (2000) which was also contested, equities markets sold off 7-8%** within the weeks following the election.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nc.  Stimulus:\n\nOne final point about the election worth noting is that it has distracted both legislators as well as the general public away from other issues.  One of those issues is the lack of a new stimulus bill from congress; **it is likely that we are going to have to last through the winter until February without a new stimulus bill being passed**.  Trump losing the election will only make him less likely to focus on the issue, as his focus will rather be on taking the best evidence for voter fraud he can find to the Supreme Court.  We may start seeing people defaulting on loans in the middle of the winter, and consequently, we may also start to see small businesses struggling to stay afloat (we will talk about this more when we look at economic data).  On top of this, the initial jobless claims are still sitting around 750,000 people each week (down 7000 from last week); these are people that rely on these stimulus checks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Section II.  Covid-19:  Winter is Coming, Is a Vaccine?**\n\na.  R0 and Cold, Dry Weather:\n\nSo we're headed into the winter months, and one of the other things the election has distracted us all from is the coronavirus.  Its fairly common knowledge that the cold, dry weather of the winter months is primarily responsible for facilitating flu seasons that are worse than they are during any other months of the year.  If you look into some of the early research done on the same topic for Covid, you find exactly what you would expect.  Pictured below are two visuals from a study done in late January in China that aimed to seek the effects of temperature and humidity on the coronavirus.\n\n[A City-Level Visualization of China's Average Temperature from Jan 19 - Feb 10](https://preview.redd.it/pmi8nzd7qkx51.png?width=749&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=116cd149c7322aa0315961682259e7f9bc854e26)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A City-Level Visualization of China's Observed r0 Value of Covid-19 From Jan 19 - Feb 10](https://preview.redd.it/mz2nz9a2qkx51.png?width=820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50583687dd093959ab1c1c388c7bc7a4a0dc4351)\n\nSource: [https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2003/2003.05003.pdf](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2003/2003.05003.pdf)\n\nWhat we see is a fairly **strong correlation between a decrease in temperature and an increase in the observed r0 of the disease**.  Simply, the r0 is just a measure of the contagiousness of a disease.  What we can expect is that during these next few months, Covid is going to reach new highs of contagiousness in the United States.  As we will see below, the current case rates in the US do not seem to set us up for a calm winter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb.  The Data:\n\n[Daily Coronavirus Cases in the United States.  7-Day MA Overlaid in Blue.](https://preview.redd.it/az26jsexmkx51.png?width=692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fce6317132ab8e3275a2550218f2d77d4a959d92)\n\nNow to look into the number of infections, during the first wave of cases in the US, we peaked at around 30,000 daily cases and started trending back down as we entered lockdowns and started social distancing.  **Yesterday, we hit 120,000 cases in a single day**, and this barely broke the news as everyone is still entirely focused on the election.  \n\nThese insanely high case numbers, coupled with the effect on r0 of the winter weather, and possibly coupled with massive gatherings that are soon to come from election protests paint a grim picture for the winter to come.  It's never been a better time to stay inside, but we aren't seeing that sentiment or concern  being expressed from the country as a whole.  It's going to get bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nc.  The Euro Countries:\n\nAs a response to a similar issue, we have seen Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and some other countries instantiate lockdowns to combat their rapidly rising case numbers.  \n\nSource: [https://www.cntraveler.com/story/european-countries-enter-second-lockdowns-as-cases-spike](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/european-countries-enter-second-lockdowns-as-cases-spike)\n\nThis is something that Trump has repeatedly said he would not do, but that's not necessarily the case with Biden; he has simply said that he will follow the science.  Soon enough we are going to start seeing regulation on social gatherings tightening up again.  A solution to stopping the current wave of Covid is unavoidable at this point, once the election news slows down, this is what people are going to be focused on.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nd.  Waiting on a Vaccine:\n\nAt the moment, we have Remdesivir which is able to reduce the infection period of Covid by a few days, but we have yet to discover something that reduces the mortality rate.  Something import to note about the Covid vaccines under development, however, is that **the US government has opted to protect pharmaceutical companies from any lawsuits related to unintended symptoms/damages caused by a vaccine**.  The purpose of doing this is to enable pharmaceutical companies to create a vaccine at a significantly faster pace, but the downside is that people are going to be skeptical of taking it.  It's also very likely that once a vaccine is available, it will be primarily given to high-risk patients as it will be in such a short supply, and it will take months (or possibly even a year) until there is enough supply/distribution underway that it can be given to everyone in the country.\n\nThe takeaway here is that we don't have much to help us get through the winter.  The market's are not going to like another economic slowdown, even if it is significantly smaller than the one we saw back in March/April.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Section III.  The Invisible Economic Data**\n\na.  Banks, Loans, and What They're Telling Us:\n\nOnce again, due to all of the news and drama about the results of the election, something that is being overshadowed is economic data.\n\nTo take a look at some interesting trends, something that should catch your eye is that we are seeing a continuation of banks tightening their lending standards.  In a booming economy with the \"V-Shaped Recovery\" we are always hearing about, this is not something that we would see continuing to rise.  Especially during a time when people are talking about inflation fears, something to note is that banks tightening their lending standards is deflationary.  If people can't take out loans, and there is less money circulating around the economy, the dollar starts to increase in value.\n\n[Percentage of Banks Tightening Their Lending Standards \\(From the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey On Bank Lending Practices\\)](https://preview.redd.it/2uwn3takuox51.png?width=1150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c67d0594ce6f5c4996281475cf72cd0be53d0c09)\n\nShown above, we are seeing around **70% of banks tightening their lending standards to small firms**, and we have not seen this number start to turn around yet.  These levels are comparable to what they were at the peak of the 2008 financial crisis, and what is shows is that the banks, for whatever reason, are **really not comfortable lending money to people right now**.  It should also be noted that typically, when banks tighten their lending standards, long-term treasuries decrease in yield and increase in price.  This is consistent with the fact that banks purchased around $30b in mortgage backed securities this past week alone to make up for their decrease in outgoing loans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb.  Imports and Exports:\n\nTaking a look at US month-over-month imports and exports, what we would expect to see during a V-Shaped recovery are values falling rapidly during the initial shock, and then linearly approaching pre-Covid levels by the end of the recovery.  However, what we can see now is that after imports started to recover rapidly in July and August, **the demand has already started to taper off**.  Similarly, exports still have a long way to recover to reach pre-Covid levels, but we are even seeing export demand taper off.  This is likely due to our main export-countries also struggling to regain their pre-Covid levels of demand.\n\n[US MoM Imports \\(USD\\)](https://preview.redd.it/03sdum9c9px51.png?width=657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a065043f449bb5da971e40940a48e8c2925ff1eb)\n\n[US MoM Exports \\(USD\\)](https://preview.redd.it/0tpsoudeapx51.png?width=659&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e71fc897e2643b99090d295c7ac12f56350a4f3b)\n\nThe key takeaway here is that with rising Covid cases, a typical economic slowdown during winter months, decreasing import and export demand, and tighter lending standards, the economic data does not portray the country as being in a strong position right now.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Section IV.  The Market and The VIX**\n\na.  Nasdaq, SPY, and DOW's Melt-Up:\n\nFinally, to take a look at where the markets are positioned, the S&amp;P 500 has rallied about 6% in the past 5 days, the DOW has rallied about 5.6%, and the Nasdaq has rallied about 7.9%.  This last trading day, we saw each index fail to break through it's current level, which is just about at market all-time-highs for each of them aside from the DOW (which has not yet fully recovered since March).  Today's volume was also significantly less than it was 2 days prior.\n\n[QQQ 3-Month With Volume](https://preview.redd.it/jget31s6epx51.png?width=814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01ccd4903bd0314f83818ed7b0a1488ae40540fc)\n\n[DIA \\(Dow Jones\\) 3-Month With Volume](https://preview.redd.it/hcdavds8epx51.png?width=812&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=939b2795c4812448859c35b0b157b6aeb02a557d)\n\n[SPY 3-Month With Volume](https://preview.redd.it/2qyjkpwaepx51.png?width=819&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ac2b71a8c136e37ef5f97238331388465c3c1ce)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nc.  The VIX:\n\nTaking a look at the VIX we are sitting at an all-time low since the start of Covid.  With so many people going long on vol and puts right before the election and then selling out of their positions once the next two years appeared to be stable due to the likelihood of a republican senate, the VIX has gotten absolutely crushed.  \n\n[VXX 6-Month With Volume](https://preview.redd.it/dcsglrtrepx51.png?width=810&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c00193cc466a62ac0b5ace19262dfb60c5144a71)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:**  Given the incoming political unrest of the country, the lack of stimulus for another several months, relatively persistent jobless claims, a likely increasing contagiousness of Covid coupled with possible social distancing regulations coming back into effect, ATH daily Covid case numbers (still rising), economic slowdown associated with winter months, 08-level tightening of banks' lending standards, tapering and slowing demand for imports and exports in the US, and the huge market rally and volatility crush we have just witnessed, the market seems to be gifting us a volatility trade.\n\nAs for the timing of it, once people look away from the election, once people start protesting the results, once people start focusing on Covid again, and once people take a closer look at the economic data, they will feel a lot less comfortable valuing markets at ATH levels.  These valuations will not last.\n\n**TL;DR of TL;DR:**  Volatility spike is likely.  A long-vol play seems appropriate, it's very cheap.\n\n**Positions:  34x (VXX 11/20 $24C)** \n\nLet me know if I missed anything or if you have any ideas of your own.  I may roll-back the options next week to the 27th to buy some more time.",

        "selftext": "My post [last Sunday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jmbuff/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_this/) where I talk about my positions. [On Wednesday I did a follow up](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jo3up7/4k_in_realized_gains_from_sunday_positions_next/) and discussed why I held some, closed others, and also why I opened up cash-secured-puts on QCOM right before earnings for a $450 pay-day.\n\nKeep in mind I only sell puts and buy shares. I made $4k on putting roughly $80k of collateral down for buying shares if I end up getting assigned. My true profit was about 5% last week with relatively low-risk positions where if they went against me I would bag-hold until profitable. When you are willing to bag-hold for months you literally cannot lose on any position (not financial advice). If you're ready to take your trading to the next level and do some technical ANAL(ysis) with me, then follow along. For those of you that hate money close this thread immediately.\n\nLastly, before I start. This is my game-plan for tomorrow's open. A lot depends on the price action in the morning. If market is down big or flat in the morning it will help me sell puts or buy shares, if we open hulk green then I just may need to wait. I haven't entered any of these positions yet. Normally I don't do this many positions, but it's earnings so its time to YOLO on some theta decay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore we start, when you look at my charts:\n\n**PINK = CHANNEL LINES** where the stock bounces between that range. When a stock exits a channel it either:\n\n1. Comes right back down into the channel or\n\n2. Begins to form a new channel.\n\nYou will never know which option happened until after-the-fact.\n\n**BLUE = SUPPORT OR RESISTANCE LINES**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll positions listed should be expected to expire this Friday the 13th of November. You can always go out further to collect more premium. It all depends on your strategy and what you are comfortable with.\n\n**DDOG - Earnings on Tuesday**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9quq9wx0i3y51.png?width=1964&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91186ec0288bd562ee7a4fc31f96f4de3591efc7\n\nDDOG provides cloud-based services. They shit the bed last earnings and the stock tanked 20% the next day. Am I worried about that happening again? Of course. Do I think it will? No. They are currently trading 10% higher than they were from market-close of their last earnings call. For any of you that have been following the stock, they landed a huge deal with Microsoft and we are about to find out just how much value that contract will bring. For that reason I think it will put a hard floor on where the stock might drop to.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$95p strike for $4.25 premium expiring this week will net you a return of about 4.5%. \n\nBreak-even only reached if stock drops to $90.75.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RKT - Earnings on Tuesday**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1r6vebe2i3y51.png?width=1968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a41d32126ce49e2e91ec8b05af193af5bfd916a\n\nRKT is somewhat of a recent IPO so the stock price is all over the place. What I do see on the chart is some strong support at the $18 and $20 level. The trend is currently down, but it looks like the stock might be reversing and breaking into a new channel through earnings this week. Good earnings will rocket this stock back to $25+, poor earnings we can re-test the $20 level. I like the upside on this one relative to what the downside might be. I'll be selling puts here.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$20p strike for $0.75 premium will have a return of 3.75%\n\nBreak-even is reached if the stock drops below $19.25\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RVLV - Earnings on Wednesday**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dx4hk495i3y51.png?width=1954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e262fb8fd220ac069fb0b822e6b2030c88392ec9\n\nRevolve crushed earnings on their last report and the stock went up 25%. You can see the stock has been trading in channel (pink lines) and is sitting comfortably somewhere near the high portion of the channel. Each time the stock price exited the channel to the upside it was rejected and pulled right back down. Generally it takes a break-through of the supply zones (resistance) or a big event to exit a channel and form a new trend. If we see some downside from earnings we might get a bounce off the $18 level. I'll be selling some puts there.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$18p for $0.85 premium will have return of $4.7%\n\nBreak-even reached if the stock drops below $17.15\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PTON - Earnings last week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tqfvpvl6i3y51.png?width=1956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f4a5802a15a0769523eee117083da0b6805d19f\n\nPeloton reported earnings last week. Management summarized to us that demand was still very high and they had trouble keeping up with it. Pretty fucking solid. This stock is literally a meme, but I do think it will be bought up on any dips. IV is also pretty high so I'll be selling weekly puts at the $115 or $120 level when I get a chance.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$120p at $2.25 premium for a return of 1.9%, break-even at $117.75\n\n$115p at $1.00 premium for a return of 0.85%, break-even at $114\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**V - Not earnings play**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ppd3x268i3y51.png?width=1836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58093caef63d46861d8751d5ea4826d9c69135f0\n\nVisa is one of the more predictable stocks. The dip to $180 two weeks ago was an early Christmas gift. I didn't draw any channel zones with my magical crayons here because this thing just bounces back and forth between resistance and support zones. V is currently trading at the pinnacle of the resistance line. If it gets rejected expect another dip back to $195 or even $190. If it breaks through we might see a continuation in momentum all the way up to $215. Why? We might see some follow through on last week's move. All the other times it was rejected by $200 from July through August it was on small moves and lower volume.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nIV is low on Visa, personally I would just outright buy the shares here. You can sell the weekly $210 covered call for some extra pocket money. I doubt this will break-through by end of next week and if it does you've already won on your shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pro Tip:** Cash-secured-puts are a much \"safer\" way to make money. There is a misconception about selling higher volume of credit spreads instead of 1 or 2 cash-secured-puts because when you lose on a credit spread you are realizing and accepting the loss. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nListen here folks, we will NEVER accept defeat. We might lose the battle and get assigned some shares of these ultra high-quality stocks, but we will ALWAYS win the war and come out profitable. See how I am aiming here for 1-3% on each of these plays. We are winners baby so lets make that bread.",

        "selftext": " So Friday we saw the stock market down again as the dow fell almost 0,6% percent while the s&amp;p fell over 1% and the nasdaq was crushed being down almost 2and a half percent as This last week we saw the dow fell 6,5% the s&amp;p 5,6% and the nasdaq 5,5% as all 3 ended the month of october down more than 2,3%\n\nOne good thing for the US economy is that the retail stores sales has recovered and consumers are still spending excess cash especially with the holidays and black Friday up next. I believe that as much as Tuesday is important for the economy, the events that will come later in the week as the FED holds two important meatings and the latest jobs report comes in at the end of the week far outweight that\n\nAs you can see the New York Federal bank economic index is still rising, that sugests a V-Shaped recovery is continuing in the US. This index takes into consideration lots of important data from the economy.\n\nThe unemployment in the US has been decling but that rate has sharply slowed down in the last months as it\u2019s still more than double the 3,5% at the start of the year as the latest number from September was almost 8% rate of unemployment.\n\nAs you can see the most affected people are still the middle and low wage under 60k/year. As the high wage jobs unemployment rate is barely down 0,5% since January.\n\nSo the fear in the stock market saw a huge pop in the last week as the VIX (the volatility index) rose from 27,55 more than 10 points to close at over 38 this last week. This next week is probably the last with such high volatility as the upcoming big events will pass and more certainty will be in front of us . The volatility was so high as we retested the June highs and have seen a pullback 3 times after hiting those levels.\n\nDespite strong earnings last week from all big tech companies (Alphabet,Amazon,Apple, facebook and Microsoft) the companies stocks dropped amid the broader stock market sell-off with the exception of Google which posted terrific numbers to crush analysts expectation.\n\nApple is down almost 19% since the highs of September and has lost 450 billion dollars in market cap since then.\n\nThis dropped in the company has been caused by a broader stock market sell off as well as missed iphone revenues. I do believe that iphone revenues will see a huge spike in the next coming quarters as apple customers as myself will finally upgrade from older iphone to this next generation iphone which is the first to have 5G technology as well as other great improvements in capability as well as camera.\n\nA couple analysts have recently changed they\u2019re target to between 132-140 which is over 20$ from where it sit\u2019s today. That is quite good upside for the company.\n\nAs you can see they are barely down 2,7% year over year in product revenue despite not having the new iphone launch included in this financials, and overall the company still saw a 1% increase in revenue due to the huge spike in services revenue that I believe will continue especially with the Apple One bundle just being launched at the end of last week. The Total Gross margin also increase slightly but I expect this to be just a small drawback in the short-term.\n\nAlso I believe that Amazon was dragged down because of the next quarter predictions of huge costs while they only forecasted a operating income of 1 to 4 point 5 billion dollars which is below what was anticipated despite amazon web services continuing to be the largest player in cloud spending. With a 32% share of total market and a revenue of 11,6 billion dollars which Is up 29% year over year, while Azure from Microsoft comes in second and google cloud in third. There is still a lot of room to grow for all of this companies as there is still over 37% of the market provided by other companies. Also this is a great company to own for the long term as digitazation and online commerce will continue to grow, some are estimating that by 2030 amazon could have annual revenues of 1 trillion dollars $ while using conservative projections of compound annual growth for e-commerce of 10%, for the cloud services of 15% and for ad revenue of 20%, amazon could hit that mark by then. But I believe this is possible even faster than that.\n\nFacebook is the one company that I will have to analyze more in this group. They will be hit with privacy issues do to the regulatory risk and Apple\u2019s announced privacy changes. But I still do believe this to be a great company as they also own Instagram, and I really like how that part of the company is innovating and growing.\n\nWhile google seems to be back on track as the company was the laggard in the group. They have become less reliant on the search ad revenue as growth in Youtube ads and Google cloud will push the company to renewed growth in the future.\n\nAlibaba will see two big events this week as they will kick off the singles day event next week, extending the event with 3 more days rather than the usual 24-hour event, in which they will also double the products on offer. Also another big event will be the IPO of ant Group in which Alibaba will still have a big stake. I believe they are a great company the forward revenue growth estimates of 31% are higher than other tech companies like amazon, google and Microsoft while the P/E for the company is the most attractive of the group also.\n\nFord just announced that late next year they will introduce a lower priced competitor for Tesla AutoPilot and GM\u2019s super cruise, this is great news for the company as they seem to be improving the company continuasly.\n\nSome important earnings coming this week are :\n\nPaypal on Monday, which I believe is the greatest fin-tech company, on\n\nWednesday Qualcomm will announce that will be a great insight to see what Apple\u2019s iphone 12 is doing as Qualcomm is the biggest supplier for apple and on Thursday Alibaba (with ant group ipo) coming also on the same day this stock could see a surge in value.",

        "selftext": "So we have a [**free twitter bot**](https://twitter.com/TradyticsAIbot) that posts intraday alerts for options contracts. They've been quite successful, so I thought why not share them here too with more explanation and my own thoughts. There are no strings attached, it's a free bot that you can follow on twitter. We had some huge winners last week with [500% gains on $NFLX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdeKyIXUF4), [400% on $SPY](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-Ky2Hn-O9kyo-LYyf4-R6KOj-Aslkb), and plenty more. Twitter page has everything detailed.\n\n# $BABA\n\n**Alert:** Buy $310 Call with Expiration 2-3 Weeks Away\n\nBABA has a good price action right now with [support at around $300](https://www.tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=BABA). With all the volatility this week, it's better to go with contracts where you have a tight stop loss. If this breaks support, you'll know to exit immediately.\n\n# $AMZN\n\n[**Alert:**](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-lVtkD-wzJ59-Ig64T-O9Iiq-uS47P) Buy $3500 Call with Expiration 1 Week Away\n\nAMZN dipped hard as did plenty of other tech stocks. However, our bot gave tons of CALL alerts. When that happens, there's a reversal coming the next day. This alert did not work on Friday, but I am expecting this to pan out in the next 1-2 days.\n\n# $TWTR\n\n[**Alert:**](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-d03l5-HXntU-unLMV-M6GDV-kFnc7) Buy $55 Call with Expiration January 15, 2021\n\nAgain, this one is seems like a safe bet considering how much TWTR dipped on Friday. The fact that the price stopped right at the support gives me more confidence. ([https://i.imgur.com/yZgsc9i.png](https://i.imgur.com/yZgsc9i.png)). Also, market tends to fill gaps and there is a huge gap up which needs filling. Given that this alert is far off in the future, it seems like an excellent one. Will keep an eye on this one.\n\n# Miscellaneous\n\nThere were tons of tech CALL alerts on Friday which makes me think tech might go up for atleast a day tomorrow. If you see any bullish signs, you can also try the following contracts:\n\n**$NFLX:** Go one or two weeks ahead from the expiration date of this alert since this one has already expired: [https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-3GH9w-uOIyX-Jnx0P-xx6As-9t28w](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-3GH9w-uOIyX-Jnx0P-xx6As-9t28w)\n\n**$CCL, NCLH, RCL:** They usually move opposite to the market and went up quite a bit on Friday. Since PUTs are not that costly, go out 2-3 months and buy PUTs,\n\n# Risk Management\n\nIf you buy some of these contracts, **hedge them with an SQQQ or** [**VXX Call**](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-tpoCB-2BxBJ-P7hS0-PrJI9-vUMzG) just to stay safe. You'll find a few alerts on SQQQ Calls on the twitter bot. Stay safe everyone!\n\nLet me know your thoughts!",

How did this historically struggling industry become a top performer during the COVID-19 Pandemic? The answer is seen in the massive gains electric vehicle stocks have seen. The best performers of the past year are NIO at 1911% gains, TSLA at 540% gains, WKHS at 492% gains, and GP at 377% gains.\n\nThe valuation of EV companies has been controversial, with many institutional investors believing EV valuations are unreasonable. Furthermore, the rise of SPACs has provided zero revenue companies easy access to investors, most notably Nikola Corporation.

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: I'm a BAM shareholder with about 15% of my portfolio.\n\nGreat interview two days ago from one of the great asset managers of all time (IMO): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PXxqCc24q4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PXxqCc24q4)\n\nSince March I rotated into 80% tech stocks (QQQ, ARK, some individual picks). However, I still kept holding my BAM shares. Bruce Flatt is a legendary value investor.\n\nIn this interview he says a number of interesting things:\n\n\\- BAM has up to $80B in dry powder and will look for distressed opportunities over the next 18 months\n\n\\- He thinks retail is going through a consolidation, but that strong will get stronger. They want to own the best mall in any given city, and its likely that the bottom half of malls will be bulldozed.\n\n\\- Bullish on return to office (boomer comment from him IMO)\n\n\\- Very interesting: Thinks that real estate prices should be 1.5x - 2x now due to the low interest rate environment, and this is starting to happen for BAM. But he also thinks people aren't quite comfortable doing these transactions yet and things are trading at big discounts\n\nI really agree with him on the last comment. Bruce Flatt knows how to smell a good deal. Buying Real Estate may be the best value opportunity in the market today.\n\nI'm primarily (80%) invested in tech (QQQ/ARK/individual picks). But I have been building up some dry powder since August or so, since values got out of hand.\n\nAs a complete side note, I went to a \"top\" mall today to go to the Apple Store. The mall was absolutely packed.\n\nDoes anyone else agree? Are public REITs currently a deep value opportunity?",

        "selftext": "Hello value investing community,  \n\nI hope you had a great weekend!\n\nI think it is fair to say that Twitter is THE most powerful news, learning, and curation tool in the world. And as an investor, it is your responsibility to constantly look for opportunities, to be informed about current events, and to expand your mental models. Everybody wants to gain an edge in the markets and Twitter might be the tool that allows you to get access to information that you would otherwise not have considered in your investment process.\n\nBut who are the most important people for investors to follow on Twitter? I think that for Twitter to unfold its full potential, it\u2019s important to keep your Twitter feed clean and learn and so it is important that you only follow quality people.\n\nI have just released a video on this subject and mention four Twitter accounts that every value investor should follow. But obviously, this list is far from exhaustive and I wanted to ask you if you have any additional recommendations? Maybe you can share a brief summary of what this account is recognized for.  \n\nBest regards\n\nRene\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhw7Dn5aUWw&amp;feature=youtu.be",

It\u2019s a great concept and has delivered exceptional returns in the past \u2013 23% annually (1988-2005). Personally, I think it is a great screening tool to generate investment ideas! \n\nWell, I recently came across an interesting chart provided by the AAII that showed the performance of the magic formula ever since Greenblatt\u2019s book \u201cThe Little Book That beats The market\u201d was published. I was quite surprised by the recent performance of the Magic Formula strategy \u2013 a drop from 23% annually (1988-2005) to 6% (2005-2019) is quite significant!\n\n[https://www.aaii.com/stockideas/performance](https://www.aaii.com/stockideas/performance)?\n\nWhat do you think caused this drop?

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 9th, 2020.\n\n# **After sharp bounce, market may take a \u2018breather\u2019 on lingering election uncertainty, virus outbreak  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/06/after-sharp-bounce-market-may-take-a-breather-on-lingering-election-uncertainty-virus-outbreak.html)**\n*****\n&gt; After an initially exuberant election reaction, stocks may trade more cautiously in the week ahead, as investors watch election developments unfold and track the course of the coronavirus. \n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up more than 7.3% in the past week, at 3,509, and the Nasdaq rose 9%, the best weekly performance since April. Stocks slid Friday, but technology, communications services, health care and discretionary stocks had the biggest gains for the week, after it appeared Democrat Joe Biden could be the next president but with a split Congress.\n*****\n&gt; The election was still unresolved heading into the weekend, but even if Biden is declared winner, close votes and lawsuits are likely to result in recounts. The Senate appeared to be in Republican hands, but the margin of control is likely to be tight, and runoff elections are required for two Senate seats in Georgia in early January.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the uncertainty is going to catch up the market on a short-term basis,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, BNY Mellon\u2019s Wealth Management chief investment officer. \u201cPerhaps next week could be a drifting lower kind of week.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ahead of the election, the market had been betting on a \u201cblue wave,\u201d where Biden would take the White House and Democrats would get control of the Senate, giving them total control of Congress. But when it appeared the Senate would stay in Republican hands, stocks surged on the idea of gridlock, which would keep Biden from implementing tax increases and lots of new regulations.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, there has been a surge in daily new coronavirus cases to more than 122,000. Economists are concerned that the economic recovery could suffer as some states could restrict activities and consumers may pull back heading into the important holiday season.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed, in its post-meeting statement Thursday, repeated that the course of the virus could help determine the path of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; There are a few economic reports in the week ahead, including consumer price index inflation data Thursday and the producer price index Friday. More than a dozen Fed officials are on the speaking circuit, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who speaks Thursday on central banking at a European Central Bank forum.\n*****\n&gt; The earnings season is beginning to slow down, but there are still dozens of reports, including from McDonald\u2019s on Monday and Walt Disney, Applied Materials and Cisco on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is just setting up to be a breather. There\u2019s still a lot to figure out here,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cThe equity market\u2019s reaction has been I think understandable and probably better than many might have expected.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said there may be uncertainty for awhile. \u201cWhat I\u2019m thinking about is the Senate races. Part of the market reaction has been relying on this divided government.\u201d After the votes are all in or recounted, \u201ca sweep is unlikely but possible.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the longer this stays uncertain and messy, the more the post-election bounce comes into question,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Different than 2000\n&gt; It would not be unusual for the stock market to sell off before rallying into year end, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall does not expect the type of turbulence there was in 2000, when former Vice President Al Gore lost to George W. Bush in a tight race that ultimately went to the Supreme Court.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn 2000, they were not expecting hanging chads. But they do expect a contested election this time. I think in many ways the market anticipated this,\u201d said Stovall.\n*****\n&gt; But the market, after its election week surge, could pull back. \u201cHistorically, the market goes down in the month of November, after a Democratic victory,\u201d said Stovall. Since World War II, Democrats won the White House nine times, and the market fell an average of 0.5% in November in those years, compared to the average gain for all Novembers of 1.4%, he said.\n*****\n&gt; After those Democratic victories, stocks then rose 1.9% in December on average, more than the normal 1.5% gain for all Decembers.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said they currently do not expect the kind of lockdowns that states ordered when the pandemic started to spread in March. But there could still be some impact that could be negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said he sees some signs of optimism for the market. Strong data, like third quarter GDP, October\u2019s drop in unemployment to 6.9%, and the better-than-expected earnings are all positives for the market. Another is that investors are so skeptical.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat does still exist is a great deal of dry powder. There\u2019s $4.3 trillion in money markets alone,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you, being in touch with investors of all shapes and sizes this week, there\u2019s still a lot of skepticism. From a contrarian view, high cash and a lot of skepticism is a contrarian indicator.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/WUlRQfd.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/FWN82Hs.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ZnTzBNz.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/g52vqsv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OiPuXi8.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lA86Kou.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xmtVSEB.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RRxlWej.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/W80POso.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eGUQXgr.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yoHWfIC.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hQyweyw.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Presidential Election Anticipation Is Keeping Us Waiting\n\n&gt; While we all anxiously await the final count and outcome of the U.S. Presidential Election, here are some possible scenarios for 2021. Our analysis here is based on historical market performance during the most likely political alignments for next year. We ran these likely scenarios through the Almanac database software to create this graph.\n\n&gt; We are either going to have the fifth year of a two-term republican president or a first year of a new democratic presidency. It appears the democrats will hold the house and the republicans will hold the senate, but that is not a forgone conclusion either. So we also examined both presidential outcomes with a democratic, republican and split congress.\n\n&gt; Our study uses the S&amp;P 500 from 1949 to 2017. We start in 1949 because it is the first full 4-Year Presidential Stock Market Cycle since the end of WWII. The Twenty-Second Amendment that implemented presidential term limits for a max of two terms or eight years was ratified on February 27, 1951. Truman in 1949 was excluded as there was a no change of party in the White House. We gave Bush 41 the same treatment.\n\n&gt; Admittedly, there are limited data points; four each of fifth year republicans and first year democrats. Here\u2019s what we found. A change in party with a new, first year democratic president came with democratic control of Congress and significantly higher performance for the S&amp;P 500, averaging 10.6% with a median gain of 15.1% versus 7.0% for the average post-election year since 1949.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a89421df75f426e1b1ff90cb2c29cb90/b63e1cf962f89fdb-a3/s400x600/f9bde99a9e4ba83b0df266a8d3cc04cd732cc58f.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Fifth year republican presidents in 1957 (Eisenhower) and 1973 (Nixon) had to work with democratically controlled Congresses and the market suffered significant losses. The market did well in Reagan\u2019s fifth year with a split Congress \u2013 a testament to how \u201cThe Great Communicator\u201d was able to work across the aisle with then Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill. Even with republican control of Congress under Bush 43\u2019s fifth year, the market had a tough year with ongoing issues in Iraq, North Korea declaring it\u2019s a nuclear power and the most active and second costliest hurricane season on record.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Job Growth Continues as COVID-19 Cases Rise\n\n&gt; The US labor market shrugged off election uncertainty and continued to add jobs in October. Despite the waning effects of fiscal stimulus and rising COVID-19 cases, per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added 638,000 jobs, ahead of Bloomberg survey estimates calling for 580,000. The headline number was depressed by a 268,000 drop in government employment, including 147,000 temporary census workers. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell from 7.9% to 6.9% despite a rise in the labor force participation rate, a reversal of the dynamic we saw in September when unemployment fell while the labor force participation also declined.\n\n&gt; However, a troubling trend remains beneath the surface. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the number of long-term unemployed\u2014those out of work for 27 weeks or longer\u2014continues to rise as a share of the total unemployed:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11.6.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWhile the labor market has continued to show improvement, there are still many people out there who are having a hard time getting back to work,\u201d noted LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWith total jobs in the US around 10 million below pre-pandemic levels and rising COVID-19 cases, there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement despite the declining unemployment rate.\u201d\n\n&gt; COVID-19 cases in the United States have reached record highs with a weekly trend growth rate above 20%, according to the COVID Tracking Project. As the weather cools and more activity shifts indoors, additional restrictions to limit the spread of the virus could slow the fragile labor market recovery.\n\n&gt; In particular, much of the private sector gains in this month\u2019s jobs report were in the services sector, where previous jobs reports had shown strength in goods-oriented industries. Many countries in Europe have reinstated restrictions or even gone as far as implementing new lockdowns. While we don\u2019t expect lockdowns in the United States like we saw in March, restrictions on activity could limit future job gains.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One Sentiment Survey Soars While Another Sinks\n\n&gt; In an earlier post, we discussed how bullish sentiment in the AAII survey has been on the rise, but looking at another weekly sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence, the opposite is true. The percentage of respondents reporting as bullish fell sharply this week, 7 percentage points, down to 53.6%. While a majority are still optimistic and that reading is in the middle of its range, that was the largest weekly decline since a 7.4 percentage point decline to 41.7% in the first week of March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, the percentage of newsletter writers that are \"looking for a correction\" rose sharply to 25.8% this week following last week's over 5% decline for the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Correction.png))**\n\n&gt; The Investors Intelligence survey has a long history dating back to 1963, and in all weeks in that time, only 5% (174 weeks) have seen bullish sentiment fall 5 percentage points or more while the percentage of respondents looking for a correction has risen at least 5 percentage points in the same week. In the chart below, we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 following these past occurrences when there has not been another in the prior 3 months. The S&amp;P 500 has frequently been higher over the following weeks and months, but there is a slight underperformance relative to all periods since 1963 when the survey begins.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Performance.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2 Post-Election Charts You Need to See\n\n&gt; The election is over, but the questions are mounting. We don\u2019t know who will be the next president as of Wednesday morning, but we do know that stocks tend to do well the final two months of an election year. \u201cOnce the uncertainty is over, stocks tend to rally in November and December, with November the best month of the year during an election year,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOf course, 2020 isn\u2019t like any other year, and we still could be a ways away from who the winner will be.\u201d\n\n&gt; The LPL Chart of the Day shows that the S&amp;P 500 Index tends to do very well the final two months of the year, especially during election years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The modern design of the S&amp;P 500 stock index was first launched in 1957. Performance back to 1928 incorporates the performance of predecessor index, the S&amp;P 90\n\n&gt; One of the big takeaways so far from Tuesday night is that the Senate likely will stay Republican, meaning we may have a divided Congress. The chances of higher taxes and more regulation likely took a hit under this scenario. This could be a nice tailwind for stocks, as the S&amp;P 500 historically has done quite well under a divided Congress, up more than 17% on average. Additionally, in years with a divided Congress, stocks have been higher the past 10 times, with 2020 potentially being the 11th in a row.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-2-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; This election is far from over, so stay tuned to LPL Research as we continue to monitor things!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Emerging Markets Cheering a Potential Biden Win\n\n&gt; The US equity market has seen a massive rally in reaction to what is looking like a Biden victory over President Trump coupled with the Republican party maintianing its majority in the US Senate. None of these results are official at this point, so they are subject to change, but these are the most likely scenarios as of now. Outside of the US, emerging markets have also rallied. In just the last two days, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF (EEM) has rallied 5% and broken above resistance to new 52-week highs. If for no other reason then Biden's campaign slogan isn't America First, the rationale behind the rally makes some sense.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-Now.png))**\n\n&gt; The reaction of EEM in the aftermath of this election is very much different from what happened in 2016. Heading into the 2016 election, EEM had been trending higher, but pulled back in the days leading up to the election and broke its uptrend that had been in place since earlier in the year. Again, Trump's America First approach was understandably viewed as a headwind to emerging market equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-labels.png))**\n\n&gt; While the initial reaction of EEM to Trump's election was negative, that weakness didn't last long. The chart below shows the performance of EEM in the two months before and one year after the 2016 election. The gray box represents the same period shown in the chart above. Within days after breaking its uptrend after the 2016 election, EEM bounced back, rallied to its 50-DMA, tested its November low, and then in the early days of 2017 it was off to the races as EEM. In fact, even accounting for the post-Election Day declines, one year after the 2016 election, EEM was up 25% which was actually more than the 21% return for the S&amp;P 500! The moral of the story here is that first reactions aren't always the right reactions, and as an investor it's not just imperative to know the environment you are operating in, but also when the tides are turning.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-2017.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Winners and Losers During Trump's Presidency\n\n&gt; With Election Day upon us, below we take a look at the biggest winners and losers across financial markets during the Trump Presidency from Election Day 2016 through today. First off, below is a chart of the market cap of the Russell 3,000 since Election Day 2000 which George W. Bush eventually won. The Russell 3,000 makes up more than 98% of the total US equity market cap, so it's a good gauge to use for measuring the overall change in market cap levels. The current market cap of the Russell 1000 is just north of $35 trillion, which is up $11.5 trillion since Election Day 2016. President Obama oversaw US market cap growth of $12.3 trillion over his two terms, while President Bush actually saw market cap decline by $4.1 trillion after his two terms.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/mktcap.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a look at the total return of various asset classes since Election Day 2016 using key ETFs listed on US exchanges. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is up 70.6% since Trump was elected, while the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) more than doubled that at +144.3%. Of the broad index ETFs in the matrix, the Smallcap Value ETF (IJS) is up the least since Election Day 2016 at just +17.2%.\n\n&gt; Looking at US sector ETFs, the Energy sector (XLE) is a huge outlier with a decline of 48.3% since Trump was elected. Technology (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) are up the most with gains of 154% and 97%, respectively.\n\n&gt; Along with Energy stocks, the oil (USO) and natural gas (UNG) ETFs have been more than cut in half since 11/8/16, while gold (GLD) is up 47% and silver is up 29.5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/assetclass1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Not every country has seen stock market gains since Trump was elected. As shown below, Mexico (EWW) is down 28.5%, Brazil (EWZ) is down 19.4%, Spain (EWP) is down 6.8%, and the UK (EWU) is just slightly in the red.\n\n&gt; The US (SPY) is up more than any other country with a gain of 70.6%, while China (ASHR) is up the second most at +51%. Whatever happened with the trade war certainly didn't hurt the US and China versus the rest of the world on a relative basis.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/countryreturns1103.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/sectors1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Within the Russell 1,000 in its current form, there are nine stocks that are up 1,000% or more since Election Day 2016, with Enphase Energy (ENPH) at the top with a gain of 8,590%. Trade Desk (TTD) is up the second most at +2,448%, followed by Novocure (NVCR), SolarEdge Tech (SEDG), and Quidel (QDEL). Square (SQ) ranks sixth with a gain of 1,203%. Other notables on the list of big winners since Trump was elected include Etsy (ETSY), Teladoc (TDOC), Tesla (TSLA), NVIDIA (NVDA), Atlassian (TEAM), Boston Beer (SAM), and Lululemon (LULU).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-since-2016.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of market cap gains for individual stocks, the numbers below are quite eye-popping. Apple (AAPL) has gained the most in market cap since Trump was elected with an increase of $1.257 trillion! Amazingly, both Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have added more than $1 trillion in market cap as well. Prior to the last few years, no company was even close to having a $1 trillion market cap, but at this point, AAPL, AMZN, and MSFT have gained that much in the last four years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/capuse.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 6th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ5sT7SXYTk))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.8.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/gziesWx.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Yme9cXS.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/a6Kp4iF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XOR4bP6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TfDOPZJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/OsrCLIc.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/N7Ibl9s.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/y4tBaZw.png))\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wVnvQZH.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9PnmIUs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uoiA0Bw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",

        "selftext": "**Biden wins the election, what does this mean for the economy and the stock market, what Buffen\u2019s Berkshire has done in the last quarter and more, let\u2019s talk about everything** \n\nHey everyone and welcome, I am going to react to the latest news from the election, the economy and in the stock market from last week and what to expect next\n\nSo late Saturday the victory of Biden was announced as networks finally started to predict that he won the election. I have no partisan view as i am not a resident or citizen of the US, but i believe that the results of this election (the Biden win and the Republicans keeping the Senate) is the best the stock market could have hoped for, as many experts were predicting a Blue Sweep. There still will be two important runoff elections in Georgia at the beggining of 2021, where the Democrats could still end up winning the Senate. Biden currently has a projected 290 electoras votes but i believe he will also keep the lead in Georgia and end up with 306 electoral votes, the same number as Trump had 4 years ago [VOTE MAP](https://ibb.co/LZ5dnzt) . Important leaders like the German Chancellor, Uk\u2019s prime minister, Canada\u2019s prime minister, France\u2019s president and many more welcomed and congratuled the win of Biden, which seems to be favored internationaly by the world leaders as they were tired of the whipsaw that came with Trump tweeting non-stop. So this probable grid-lock in Congress is loved by the stock market, as there are no iminent tax raises and a stimulus bill is far more likely if not by the end of the Trump mandate surely at the very start of Biden\u2019s.\n\nSo this scenario that is playing out seems to be the most profitable one for wall street as the average annual return since 1933 is about 14% with a Democractic President and a split Congress [Historical CHART](https://ibb.co/SJGP97P)\n\nYesterday Biden also announced how they will try to combat the illness with Better testing and tracing, a increase in PPE production, National guidance for schools, business and families, Investments of 25 bilion in vaccine development and distribution and mask mandates. While also trying to make the higher risk individuals more safe.\n\nP.S. Here\u2019s a funny meme that LeBron James posted with a throwback to his big block of an opponent. [MEME](https://ibb.co/2hmQk6R)\n\nSo all 3 big indices had the best week since early April with the Nasdaq composite being up just over 9% [NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/rpgWtJH), the SP500 was up 7,32% [S&amp;P CHART](https://ibb.co/Ss7FWVN) and the DOW gained almost 7%.[DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/j3bB0P8) The Nasdaq and Sp were flat for the day, pairing loses from the begining of the day while the down fell 0,23% mostly based on profit taking in my opinion.\n\nThere were more companies that were declining on Friday with over 60% of the companies in the red but with a disproportional number of almost 90% of new highs while the volume fell again way below average [MARKET CHART](https://ibb.co/k0kY7Z1) . There weren\u2019t any significant leaders in the market on Friday but energy traield again being more than 2% down [SECTOR CHART](https://ibb.co/VDFksR8) while small caps under-performed the market especialy the value plays.  [CHART](https://ibb.co/9ndqFLC)\n\nThe fear in the market seems to have completly gone away as we have seen another 10% decline in the VIX indicator to drop below 25. [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/8MjSd1f)\n\nHere is a heat map of Friday, you can see this was quite a slow day, not to many green companies but not that big of a red day either. [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/nsCvwVz)\n\nThe US economy added more than 638 thousand jobs [NEWS](https://ibb.co/hDrrTXs) more than 503 thousand that were expected [CHART](https://ibb.co/C6fD3Sh), while the unemployment rate fell to 6,9% way better than the 7,7% expected this is the sixt straight month of jobs recovery.[CHART](https://ibb.co/RBZzdVG) As they seem to be in a big V shape recovery, overall  [V- SHAPE](https://ibb.co/HN6n9dH)\n\nThe market should now turn they\u2019re attention to the samshing of the earnings season amid the election with 2 thirds of the SP500 beating the estimates both the top and bottom line, that is almost double the 38% historical average. \n\nBank of American release a chart for q3 earnings and as you can see earnings have increased 6,7% in the SP500 year over year and 21,5% quarter over quarter. [EARNINGS CHART](https://ibb.co/C6zfWZR)\n\nAnd as the fed announced that it will keep the benchmark rate between 0 and 0,25% [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/vjNy43D)this continues to stimulate the economy of the US, with the fed beeing probably more responsible for the recovery in the last months as stimulus has been staled in congress. Also they continue to have a target of a running inflation of 2% and will continue to buy assests worth around 120 billion dollars montly to pump money in the economy  [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/wBxn56S). If a stimulus bill will eventualy pass, households will probably continue to use the money the same way as last time with over 70% of the money being used for savings and debt payments. But thay may go down a little as people may tend to spend a little more on essentials and non essentials with a better outlook in the near future than last time. [HOUSEHOLD SPENDING](https://ibb.co/dbbKCj6)\n\nHere are some interesting economic events for next weeks as we continue to closely watch how to recovery is going. [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/gMX5XH5)\n\nNvidia saw a pop in the stock finally as they announced that Fornite will join the GeForce gaming cliud, that could mean a return for the game in ios devices with GeForce currently available on Mac,Windows,Android and Chromebooks. The company has almost reteurn to it all time highs after this weeks strong gains. [NVIDIA CHART](https://ibb.co/1qxmphB)\n\nBuffets Berkshire announced on Saturday that they bought back around 9 billion of the company\u2019s stock,bringing the total to around 16 bilion for the year so far.[BUYBACK CHART](https://ibb.co/ysw5bkx) That was around 4 billion more than in the second quarter. the operating earnings also decrease a little since last quarter and are almost 3 billion or 32% less then last year. [BUYBACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/fSWCvdQ)The only segment that improved since last year was Railroad,utilities and enegery, while insurance was the biggest loser.\n\nThe company has almost the same amount of cash and short term investemtns like the previos quarter at around 146 billion dollars with 70% of the investments concentrated in 4 big companies (Apple , Bank of America, Coca-Cola and American Express) up from the 60% these company represented at the end of 2019. [INVESTMENTS](https://ibb.co/Dps2f95)\n\nThe buybacks of the company exced any full year amount in Berkhsire\u2019s history and far exeded the analysts expectation of around 3,2 billion in buybacks. As the strategy for Buffet and Charlie Munger is to buyback the company\u2019s stock as long as they believe it\u2019s undervalued and they will still have ample cash after the buybacks. AS the only other major investments made last quarter were about 6 billion invested in the five big Japenese trading houses and the data storage company Snowflake.\n\nI just saw some interesting news as NetFlix announced they will launch a offering named NetFlix Direct in France that will come with a linear feed of content from Netflix\u2019s library, so the company that is the biggest reasons for the decline of old TV programming made quite a twist as they seek to expand more and more.  [NETFLIX NEWS](https://ibb.co/gWzmKKs)\n\nHere is a list with some of the most important earnings next week, some companies that i like that are reporting are: McDonalds, Datadog, Tencent, Corsair, Purple, Lemonade and DraftKings.

        "selftext": "After World War II, a new international monetary system called Bretton Woods was created.\n\nBretton Woods established three main things:\n\n(1) the U.S. dollar was to be an international reserve currency, \n\n(2) the U.S. dollar would be backed by gold at a price of $35 per ounce, and \n\n(3) any country could exchange dollars for gold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCountries running trade surpluses with the US sought to exchange their dollars for gold, and this rapidly shrunk US gold reserves. \n\nThis then led to the so called Nixon shock - President Richard Nixon effectively ending the Bretton Woods system in 1971.\n\nThe world economy entered a new era: the US Dollar became the global reserve currency.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe US made no effort to rein in deficit spending, in fact quite the opposite.\n\nTherefore, the US needed to continue to find ways to sell government debt (i.e. to find buyers of US Treasury Securities) *without* driving up interest rates.\n\nThat is, the US needed more buyers for its debt.\n\nBut by 1974, the enormous flood of dollars from the US into top-oil-exporter Saudi Arabia suggested a solution.\n\nThat year, Nixon sent new US Treasury secretary William Simon to Saudi Arabia with a mission...\n\nThe task: neutralize crude oil as an economic weapon against the US and find a way to persuade a relatively hostile kingdom to finance America's widening deficit with its newfound petrodollar wealth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe basic framework was simple: the US would buy oil from Saudi Arabia and provide the kingdom military aid and equipment.\n\nIn return, the Saudis would plow billions of their petrodollar revenue back into US Treasuries and therefore finance America's spending.\n\nA win-win: the Saudis would receive protection from geopolitical enemies, and the US would get a new place to unload large amounts of government debt.\n\nThis became known as \"petrodollar recycling\".\n\nBy *spending* on oil, the US was creating new demand for US debt and US dollars.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoreover, since Saudi Arabia dominated the OPEC - the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries - this dollar deal was extended to OPEC overall, which meant that the dollar became the preferred currency for oil purchases worldwide.\n\nAnd so the petrodollar era began.\n\nThis petrodollar system has had *massive* implications for US foreign policy, which has essentially involved imposing 'freedom' on any major oil-exporting state that moves towards ending its reliance on dollars.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2000, Saddam Hussein, then-president of Iraq, announced that Iraq was moving to sell its oil in Euros instead of dollars.\n\nFollowing a particular catalyst event in 2001, the US invaded Iraq, deposed Saddam Hussein, and converted Iraqi oil sales back to the US dollar.\n\nOf course, this exact pattern was repeated with Gaddafi when he attempted to create a unified African currency backed by Libyan gold reserves to sell African oil.\n\nShortly after his announcement, rebels armed by the US Government and allies overthrew the dictator and his regime.\n\nAfter his death, the idea that African oil would be sold on something other than the dollar quickly died out.\n\nOther regimes that have called for abandoning the petrodollar include Iran and Venezuela. \n\nThe US has called for regime change in both of these countries...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough they have tried to keep it under wraps, Saudi Arabia is believed to be one of America's largest foreign creditors.\n\nUndoubtedly, Saudi holdings of US debt and other assets are significant.\n\nAll else being equal, the US should be growing less dependent on foreign holders of debt, certainly in terms of Saudi and OPEC-held debt, since the global role of OPEC and the Saudis has been diminishing in terms of global market share.\n\nBut all else *isn't* equal, and the US has been piling on ever-larger amounts of debt in recent years. \n\nIn 2019, for example, the annual deficit topped *one trillion*. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis immense growth in debt obviously makes the US regime more sensitive to changes in demand for US debt, and ever more reliant on foreign demand for both US debt and US dollars. \n\nIn order to avoid a crisis, the US must ensure that interest rates remain low and that foreigners want to acquire both US dollars and US debt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWere petrodollars and petrodollar recycling to disappear, it would have a twofold effect on US government finances: \n\nFirst of all, a sizable decline in petrodollar recycling would put significant *upward* pressure on interest rates. \n\nThe result would be a budget crisis for the US government, as it would have to devote ever-larger amounts of the federal budget to payments on the debt. \n\n(The other option would be to have the US central bank monetize the debt by purchasing ever-larger amounts of it to make up for a lack of foreign demand. But this would lead to growing price inflation.)\n\nFurthermore, if participants began to exit the petrodollar system (and, say, sell oil in euros instead) demand for dollars would drop, exacerbating any scenarios in which the central bank is monetizing the debt.\u00a0 \n\nThis would also generally contribute to greater price inflation, as fewer dollars will be sucked out of the US by foreign holders.\n\nThe result could be ongoing declines in government spending on services, and growing price inflation. \n\nThe US regime's ability to finance its debt would decline significantly, and the US would need to pull back on military commitments, pensions, and more. \n\nEither that, or keep spending at the same rate and face an inflationary spiral.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr...how about another option?\n\nAnyone fancy a Great Reset? \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjK0nRSUNgU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjK0nRSUNgU)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCREDIT: \n\nRyan McMaken\n\n[Huge Debt Got Us Hooked on Petrodollars \u2014 and on Saudi Arabia](https://mises.org/wire/huge-debt-got-us-hooked-petrodollars-%E2%80%94-and-saudi-arabia)",

Visa generated 52% of its volume in the September quarter from debit transactions, compared with 44% for Mastercard MA .\n\nIn normal recessionary times, debit stays strong for a while before a swing back into credit takes place after a few years, Ellis said, but the COVID-19 crisis adds a new dimension. In addition to the cyclical shift toward debit because of the pandemic, there\u2019s also been a step up in cash displacement, which is a secular trend that she expects to continue. Much of that movement from cash to cards seems to be happening through debit.\n\nEllis said that the debit trends are one reason she tilts toward Visa shares over Mastercard\u2019s these days, though she has buy ratings on both names. She\u2019s also upbeat about the company\u2019s Visa Direct platform, which allows for \u201cpush\u201d payments, a popular way for gig economy companies to pay drivers and delivery people.

        "selftext": "I am a known massive proponent for the transaction fintechs, and have written a multitude of posts on them in the last 3 years. Apart from diligent financial analysis and modeling, the largest reason for these massive long positions is Sweden.\n\nSweden is a world leader of digital payments, spawning multiple large fintechs platforms, such as Swish (Sweden domestic only), Klarna (Global payments), and iZettle (PayPal acquisition). As one of the world leaders of fintech, I use what works in Sweden to project into the US.\n\nIn the latest Central Bank (Riksbanken) report, Swish (Swedish Venmo/Cashapp) has surpassed total cash usage. It's used eveywhere, by everyone. Combine this potential future with Cashapp and Venmo (both of which show profitable margins), the potential for Square &amp; PayPal is much larger than is currently priced in. These stocks may look very over valued as of now, if you draw a line between where their e wallets are now to where swish is in Sweden, they have very very far to go.\n\nSQ is especially hot as of this week after a smash earnings, but I have a massive conviction that this isn't the last smash quarter they will have. Over the next 5 years I am extremely confident they will both outperform the market in raw e-wallet growth. For the first time, cash will be monitized by private corporations. You don't want to miss it.\n\nI mostly made this post for people who doesn't know how far e wallets have come in frontiers. In 5 years, cash will be very very close to dead in sweden. In 20, it'll be gone. Someone will profit and perhaps become the visa / Mastercard of the new age. \n\nPs: \"hur durr bitcoin &amp; crypto will deseat fiat currencies\". PayPal and Square are the two largest corporations currently investing heavily into crypto. If the stable cryptocurrencies is part of our fintech future, no large company will profit as much as they.

        "selftext": "\nIn my original cover piece of\u00a0Open Orphan\u00a0(ORPH) on the 30th October 2020 I indicated the company is not a one trick pony play on covid-19. The company has a portfolio of 8 viral challenge study models which are: 2 FLU, 2 RSV, 1 HRV, 1 Asthma, 1 cough and 1 COPD viral challenge models. East London Queen Mary Bio-Enterprise facility is now close to fully booked until the end of 2021. It is the world leader in testing antivirals and vaccines. What makes the company so attractive to the large pharmaceuticals and government agencies is the fact it has the world's largest database for infectious diceases. However, it must be said the Covid-19 part of the business, namely the world's first company to take part in human for the Covid-19 challenge vaccine trial appears to be an area the retail investors is chasing the money. But wait, there is more to Open Orphans as I will explain a little later in the follow-up.\n\n\nIt is worth noting\u00a0no more fundraisers' are expected, the last raise was for \u00a312m in May, of which it still had m of this last week, giving at total of \u00a321.5m plus \u00a310m received on Monday from the UK government, plus \u00a32.5m announced on the 5th November - assuming I have not misheard Cathal's strong Irish accent the company should have somewhere in the region of \u00a334m of cash.\n\n\nWith more \u00a3multi million contract wins anticipated it is likely Open Orphan will offer special dividends to shareholders. I don't believe there are any dilutive share options due in the future to the board. I think Cathal referred to these type of options being granted as theft. I'm not sure I agree with this unless the board are amply renumberated. Thus no liefestyle pay packets for the board, Cathal is on \u00a3140,000 and he is the highest paid member of a well run board.\n\n\nDue to the company's specialist facilities and database which has positioned the company ahead of any other company in the world, which meaning it has become the goto human vaccine challenge company, thus well positioned to become rapid cash-cow, with estimates of \u00a34m worth of contracts each month in Q3, with Q4 looking to accelerate the income stream's which could expand at warp speed if the company has as some of us suspect the unnamed US biotechnology company now partnered by their hVIVO arm are involved with Trumps Warp Speed Project.\n\n\nOperation Warp Speed was introduced in early April 2020, after a round-table meeting with Trump, Pence and industry executives at the White House on March 2. It will promote mass production of multiple vaccines based on preliminary evidence allowing for faster distribution if clinical trials confirm one of the vaccines is safe and effective. As part of the funding the US government has allocated $10 billion for Operation Warp Speed through the\u00a0Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, with $6.5 billion designated by Congress for countermeasure development through\u00a0BARDA, along with $3 billion for\u00a0NIH\u00a0research. For the moment we do not know if Open Orphan is part of this project - For now, Cathal Friel is keeping a tight lip. Imagine how exciting very exciting this project could be for us?\n\n\nProbable M&amp;A Activity (it is no secrete)\n\n\nI will focus on Imutex as this has the most potential in terms of value for shareholders, which I believe will be returned in the form of a dividend. Open Orphan has a 49% owned interest in Imutex - picked up for beans. Earlier this year its hVIVO unit reported successful phase IIb trial of a potential flu vaccine for its FLU-v. This has resulted in a\u00a0joint-venture peer-reviewed article written in a scientific journal. The data from FLU-v 004 challenge study underlined its ability to reduce mild-to-moderate symptoms of the illness. The publication of the results in the periodical ''npj Vaccines'' follows results from a separate field assessment of the drug, which revealed \u201ccellular and humoral immunogenicity\u201d from a single dose of adjuvanted FLU-v.\u00a0Meaning the vaccine immediately provoked an immune response.\n\n\nIf as expected Imutex meetings with FDA regulators in the USA ahead of further trials, this should pique interest from M&amp;A suitors.\n\n\nOpen Orphan chief executive Trevor Phillips: \u201cProgression to larger phase III studies with FLU-v can further describe the cellular immune response and evaluate how the vaccine interacts with influenza disease,\u201d Open Orphan chief executive Trevor Phillips.\n\n\nCEC Cathal Friel: \u201cThe need for better, more broadly protective vaccines against influenza is a high priority worldwide, and few new vaccines have demonstrated efficacy in humans as seen in the results of the challenge study for FLU-v 004. \u201cThis is the first universal influenza vaccine that has shown this protection from influenza and reduction of symptoms\u00a0in late-stage studies and together with the\u00a0highly statistical immune results reported in a peer review article means that the risk of failure in a phase III setting is greatly reduced compared with entering into phase III studies with no efficacy data.\u201d\n\n\nNo doubt revenues are anticipated to grow at pace in the coming months as bed capacity/occupancy increases, if not sooner...probably sooner because the CEO. Cathal Friel is a man on a mission to gets things done. I am sure we all expect news on this front from Holland and the USA soon. All of this I believe to be just c90 per cent of the business if I understand Cathal Friel.\n\n\nIt is fair to say Open Orphan has struck gold with its acquisition of hVIVO shortly followed by the acquisition of CHIMagent for a nominal fee. Leaving aside the relatively poor performance before Open Orphan opportunistic, or should I say insightful vision. Along with VENN, these little beauties have transformed the company in a matter of a few months, moreover, have not proved to be a cash drain on the company, but have fitted into a brilliant strategy almost seamlessly and the bonus, that they are already producing a lot of cash with much more to come. Which means Q4 group profitability I believe to be at a NET cash level.\n\nSmart Us of The World Largest Infection Dicease Database\n\nI am really excited for the monetisation of the world's largest infectious dicease database. The excitement is centered around utilising the data in everyday consumable wearables.\u00a0Previous management did not seem to understand the value they had until Cathal Friel arrived a shrewder Irishman, and these fellas are not known for missing much when it comes to turning muck into brass. I am not sure I can call infectious diceased much, unpleasant perhaps! No matter, they have considerable value as we are already witnessing, yet Cathal appears to have found another way to unlock more value in a way I find even more exciting. Let's face it, we will need to learn to live with Covid-19 for some time to come, and everyday affordable wearables could help the world live with infectious diceased that make us much more aware of them.\u00a0\n\n\nThe talk coming from Open Orphan (not just BB gossip), is Apple and Amazon, plus others, are seeking to use the database for wearable devices, smartwatches, health monitor devices, etc. These are often premium devices, especially if you are Apple or Samsung smartwatches brands. So, what is the market size for smart devices? As investors we shouldn't allow Apple's cash pile reported to be $1900bn to excite us too much - Apple didn't amass that cashpile by giving away money to smaller companies as a charitable donation, these companies a ruthless as I am sure their Chinese workforce would profess to their collective dismay. That said, if anyone thinks Cathal, et al at the company do not realise its worth and do not know how to pitch one corporate off against another are fools. Not many Open Orphan investors strike me as fools.\u00a0\n\n\nGlobal Smart Devices Market - Huge and Growing Fast\n\n\nThe global wearable medical device market size was valued at USD 13.0bn in 2019 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 27.9% over the forecast period. The growth of industries such as\u00a0home healthcare\u00a0and remote patient monitoring devices is anticipated to positively influence the demand for wearable devices. In addition, increasing consumer focus on fitness and efforts toward leading a healthy lifestyle are expected to positively fuel the product demand.\n\nMore from the report\u00a0here.\n\n\nThe Global Smart Healthcare Market size stood at US$ 141bn in 2019 and is expected to grow at 14.5% through 2030. Smart Healthcare is technology integrated diagnostic tool used for treating patients and improving the quality of life using e-health, m-health and ambient assisted living services. Rising government initiatives for the digitization of healthcare infrastructure are driving the growth of the smart healthcare market.\n\nMore from the report\u00a0here.\n\n\nThe number of connected wearable devices worldwide has more than doubled in the space of three years, increasing from 325m in 2016 to 722m in 2019. The number of devices is forecast to reach more than one billion by 2022.\n\n\nTwo important factors to the growth within the wearable devices market is primarily being powered by sales of smartwatches \u2013 shipments of smartwatches worldwide are forecast to surpass 100m in 2020. Apple, who unveiled their first smartwatch in 2015, currently dominate the smartwatch market and have held a share of around 45% since 2018. Another reason for the growth of the wearables market is the rise in popularity of hearable devices. Also referred to as earwear or ear-worn devices, this category is expected to soar over the next few years with shipments of devices forecast to increase by 45% to 105m units by 2023.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAny search you chose to do for smartwatches, or health monitoring devices will vary from the cheap and nasty, to the premium expensive kind. What is important as far as we are concerned, and Open Orphan of course, is the fact the company has a very lucrative database of infectious diceases. Some of the world's largest companies are seeking to supplant in their wearable smart devices. While these devices may have been around for a while, and in some cases become a short-term fad for the post-Christmas fitness bunny, I think, as do Apple and Amazon, probably others, a new more important market has just opened up, one that has the potential to save lives as well as monitor health and wellbeing on an all new level previously only health care professionals had access too.\u00a0\n\n\nAs I understand it. The idea is to license Open Orphan data to smart device manufacturer(s). These devices will have the ability to instantly warn the consumer they have contracted symptoms of an infectious dicease, which will have a variety of alert levels related to the disease offering specific advice, like self isolate, off you pop to hospital, etc. The \u00a3multi million question must be who with?\u00a0\n\n\nOne option is to a global leader as first mover advantage on an exclusivity period - naturally this option would yield significant margins to Open Orphan by virtue of the market it would grab ahead of any other adopter because this would of course add significant value in today's pandemic environments.\u00a0\n\n\nThen the second highest bidder? Or multiple companies and or government agencies. The moral standpoint I have is one of ethics and morality. (I make no apologies for my Master Mason and Christian beliefs) To my mind I think such ground-breaking technology should be made as widely available as possible because the alert system is lifesaving, track and traceability (IF AN OPTION) could become a problem if governments do not put financial safety nets in place for people contracting Covid -19 or ave some symptoms that require isolation, this being the only real negative I see for such devices as this would reduce its effectiveness.\u00a0\n\n\nThe other question is the pricing for such data access and alerts in real time - will this price the ordinary mid to low salary consumers be priced out of the market, thus reduce the effectiveness if it were not made available more widespread at affordable pricing levels? This must be a factor for opening up the world economy again...yes, it really has the potential to be this important.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat price could be put on this new ground-breaking market to Open Orphan? Surely global governments have more buying power than any global Apple, Amazon type business. Hell fire, do they deserve this opportunity!\n\nThank you for reading.

        "selftext": "#**Sector and Industry**\n\nThe communication services sector has seen annual [earnings growth of 19.63%]( https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=sector&amp;v=152&amp;o=-eps5years&amp;c=0,1,11) in the past five years. This makes the sector second only to the consumer cyclical sector in earnings growth. Notably, the consumer cyclical sector includes Yum Brands ([YUM](https://www.vhinny.com/display/YUM)), Amazon ([AMZN]( https://www.vhinny.com/display/AMZN)), and Acushnet ([GOLF](https://www.vhinny.com/display/GOLF)).\n\nThe telecommunication services industry is a subset of the broader communication services sector. Telecom companies provide communication solutions through phones, airwaves, cable infrastructure, satellites, and the Internet. The industry has seen stable earnings growth over the past five years. Telephone communication has been the largest historical source of revenue for telecom companies. However, technological advances have proven that future growth will be focused on Internet communication and mobile networks. \n\nTelecom services is [third in EPS growth](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&amp;sg=communicationservices&amp;v=152&amp;o=-eps5years&amp;c=0,1,11) for the last five years, of the communication services industries. Overall, telecom has seen steady earnings growth in recent years but still underperformed its sector.\n\nVerizon is the largest in the industry, with a market cap of $241B compared to AT&amp;T\u2019s $193B. The two companies make up approximately 30% of the industry\u2019s [$1,345B total market cap](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&amp;sg=communicationservices&amp;v=152&amp;o=-perf52w&amp;c=0,1,2).\n\n#**Descriptions**\n\nVerizon and AT&amp;T are both titans in mobile data plans, internet service, and entertainment. AT&amp;T has a larger exposure to entertainment through its [acquisition of Time Warner in 2018]( https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/att-vs-verizon-stock-which-is-a-better-investment). Time Warner was renamed to WarnerMedia and includes Warner Bros., Turner Broadcasting, HBO, CNN, DC Entertainment, Cinemax, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, TBS and TNT. AT&amp;T has famously struggled to retain customers of its DirecTV services and is currently [attempting to sell the division](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/10/att-loses-another-600000-tv-customers-as-it-seeks-buyer-for-directv/). \n\nVerizon has made the notable acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo\u2019s internet division in the past five years. These acquisitions ended in Verizon [writing off a $4.6 billion loss in 2018](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/verizon-takes-4-6-billion-hit-aol-yahoo-n946486) after failed attempts to integrate the two companies. In September, Verizon [acquired Tracfone\u2014a prepaid mobile phone provider](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/verizon-stock-buy-now/). Verizon has since moved away from entertainment and focused on preparing for the adoption of 5G technology. It is still unclear if Verizon will have a competitive edge over competitor T-Mobile in the 5G space.\n\n#**Valuations**\n\nTicker|Company|Mkt Cap|P/E|PEG|Div %|Payout Ratio\n:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:\nVZ|Verizon|$241B|13.24|3.82|4.29%|55.60%\nT|AT&amp;T|$194B|18.06|6.76|7.58%|103.70%\n\nVerizon and AT&amp;T both carry large debt loads; both are part of the top five most indebted companies. Verizon carries $139B in total debt with a current ratio of 1.10 ([read about current ratios here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentratio.asp)). AT&amp;T\u2019s debt situation is much worse with $181B in total debt and a current ratio of 0.80. A current ratio of less than 1 indicates the Company has short-term debts greater than its total assets. \n\nAT&amp;T is considered a dividend aristocrat as the Company has increased its dividend payout for 36 consecutive years. AT&amp;T currently pays a dividend of 7.58%, with a [payout ratio of 103.70%](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;t=T,VZ&amp;c=0,1,2,14,15). The Company\u2019s large debt and unsustainable payout ratio makes it fundamentally undesirable, although it is attempting to cut cash-burning operations such as DirecTV.\n\nVerizon is not yet a dividend aristocrat, with 16 consecutive years of increased dividend payouts. Verizon\u2019s 4.29% dividend yield at a [payout ratio of 55.60%](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;t=T,VZ&amp;c=0,1,2,14,15) is much more sustainable than its competitor. The lower dividend payout ratio has allowed Verizon to invest into 5G technology and pay down debt, while still growing the dividend in a sustainable way.\n\nFundamentally, Verizon trades at both lower P/E and PEG ratios. AT&amp;T has seen annual EPS growth of  [8.90% the past five years, compared to Verizon\u2019s 14.00%](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;t=T,VZ&amp;c=0,1,2,19). Estimated five-year growth for both companies is low, with [Verizon at 2.27% annual growth and AT&amp;T at -1.74%](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;t=T,VZ&amp;c=0,1,2,20). This estimate will likely change as the impact of 5G on Verizon\u2019s revenues becomes clear and AT&amp;T continues [restructuring efforts](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/03/struggling-att-plans-tens-of-billions-in-cost-cuts-more-layoffs/).\n\n#**Conclusion**\n\nPositive catalysts for Verizon include the adoption of 5G and its low debt compared with AT&amp;T. Verizon recently spent [$1.9B in bidding on 5G mmWave spectrum](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-verizon-dish-became-top-spenders-crbs-spectrum-auction-2020-9), on top of other multi-billion 5G investments. [Open signal data]( https://www.opensignal.com/reports/2020/06/usa/mobile-network-experience-5g) from mid-2020 showed Verizon\u2019s average 5G speed beating AT&amp;T's by as much as eight times.\n\nAT&amp;T would benefit from selling their DirecTV division, which would allow focus on the recently launched HBO Max streaming service. However, even selling DirecTV may not be enough for AT&amp;T\u2019s success in the digital streaming space due to intense competition from Disney, Netflix, Apple, and Amazon. Right now, AT&amp;T is limited by their dividend payout ratio and debt.\n\nIn conclusion, Verizon has stronger fundamentals than AT&amp;T and has made key investments that should serve as positive catalysts in the future. AT&amp;T is weighed down by its dividend payment and debt making innovation difficult. Neither company offers a compelling case for growth investors and the telecom industry fits dividend investing ideals better. Those invested into either company can expect less volatility and consistent dividends but also lower gains than the total market.\n\n---\n\nFinancial data was sourced from [Vhinny](https://www.vhinny.com), [Finviz](https://finviz.com/), and [Yahoo Finance]( https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nI hold no position in VZ or T and do not plan to in the near future.",

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 9th, 2020.\n\n# **After sharp bounce, market may take a \u2018breather\u2019 on lingering election uncertainty, virus outbreak  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/06/after-sharp-bounce-market-may-take-a-breather-on-lingering-election-uncertainty-virus-outbreak.html)**\n*****\n&gt; After an initially exuberant election reaction, stocks may trade more cautiously in the week ahead, as investors watch election developments unfold and track the course of the coronavirus. \n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up more than 7.3% in the past week, at 3,509, and the Nasdaq rose 9%, the best weekly performance since April. Stocks slid Friday, but technology, communications services, health care and discretionary stocks had the biggest gains for the week, after it appeared Democrat Joe Biden could be the next president but with a split Congress.\n*****\n&gt; The election was still unresolved heading into the weekend, but even if Biden is declared winner, close votes and lawsuits are likely to result in recounts. The Senate appeared to be in Republican hands, but the margin of control is likely to be tight, and runoff elections are required for two Senate seats in Georgia in early January.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the uncertainty is going to catch up the market on a short-term basis,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, BNY Mellon\u2019s Wealth Management chief investment officer. \u201cPerhaps next week could be a drifting lower kind of week.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ahead of the election, the market had been betting on a \u201cblue wave,\u201d where Biden would take the White House and Democrats would get control of the Senate, giving them total control of Congress. But when it appeared the Senate would stay in Republican hands, stocks surged on the idea of gridlock, which would keep Biden from implementing tax increases and lots of new regulations.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, there has been a surge in daily new coronavirus cases to more than 122,000. Economists are concerned that the economic recovery could suffer as some states could restrict activities and consumers may pull back heading into the important holiday season.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed, in its post-meeting statement Thursday, repeated that the course of the virus could help determine the path of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; There are a few economic reports in the week ahead, including consumer price index inflation data Thursday and the producer price index Friday. More than a dozen Fed officials are on the speaking circuit, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who speaks Thursday on central banking at a European Central Bank forum.\n*****\n&gt; The earnings season is beginning to slow down, but there are still dozens of reports, including from McDonald\u2019s on Monday and Walt Disney, Applied Materials and Cisco on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is just setting up to be a breather. There\u2019s still a lot to figure out here,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cThe equity market\u2019s reaction has been I think understandable and probably better than many might have expected.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said there may be uncertainty for awhile. \u201cWhat I\u2019m thinking about is the Senate races. Part of the market reaction has been relying on this divided government.\u201d After the votes are all in or recounted, \u201ca sweep is unlikely but possible.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the longer this stays uncertain and messy, the more the post-election bounce comes into question,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Different than 2000\n&gt; It would not be unusual for the stock market to sell off before rallying into year end, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall does not expect the type of turbulence there was in 2000, when former Vice President Al Gore lost to George W. Bush in a tight race that ultimately went to the Supreme Court.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn 2000, they were not expecting hanging chads. But they do expect a contested election this time. I think in many ways the market anticipated this,\u201d said Stovall.\n*****\n&gt; But the market, after its election week surge, could pull back. \u201cHistorically, the market goes down in the month of November, after a Democratic victory,\u201d said Stovall. Since World War II, Democrats won the White House nine times, and the market fell an average of 0.5% in November in those years, compared to the average gain for all Novembers of 1.4%, he said.\n*****\n&gt; After those Democratic victories, stocks then rose 1.9% in December on average, more than the normal 1.5% gain for all Decembers.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said they currently do not expect the kind of lockdowns that states ordered when the pandemic started to spread in March. But there could still be some impact that could be negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said he sees some signs of optimism for the market. Strong data, like third quarter GDP, October\u2019s drop in unemployment to 6.9%, and the better-than-expected earnings are all positives for the market. Another is that investors are so skeptical.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat does still exist is a great deal of dry powder. There\u2019s $4.3 trillion in money markets alone,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you, being in touch with investors of all shapes and sizes this week, there\u2019s still a lot of skepticism. From a contrarian view, high cash and a lot of skepticism is a contrarian indicator.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/WUlRQfd.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/FWN82Hs.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ZnTzBNz.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/g52vqsv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OiPuXi8.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lA86Kou.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xmtVSEB.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RRxlWej.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Piu5auo.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/W80POso.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eGUQXgr.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yoHWfIC.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hQyweyw.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Presidential Election Anticipation Is Keeping Us Waiting\n\n&gt; While we all anxiously await the final count and outcome of the U.S. Presidential Election, here are some possible scenarios for 2021. Our analysis here is based on historical market performance during the most likely political alignments for next year. We ran these likely scenarios through the Almanac database software to create this graph.\n\n&gt; We are either going to have the fifth year of a two-term republican president or a first year of a new democratic presidency. It appears the democrats will hold the house and the republicans will hold the senate, but that is not a forgone conclusion either. So we also examined both presidential outcomes with a democratic, republican and split congress.\n\n&gt; Our study uses the S&amp;P 500 from 1949 to 2017. We start in 1949 because it is the first full 4-Year Presidential Stock Market Cycle since the end of WWII. The Twenty-Second Amendment that implemented presidential term limits for a max of two terms or eight years was ratified on February 27, 1951. Truman in 1949 was excluded as there was a no change of party in the White House. We gave Bush 41 the same treatment.\n\n&gt; Admittedly, there are limited data points; four each of fifth year republicans and first year democrats. Here\u2019s what we found. A change in party with a new, first year democratic president came with democratic control of Congress and significantly higher performance for the S&amp;P 500, averaging 10.6% with a median gain of 15.1% versus 7.0% for the average post-election year since 1949.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a89421df75f426e1b1ff90cb2c29cb90/b63e1cf962f89fdb-a3/s400x600/f9bde99a9e4ba83b0df266a8d3cc04cd732cc58f.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Fifth year republican presidents in 1957 (Eisenhower) and 1973 (Nixon) had to work with democratically controlled Congresses and the market suffered significant losses. The market did well in Reagan\u2019s fifth year with a split Congress \u2013 a testament to how \u201cThe Great Communicator\u201d was able to work across the aisle with then Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill. Even with republican control of Congress under Bush 43\u2019s fifth year, the market had a tough year with ongoing issues in Iraq, North Korea declaring it\u2019s a nuclear power and the most active and second costliest hurricane season on record.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Job Growth Continues as COVID-19 Cases Rise\n\n&gt; The US labor market shrugged off election uncertainty and continued to add jobs in October. Despite the waning effects of fiscal stimulus and rising COVID-19 cases, per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added 638,000 jobs, ahead of Bloomberg survey estimates calling for 580,000. The headline number was depressed by a 268,000 drop in government employment, including 147,000 temporary census workers. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell from 7.9% to 6.9% despite a rise in the labor force participation rate, a reversal of the dynamic we saw in September when unemployment fell while the labor force participation also declined.\n\n&gt; However, a troubling trend remains beneath the surface. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the number of long-term unemployed\u2014those out of work for 27 weeks or longer\u2014continues to rise as a share of the total unemployed:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11.6.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWhile the labor market has continued to show improvement, there are still many people out there who are having a hard time getting back to work,\u201d noted LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWith total jobs in the US around 10 million below pre-pandemic levels and rising COVID-19 cases, there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement despite the declining unemployment rate.\u201d\n\n&gt; COVID-19 cases in the United States have reached record highs with a weekly trend growth rate above 20%, according to the COVID Tracking Project. As the weather cools and more activity shifts indoors, additional restrictions to limit the spread of the virus could slow the fragile labor market recovery.\n\n&gt; In particular, much of the private sector gains in this month\u2019s jobs report were in the services sector, where previous jobs reports had shown strength in goods-oriented industries. Many countries in Europe have reinstated restrictions or even gone as far as implementing new lockdowns. While we don\u2019t expect lockdowns in the United States like we saw in March, restrictions on activity could limit future job gains.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One Sentiment Survey Soars While Another Sinks\n\n&gt; In an earlier post, we discussed how bullish sentiment in the AAII survey has been on the rise, but looking at another weekly sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence, the opposite is true. The percentage of respondents reporting as bullish fell sharply this week, 7 percentage points, down to 53.6%. While a majority are still optimistic and that reading is in the middle of its range, that was the largest weekly decline since a 7.4 percentage point decline to 41.7% in the first week of March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, the percentage of newsletter writers that are \"looking for a correction\" rose sharply to 25.8% this week following last week's over 5% decline for the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Correction.png))**\n\n&gt; The Investors Intelligence survey has a long history dating back to 1963, and in all weeks in that time, only 5% (174 weeks) have seen bullish sentiment fall 5 percentage points or more while the percentage of respondents looking for a correction has risen at least 5 percentage points in the same week. In the chart below, we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 following these past occurrences when there has not been another in the prior 3 months. The S&amp;P 500 has frequently been higher over the following weeks and months, but there is a slight underperformance relative to all periods since 1963 when the survey begins.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Performance.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2 Post-Election Charts You Need to See\n\n&gt; The election is over, but the questions are mounting. We don\u2019t know who will be the next president as of Wednesday morning, but we do know that stocks tend to do well the final two months of an election year. \u201cOnce the uncertainty is over, stocks tend to rally in November and December, with November the best month of the year during an election year,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOf course, 2020 isn\u2019t like any other year, and we still could be a ways away from who the winner will be.\u201d\n\n&gt; The LPL Chart of the Day shows that the S&amp;P 500 Index tends to do very well the final two months of the year, especially during election years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The modern design of the S&amp;P 500 stock index was first launched in 1957. Performance back to 1928 incorporates the performance of predecessor index, the S&amp;P 90\n\n&gt; One of the big takeaways so far from Tuesday night is that the Senate likely will stay Republican, meaning we may have a divided Congress. The chances of higher taxes and more regulation likely took a hit under this scenario. This could be a nice tailwind for stocks, as the S&amp;P 500 historically has done quite well under a divided Congress, up more than 17% on average. Additionally, in years with a divided Congress, stocks have been higher the past 10 times, with 2020 potentially being the 11th in a row.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-2-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; This election is far from over, so stay tuned to LPL Research as we continue to monitor things!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Emerging Markets Cheering a Potential Biden Win\n\n&gt; The US equity market has seen a massive rally in reaction to what is looking like a Biden victory over President Trump coupled with the Republican party maintianing its majority in the US Senate. None of these results are official at this point, so they are subject to change, but these are the most likely scenarios as of now. Outside of the US, emerging markets have also rallied. In just the last two days, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF (EEM) has rallied 5% and broken above resistance to new 52-week highs. If for no other reason then Biden's campaign slogan isn't America First, the rationale behind the rally makes some sense.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-Now.png))**\n\n&gt; The reaction of EEM in the aftermath of this election is very much different from what happened in 2016. Heading into the 2016 election, EEM had been trending higher, but pulled back in the days leading up to the election and broke its uptrend that had been in place since earlier in the year. Again, Trump's America First approach was understandably viewed as a headwind to emerging market equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-labels.png))**\n\n&gt; While the initial reaction of EEM to Trump's election was negative, that weakness didn't last long. The chart below shows the performance of EEM in the two months before and one year after the 2016 election. The gray box represents the same period shown in the chart above. Within days after breaking its uptrend after the 2016 election, EEM bounced back, rallied to its 50-DMA, tested its November low, and then in the early days of 2017 it was off to the races as EEM. In fact, even accounting for the post-Election Day declines, one year after the 2016 election, EEM was up 25% which was actually more than the 21% return for the S&amp;P 500! The moral of the story here is that first reactions aren't always the right reactions, and as an investor it's not just imperative to know the environment you are operating in, but also when the tides are turning.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-2017.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Winners and Losers During Trump's Presidency\n\n&gt; With Election Day upon us, below we take a look at the biggest winners and losers across financial markets during the Trump Presidency from Election Day 2016 through today. First off, below is a chart of the market cap of the Russell 3,000 since Election Day 2000 which George W. Bush eventually won. The Russell 3,000 makes up more than 98% of the total US equity market cap, so it's a good gauge to use for measuring the overall change in market cap levels. The current market cap of the Russell 1000 is just north of $35 trillion, which is up $11.5 trillion since Election Day 2016. President Obama oversaw US market cap growth of $12.3 trillion over his two terms, while President Bush actually saw market cap decline by $4.1 trillion after his two terms.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/mktcap.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a look at the total return of various asset classes since Election Day 2016 using key ETFs listed on US exchanges. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is up 70.6% since Trump was elected, while the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) more than doubled that at +144.3%. Of the broad index ETFs in the matrix, the Smallcap Value ETF (IJS) is up the least since Election Day 2016 at just +17.2%.\n\n&gt; Looking at US sector ETFs, the Energy sector (XLE) is a huge outlier with a decline of 48.3% since Trump was elected. Technology (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) are up the most with gains of 154% and 97%, respectively.\n\n&gt; Along with Energy stocks, the oil (USO) and natural gas (UNG) ETFs have been more than cut in half since 11/8/16, while gold (GLD) is up 47% and silver is up 29.5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/assetclass1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Not every country has seen stock market gains since Trump was elected. As shown below, Mexico (EWW) is down 28.5%, Brazil (EWZ) is down 19.4%, Spain (EWP) is down 6.8%, and the UK (EWU) is just slightly in the red.\n\n&gt; The US (SPY) is up more than any other country with a gain of 70.6%, while China (ASHR) is up the second most at +51%. Whatever happened with the trade war certainly didn't hurt the US and China versus the rest of the world on a relative basis.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/countryreturns1103.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/sectors1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Within the Russell 1,000 in its current form, there are nine stocks that are up 1,000% or more since Election Day 2016, with Enphase Energy (ENPH) at the top with a gain of 8,590%. Trade Desk (TTD) is up the second most at +2,448%, followed by Novocure (NVCR), SolarEdge Tech (SEDG), and Quidel (QDEL). Square (SQ) ranks sixth with a gain of 1,203%. Other notables on the list of big winners since Trump was elected include Etsy (ETSY), Teladoc (TDOC), Tesla (TSLA), NVIDIA (NVDA), Atlassian (TEAM), Boston Beer (SAM), and Lululemon (LULU).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-since-2016.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of market cap gains for individual stocks, the numbers below are quite eye-popping. Apple (AAPL) has gained the most in market cap since Trump was elected with an increase of $1.257 trillion! Amazingly, both Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have added more than $1 trillion in market cap as well. Prior to the last few years, no company was even close to having a $1 trillion market cap, but at this point, AAPL, AMZN, and MSFT have gained that much in the last four years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/capuse.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 6th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ5sT7SXYTk))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.8.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$PLUG** \n&gt; * **$WKHS** \n&gt; * **$CGC** \n&gt; * **$DKNG** \n&gt; * **$BYND** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$ACB** \n&gt; * **$RKT** \n&gt; * **$SPG** \n&gt; * **$JMIA** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$TLRY** \n&gt; * **$NKLA** \n&gt; * **$DDOG** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$DHI** \n&gt; * **$WIX** \n&gt; * **$CARS** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$DIS** \n&gt; * **$INO** \n&gt; * **$GRWG** \n&gt; * **$NLS** \n&gt; * **$AAP** \n&gt; * **$DOYU** \n&gt; * **$RNG** \n&gt; * **$PRTS** \n&gt; * **$NBEV** \n&gt; * **$LMND** \n&gt; * **$TGNA** \n&gt; * **$WVE** \n&gt; * **$EXPI** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$ICPT** \n&gt; * **$HUYA** \n&gt; * **$GOGO** \n&gt; * **$NCLH** \n&gt; * **$OXY** \n&gt; * **$PEIX** \n&gt; * **$CYBR**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Piu5auo.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MDVAWXO.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Yme9cXS.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/a6Kp4iF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XOR4bP6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TfDOPZJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/OsrCLIc.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/N7Ibl9s.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/y4tBaZw.png))\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wVnvQZH.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9PnmIUs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uoiA0Bw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Plug Power, Inc. $18.86\n**Plug Power, Inc.

Most of our longest-paying dividend stocks are financials and this sector has not recovered from March.\n\nAs someone who's just starting out but wants to transition into value stocks in the future, I looked at value and dividend ETFs. I realized that all 3 of the ETFs I found through Ishares had solid dividend yields which slightly surpassed what I was looking for, only to be brought down by their MERs.\n\nDiversification-wise, XCV is heavily overweight in financials, which makes sense since we've had low interest for a while. XDV is also heavily overweight in financials but also has a strong showing of utilities and telecommunication. CDZ is the most diversified, though its a shame they have a low amount of telecom stocks.\n\n~~When it comes to total returns, it would be expected for XCV to beat both XDV and CDZ over a long time period.~~ \n\nMy question is due to the unique situation our market is in: could value ETFs such as XCVbe a long-term replacement for dividend ETFs like XDV or CDZ, or should we wait another 5 years to see how value stocks change?",

        "selftext": "**Biden wins the election, what does this mean for the economy and the stock market, what Buffen\u2019s Berkshire has done in the last quarter and more, let\u2019s talk about everything** \n\nHey everyone and welcome, I am going to react to the latest news from the election, the economy and in the stock market from last week and what to expect next\n\nSo late Saturday the victory of Biden was announced as networks finally started to predict that he won the election. I have no partisan view as i am not a resident or citizen of the US, but i believe that the results of this election (the Biden win and the Republicans keeping the Senate) is the best the stock market could have hoped for, as many experts were predicting a Blue Sweep. There still will be two important runoff elections in Georgia at the beggining of 2021, where the Democrats could still end up winning the Senate. Biden currently has a projected 290 electoras votes but i believe he will also keep the lead in Georgia and end up with 306 electoral votes, the same number as Trump had 4 years ago [VOTE MAP](https://ibb.co/LZ5dnzt) . Important leaders like the German Chancellor, Uk\u2019s prime minister, Canada\u2019s prime minister, France\u2019s president and many more welcomed and congratuled the win of Biden, which seems to be favored internationaly by the world leaders as they were tired of the whipsaw that came with Trump tweeting non-stop. So this probable grid-lock in Congress is loved by the stock market, as there are no iminent tax raises and a stimulus bill is far more likely if not by the end of the Trump mandate surely at the very start of Biden\u2019s.\n\nSo this scenario that is playing out seems to be the most profitable one for wall street as the average annual return since 1933 is about 14% with a Democractic President and a split Congress [Historical CHART](https://ibb.co/SJGP97P)\n\nYesterday Biden also announced how they will try to combat the illness with Better testing and tracing, a increase in PPE production, National guidance for schools, business and families, Investments of 25 bilion in vaccine development and distribution and mask mandates. While also trying to make the higher risk individuals more safe.\n\nP.S. Here\u2019s a funny meme that LeBron James posted with a throwback to his big block of an opponent. [MEME](https://ibb.co/2hmQk6R)\n\nSo all 3 big indices had the best week since early April with the Nasdaq composite being up just over 9% [NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/rpgWtJH), the SP500 was up 7,32% [S&amp;P CHART](https://ibb.co/Ss7FWVN) and the DOW gained almost 7%.[DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/j3bB0P8) The Nasdaq and Sp were flat for the day, pairing loses from the begining of the day while the down fell 0,23% mostly based on profit taking in my opinion.\n\nThere were more companies that were declining on Friday with over 60% of the companies in the red but with a disproportional number of almost 90% of new highs while the volume fell again way below average [MARKET CHART](https://ibb.co/k0kY7Z1) . There weren\u2019t any significant leaders in the market on Friday but energy traield again being more than 2% down [SECTOR CHART](https://ibb.co/VDFksR8) while small caps under-performed the market especialy the value plays.  [CHART](https://ibb.co/9ndqFLC)\n\nThe fear in the market seems to have completly gone away as we have seen another 10% decline in the VIX indicator to drop below 25. [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/8MjSd1f)\n\nHere is a heat map of Friday, you can see this was quite a slow day, not to many green companies but not that big of a red day either. [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/nsCvwVz)\n\nThe US economy added more than 638 thousand jobs [NEWS](https://ibb.co/hDrrTXs) more than 503 thousand that were expected [CHART](https://ibb.co/C6fD3Sh), while the unemployment rate fell to 6,9% way better than the 7,7% expected this is the sixt straight month of jobs recovery.[CHART](https://ibb.co/RBZzdVG) As they seem to be in a big V shape recovery, overall  [V- SHAPE](https://ibb.co/HN6n9dH)\n\nThe market should now turn they\u2019re attention to the samshing of the earnings season amid the election with 2 thirds of the SP500 beating the estimates both the top and bottom line, that is almost double the 38% historical average. \n\nBank of American release a chart for q3 earnings and as you can see earnings have increased 6,7% in the SP500 year over year and 21,5% quarter over quarter. [EARNINGS CHART](https://ibb.co/C6zfWZR)\n\nAnd as the fed announced that it will keep the benchmark rate between 0 and 0,25% [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/vjNy43D)this continues to stimulate the economy of the US, with the fed beeing probably more responsible for the recovery in the last months as stimulus has been staled in congress. Also they continue to have a target of a running inflation of 2% and will continue to buy assests worth around 120 billion dollars montly to pump money in the economy  [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/wBxn56S). If a stimulus bill will eventualy pass, households will probably continue to use the money the same way as last time with over 70% of the money being used for savings and debt payments. But thay may go down a little as people may tend to spend a little more on essentials and non essentials with a better outlook in the near future than last time. [HOUSEHOLD SPENDING](https://ibb.co/dbbKCj6)\n\nHere are some interesting economic events for next weeks as we continue to closely watch how to recovery is going. [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/gMX5XH5)\n\nNvidia saw a pop in the stock finally as they announced that Fornite will join the GeForce gaming cliud, that could mean a return for the game in ios devices with GeForce currently available on Mac,Windows,Android and Chromebooks. The company has almost reteurn to it all time highs after this weeks strong gains. [NVIDIA CHART](https://ibb.co/1qxmphB)\n\nBuffets Berkshire announced on Saturday that they bought back around 9 billion of the company\u2019s stock,bringing the total to around 16 bilion for the year so far.[BUYBACK CHART](https://ibb.co/ysw5bkx) That was around 4 billion more than in the second quarter. the operating earnings also decrease a little since last quarter and are almost 3 billion or 32% less then last year. [BUYBACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/fSWCvdQ)The only segment that improved since last year was Railroad,utilities and enegery, while insurance was the biggest loser.\n\nThe company has almost the same amount of cash and short term investemtns like the previos quarter at around 146 billion dollars with 70% of the investments concentrated in 4 big companies (Apple , Bank of America, Coca-Cola and American Express) up from the 60% these company represented at the end of 2019. [INVESTMENTS](https://ibb.co/Dps2f95)\n\nThe buybacks of the company exced any full year amount in Berkhsire\u2019s history and far exeded the analysts expectation of around 3,2 billion in buybacks. As the strategy for Buffet and Charlie Munger is to buyback the company\u2019s stock as long as they believe it\u2019s undervalued and they will still have ample cash after the buybacks. AS the only other major investments made last quarter were about 6 billion invested in the five big Japenese trading houses and the data storage company Snowflake.\n\nI just saw some interesting news as NetFlix announced they will launch a offering named NetFlix Direct in France that will come with a linear feed of content from Netflix\u2019s library, so the company that is the biggest reasons for the decline of old TV programming made quite a twist as they seek to expand more and more.  [NETFLIX NEWS](https://ibb.co/gWzmKKs)\n\nHere is a list with some of the most important earnings next week, some companies that i like that are reporting are: McDonalds, Datadog, Tencent, Corsair, Purple, Lemonade and DraftKings.
