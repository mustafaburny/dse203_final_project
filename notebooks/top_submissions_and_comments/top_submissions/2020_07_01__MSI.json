        "selftext": "**Disclaimer:** I originally wrote this post for both WSB and SPACs because those are the only two subreddits I am active in. So forgive me if I try to explain things about AVCT/warrants that you already know. I also know a lot of you have followed AVCT recently too so don't hesitate to call me out if you see an error.\n\n**What is AVCT:** In their own words, they are a Houston-based \u201cPremier IT solutions provider offering a comprehensive bundle of services including unified cloud communications, managed services, cybersecurity, and enhanced connectivity.\u201d\n\n**Why are they under the radar:** In early 2019, a blank check company named Pensare was on the hunt for established cloud companies with significant room to grow. In July 2019 the acquisition of a 30 year old cloud service company named Computex DID happen but it wasn\u2019t finalized until April 2020. At the time Computex was bought for 65 million but in a recent job posting they described themselves as a \u201c150 million+ cloud UCaaS and cybersecurity company.\u201d So as of July 2019, Pensare became AVCT, the owner of Computex. The issue is that AVCT has not filed an earnings report that shows their Computex profits. Their last 10-K about a week ago was basically meaningless since it just reported the numbers of the investing vehicle they used for the merger.\n\n**What do we know:** Because we have no earnings reports to go off of, it\u2019s undeniable that this is a speculation play. But there are some things that we DO know because of what AVCT and Computex have slowly revealed through job postings and twitter. The bulk of the good news comes in a tech article that Computex tweeted last night. \u2022\tThey have services ready to launch that they describe as \u201csolutions focused on SD-WAN, enhanced productivity solutions for remote home workers, cybersecurity solutions for remote workforces, and UCaaS\u201d \u2022\tTheir first business objective is to become the leading \u201cone-stop shop white glove cloud service provider\u201d through a subscription based business model. \u2022\tThey are currently in the process of hiring 40 new sales people and system architects to market their new services. This would be adding 40 more to their team of 200. \u2022\tComputex is the Houston metropolitan area's top cloud and managed services provider and the top cybersecurity player with its own dedicated 24-by-7-by-365 network operations center\n\n\u2022\tThey see acquisitions as the second half of their business objective and plan to grow aggressively. This is what their President had to say: \"In this market where not everybody may survive, we definitely expect to acquire some value plays in the market and grow the business. This is the right time as well as people start adjusting to operating in this new environment.\" Also, \u201cwe're fairly used to inorganic growth, acquiring companies, integrating them, enhancing their portfolios, and cross-selling into their customer bases,\" he said. \"The muscle we get with AVCT at the public level with some of the most amazing names in the industry in our executive list ... brings a different level of expertise to our capabilities. And frankly, the growth target through acquisitions is a big focus for us.\"\n\n\u2022\tComputex has its own multimillion dollar (NOC) network operations centers in Houston and Minneapolis along with a security operations center (SOC) in Houston, a solutions lab for testing complex technology solutions, and three integration centers.\n\n\u2022\tTheir executive team includes former executives from AT&amp;T, Panasonic, NSORO, Vonage, MasTech, Compass, and Motorola\n\n**How can I invest:** Only stocks and warrants are available. No options. But with stocks trading close to $3 and warrants currently at $.24 a piece you might not care. For those unfamiliar with warrants, you pay for one AVCT warrant and if sometime in the next 4 years AVCT is valued at $18 or more for a period of at least 4 days, you will be able to purchase one share of AVCT in 2024 for about $11 regardless of how much the share price is.\n\n**TLDR:** AVCT is potentially Zoom\u2019s shy younger sister. AVCT stock is currently trading around $3.20 and warrants around $.24.\n\n**Links to a few of the best resources I got some of the info from:** [https://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/computex-looks-to-grow-acquire-during-covid-19-crisis?itc=refresh](https://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/computex-looks-to-grow-acquire-during-covid-19-crisis?itc=refresh) [https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1930204137/?alternateChannel=search](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1930204137/?alternateChannel=search) [https://www.ir.avctechnologies.com/leadership/management/](https://www.ir.avctechnologies.com/leadership/management/)\n\n**Credit:** Shout out to /u/karmalizing for being the first poster on AVCT a few months ago. Since I saw his post, I\u2019d been keeping up with every resource I could find that had new information on them. I\u2019ve been waiting to post this DD until they released more substantial direction about where they are heading. Good luck my dudes.",
