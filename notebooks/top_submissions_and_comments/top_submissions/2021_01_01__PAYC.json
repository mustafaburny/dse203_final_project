        "selftext": "I don't know much, but I know tech and AMD has A LOT going for it right now.\n\n[*Obligatory do your own research and draw your own conclusions statement.*]\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\n- Both Sony and Microsoft are using custom AMD APUs in their latest consoles. (APU = CPU + GPU combined into one.) In case you've been living under a rock for the past 8 weeks, both the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X have been selling like hotcakes, with fresh inventory being depleted within minutes. \n\n- AMD has been the underdog vs Intel in the consumer desktop CPU space for as long as I can remember. But for the first time in 15 years, [AMD is winning in terms of market share](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-overtakes-intel-in-desktop-cpu-market-share-for-the-first-time-in-15-years). Intel has been able to stay competitive with their latest generation of CPUs by offering significant discounts. Despite this, AMD's CPUs still remain in higher demand and sell out almost instantly (at MSRP). \n\n- AMD owns Radeon, which is their brand of Graphics Cards. These compete directly with Nvidia's RTX GPUs. Performance wise, they're up there with NVDA, but still lagging a bit in the ray tracing department which most will agree is the future. Key word being future, it's not a big deal *yet*. And thanks to the pandemic these too also sell out super quick. \n\n- AMD's next generation of mobile CPUs will be launching soon. Just like their desktop lineup, you can expect these to outperform their Intel counterparts as well. AMD's previous mobile generation of 4000 series chips crushed Intel - the biggest problem was availability. People wanted the AMD chips but for whatever reason, they were found mostly in the mid-range and lower end gaming laptops. I expect the availability issue to improve greatly this year. As we can see, certain manufacturer's like Asus are already featuring the AMD SKUs in their [top of the line gaming laptops](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ROG-Strix-Scar-17-ditches-Comet-Lake-H-for-an-unlocked-Ryzen-9-5900HX-with-liquid-metal-and-RTX-3080-Mobile.514702.0.html). \n\n**RISK FACTORS**\n\n- While speaking purely from a monetary standpoint, overall I think the pandemic has been a net positive for tech companies like AMD. However, AMD's own fearless leader Lisa Su recently said: [\"...the COVID environment has increased shipping and freight costs, which are hard to avoid. As we get into a more normal environment, this should improve.

This doesn't really affect AMD (yet) because [Apple has been using Intel chips in their laptops and desktops for the past 15 years.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/why-apple-is-breaking-a-15-year-partnership-with-intel-on-its-macs-.html#:~:text=Menu-,Apple%20is%20breaking%20a%2015%2Dyear%20partnership%20with,on%20its%20Macs%20%E2%80%94%20here's%20why&amp;text=Apple's%20new%20laptops%20and%20desktop,can%20improve%20laptop%20battery%20life.) And despite being a massive company, Apple only makes up about [13% of the PC market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/576473/united-states-quarterly-pc-shipment-shareapple/#:~:text=In%20the%20fourth%20quarter%20of,the%20fourth%20quarter%20of%202020.). AMD is still Apple's partner for discrete graphics, but that could change soon. This is definitely something you'll want to keep your eye on though because other titans like [Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/article/microsoft-processors-int/microsoft-working-on-in-house-chips-for-its-servers-pcs-idUSKBN28S2Y1), [Google](https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/04/google-is-making-its-own-chips.html), and Amazon are all either working on, or producing their own in house chips. In my opinion, this is not nearly as bad as it sounds. Let's break it down by company.\n\n - [Microsoft currently uses Intel-based processors for the majority of its Azure cloud services, and most of the company\u2019s Surface lineup run on Intel chips, too.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report#:~:text=Microsoft%20has%20worked%20with%20AMD,move%20away%20from%20just%20Intel.&amp;text=Microsoft%20co%2Dengineered%20an%20ARM,a%20couple%20of%20months%20ago.) Only some of Microsoft's laptops run on AMD hardware. \n\n - [Google is readying its own in-house processors for use in future Pixel devices, including both phones and eventually Chromebooks, too.](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/google-said-to-be-preparing-its-own-chips-for-use-in-pixel-phones-and-chromebooks/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADHPvna5MKFbSAnwNIPsW4kMhD7zhe-7IJtk0AzQP1Rrer78Olm_S_019orsNcQA9Ezk_sCz0z8My1nHGdTap_0-SYZtHKs1U9v9ni-AGkuJzp3cOHYUDSEu7b90qMQIDsc-PC8tFFceJElhUcPhJ3ctKtatuQcLkrIF1VotSBz1#:~:text=The%20Axios%20report%20says%20that,machine%20learning%20and%20Google%20Assistant.) Again, because Google currently relies more on Intel CPUs this is not a big blow to AMD's bottom line.

These were also replaced by Intel.\n\nAMD has earnings coming up on the 26th which I think they're going to shatter. I probably would not recommend trying to play off of that though as ERs can be quite unpredictable, especially if the news is positive. Personally, I think AMD is going to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 after ER, but I'm not betting on that. Which is why my current position (30% of my portfolio) is LEAPS: (x2) Jan 2022 90c.\n\nMy conservative 6 month PT for AMD is 110. Also open to hearing any other potential risks I may have overlooked. To be on the safe side I'm only including 6 rockets.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Looks like after early rumors this week, the DA is officially out, so I thought I'd share some insights about Achronix's merger with $ACEV. It is currently trading \\~15% above NAV, and I consider it a strong buy right now. Please enjoy this quickly compiled post about ACEV/Achronix and why I think it's a great opportunity right now.\n\n[Achronix's position in the market serves as an attractive investment opportunity.

They don't plan to f\\*\\*\\* this up.\n* Founded in 2004, Achronix is one of the top five global fabless semiconductor companies and the **only independent supplier of high-performance field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)**. The profitable company is a key player in the global FPGA market alongside Intel Corp. and Xilinx.\n* The Silicon Valley-based FPGA maker's revenue in 2018 stood at around 67 billion won ($61.2 million), which surged to 115 billion won in 2020. This year, Achronix is expected to post 173 billion won in revenue. **Achronix will post \\~$160M in revenue for this year.**\n* Achronix's major clients include **Intel, Google, Microsoft and Samsung**. Achronix also licenses its intellectual property to **General Motors** for its advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). What a strong base of clients set-up for this company. Once the merger goes through, Achronix will gain more funding to scale their business.\n* Given its specialty in high volume and high speed data processing, **FPGAs are widely used for data centers, artificial intelligence, machine learning and 5G.** These industries are poised to grow significantly over the next few decades. Despite the buzzwords, they aren't buzzwords without validity. Achronix is positioned to serve these markets well.\n* The FPGA industry grabbed investors\u2019 attention when **Intel acquired programmable chip maker Altera in 2015 for approximately $16.7 billion**, followed by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) acquiring the leading FPGA maker Xilinx for $35 billion last year. As of today's writing, ACEV/Achronix's market cap sits at \\~$330M. In my opinion, it is severely undervalued right now.\n\nAlthough the initial rumors and Definitive Agreement came out this week across major publishers, the hype riding clean energy in SPACs overtook this announcement across the markets. **I expect this to be a strong long-term hold over the next decade. Currently, the SPAC trades at \\~15% above NAV.**\n\n[More details surrounding the merger.](https://preview.redd.it/waf6127ks6a61.png?width=985&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b48fb1bb2e5098cc9162e805e2071960388f8b6a)\n\nSource:\n\n(1) [https://www.achronix.com/sites/default/files/docs/Achronix\\_Ace\\_Merger\\_Presentation\\_VF.pdf](https://www.achronix.com/sites/default/files/docs/Achronix_Ace_Merger_Presentation_VF.pdf)\n\n(2) [https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202101080005?lang=us](https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202101080005?lang=us)\n\n(3) [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210107005892/en/Achronix-to-List-on-Nasdaq-Through-Merger-With-ACE-Convergence](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210107005892/en/Achronix-to-List-on-Nasdaq-Through-Merger-With-ACE-Convergence)\n\n(4) [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/achronix-is-said-in-talks-for-merger-with-blank-check-firm-ace](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/achronix-is-said-in-talks-for-merger-with-blank-check-firm-ace)",

        "selftext": "AMD is reporting their Q4 2020 results on the 26th (estimated). As a long-term investor and given all the events in the past months I believe AMD is still undervalued at $95.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Intel struggles**\n\nAs is known, Intel has been struggling to keep up with AMD when it comes to the CPU market. Intel is reporting their Q4 on the 21th. There is a chance that they announce any kind of further delays in their 7nm or an even weaker outlook than expected. This has been reinforced by the fact that Intel\u2019s CES presentation was disappointing to many. This could obviously be beneficial to AMD in the runup to their earnings. AMD popped 12% on Intel Q2 report when they first announced their delays. We could get a glimpse off production capacities (and issues) tomorrow when TSMC FY report comes out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMD Q4 and FY**\n\nEPS Q4 consensus estimate is 0.47 with a range between 0.43 to 0.58. I believe revenue will be higher than expected, mainly due to the huge demand in the console market (PS5/Xbox) but also the PC/notebook market in general since half of the world was in (semi) lockdown for some parts of Q3/Q4. The main thing I am hoping for is that profit margin stays (roughly) the same at 44%, even though margins on consoles are very thin. If they manage to maintain a margin above 40%, EPS could end up 0.55, which would be a 360% increase with respect to Q4 2019 and 280% year on year. That would be very impressive, given the fact that AMD is considered to still be in their growth stage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2021&amp;2022 Outlook**\n\nBut the main thing to look out for is the guidance for the coming years. Given the continuing lockdowns, the fact that all the market segments they are in (consoles/PC\u2019s/laptops/servers) are booming and the fact that they have GPU\u2019s that can go head to head with NVDA\u2019s I think they could raise their outlook for the coming year as well as 2022. Especially when the Xilinx merger falls trough and they have an increased TAM (total Accessible Market). Estimated EPS for the coming years are 1.83 and 2.42 but with all the mentioned headwinds EPS targets of 2.00+ and 2.75 are not crazy. This would imply P/E\u2019s off 34 for 2022 which is lower than ASML\u2019s for example (50). Hence a stock price of 105-115 is a fair target in the short term and 137,50-145 as a long-term target.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Booming Market**\n\nFinally, we have been in the biggest bull market in a long time, mainly driven by central bank money. Biden is planning a 2.8T stimulus package in the coming weeks. The rising tide has lifted all boats, leading to insane PE valuations across the markets (Lemonade trading at 150x FORWARD P/E for example). A forward PE of 34 for AMD is a way better bet in my opinion.\n\ntl;dr: Buy AMD before we go 100+ \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nPosition:\n\n2750 shares, 5000 LT warrants, 200 29Jan\u201921 100Calls.",

        "selftext": "Bottom line up front: assuming the deal goes through at the stated timeline and price point, and using conservative estimates of both companies' growth trajectories, AMD will be trading at no less than $150/share by spring 2023, representing 24% gain per year for 2.5 years, using the January 7 closing price of $95.16. If its price multiples increase to fall within the range of NVDA, QCOM, QRVO, upside is $300 to $450 per share by mid-2023 (or higher, if you want to use a more aggressive growth trajectory). \n\n \\-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are two assumptions in play that are by no means a done deal that are serving as the basis for my calculations. They are:\u00a0\n\n1) They will complete the deal as planned by the end of 2021, meaning they will meet unspecified pre-conditions and receive regulator approval  \n2) The all-stock purchase will be completed for the stated price of $35 billion.\u00a0\n\nIf those assumptions hold true, then the following is also true:\u00a0\n\nThe current fair market value for AMD stock, if XLNX's current market cap and outstanding shares are folded into the mix, is $100.96/share, based on today's XLNX price, or $101.14 based on the year-end $35 billion purchase price. The latter represents a 6.33% increase over the 7 January 2021 AMD closing price of $95.16/share. This is only based on up-to-date market cap figures and most-recent-quarter earnings figures, which are a good three months out of date at this point.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, in the press releases and earnings calls where the CEOs discussed the merger, one of the points that came out was that the companies have a lot of overlap when it comes to their business operations and R&amp;D. Within 18 months of the merger, or late spring 2023, that means they will be able to [cut $300 million in annual expenses](https://www.crn.com/slide-shows/components-peripherals/the-35b-amd-xilinx-acquisition-7-big-things-to-know/2), simply through synergy of eliminating functional overlap. Given the following from the most recent quarterly reports, covering 3 months of operations ending 26 Sep 2020:\u00a0\n\n1) XLNX net earnings were $193.8m, or $775.2m annualized  \n2) AMD net earnings were $390m, or $1.56b annualized  \n3) Combined earnings are $2.33b\n\nThat means that net earnings will be increased by 13%, just in cutting overlapping expenses. That means that, assuming today's earnings and today's share prices, and combining the financials of both companies, the fair market value for AMD as of early- to mid-2023 is $114, based on annualized earnings numbers that are already three months old.\u00a0\n\nUsing conservative extrapolation of recent growth trajectories, and using today's price multiples\\*, it's conservative to estimate that AMD will be trading for $150/share by June 2023. Based on the current share price of 95.12, that's an annualized growth of 23.96%.\u00a0\n\n\\*If for whatever reason there's a market downturn in this time, AMD's performance could live up to these numbers, but the price multiples could decrease. This represents nearly all remaining risk of inaccuracy, outside the stated assumptions.\n\nPlease fire away at this. Poke your holes and make your arguments.
