        "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been riding AMD\u2019s cock since late June and have made some great returns, especially in the past two weeks. That being said, today I sold my remaining call contracts on the stock. No, not because I think AMD is going to drop (although it will have price pullback all the way down to $77)- but because I think there\u2019s an opportunity that many investors (including you autists and bag holders) are overlooking.\n\nINTC took a massive hit the last two weeks (-$13.42 between 07/20-07/31) , following a pump on AMD after their Q2 earnings beat, with the additional help of many news outlets covering the AMD versus INTC battle. In the midst of all of this, INTC decides to let everyone know that they will not be manufacturing chips anymore- which sealed the deal on AMD being a dominant force in the chip manufacturing industry. \n\nI see a lot of people, especially on this retarded reddit page full of blind option traders (with the exception of the 10% who know what they are doing) talk about how \u201cINTC is going to drop all the way down to $32\u201d... \n\n\n\n- Here is what you need to understand about Intel -\n\nSince 2014, Intel\u2019s revenue in the Client Computing Group (chip manufacturing) has dropped almost 7% in 6 years. You cannot let this news regarding Intel\u2019s switch in corporate direction give jurisdiction on whether you think the corporation will be of any value a year from now. It is obvious that Intel has been slowing the production of their chips for atleast two years now, and they have slowly been shifting in a different direction because of an increase in revenue provided from the data sector.\n\n\n\nSo what does this all mean?\n\nThe fact that Intel has cut the manufacturing of chips is actually a good thing for the corporation, whether you think so or not. It has been a slowly-decaying revenue stream for years, and the money can be implemented in other sectors in which Intel has seen yearly-growth in revenue.\n\nI know, it\u2019s hard. Intel isn\u2019t making chips, doesn\u2019t make sense right? Yea it kind of doesn\u2019t make sense. BUT, in a broader scheme of things, it does. They have been getting killed by their competitors for years, so the move seems appropriate.\n\n\n\nINTC STOCK\n\nThe only times INTC stock has dropped below $50, in the past 3 years, were for the following reasons:\n\nAugust to February 2018- Intel suffers scrutiny for announcing that they are shifting their focus away from chip making and towards A.I., memory solutions, cloud computing, and IoT.\n\nJuly to August 2019- News articles released regarding AMD\u2019s new Ryzen chips and their comparison to Intel.\n\nMarch 2020- Do i really need to explain this drop\n\n\n\nConsensus\n\nINTC has been hinting for YEARS that they are leaving the chip manufacturing sector and turning towards other profitable ones. Their latests announcement shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, but if you are someone who hasn\u2019t followed them for years- then it may seem like one.\n\n\n\nThe reason you are reading this\n\nINTC 60C - exp 01/15/21 \nThese \u201crelatively small\u201d leap contracts are sold for pennies on the fucking dollar right now. If you read what I just wrote, which I\u2019m sure most of you won\u2019t- then you would understand that this move has a lot potential. Right now, INTC isn\u2019t gonna drop any more. If it goes below $40, then maybe I\u2019m wrong.\n\nBut I\u2019m never wrong.\n\n\n\nAmd to the moon, but lets not be retarded on how we value a major corporation like this. I mean cmon. LOL",

        "selftext": "Alright guys so I'm one of the hosts on a YouTube channel named \"Max Tech\".  \nI previously did YouTube work for the channel \"Appleinsider\" since 2016, making videos on Apple products which include Mac computers with Intel chips. \n\nI also grew up playing video games and building custom PCs right when AMD started to release six-core and 8-core processors that were cheaper than Intel CPUs and targeted towards gamers.  \n\nEven though the Intel chips were better for gaming, I still bought AMD because they were cheaper. Intel maintained the lead for many years since games really only used 4 cores, and Intel chips gave more consistent frame rates for gaming.\n\nAt one point, it was clear to me and to everyone else that Intel was intentionally holding off from innovating and improving their performance because they already owned a bulk of the market share. They realized that they could make more profit by making small improvements every year, while AMD was busting their ass trying to figure out how they can compete. (it was ultimately the gaming and custom PC market) \n\nMeanwhile.. Apple was using Intel chips quite successfully in their Mac computers the like MacBooks and iMacs. And Apple was also using their XEON chips for their higher-end machines. And of course, Intel was killing it in the server market.\n\nNow in 2013, Intel announced that they were working on their new 10nm chip process and that it should be ready to launch in 2015, and they said their 7nm chips should launch in 2017. \n\nBack to Intel, over the new few years, Intel delayed 10nm to 2016... and then to 2017.. and then to late 2019... We are now in 2020 and Intel is still shipping 14+++++ nm chips for high-end machines like the 2020 5K Apple iMac that was just released yesterday. Only laptops are getting the actual 10nm chips right now. \n\nIn 2017, AMD shocked the world by announcing their new Ryzen chips, and then also their Threadripper chips, and ever since then, they've been quickly catching up to Intel in terms of both performance and price. \n\nBecause of this, Intel instantly started lowering the price of their chips, and in 2018, they finally made 6-core chips for the MacBook Pro. 8-core chips in 2019, and now 10-core chips in 2020. This is an obvious and desperate move to try and compete with AMD. \n\nBecause Intel's 10nm chips were not ready in 2015 or 2016, Apple's redesigned 2016 MacBook Pro which was thinner than ever before, had overheating issues. The overheating was severe in 2018 with the 6-core chips that Intel made in fear of AMD. \n\nThere were even leaked emails from Intel executives worried about AMD's price to performance beating out Intel. \n\nAnd right now, it is well known that AMD is making BETTER price-to-performance x86 chips. \n\nThe MOST important part of this discussion is that the tech community as a whole, including or YouTube and Reddit, are now convinced that AMD is the way to go. I've seen countless comments on my videos that are dissing on Intel chips and wishing that Apple would switch to using Intel. \n\nIf we make a build guide video using an Intel processor, we get shamed and called dumb for not using an AMD chip. Our Mac Pro videos got a ton of negative feedback because Apple is stupid for using Intel chips. Our 2020 MacBook Pro videos were getting comments dissing on Intel's 10th-gen chips. The entire community is starting to hate Intel and preferring AMD.  \n\nAMD stock has increased over 11x since they announced the first Ryzen chips in August of 2016.  \nIntel stock has only increased 38% since that same date. \n\nAnd looking towards the future.. Intel has recently delayed their 7nm chips until late 2022 or 2023. This caused their stock price to tank at they last earnings call. \n\nThere's even now a class-action lawsuit against Intel because of this delay. \n\nThis also caused their chief of chip engineering to resign, and they reorganized their entire chip team. \n\nThey've even discussed outsourcing their future 6nm, 5nm and 3nm chip production to their rival foundry TSMC because they've lost confidence in their own foundry. \n\nSo it's clear that Intel is getting killed by AMD with each passing year, and the tech community knows it. (Which is VERY important)   \n\n\nThis brings us into the Apple and TSMC portion of this DD.   \n\n\nBack in 2013, Apple announced their A7 chip for their iPhone 5s, the first 64 bit smartphone chip, and ever since then, there was a massive performance war between Apple and Qualcomm, fighting to create the fastest smartphone chips, in which Apple ultimately won. \n\n(The A13 in the iPhone 11 Pro is still much faster than the Snapdragon 865+ which was just recently released this year) \n\nStuck in the middle of this battle was TSMC, which has been the EXCLUSIVE manufacturer of Apple Silicon chips for their iPhones and iPads since the A10 chip in 2016. \n\nAnd in 2018, Apple released their 11\" iPad Pro with the A12X chip manufactured by TSMC's 7nm process. This iPad from 2 years ago is so powerful that it still outperforms the new 2020 13\" MacBook Pro with Intel's 10th gen chip in both processor AND graphics performance. \n\nNow, Apple is about to announce their iPhone 12 in about a month that's gonna pack the A14 chip which is being built on TSMC's brand new 5nm process. \n\nAnd of course, the next iPad Pro will get a much improved A14X 5nm chip, and it's the same story for the Apple Silicon Mac chips that will start being released later this year in October/November. \n\nI'm of course, talking about Apple finally ditching Intel and moving forward with their own chips. This makes sense for Apple for various different reasons.\n\n1: They can run iPhone &amp; iPad apps on their Macs.\n\n2: They control both the software and hardware for incredibly amounts of performance optimization.\n\n3: They can make sure every new Mac update gets a new chip with performance improvements instead of relying on Intel to release improved chips. \n\n4: This is of course, much cheaper for Apple since they don't have to pay Intel the high price of their chips. \n\n5: They don't have to deal with overheating issues since most Intel chips are still on 14nm technology, therefore running very hot and using a lot of power.   \n\n\nAnd there's a good chance that the very first Apple Silicon Mac chips are gonna outperform the current Intel chips, stay much cooler and give you much better battery life. \n\nJust to give you some perspective in terms of how Intel's 10nm compares to TSMC's 5nm..\n\nIntel 10nm transistor density: around 100 million transistors per square millimeter.\n\nTSMC 5nm transistor density: around 171 million transistors per square millimeter. \n\n  \nTSMC has already confirmed that they're working on risk production of their new 3nm process in 2021,  with those chips going into 2022 iPhones, iPads and Macs. \n\nSo here's what the future looks like:\n\n  \nIntel 7nm in late 2022/2023 : 240 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nTSMC 3nm shipping in 2022 Apple products: 290 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nAnd apparently, TSMC is already working on plans for their 2nm process for 2024.   \n\n\nAnd due to Intel's past, there's a very good chance that Intel could delay 7nm even further, especially since they had to restructure their entire chip team, while TSMC has been on point.   \n\n\nSo the future isn't looking very bright for Intel's chip technology compared to TSMC. No wonder why they wanted to outsource their chips from them.   \n\n\nAnd one last bit on Apple's switch to their own chips built by TSMC. \n\nApple has already given developers their transition kit which is a Mac Mini with an A12Z chip from their iPad Pro. \n\nOne developer tweeted this: \"At this point, I think that the first gen Apple Silicon machines will be faster at running x86 code than an actual x86...\"  \n\n\nWhat he means is that Apple's new Rosetta 2 emulation software is so good that he thinks it'll outperform Intel chips even though it's not running natively for ARM. \n\nSo basically, Apple made the right choice by ditching Intel.   \n\n\nAnd if Apple proves everyone wrong by coming out with incredibly great Macs thanks to their switch to their own Apple Silicon ARM-based chips, then there's a VERY good chance that the rest of the market will follow them and start developing ARM-based chips for laptops.\n\nThis will force Windows to start heavily investing in their ARM-based Windows software. \n\nAnd if you didn't already know.. Intel is FAR behind in the ARM-based chip world.   \n\n\nNow, the most common argument I hear is this: Apple is only a tiny part of Intel's business, and while that may be true.. the MOST important thing is the public's view of Intel.  \n\n\nThe tech community is already starting to despise Intel as a brand name because of their overpriced processors and the fact that AMD is beginning to CRUSH them. \n\nJust wait until Apple Silicon Macs start getting released and people realize that ARM-chips have a ton of potential, and they'll start hating Intel even more. \n\nThis will cause Intel's brand recognition and reputation to get absolutely destroyed in favor of AMD and Apple Silicon. This alone will lead to less market share. And what will happen if Nvidia or Apple buy out ARM? \n\nAnd by the way, there are now more and more ARM-based servers popping up, so there's a good chance that Intel will start to lose market share on the server side if ARM-based servers prove themselves. (They use less power so this makes sense for server farms)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is that Intel just got ditched by Apple.. and they're getting killed by AMD and TSMC. ARM is coming VERY quickly and Intel is NOT ready. They have been plagued with delay after delay, and all of this drama will ruin the confidence of their staff, leading to lowered productivity. It's not looking good for Intel for the long-term.  \n\n\nAs of right now, Intel stock is very cheap, and you might make a few bucks if you trade short term.. but I wouldn't hold Intel stock long term.   \n\n\nIf you want more in-depth info with visuals and extra details, you can check out two videos I made on the Max Tech Youtube channel: \n\n\"How Intel Lost the CPU Race..\"\n\n\"Apple Silicon ARM Chips vs Intel x86 Processors for Mac?\"\n\nHopefully you enjoyed this DD.",

        "selftext": "Listen up fuckers.\n\n\nI\u2019m not ludicrously experienced with options, but I can recognize some bullshit when I see it. This arcticle [(Intel \u2018Stunning Failure\u2019 Heralds End of an Era for U.S. Chip Sector)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-stunning-failure-heralds-end-030711424.html) and a bunch of other \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b news caused $INTC to drop off the face of the earth last week. \n\n\nI kinda fail to see the drama. Intel has always outsourced it's chips. Maybe it's doing it more now, but even 8 years ago when my brother and I built our first PC's. His chip was from Mexico, mine was from Taiwan. \n\n\nFurthermore, TSMC, the company this article says Intel should sell factories to, has been the heavyweight chip maker for a decade or more.\n\n\nNvidia and AMD for example, they are the two graphics card manufacturers. BOTH of them have their chips made by TSMC. These companies do all their designing, but in the end everything is made by TSMC anyway. At least, a lions share of it.\n\n\nNow, Intel definitely has struggled in the recent market, but that's because they've demolished AMD in the performance chip market for nearly two decades. There was no reason to keep pushing their envelope, spending billions on R&amp;D for a better product. All they had to do was refine their Lake series processors and they'd continue to rake in a ton of profit. This profit was used to expand their market to the mobile industry. Particularly laptops. For a long time it was hard to get an apple product with any kind of processor that wasn't Intel.\n\n\nThey're not going away. They're not crashing.\n\n\nThey're just finally seeing AMD pass them in one market. This has caused other markets to start to shift due to uncertainty about who the \"best\" chip manufacturer is, but trust me - we will see Intel back with a fiery vengeance.\n\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Intel pops out some high core count chips that are pushing 5.0-5.5 all core clock count speeds. Once they scale down their transistor size... Oof. It's going to be a Rottweiler back in the pit. \n\n\n\nTL;DR INTC $55c 09/18, but load up on whatever the hell you want, these contracts are CHEAP",

        "selftext": "Microchip is a semiconductor company out of Arizona with a Mkt. Cap of about $26 Billion. They make chips for a bunch of products like Cyber Security, Wireless Products, and Telecommunications. The thing is that they earnings on 08/04 Tuesday after hours. It is very obvious that are going to beat earnings. Why? Because look at the rest of the industry: Qualcomm, Intel, AMD, Qorvo, and IBM have all destroyed earnings. And since Intel just told everyone that they're too retarded to even make potato chips all the smaller time semiconductor competitors are making bank, example: AMD and QCOM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMicrochip isn't just your run of the mill small back water company. They actually make acquisitions of other chip companies and use their intellectual property to increase the quality and market share of their own chips. Microchip was found in 1989 and has since made 16 acquistions!!! \n\nYou may, for some reason, say that only big boy chip companies are gonna beat earnings. Well if you don't believe me think about the industries that depend on Microchip for their needs: online educational servicing companies, cloud servicing companies, cyber security companies, telecommunications companies, and just software/tech companies in general. What the hell do we already know about these industries from earnings season? We know they absolutely massacred earnings estimates as everything during COVID has gone tech. Yes, the age of actual industry is dead. Now there are only tech companies that get pumped because of sky high demand (looking at you Apple) and Amazon that sells random shit and still has a tech company valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and you know what's awesome because we have all this knowledge? MCHP is expected to post $1.43 EPS on tuesday, but last year on this quarter they posted $1.41 EPS. What a fucking joke, we should expect at least 40-50% growth in that number from COVID induced semiconductor demand. Not to mention, I think MCHP is gaining market share and could be a big player in a few years in the semiconductor industry. \n\nYou might be hesitant because of my last post on $TER, a chip supplier that many people played incorrectly. I say to you, fuck you. I made money on that play because I sold directly at market open after they destroyed earnings like my data said they would. So if you feel even the slightest FOMO look at these charts from last week: QCOM, QRVO, and AMD; and then tell me what you think MCHP (the same industry) will do!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; MCHP $107c 08/07",

Recent excessive beatdown due to AMD getting the spotlight and chip delays. Consolidating around \\~$48 primed for a gap up. Intel is still insanely profitable with lots of collaborations and products lined up. Also safe from any COVID-19 related shutdowns.\n2. Consistent Grind Up history after beatdowns. Tends to slowly increase, but expecting a Pop tomorrow or Wednesday due to some factors listed below.\n3. Ex-dividend date this Thursday. Dividends are only distributed if bought before the date so run ups are higher likely tomorrow and Wednesday. Dividend also demonstrates the fundamental strength of the company.\n4. Alot of Insider buying recently with leaked Institutional buying this week(sorry can\u2019t say who but yeah going to get called out but it is what it isss).\n5. Stimulus package confirmation this week may cause excessive euphoria in market-leading to even more buying.\n\nSafe price target would be \\~50.4 and could easily run past 52+. Hope this helps!",

        "selftext": "TSM has been on my radar since I started saving to invest in 2018 because of AMD / GlobalFoundries. Really interesting business model for Semis AMD has.\n\nIn 2019, you couldn't get away from heating up of the trade war. Congress began debating SAR for HK around the end of  Hong Kong's \"2019 Summer of Love\" and rumors of what happens in the \"re-education\" camps / \"Where did the Falun Gong practitioners go?\" This is important because of the SWIFT system of world banking. HK is how they get dollars.\n\nThen in November of 2019, this happened..\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Human_Rights_and_Democracy_Act#Related_bill\n\nArizona plant news is where the tin foil ends and the conviction began for me. The Foundry is basically THE corporation of Taiwan. The Great Cheetoh has been making deals around the world, and technically Taiwan isn't China. We have recent armament deals with Taiwan and Japan to prove it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TLKt9yPb-f0\n\nWhy not?? Seemed like the American thing to do and there is a republican in office hell-bent on decoupling US communications tech from the CCP aka ROC.\n\nIn Feb / March... Rona. April the economic fallout, news about bad PPE and tests from China being sold to Italy. In May all the US boats in Taiwanese waters and the rhetoric worldwide basically reflecting that the world isn't happy with the CCP.\n\nI had the balance for a RH call and it made more sense than an airline play at the time, so i got in.\n\nAnti CCP rhetoric started heating up and bi-partisan on the YouTube's, by the way, it seems 2020 is the year NBC (Comcast) discovered ad-revenue. Thank you Lester.\n\nAt this point morning wood for TSM was a regular thing, so i set my limits on call options for both accounts, and incorporated into the LT DRIP. Thank you Papa Powell. I'm still poor, couldn't have done it without you...\n\nThen it seemed to be heating up at the end of May. Everyone is like WTF 'mate on the \"One Belt. One Road.\" Initiative, both the geographical and digital. People are really starting to report on not-so-great stories out of China, and not just tinfoil or Epoch Times channels.\n\nLot of shade being thrown on China tech, and things are heating up in S China Sea.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6KiLhxgIBys\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BTgDYhtr-LU\n\n...looks like Chy-na is on everyone's shit list, including Australia. Forex folks know how dope-tied the Aussie's and Kiwis are to CCP trade relations.\n\n The rumor was potential decouple from China. I mean the world is kinda dope-tied to Santa's little elves. I just realized how weird Christmas will be...\n\nI bought my shares for both accounts as per the voodoo ritual of purchasing at least 1 stock of a long term call strategy. Got my hand deep (for me) in the cookie jar May and June.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/xb7ptte\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/ToFdT3z\n\nThird week of July called a bull flag on hourly:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hwz949/daily_discussion_thread_for_july_24_2020/fz4bi1b?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nJuly 24th, I got filled to the teeth in RH and my now free play in Webull was up 1,600%.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/0fB3FEp\n\nTHEN July 27th, I closed my \"free play\" in Webull at $1,250. A little over 3,000% between 2 contracts that cost $75 total.\n\nAlong the way, i picked up RH tendies and rebalanced the cash / bought more contracts and shares. They're officially part of the DRIP.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/UFKPnOz\n\n\nRelated post I made last week regarding TSM and INTC. Any thoughts on how US semi production will play out for them?\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i0jqtu/opinions_on_taiwan_semiconductor/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nLast week, The Fool confirmed many of the LT bias I had been building up on a win for The Foundry since November. All hype, or real talk?\n\nhttps://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/31/3-tailwinds-are-lifting-tsmcs-stock-to-new-all-tim.aspx\n\nFinancial analysis-\nThis guy is boring af, but he goes through the numbers that no one likes to read, records in mobile, and is cool enough to zoom in on what he is talking about.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wVxF7wwuogo\n\nCan anyone see a downside other than \"COVID CLAP Trumps all\"? Maybe I've been chewing too much YouTube tinfoil on lunch, but the limit orders that are closing 930-4pm are making me think I've hit the Autistic Lottery. Wish I had bought more.\n\nFriday, all I could see was a bull flag on the 4hr and 30min charts. Monday 8/03 it hasn't shit the bed at 11am EST. Maybe thats just the tin foil talking again and this is the ceiling.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/nRYKBB5",

        "selftext": "Alright retards, strap in. I read the FAA's 96 page summary on the 737 MAX and have the following to report. Here is the link in case you want to read for [yourself](https://www.faa.gov/news/media/attachments/737-MAX-RTS-Preliminary-Summary-v-1.pdf).\n\nThere were 7 different safety items addressed in the report. The biggest issue was the Angle of Attack (AOA) sensor and the way it allowed the pilots to interact with the plane. This sensor would basically override any actions the Pilots wanted to take and the false readings lead to the crashes years ago. The AOA sensor is manufactured by a private company called Rosemount Aerospace.\n\nAnother issue was with the \"maneuvering characteristics augmentation system\" (MCAS) which is the flight control system that is heavily impacted by all the sensors on the plane (especially the AOA).\n\nLooking forward, the FAA has clearly stated requirements that will allow the 737 MAX to return to flight around the world. they are:\n\n*  Completion of all TAB return to service (RTS) recommendations and acceptance by the TAB of those completed actions. (these are the 7 things about AOA and MCAS)\n* Completion by BA and Acceptance by FAA the new regulatory requirements\n* Official revisions to documentation/training for the 737 MAX\n\nAdditionally, there are specific requirements before it can fly in the US:\n\n* For delivered/yet to be delivered 737s, all FAA changes must be incorporated and updated based on the above changes\n* All Pilots must be trained and certified on the new changes BA will be making to aircraft operation.\n\nAfter this is compelte, FAA will issue a  Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (CANIC) (example [here](https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/media/CAN-2019-05.pdf)). this basically tells the international 737 MAX owners to:\n\n*  strongly encouraged to mandate the pilot training identified in the 737 MAX FSB report as a minimum starting point\n* be responsible for the continued airworthiness and continued operational safety (COS) of aircraft on its registry \n\nThe rest of the report breaks down in engineering terms what is wrong and how it is going to be fixed.\n\n**TL;DR: FAA is making BA rework all of its 737 MAXs. BA will likely be taking those cost directly out of its own profit margins. Buy calls / stock on their top suppliers, who BA will have to pay for all the new equipment\\***\n\n[**BA TOP SUPPLIERS**](https://csimarket.com/stocks/competitionNO4.php?supply&amp;code=BA)\n\n* TAITRON COMPONENTS - TAIT (no options)\n* MSFT - whatever you retards are buying for Tik Tok is fine. Leaps will be good here as well\n* TSM - Jan21 80c should work. if you are cheap do 90\n* Intel - more importantly AMD is a supplier and they will eat intel's lunch. Dell and IBM also provide them chips.\n* other big defense companies that subcontract, LMT, NOC, RTX etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*DISCLAIMER**: I am not an engineer, I am a retarded PFA for a DFEN company.

I put a limit order to fill at 'x' price a few weeks ago.  I also own some shares of Intel (NTC)... we all know how that's going.  I got freaked out and pulled the trigger to sell all my TMUS shares once it was at a comfortable number for me. So I owned 0 shares.   Then the share price met the limit order value, and sold off another equal number of shares.  So now I'm in the hole and own 'negative' shares? I didn't think this is even possible.  My checking account looks likes I have money from the sell of negative shares, so I tried buying back the stock to balance it back to zero. No luck. When I got to make the purchase, my checking balance is 0.  I'm using stock slices with Schwab.  \n\nWhat do I do? Is there anything I can do?

I'm not predicting a second crash, just looking for companies that are likely to decline no matter what. In a crash, they'll just decline more steeply, offsetting losses to long positions... in theory.\n\nFor example, I was thinking of buying puts in MAC ($7-ish)  back when it was around $35. They had been in decline for a long time while their competitors were doing fine.\n\nMaybe INTC? I don't think their troubles will be over soon. If Apple shows that custom ARM chips are superior, others will jump ship. ARM is making inroads even in the enterprise market.  (If NVDA does buy ARM, that would give them a huge advantage: long NVDA. Also long TSM as the actual manufacturer of Apple's custom silicon, but damn it, I should be looking for shorts!)\n\nNNN: It's already gone down quite a lot, but they are still paying a hefty dividend. I'm not sure that's sustainable while people are staying away from malls, and if it's cut, the share price will drop further.\n\nKODK: It was all hype anyway, and it's already on its way down.\n\nAnyone else got some ideas?",
