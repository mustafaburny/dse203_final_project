        "selftext": "Because I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gnwgj4/the_phun_just_wont_stop_it_took_a_huge_dive/) among many but it has [this reply to it which made me curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gnwgj4/comment/frelygf). **SO TO THE FACTS:**\n\nAfter writing already June 14 that a deal Phunware (NASDAQ:PHUN) announced was suspicious, I asked a journalist to look into that deal, with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NASDAQ:HPE) which Phunware announced May 20.\n\nCaused its stock to jump from 0.67 to 1.57 after announcing this, *getting them above the Delisting Notice from NASDAQ they received April 17*.\n\n**IT'S FAKE. SOURCE:**\n\n[It's in the article linked to in my Tweet in my Thread here](https://twitter.com/olejonbj/status/1328789813378551809?s=19) or [read it directly here](https://www.miamiherald.com/article247234629.html).\n\nWhat would the market &amp; company situation have been for Phunware if investors knew back then?\n\nAfter e.g. [Honeywell confirmed the partnership Phunware claimed they have gotten with them was FAKE](https://twitter.com/honeywell/status/1313952992991870982?s=19), asking Phunware over a month ago to take it down, *but they don't*, getting a similar answer from HPE would be much bigger.\n\nThis is kind of a follow-up to an [article in The New Yorker I was a main source to](https://www.newyorker.com/news/campaign-chronicles/the-trump-campaigns-mobile-app-is-collecting-massive-amounts-of-voter-data), published September 13 (yes I have clearance to take credit in public as my name was supposed to be there - it accidentally was taken out), but the *Actual News Outlet behind this article*, has obviously, well, more resources. I've been contacted because of my Thread by journalists, though can't say which ones, but I do help out wherever I can. \n\nMy Thread was really just going to look into the app, but Phunware popped up immediately and had to be looked into. A lot outside my knowledge there, so little by little in the Thread, with help from some anonymous sources and journalists. As you may know, Twitter Threads can't be edited later, so, *better look from the Last to the First Tweet in the Thread*.\n\n*DISCLAIMER: I'm not an investor, not a US Citizen, although Phunware thinks so, that I am 2 actually, with my skills it's not that hard. Reason for posting here: I kept getting results from this subreddit on certain searches when searching basics.*",
