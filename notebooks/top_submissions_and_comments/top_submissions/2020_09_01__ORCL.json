        "selftext": "Snowflake (SNOW) will go public today. The data warehousing company will be the biggest IPO of the year and it has gotten a lot of attention lately. Salesforce and even Berkshire Hathaway will both be buying 3.1 million stocks, good for $500,000,000 in total. They got to buy them for $80 per share.\n\nThis week, the company's underwriters have upped the price range from $75-$85 to $100-$110, which is an increase of 31% due to greater demand. They then decided that this was still not good enough so the stock will go public at $120 per share.\n\nCan this be justified? Maybe. Their revenue increased with 130% in the first half of the year yoy. They're on track to bring in $500 mln in revenue this year. We all know that investors get really excited by cloud companies and pay a hefty premium for them, because they keep generating revenue during lockdowns and high growth rates are expected to continue over the coming years.\n\nNow, here's the quote we've all been waiting for:\n\n\"For the investor, a too-high purchase price for the stock of an excellent company can undo the effects of a subsequent decade of favorable business developments.\"\n\nThe irony is that Buffet himself is involved in this highly priced IPO. Yes, we all know that the company will probably do great over the next few years. The data warehousing industry will have a size of around $35 bln in 2025. That's just a little bigger than the current market cap of Snowflake($33.3 bln). Last February, they were only valued at $12.7 bln, and with a P/S ratio of 50, the stock is more expensive than Zoom. What you really should be asking yourself is: how much of their expected growth is already priced in? Are you willing to pay 50% more than that institutional parties had to?\n\nI'm not saying whether to buy in or not, I just wanted to give this piece of advice by the Oracle to you. Never buy out of FOMO and good luck investing y'all.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 9, 2020**\n\nStocks shot up today and recovered some losses after sharp declines in big tech stocks. After several red days, shares of Amazon (AAPL), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and other big companies rallied. On a dour note, reopening stocks (travel, cruise lines, airlines, hotels, etc) were down after AstraZeneca (AZN) announced it had its COVID-19 vaccine trial paused. \n\nThe S&amp;P finished 2.08% up, the Nasdaq was 2.92%, leading the day, and the Dow finished 1.68% up. The volatility index (VIX) was down 4.8%, indicating increased risk appetite in traders.\n\nToday, it was announced that AstraZeneca, a forerunner in the development of the COVID vaccine announced a pause of their experimental trial after one patient became more ill, pledging to make safety a priority and take the time necessary to let science prevail. This setback comes in stark contrast to politicians and governments who seem to imply a cure is just around the corner. Shares of AstraZeneca sank 2%, while those of companies competing to develop a Covid-19 vaccine including Moderna (MRNA) and Novavax (NVAX) rose. \n\nUS oil prices plunged nearly 7% today, after Saudi Aramco, the largest oil producer in the world, announced it would be slashing its selling price to Asia and the United States, per Bloomberg. \"Oil demand globally is really sluggish. All of the low hanging fruit from the global oil recovery has already happened,\" said Michael Tran, managing director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAsia-Us cargo rates are at the highest since March lows.

        "selftext": "I'm not sure I buy this Oracle deal. \n\n**The \"Trump Connection\"**\n\nThe supposed close connection is one guy who hosted a fundraiser for him and is connected to a lady that was part of his transition team. The single fundraiser wouldn't likely represent something significant to Trump, as there are far bigger boosters that Trump seems to be genuinely unaware of ever meeting. \n\nMore significantly, the guy also has ties to China, so the \"connection\" that he might trust would be the woman from Trump's transition team. \n\nThe thing is, Trump was infamously uninvolved in his transition team. When he was told that, before you even know if you won, you put out millions to fund a transition team he balked at the idea. Instead he sat down with Chris Christie and another guy to quickly throw together a list, mostly consisting of people he's never heard of. \n\nThe refusal to pay for the traditional transition process was ultimately the cause of many of Trump's political problems. His administration was plagued from the onset by leaks and administration officials actively working against the administration's agenda. \n\n**The Deal**\n\nThe deal doesn't accomplish anything Trump set out to do. He would have to publicly change the stated terms of his executive order in order for this to be allowed.\n\nIt also does nothing significant to protect American data from spying. Without access to the algorithm, this basically just amounts to an American company with Chinese ties vouching for Tik Tok.\n\n**Trump absolutely prefers a deal with Microsoft**\n\nHe recently redirected the money the US was sending to the WHO to a Gates charity. They're also one of the only companies that isn't being actively targeted by the FCC or the DOJ.\n\nFurther, as Tik Tok's data and algorithm could be used to enhance Bing and finally make it viable MSFT would then pose a serious threat to Google, a company Trump has very publicly opposed due to perceived bias against him. \n\n**China doesn't actually have leverage**\n\nRetaliatory tech tariffs imposed by China would injure companies that Trump largely considers enemies. His proposed change in regulations such that moderated social media would be considered a publisher poses a far greater threat to those companies financially than anything China could do.\n\nFurther, if China doesn't ultimately capitulate Bytedance will lose billions and there will be a looming threat of similar restrictions being placed on other Chinese tech firms. It would likely result in companies like TENCENT taking significant hits. \n\n**Bad Optics**\n\nChanging the terms of his executive order to fit this deal would essentially be conceding defeat. As both candidates have argued that they will take firm stances against China, giving this much ground here would make Trump look incredibly weak. The fact that it might also be spun as corruption to benefit a campaign donor only makes the optics worse. \n\n**Kushner**\n\nThey sent Kushner on CNBC this morning to talk about the deal. While many of you will recognize that name as a significant Trump official, a couple months ago he was quietly demoted as the Trump campaign decided to go in a different direction.\n\nEven in his discussion of the deal this morning, he continued to stress that it will be reviewed by the appropriate regulatory agency and never gave any indication he believes it will pass that review. He had a poker face throughout the interview and had little hopeful commentary. \n\nTL;DR- I don't think this ORCL deal goes through.",

        "selftext": "The ruling followed an emergency hearing Sunday morning in which lawyers for TikTok argued that the administration\u2019s app-store ban would infringe on the company\u2019s First Amendment rights and do irreparable harm to the business.\n\nEarlier this year, President Donald Trump declared that TikTok was a threat to national security and that it must either sell its U.S. operations to U.S. companies or be barred from the country.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Lawyers for TikTok pleaded with a U.S. federal judge on Sunday to delay the Trump Administration\u2019s ban of the popular video sharing program from app stores set to take effect at the end of the day, arguing the move would infringe on First Amendment rights and do irreparable harm to the business.\n\nThe 90-minute hearing came after President Donald Trump declared this summer that TikTok was a threat to national security and that it either sold its U.S. operations to U.S. companies or the app would be barred from the country.\n\nTikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is scrambling to firm up a deal tentatively struck a week ago in which it would partner with tech company Oracle and retailer Walmart and that would get the blessing of the Chinese and American governments. In the meantime, it is fighting to keep the app available in the U.S.\n\nThe ban on new downloads of TikTok, which has about 100 million users in the U.S, was delayed once by the government. A more comprehensive ban is scheduled for November, about a week after the presidential election. Judge Carl Nichols of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said he would make a decision by late Sunday, leaving TikTok\u2019s fate hanging.\n\nIn arguments to Judge Nichols, TikTok lawyer John Hall said that TikTok is more than an app but rather is a \u201cmodern day version of a town square.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that prohibition goes into effect at midnight, the consequences immediately are grave,\u2019\u201d Hall said. \u201cIt would be no different than the government locking the doors to a public forum, roping off that town square\u201d at a time when a free exchange of ideas is necessary heading into a polarized election.\n\nHall called the ban \u201cpunitive,\u201d noting that this is \u201cjust a blunt way to whack the company now while doing nothing to achieve the stated objective of the prohibition. \u201c\n\nTikTok lawyers also argued that a ban on the app would stop tens of thousands of potential viewers and content creators every month and would also hurt its ability to hire new talent. In addition, Hall argued that a ban would prevent existing users from automatically receiving security updates, eroding national security.\n\nJustice Department lawyer Daniel Schwei sought to undercut TikTok lawyers\u2019 argument, saying that Chinese companies are not purely private and are subject to intrusive laws compelling their cooperation with intelligence agencies. The Justice Department has also argued that economic regulations of this nature generally are not subject to First Amendment scrutiny. Plaintiffs can\u2019t claim a First Amendment right in hosting TikTok itself as a platform for others\u2019 speech because merely hosting a platform is not an exercise of the First Amendment, the Justice Department contends.\n\n\u201cThis is the most immediate national security threat,\u201d argued Schwei. \u201cIt is a threat today. It is a risk today and therefore it deserves to be addressed today even while other things are ongoing and playing out.\u201d\n\nSchwei also argued that TikTok lawyers failed to prove it would suffer irreparable business harm.\n\nThe Justice Department laid out its objections to TikTok\u2019s motion for a temporary injunction in a brief under seal, but it was unsealed in redacted form to protect confidential business information.\n\nTrump set the process in motion with executive orders in August that declared TikTok and another Chinese app, WeChat, as threats to national security. The White House says the video service is a security risk because the personal information of its millions of U.S. users could be handed over to Chinese authorities.\n\nTrump has said he would approve a proposed deal in which Oracle and Walmart could initially own a combined 20% of a new U.S. entity, TikTok Global. Trump also said he could retract his approval if Oracle doesn\u2019t have \u201ctotal control.\u201d\n\nThe two sides of the TikTok deal have also appeared at odds over the corporate structure of TikTok Global. ByteDance said last week that it will still own 80% of the U.S. entity after a financing round. Oracle, meanwhile, put out a statement saying that Americans \u201cwill be the majority and ByteDance will have no ownership in TikTok Global.\u201d\n\nChinese media have criticized the deal as bullying and extortion, suggesting that the Chinese government is not happy with the arrangement. ByteDance said Thursday it has applied for a Chinese technology export license after Beijing tightened control over exports last month in an effort to gain leverage over Washington\u2019s attempt to force an outright sale of TikTok to U.S. owners.\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/archive-donald-trump-ad614fb615efe904057a1911985bb108?utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter",

        "selftext": "Oracle Corp. ORCL +5.49% won the bidding for the U.S. operations of the video-sharing app TikTok, people familiar with the matter said, beating out Microsoft Corp. MSFT +1.90% in a high-profile deal to salvage a social-media sensation that has been caught in the middle of a geopolitical standoff.\n\nOracle is set to be announced as TikTok\u2019s \u201ctrusted tech partner\u201d in the U.S., and the deal is likely not to be structured as an outright sale, the people said.\n\nThe next step is for the White House and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. to approve the deal, said one of the people, adding that the participants believe it satisfies the concerns around data security that have been previously raised by the U.S. government.\n\nOn Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed that his office received a bid proposal from Oracle for TikTok\u2019s operations over the weekend and said that the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. would review it this week.\n\n\u201cWe will be reviewing that at the CFIUS committee this week and then will be making a recommendation to the president and reviewing it with him,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said on CNBC. \u201cFrom our standpoint, we\u2019ll need to make sure that the code is, one, secure, Americans\u2019 data is secure, that the phones are secure and we\u2019ll be looking to have discussions with Oracle over the next few days with our technical teams.\u201d\n\nMr. Mnuchin also said the Oracle deal includes a commitment to establish TikTok as a global company headquartered in the U.S., which he said would mean 20,000 new jobs.\n\nThe Treasury secretary said he wouldn\u2019t go into all the details of the plan, but clarified that the deadline for the sale of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations is Sept. 20.\n\nThe move by TikTok\u2019s parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., comes days after the Chinese government threw negotiations into doubt when it issued new export restrictions late last month on the kind of artificial intelligence technology TikTok uses. The algorithms, which determine the videos served to users and are seen as TikTok\u2019s secret sauce, were considered part of the deal negotiations up until the Chinese policy change raising questions among the parties involved in negotiations over how to value the social-media business.\n\nThe structure of Oracle\u2019s deal wasn\u2019t immediately known, including whether it includes transfer of the algorithms.\n\nTwo people familiar with the Oracle deal said it was more appropriate to call it a partnership, rather than an acquisition, suggesting that there wasn\u2019t an exchange of significant assets. At least some of ByteDance\u2019s existing investors, including U.S. investment firms Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, will get stakes in the venture as part of the deal, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe possibility that a deal might not involve an outright sale was previously reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nPresident Trump has said repeatedly that he would shut down TikTok in the U.S. if it isn\u2019t sold to an American company. In an Aug. 6 executive order, the White House gave ByteDance a 45-day deadline before it would ban the app, which the Trump administration says poses an economic and national-security threat to U.S. interests, if it isn\u2019t sold to a U.S. buyer.\n\nMicrosoft, which had teamed up with Walmart Inc., earlier Sunday said in a statement that it was notified earlier in the day of the decision by ByteDance.\n\n\u201cWe are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok\u2019s users, while protecting national security interests,\u201d the statement said. \u201cTo do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation, and we made these principles clear in our August statement.\u201d\n\nDOES ORACLE\u2019S WINNING BID AVERT A BAN?\n\nA look at the state of play for the video app\u2019s ownership and the prospects for a deal.\n\nIn a statement late Sunday, Walmart suggested it is considering joining the Oracle group, saying it is continuing \u201cdiscussions with ByteDance leadership and other interested parties.\u201d\n\nWhile China\u2019s recently announced trade restrictions made acquiring TikTok\u2019s algorithm tricky, Microsoft remained committed to acquiring the app\u2019s powerful suggestion algorithms, said a person familiar with the matter. Without outright purchase of the algorithms, Microsoft wouldn\u2019t be able to follow through with its stated commitment to national security issues.\n\nOracle\u2019s interest in TikTok is primarily driven by kick-starting its fledgling cloud-computing business, which remains far behind market leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s plans were more ambitious than Oracle, said one person. Owning TikTok would help Microsoft have more presence among everyday consumers, an area it had mostly abandoned to chase after corporate users with the exception of its Xbox gaming business. TikTok would also give Microsoft a treasure trove of data on young and mostly female users, an area it doesn\u2019t have much insight into now.\n\nThe New York Times reported earlier that Microsoft had been notified of the ByteDance decision.\n\nTikTok has soared to around 100 million monthly users in the U.S., from about 11 million in early 2018, and they are considered among the most lucrative in the app\u2019s global user base of about 689 million, though the app still loses money.\n\nOracle wasn\u2019t as obvious a winner in the race for TikTok as Microsoft. While both tech companies have sizable cloud-computing operations and technical capabilities, Oracle is mainly focused on serving business clients and has virtually no experience running a social-media platform or other major consumer-facing business. Microsoft is an even bigger player in business computing but also owns the LinkedIn social-media site and the Xbox videogame business. It also is a much bigger company and has about $136 billion of cash, some three times what Oracle has on hand.",

        "selftext": "These are all daily momentum trade ideas that could be entered at market open and closed same day. \n\n- ORCL: \u201cOracle shares rose as much as 6% in extended trading on Thursday after the software maker reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and quarterly guidance that were better than analysts had expected\u201d [CNBC]. I\u2019m looking at short-term weekly or potentially even daily calls that could be entered at market open as an earnings continuation play if the overall market is trending upwards.\n\n- PTON: \u201cPeloton crushes estimates as sales surge 172%, expects strong demand to continue into 2021. With such strong demand for its bike and treadmill, it said it doesn\u2019t expect to return to \u201cnormalized order-to-delivery windows\u201d in the U.S. before the end of the fiscal second quarter\u201d [CNBC]. I suggested this as an earnings run-up play and we could now potentially play this similar to ORCL as mentioned above. Slightly OTM weekly calls at market open if the overall market sentiment is positive might be a viable option. These could be sold as early as end of day tomorrow.\n\n- AAPL: Apple continued to sell-off today after yesterday bounce-back and has established itself as the QQQ momentum leader over the last days. Short-term calls or puts depending on market sentiment at open might be a viable trade.\n\n- NKLA: Nikola might be the most overvalued company with a market cap &gt; $10B in the US market.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 9, 2020**\n\nStocks shot up today and recovered some losses after sharp declines in big tech stocks. After several red days, shares of Amazon (AAPL), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and other big companies rallied. On a sour note, reopening stocks (travel, cruise lines, airlines, hotels, etc) were down after AstraZeneca (AZN) announced it had its COVID-19 vaccine trial paused.\n\nThe S&amp;P finished 2.08% up, the Nasdaq was 2.92%, leading the day, and the Dow finished 1.68% up. The volatility index (VIX) was down 4.8%, indicating increased risk appetite in traders.\n\nToday, it was announced that AstraZeneca, a forerunner in the development of the COVID vaccine announced a pause of their experimental trial after one patient became more ill, pledging to make safety a priority and take the time necessary to let science prevail. This setback comes in stark contrast to politicians and governments who seem to imply a cure is just around the corner. Shares of AstraZeneca sank 2%, while those of companies competing to develop a Covid-19 vaccine including Moderna (MRNA) and Novavax (NVAX) rose.\n\nUS oil prices plunged nearly 7% today, after Saudi Aramco, the largest oil producer in the world, announced it would be slashing its selling price to Asia and the United States, per Bloomberg. \"Oil demand globally is really sluggish. All of the low hanging fruit from the global oil recovery has already happened,\" said Michael Tran, managing director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAsia-Us cargo rates are at the highest since March lows. For bulls evidence of a rebounding economy, for bears activity is fueled by liquidity and the shoe has yet to drop.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* After falling nearly 20% in the week, Tesla (TSLA) stock roared back today, finishing the day 10.9% up.\n* Big Commerce (BIGC) reported earnings today.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - September 18, 2020**\n\nStocks dropped again today, closing out a volatile week on a sour note. Tech stocks continued pulling back, with many notable stocks breaking through well-established supports. In spite of the Fed\u2019s commitment to keep interest rates low until 2023 and mostly positive economic data, the sell off in tech, which is the largest holding in the three major benchmarks, has dragged the market down. \n\nThis week, tech stocks like Apple (AMZN), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) have declined sharply after hitting consecutive record highs in August. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is the hardest hit, with prices at similar levels to early August. The S&amp;P finished the day 1.12% down, the Nasdaq 1.28% down, the Dow was 0.87% down.\n\nAfter a historic August led by tech stocks, the current volatility in the market has sharply lowered investor sentiment and belief in the prospect of a sharp recovery for the virus-ravaged economy.The still raging pandemic, combined with no fiscal stimulus from Congress, has economists lowering expectations for the remainder of the year. In a note to clients today, Goldman Sachs (GS) said, \u201cAt this point, a major stimulus package before the election looks like a long shot and we expect Congress to leave at the end of September without extending the extra unemployment insurance payment, approving another round of stimulus payments, or providing additional support to small businesses or state and local governments. Failure to pass any additional fiscal measures would likely lead us to downgrade our growth estimates for Q4\u201d\n\nEconomic data has been surprisingly good in spite of the circumstances. 860,000 people filed unemployment claims, while that\u2019s a lot normally, it has been less than 1 million for the third week straight. Continuing Claims, which are the number of people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, fell below 13 million for the first time since March highs, an encouraging sign. \n\nConfidence in the market, right now, is dependent on Congress passing more fiscal stimulus. Top FOMC officials, including Jerome Powell, and Pres. Trump have publicly endorsed the passage of more fiscal stimulus. Economists and politicians agree that more stimulus is needed to boost consumer confidence and provide much-needed support to cash-strapped families and small businesses. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* United Airlines (UAL) tells Congress 16k jobs at risk without aid. - Politico\n* Walt Disney (DIS) World Swan and Dolphin Resort to Lay Off 1,100 Employees Due to Low Occupancy \n* Grow Generation (GRWG): Roth Capital maintains BUY and raises price target to $20. Disclaimer: I own this stock. It's been a beast for me, reported record quarters and beat expectations the last 10 quarters. A couple of weeks ago had a 100% return on stock trade.\n* Gilead Sciences (GILD): RBC Capital maintains OUTPERFORM and raises price target to $86\n* Moderna (MRNA) says in 8K filing it currently anticipates production of its COVID vaccine MRNA-1273 will be approx 20M doses by end of year\n* The Center for Pharmaceutical Research is moving forward with trials of a DNA vaccine developed by pharmaceutical company Inovio (INO).\n* Blink Charging Announces Acquisition of BlueLA Carsharing Expanding Affordable Electric Vehicle Accessibility For Underserved Communities Across the City of Los Angeles\n* What a crazy ride\u2026 apparently now TikTok and WeChat will be removed from the Store on Sept 20, despite recent report that a deal was agreed between Bytedance and Oracle (ORCL).\n* Salesforce (CRM) to add 12,000 jobs by next year, according to Reuters. \n* Stichfix (SFIX) had target raised by Telsey Advisory Group from $29 to $33 OUTPERFORM\n* Shopify (SHOP) reiterated by Wedbush at HOLD\n* UTZ Brands (UTZ) initiated by Citigroup (C) at BUY\n* Wix.com (WIX) Wix reiterated by Wedbush BUY",

        "selftext": " **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, Sept 17, 2020**\n\nStocks ended sharply down in a volatile trading session, as investors and traders became more cautious following the Federal Reserve\u2019s announcement yesterday and conflicting information and timeframes regarding a potential coronavirus vaccine.\n\nThe sell-off was led by big tech stocks, like Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), and Apple (AAPL), which extended yesterday\u2019s losses and soured overall market sentiment. It appears that after the historic rally in August and since the March bottom, traders are rethinking the prospects of a continued, sharp economic recovery in the face of no additional fiscal stimulus. The volatility this month highlights the effects this still-raging pandemic has on the economy. \n\nAnother 860,000 workers filed for unemployment claims this week, with claims remaining below 1 million for a third straight week. The number of unemployed persons also fell below 13 million, an encouraging sign for a recovering labor market.  \n\nFed officials upgraded their economic projections for this year, and now anticipate a shallower decline in real GDP and a lower unemployment rate by year-end versus their early-summer projections. Still, officials suggested that the quicker-than-expected early economic recovery could be jeopardized in absence of further fiscal stimulus. Powell said, \u201cIt will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that.\u201d Again, Powell is urging Congressional lawmakers to pass additional fiscal stimulus.\n\nThe expiration of the CARES Act and enhanced unemployment benefits have left millions of Americans unemployed and without support in the middle of a pandemic. While the stock market is okay (relatively), Powell and other FOMC members have stressed the financial burden this pandemic has placed on small businesses and individuals, urging Congress to pass more fiscal stimulus. \n\nPresident Trump agrees with Powell and on Wednesday called on congressional Republicans to support a massive economic relief bill with \u201cmuch higher numbers\u201d and stimulus payments for Americans, abruptly proposing an entirely different plan from what the Senate GOP sought to advance in recent days. Trump advocated for the $1.5 trillion plan unveiled by the bipartisan house committee, the Problem Solvers Caucus.  The proposal includes a new round of $1,200 stimulus checks to individual Americans, a provision omitted from an approximately $300 billion plan Senate Republicans tried unsuccessfully to pass last week. Pres. Trump said, \u201cI like the larger amount, I\u2019ve said that. Some of the Republicans disagree, but I think I can convince them to go along with that because I like the larger number. I want to see people get money.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s claim yesterday that a coronavirus vaccine could be ready by November went against statements made the same day by Robert Redfield, the head of the CDC. Redfield said he does not expect a vaccine to be \u2018widely available\u2019 until the third quarter of next year. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows responded by saying \u201cnot sure where Dr. Redfield got his particular timetable, but it\u2019s not based on those that are closest to the process.\u201d In response, the WHO said, \u201cIt is important  we have consistent messaging by officials worldwide\u201d.\n\nIn an unfortunate development, WHO officials warned that the spread of coronavirus in Europe now is worse than it was in March, near the start of the pandemic.

        "selftext": " **PsychoMarket Recap - September 18, 2020**\n\nStocks dropped again today, closing out a volatile week on a sour note. Tech stocks continued pulling back, with many notable stocks breaking through well-established supports. In spite of the Fed\u2019s commitment to keep interest rates low until 2023 and mostly positive economic data, the sell off in tech, which is the largest holding in the three major benchmarks, has dragged the market down. \n\nThis week, tech stocks like Apple (AMZN), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) have declined sharply after hitting consecutive record highs in August. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is the hardest hit, with prices at similar levels to early August. The S&amp;P finished the day 1.12% down, the Nasdaq 1.28% down, the Dow was 0.87% down.\n\nAfter a historic August led by tech stocks, the current volatility in the market has sharply lowered investor sentiment and belief in the prospect of a sharp recovery for the virus-ravaged economy.The still raging pandemic, combined with no fiscal stimulus from Congress, has economists lowering expectations for the remainder of the year. In a note to clients today, Goldman Sachs (GS) said, \u201cAt this point, a major stimulus package before the election looks like a long shot and we expect Congress to leave at the end of September without extending the extra unemployment insurance payment, approving another round of stimulus payments, or providing additional support to small businesses or state and local governments. Failure to pass any additional fiscal measures would likely lead us to downgrade our growth estimates for Q4\u201d\n\nEconomic data has been surprisingly good in spite of the circumstances. 860,000 people filed unemployment claims, while that\u2019s a lot normally, it has been less than 1 million for the third week straight. Continuing Claims, which are the number of people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, fell below 13 million for the first time since March highs, an encouraging sign. \n\nConfidence in the market, right now, is dependent on Congress passing more fiscal stimulus. Top FOMC officials, including Jerome Powell, and Pres. Trump have publicly endorsed the passage of more fiscal stimulus. Economists and politicians agree that more stimulus is needed to boost consumer confidence and provide much-needed support to cash-strapped families and small businesses. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* United Airlines (UAL) tells Congress 16k jobs at risk without aid. - Politico\n* Walt Disney (DIS) World Swan and Dolphin Resort to Lay Off 1,100 Employees Due to Low Occupancy \n* Grow Generation (GRWG): Roth Capital maintains BUY and raises price target to $20. Disclaimer: I own this stock. It's been a beast for me, reported record quarters and beat expectations the last 10 quarters. A couple of weeks ago had a 100% return on stock trade.\n* Gilead Sciences (GILD): RBC Capital maintains OUTPERFORM and raises price target to $86\n* Moderna (MRNA) says in 8K filing it currently anticipates production of its COVID vaccine MRNA-1273 will be approx 20M doses by end of year\n* The Center for Pharmaceutical Research is moving forward with trials of a DNA vaccine developed by pharmaceutical company Inovio (INO).\n* Blink Charging Announces Acquisition of BlueLA Carsharing Expanding Affordable Electric Vehicle Accessibility For Underserved Communities Across the City of Los Angeles\n* What a crazy ride\u2026 apparently now TikTok and WeChat will be removed from the Store on Sept 20, despite recent report that a deal was agreed between Bytedance and Oracle (ORCL).\n* Salesforce (CRM) to add 12,000 jobs by next year, according to Reuters. \n* Stichfix (SFIX) had target raised by Telsey Advisory Group from $29 to $33 OUTPERFORM\n* Shopify (SHOP) reiterated by Wedbush at HOLD\n* UTZ Brands (UTZ) initiated by Citigroup (C) at BUY\n* Wix.com (WIX) Wix reiterated by Wedbush BUY",

This does not mean the party stops, though .. we just needed a quick break. \n\nWhat\u2019s the play to take us to the moon? MSFT Calls and ORCL lottos to hedge. \n\nTwo reasons:\n\n1. The election. Presidential debates are slated to start soon, and the election is creeping up. Trump\u2019s hallmark has been a strong stock market. There is no way he does not pump the markets soon. In fact, we are already seeing signs of this with Trump floating the idea of a second stimulus ***yesterday*** ([https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/trump-leftover-coronavirus-relief-second-stimulus-check)](https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/trump-leftover-coronavirus-relief-second-stimulus-check))\n\n2. TikTok catalyst. Given the recent selloff, I don\u2019t think news is being properly priced in. Don\u2019t just listen to me on this: \u201cMr. Mayer, a former Disney executive who had announced he was joining TikTok in May, said[ he was resigning](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/technology/tiktok-kevin-mayer-resign.html) because he had signed on for a global role, not to run a carved-up version of the company. In a note to employees, he also indicated that a deal for TikTok might be close. \u201cWe expect to reach a resolution very soon.\u201d\u201d The same article continues:  Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a note to investors that \u201cthe participation of Walmart was likely \u201cthe final piece of the puzzle that ultimately cements Microsoft successfully acquiring TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations for likely $35 billion to $40billion.\u201d ([https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/technology/walmart-tiktok-deal.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/technology/walmart-tiktok-deal.html))\n\nThis catalyst is obviously a huge trigger for a potential reversal. Beyond this, the fed has basically been signaling for us to hold assets, so a reversal of current trends is essentially inevitable.\n\n**Positions: MSFT 220c 10/16, ORCL 60c 9/25 (to hedge)**\n\nTo the moon brethren",

        "selftext": "Oracle Corp. ORCL +5.49% won the bidding for the U.S. operations of the video-sharing app TikTok, people familiar with the matter said, beating out Microsoft Corp. MSFT +1.90% in a high-profile deal to salvage a social-media sensation that has been caught in the middle of a geopolitical standoff.\n\nOracle is set to be announced as TikTok\u2019s \u201ctrusted tech partner\u201d in the U.S., and the deal is likely not to be structured as an outright sale, the people said.\n\nThe next step is for the White House and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. to approve the deal, said one of the people, adding that the participants believe it satisfies the concerns around data security that have been previously raised by the U.S. government.\n\nOn Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed that his office received a bid proposal from Oracle for TikTok\u2019s operations over the weekend and said that the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. would review it this week.\n\n\u201cWe will be reviewing that at the CFIUS committee this week and then will be making a recommendation to the president and reviewing it with him,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said on CNBC. \u201cFrom our standpoint, we\u2019ll need to make sure that the code is, one, secure, Americans\u2019 data is secure, that the phones are secure and we\u2019ll be looking to have discussions with Oracle over the next few days with our technical teams.\u201d\n\nMr. Mnuchin also said the Oracle deal includes a commitment to establish TikTok as a global company headquartered in the U.S., which he said would mean 20,000 new jobs.\n\nThe Treasury secretary said he wouldn\u2019t go into all the details of the plan, but clarified that the deadline for the sale of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations is Sept. 20.\n\nMORE ON TIKTOK\u2019S BUSINESS\n\nThe move by TikTok\u2019s parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., comes days after the Chinese government threw negotiations into doubt when it issued new export restrictions late last month on the kind of artificial intelligence technology TikTok uses. The algorithms, which determine the videos served to users and are seen as TikTok\u2019s secret sauce, were considered part of the deal negotiations up until the Chinese policy change raising questions among the parties involved in negotiations over how to value the social-media business.\n\nThe structure of Oracle\u2019s deal wasn\u2019t immediately known, including whether it includes transfer of the algorithms.\n\nTwo people familiar with the Oracle deal said it was more appropriate to call it a partnership, rather than an acquisition, suggesting that there wasn\u2019t an exchange of significant assets. At least some of ByteDance\u2019s existing investors, including U.S. investment firms Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, will get stakes in the venture as part of the deal, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe possibility that a deal might not involve an outright sale was previously reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nPresident Trump has said repeatedly that he would shut down TikTok in the U.S. if it isn\u2019t sold to an American company. In an Aug. 6 executive order, the White House gave ByteDance a 45-day deadline before it would ban the app, which the Trump administration says poses an economic and national-security threat to U.S. interests, if it isn\u2019t sold to a U.S. buyer.\n\nMicrosoft, which had teamed up with Walmart Inc., earlier Sunday said in a statement that it was notified earlier in the day of the decision by ByteDance.\n\n\u201cWe are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok\u2019s users, while protecting national security interests,\u201d the statement said. \u201cTo do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation, and we made these principles clear in our August statement.\u201d\n\nDOES ORACLE\u2019S WINNING BID AVERT A BAN?\n\nA look at the state of play for the video app\u2019s ownership and the prospects for a deal.\n\nIn a statement late Sunday, Walmart suggested it is considering joining the Oracle group, saying it is continuing \u201cdiscussions with ByteDance leadership and other interested parties.\u201d\n\nWhile China\u2019s recently announced trade restrictions made acquiring TikTok\u2019s algorithm tricky, Microsoft remained committed to acquiring the app\u2019s powerful suggestion algorithms, said a person familiar with the matter. Without outright purchase of the algorithms, Microsoft wouldn\u2019t be able to follow through with its stated commitment to national security issues.\n\nOracle\u2019s interest in TikTok is primarily driven by kick-starting its fledgling cloud-computing business, which remains far behind market leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s plans were more ambitious than Oracle, said one person. Owning TikTok would help Microsoft have more presence among everyday consumers, an area it had mostly abandoned to chase after corporate users with the exception of its Xbox gaming business. TikTok would also give Microsoft a treasure trove of data on young and mostly female users, an area it doesn\u2019t have much insight into now.\n\nThe New York Times reported earlier that Microsoft had been notified of the ByteDance decision.\n\nTikTok has soared to around 100 million monthly users in the U.S., from about 11 million in early 2018, and they are considered among the most lucrative in the app\u2019s global user base of about 689 million, though the app still loses money.\n\nOracle wasn\u2019t as obvious a winner in the race for TikTok as Microsoft. While both tech companies have sizable cloud-computing operations and technical capabilities, Oracle is mainly focused on serving business clients and has virtually no experience running a social-media platform or other major consumer-facing business. Microsoft is an even bigger player in business computing but also owns the LinkedIn social-media site and the Xbox videogame business. It also is a much bigger company and has about $136 billion of cash, some three times what Oracle has on hand.",

Intriguingly, Snowflake has established itself without the founder-led culture that dominates most of the tech industry. Instead, three external CEOs have guided the company to a \\~$500M annual revenue run rate, with 132% year-over-year growth. That's attracted pre-IPO investment from Warren Buffett \u2014 a rare foray into tech for the Oracle of Omaha.

        "selftext": " Stocks slide day after Fed signals caution about pace of recovery\n\nWall Street is weaker in afternoon trading as Chair Powell's uncertainty over the pace of the economic recovery has weighed on sentiment in an apparent delayed reaction to yesterday's policy update and press conference from the leader of the central bank. Meanwhile, profit taking may also be playing a role following the tech-led gains on Monday and Tuesday of this week.\n\n**ECONOMIC EVENTS:** In the U.S., initial jobless claims fell 33,000 to 860,000 in the week ended September 12. Housing starts dipped 5.1% to a 1.416M pace in August. The Philly Fed index fell 2.2 points to 15.0 in September, which was weaker than expected.\n\n**TOP NEWS:** Reports flooded in about ByteDance's proposed agreement with Oracle (ORCL) over TikTok, with [CNBC reporting](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/17/trump-to-rule-on-tiktok-deal-in-24-36-hours-oracle-to-take-20percent-stake.html) that President Donald Trump is expected to rule on the agreement in the next 24-36 hours. CNBC's David Faber noted in his reporting that under the proposed deal, Oracle will own roughly 20% of the new entity and Walmart (WMT) will be involved in some capacity. Meanwhile, Bloomberg said that the U.S. Treasury Department sent ByteDance a revised terms sheet late yesterday and the company and Oracle have accepted it. The changes address national security concerns about the deal, according to Bloomberg.\n\nShares of AstraZeneca (AZN) were in focus after [CNN said](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/17/health/astrazeneca-vaccine-trial-document/index.html) that an internal safety report by the company sheds light on the neurological condition suffered by one of the participants in its coronavirus vaccine clinical trial, detailing how the 37-year-old study volunteer \"experienced confirmed transverse myelitis\" after receiving her second dose of the vaccine, and was hospitalized on September 5.\" In response, AstraZeneca [disputed the report](https://twitter.com/megtirrell/status/1306594370855088128), saying it contains \"inaccuracies,\" including hte diagnosis, which is based on preliminary findings. The company added that the information shared by CNN \"was not obtained from internal documents, but rather sent to investigators and doctors running trials that should not be shared because they contain confidential patient records.\"\u00a0  \n\n\nMeanwhile, Moderna (MRNA) shares were 4% lower near 1 pm ET after CEO Stephan bancel said that the company anticipates a base plan for efficacy for the first interim readout of its coronavirus vaccine data to be in November and the best case scenario plan being in October. He also said October is unlikely, but it is possible and that the worst case scenario would be in December.\n\n**MAJOR MOVERS:** Among the noteworthy gainers was Sorrento Therapeutics (SRNE), which surged 11% after it received FDA clearance to proceed with its STI-1499 trial. Also higher was Herman Miller (MLHR), which gained 34% after reporting quarterly results.\n\nAmong the notable losers was Dave &amp; Buster's (PLAY), which fell 25% after a Wall Street Journal [report ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/dave-busters-warns-of-bankruptcy-if-no-lender-deal-struck-11600292027)that the company has warned of bankruptcy potential. Also lower was Nano-X Imaging (NNOX), which declined 18% after Empire Financial Research's Whitney Tilson [said ](https://empirefinancialresearch.com/articles/nnox-is-theranos-2-0-short-report-on-lumber-liquidators-interviews-with-carson-block-and-dan-david-snowflakes-ipo-working-remotely-from-bermuda)that Citron's Andrew Left is right about Nano-X, as its \"stock is worthless.\"\u00a0\n\n**INDEXES:** Near 1 pm ET, the Dow was down 211.02, or 0.75%, to 27,821.36, the Nasdaq was down 213.57, or 1.93%, to 10,836.90, and the S&amp;P 500 was down 42.69, or 1.26%, to 3,342.80.",

Small companies will always have more value to you \u201cprofessional day traders\u201d than any of the big name slot machine tickers. Their humble size is their biggest strength, not because they have some untapped potential to moon or they happen to be some diamond in the rough, just the opposite in fact. These companies are quite fragile, most rely on just a few clients, largely government and corporate contracts. But one wrong move, and their entire income is in jeopardy.\nTake Digital Ally (DGLY) for instance: They specialize in body cam and dash cam equipment for law enforcement applications. Despite numerous controversies about the integrity or their equipment, they\u2019ve also been managed about as well as the Cincinnati Bengals. Yet they continue to get away with it because a $5 million market cap, hyper-specialized, tactical equipment company doesn\u2019t draw many flashy headlines. Their most glaring flaw, besides one of their 2 customers being the oh-so-loyal U.S. government, are their absolutely disgusting finances:\n&gt; DGLY booked profit margins of -97.30%, and its Return on Assets is -67.50%.

As [I wrote previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/idxxe2/a_lot_of_gamma_expiring_today_will_volatility/) how a lot of gamma was set to roll off after August expiration and it looks like that's partially responsible for some of the bigger moves in the market this past week. I also [wrote](https://www.optionseye.com/draftkings-dkng-earnings-preview/) about how a lot of that upside skew we were seeing in big tech names and story stocks had the options market all out of whack.

        "selftext": "I posted yesterday about the upcoming tik tok deal and what it could mean regarding Microsoft stock price. As I\u2019m currently heavily invested in Microsoft calls I thought I\u2019d share with you all this incredible opportunity for a big cash out. \n\nContext: ByteDance is a Chinese company that owns tik tok. US Companies have been looking to purchase the US version of TikTok. Trumpie doesn\u2019t like the idea of the Chinese owning tik tok to SPY on us, and last month signed an executive order that will effectively ban tik tok unless it is sold to a US company by mid September. \n\nCurrently, the main players looking to purchase tik tok are Microsoft teamed up with Walmart, and oracle. \n\nNow between the top bidders it makes much more sense for Microsoft to be selected as the winning buyer. Oracle does not own any type of social platform whereas Microsoft owns Xbox and other communication channels such as teams. Additionally, the tik tok interim CEO herself said that she saw great synergy potential with Walmart as they could sell products through the app. \n\nBased on the above, it seems like a no brainer that Tik Tok will be sold to Microsoft and Walmart....\n\nBut hold the phone, yesterday news came out that China has now put a limit on its data exports which would include tik tok. This limit acts as a retaliation against trumpie and many believe it could prolong the deal. \n\nNow if you\u2019ve seen anything this administration it\u2019s Trump not giving a shit about the right thing to do. He stated 9/20 as tik tok shutting off unless it\u2019s sold and honestly seems like a win win if the deal goes through. \n\nBecause there is uncertainty on if the deal goes through, but it should theoretically happen, this makes NOW a great time to buy MSFT/WMT calls. \n\nMy guess is that if the biggest new social media platform is sold to Microsoft, you could see a jump up to $240-$250 overnight for some hugeeee gains. \n\nHappy trading! \n\nMSFT $230 c 9/18, 10/2",

        "selftext": "The Treasury Department said it would review a deal by Oracle Corp. ORCL +5.51% for TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations aimed at avoiding a ban of the popular video-sharing app because of its Chinese ownership.\n\nBusiness software provider Oracle on Monday said it was part of the proposal submitted by TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent ByteDance Ltd. to the U.S. government in which the American tech company would \u201cserve as the trusted technology provider.\u201d It beat out Microsoft Corp. MSFT +1.94% to work with TikTok to address Trump administration concerns that the popular video-sharing app\u2019s ownership by a Chinese company posed a national security risk, people familiar with the situation said Sunday.\n\nPresident Trump was pushing for a sale of TikTok\u2019s U.S. business and has said, absent a deal, those operations would be shut down.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday confirmed that his office received a bid proposal from Oracle for TikTok\u2019s operations over the weekend and said that the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. would review it this week. \u201cWe will be reviewing that at the Cfius committee this week and then will be making a recommendation to the president and reviewing it with him,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said on CNBC. Presidents have the power to overrule Cfius recommendations to either clear or block a deal.\n\nDetails of the Oracle arrangement with TikTok weren\u2019t immediately disclosed, but it is expected to involve moving TikTok\u2019s data on American users to Oracle\u2019s cloud-computing infrastructure and housing that information only in the U.S. Oracle is joining with some of ByteDance\u2019s U.S. investors, and Walmart Inc., which had been working with Microsoft, suggested late Sunday that it is considering joining the Oracle group, according to the people.\n\nFor Oracle, the arrangement could give a jolt to the Silicon Valley stalwart\u2019s efforts to transform its staid database business into a major player in cloud computing\u2014if the companies can secure government approval for the plan.\n\nThe principal attraction of a TikTok deal is adding a flagship customer to its cloud, people familiar with the arrangement said. TikTok is a globally recognized client and comes with a coveted user base for Chairman Larry Ellison as he seeks to accelerate the shift of the Redwood City, Calif.-based company he founded into a force in cloud computing, one of the most dynamic areas of tech.\n\nOracle currently lags far behind cloud leaders including Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft. It mainly provides enterprise customers software to help run their business.",

        "selftext": "Summarized to save you time.\n\n**Another day of FAANG underperformance weighing on sectors:**\n\n* **REITs** and **utilities** trailing, but session characterized by continued underperformance from the FAANGs and pressure on the requisite sectors. In addition to declines in AAPL-US and MSFT-US , **tech** seeing weakness in semis. **Consumer discretionary** seeing a fair number of gainers outside AMZN-US , though some weakness in specialty retailers and hotel/leisure names. **Communication services** feeling some drag from select media and entertainment names alongside the drop by GOOGL-US (FB-US a slight gainer). Industrial metals (particularly steel) stronger in **materials**. **Consumer staples** beating the tape with help from select grocers and food-products companies. **Energy** helped by higher crude. **Healthcare** slightly positive, with pharma and managed care largely better. **Industrials** outperforming thanks to some strength in A&amp;D and machinery. **Financials** leading the market. Insurers, online brokers, credit cards some of the better performers.\n\n**Fed considering whether to extend restrictions on dividends and share buybacks:**\n\n* [Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200917a.htm) said that it will announce by the end of September whether to extend current restrictions on dividends and share buybacks into Q4. Board released its two hypothetical scenarios for a second round of bank stress tests, both of which envisage severe global downturns with substantial stress in financial markets and include a global market shock component that will be applied to banks with large trading operations. One scenario features a faster and higher peak in unemployment while the second sees a lower unemployment peak but a slower descent. Board will release firm-specific results from banks' performance under both scenarios by the end of 2020. [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-17/fed-weighs-extending-bank-dividend-caps-re-starts-stress-tests?srnd=premium&amp;sref=4uo0B65n) noted update particularly of note for GS-US , MS-US , who are more reliant on capital market. Fed hasn't made clear whether second set of tests will replace earlier set of tests, which would raise each firm's capital minimum.\n\n**Preliminary Michigan consumer sentiment rose in early September:**\n\n* Preliminary **Michigan Consumer Sentiment** for Sep of 78.9 versus cons 75, up 4.8 pts from last month. Noted a modest improvement to the top of the range since April with consumers beginning to look towards the presidential election and for release of a coronavirus vaccine. Current conditions index up 4.6 pts to 87.5. Expectations index 4.8 pts higher to 73.3. One-year and five-year inflation expectations fell with the former down 0.4% to 2.7% and the latter down a tenth to 2.6%. Next week will bring August **existing home sales** (5.925M cons vs 5.86M prior) and September **Richmond Fed index** (12 cons vs 18 prior) on Tuesday, a slight deceleration expected in preliminary **Markit PMIs** Wednesday, **initial claims** (850k exp vs 860k prior) and August **new home sales** Thursday (875K exp vs 901K prior), and August **durable goods orders** Friday (1.4% exp vs 11.4% prior).\n\n**Covid-19 vaccine developers bow to calls for greater transparency, states face logistical challenges:**\n\n* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/health/covid-moderna-vaccine.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage.) reported Moderna (MRNA-US ) and Pfizer (PFE-US ) released comprehensive details of their vaccine evaluation process, including how participants are monitored, conditions that could force early stop to trials, and evidence used to determine whether vaccine protected participants against Covid-19. Marks a departure from standard practice where documents are shared after studies are complete. Demand for greater transparency from vaccine developers fueled in part by concerns about political interference in regulatory approval process. Separately, [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/17/coronavirus-vaccine-distribution-trump-states-417407) highlighted how states tasked with leading vaccine distribution efforts face logistical and supply chain challenges that could thwart Trump's optimistic timeline for delivery.\n\n**Stimulus deal remains elusive:**\n\n* [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/17/coronavirus-stimulus-deal-417142) reported Democrats and Republicans appeared further apart on key components of a fifth coronavirus relief bill on Thursday. House Speaker Pelosi said Democrats could push for more than their previous offer of $2.2T given financial imperative has grown since May, though suggested Democrats aren't prepared to accept less than that ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/516904-pelosi-hard-to-see-dems-supporting-less-than-22t-in-covid-aid)). However, little appetite from Senate Republicans on going above their 'skinny' stimulus bill. [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pelosi-trump-stimulus-checks/2020/09/17/7e507a74-f90c-11ea-a510-f57d8ce76e11_story.html) highlighted how Trump's call this week for Republicans to embrace a larger stimulus has put Pelosi in a bind over whether to hold her ground on the $2.2T or negotiate with White House and placate centrist Democrats fearful of voter blowback. Article noted that with Congress set to leave town in first week of October and not return until after election, situation puts some Democrats facing tough reelection chances in difficult spot.\n\n**Unlike stimulus talks, government-funding negotiations remain on track:**\n\n* [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawmakers-close-in-on-spending-deal-to-avert-shutdown-11600379832) the latest to highlight continued progress on congressional negotiations about a short-term funding package to keep the government from shutting down after 1-Oct, sidestepping a potential confrontation ahead of the 3-Nov elections. Recall Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and House Speaker Pelosi agreed earlier this month to pursue a \"clean\" funding bill unburdened by politically sensitive additions ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/515060-mnuchin-pelosi-reach-informal-deal-to-avoid-government-shutdown)), though today's WSJ notes there have been some discussions about whether to add an extension for flood insurance, funding for highways, or funding to give the government extra time to complete the decennial census. Lawmakers and aides said they were finishing up discussions and could have a bill ready for introduction to the House around midday today.\n\n**A busy day of Fedspeak ahead after this week's FOMC meeting:**\n\n* In an essay \"[Why I Dissented](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2020/why-i-dissented),\" Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari (voter) said the Fed should hold off on rate hikes until roughly a year of 2% core inflation. He also said he dissented because he wanted a stronger commitment to zero rates, and said sustained core inflation at 2% would demonstrate the economy was at full employment. St. Louis' Bullard (non-voter) said that we may be at a moment where there may be some inflation given loose policy, government deficits, and supply deficits across the economy. He also said that he's optimistic the US economy can get back to where it was pre-pandemic, and that 100% of GDP can be produced safely despite COVID-19. Atlanta's Bostic (non-voter) told [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-18/slowing-u-s-economy-needs-more-fiscal-aid-fed-s-bostic-says?sref=4uo0B65n) he will wait for evidence of overheating before taking action, and that he's more concerned with the trajectory of inflation than specific levels.\n\n**US to block TikTok downloads starting Sunday, shutdown app in November if no deal reached:**\n\n* Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Friday that US users will be blocked from downloading TikTok and WeChat starting 20-Sep. TikTok will also be shut down would come 12-Nov if no deal is reached ([statement](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/09/commerce-department-prohibits-wechat-and-tiktok-transactions-protect), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-ban-exclusive/exclusive-trump-to-block-u-s-downloads-of-tiktok-wechat-on-sunday-officials-idUSKBN2691QO?il=0), [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/c460ce4c-c691-4df5-af49-47a395429fe8?shareType=nongift)). The statement also said that WeChat would also be removed from app stores, and that transactions and payments would be banned on the app Monday. Reports yesterday noted TikTok and Oracle have agreed to the US Treasury terms to complete the transaction though Trump has not issued final approval ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-17/oracle-bytedance-said-to-accept-new-treasury-terms-on-tiktok), [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/technology/tiktok-deal-revisions-trump-review.html?smid=tw-share)), while [WSJ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/technology/tiktok-deal-revisions-trump-review.html?smid=tw-share) reported the deal will still need signoff from China. [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-pushes-for-u-s-control-of-tiktok-11600295711?mod=hp_lead_pos2) also reported Trump administration officials have sought to ensure US investors hold significant majority stake in the company that will take over TikTok, headlined by Oracle (ORCL-US ) and Walmart (WMT-US ).\n\n**Fed survey shows improvement to households' financial strain from government support:**\n\n* The Fed's [update](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2019-report-economic-well-being-us-households-update-202009.pdf) to its Report on the Economic Well-Being of US Households survey, which was conducted in July, said that employment outcomes differed markedly across workers of different incomes and education levels. It also said that the extraordinary governmental measures in response to the pandemic helped ease families' financial strain, with financial well-being higher in the July survey than early April before the financial relief efforts were in place. The report was in line with recent Fed commentary on the need for more fiscal policy stimulus. Fed Chair Powell said in the post-FOMC press conference this week that while fiscal support has been essential to the recent recovery, more fiscal support is likely to be needed given the 11M people still out of work due to the pandemic, struggling small businesses, and declining revenues across state and local governments.\n\n**Companies see higher taxes post-election, no matter who wins:**\n\n* [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-brace-for-higher-taxes-after-u-s-election-11600366918) reported that financial executives at major US companies expect corporate tax rates to rise following the November election, no matter who wins, according to PwC survey. Former VP Biden said he supports raising corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, add new surtax to companies that make products overseas and sell them back to US and raise minimum tax on foreign income. Trump hasn't proposed any changes, but the article noted that executives anticipate higher taxes on expectation government will have to fund stimulus spending, tax deferrals, and other federal COVID-related relief. Also said if Trump is re-elected, executives will likely spend more on companies' supply chains to protect against fallout of US-China tensions.",

        "selftext": "Ok  guys, I know this long weekend is tough on us all.  Not being able to  throw my portfolio 100% into a stock I haven't researched whatsoever is  making me wonder if it really is Monday or if my Step-Dad actually  turned the stock market off like he kept threatening to do...\n\nI've decided to help my WSB brethren through this long and difficult day of no ~~investing~~  gambling by sharing a newfound gift with you all.  For those out of the  loop, I have been chosen by the Gods as the new Prophet, translator of  strange tongues and oracle of oration.  I first discovered this gift 2  days ago while deciphering the sacred writings of [u/Jaecer](https://www.reddit.com/u/Jaecer/) and his [Divine Prophecy of GDP Q3 up BIGLY: The Coming of Hulk Dildo Tuesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/impkrk/donald_pump_said_gdp_in_3rd_quarter_and_other/g42e9b2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).   While pouring over the manuscript I felt a strange power grip hold of  me tighter than a Bear's rectum gripping green candlesticks.  It was as  though the matrix were shooting up, through my balls and out my finger  tips as my hands flew across the keyboard.  Rainman had been awakened  and through my body, a mere vessel of foot fungus and dandruff, he was  decoding the gibberish and nonsensical ramblings posted to WSB to  uncover their true meaning.\n\n\"blsh blsh blshjshfjenmrjg fuck auto mod your gay af eriahjguwehbtinu askjryhdnviSZJUEf\"\n\nIt was so obvious, this simple acronym contained the codex:\n\n\"*Buy  Low Sell High, Buy Low Sell  High, Buy Low Sell High Just Sell High For  Jerome Even Noobs Make Retard  Jerkoff Gains fuck auto mod your gay af,  Every Retard Is A Hero Just  Going Up With Each Heroic Bullish Trade  Inflation's Not Unflation, Any  Savant Knows Jerome Recently YOLO'ed His  Donald November Volatility  Investment SHORT ZOOM JAN800c ELON faggots\"*\n\n...and then a new vision emerged!  The angel [u/greenpaint11](https://www.reddit.com/u/greenpaint11/)  appeared, as if to tell me I was right to transcribe the acronyms so  that the retards would know what to trade, to push me to fulfill my  destiny, and bearing this message from God himself: \"Jakriisbwsb\"\n\nFaster than a fapping fucktard the message: \"*Jaecer And Koala Recommend Inversing Intelligent Strategies Because Wall Street Bets*\" shot out my thumbs and I came all over my screen.\n\nSo  anyway, that made two successfully translated acronyms in a row so  we're clearly on a hot streak, and you always double down on a hot  streak.  Anyone ever won their first roll at a craps table and walked  away?  Of course not, that would be ridiculous.\n\nWhat's the plan?  When our divine beings [u/Jaecer](https://www.reddit.com/u/Jaecer/) and [u/greenpaint11](https://www.reddit.com/u/greenpaint11/)  grace us with their presence, the first reply to their comments that is  a string of gibberish letters (no numbers, can't have your autism  manipulating God's message,) shall be translated by yours truly, in an  attempt to combine the unintelligible ramblings of Wall Street Babylon's  many tongues to reveal what J-Po &amp; Elon are planning.  From these  translations we will know what this week brings and I will update OP  with positions based upon these holy translated acronyms.  Acronyms  should be between 11 and 58 letters, as these were the lengths of the  first two messages from the endless above where the great Battery lives.\n\nAND SO IT SHALL BE DONE.  I HAVE SPOKEN.",

        "selftext": "What's up people of stocks, some of you may have seen my unusual options activity posts in other option's trading sub-reddits. I've decided to put together a little summary for the week that details some trending tickers, option activity, and some setups for next week ( + reasoning for the setup). Mods if this isn't allowed, I won't post again. Here we go:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Upcoming Earnings\n\nMicron (MU) Earnings are coming up this week. The semi-conductor company has been consistently beating earnings and has seen some growth throughout the pandemic as more companies become increasingly tech-focused with work-from-home orders. Here\u2019s a snapshot of their most recent earnings and performance moves day-after the report. \n\n[https://imgur.com/stDsUEx](https://imgur.com/stDsUEx)\n\n**What to look for**\n\nBy proxy, companies that will see some related movements to MU\u2019s earnings are: AMD, INTC, and NVDA. A good showing from MU will also mean good things for other semi-conductor companies.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at MU\u2019s average options\u2019 Implied Volatility (IV) over the last month. We can see that typical IV is in the 40-45% range. When the stock price dropped early September during the crash, we saw IV get up to the 60\u2019s. IV has begun to dip back into the 40\u2019s meaning there is not a huge move expected off the earnings report. (Stock price is gold vs IV blue line). \n\n[https://imgur.com/87nthwQ](https://imgur.com/87nthwQ)\n\n# Economic Calendar\n\nWe have some important economic data coming out this week. Here\u2019s the outlook:\n\nTuesday 10am: Consumer Confidence\n\nWednesday 8:30am: GDP Q2, Pending Home Sales\n\nThursday 8:30am: Jobless claims\n\nFriday 8:30am: Unemployment Rate\n\n**Full Calendar of Important Events w/ Forecasts (via Bloomberg):** \n\n[https://imgur.com/1XEHPyC](https://imgur.com/1XEHPyC)\n\n# Trending Stocks\n\nMost Mentioned Tickers + Sentiment from Friday \n\n[https://imgur.com/jTw7JiO](https://imgur.com/jTw7JiO)\n\n# This week\u2019s trend gainers and losers\n\n**Losing Hype:** TSLA, VALE, NKLA, MSFT, WMT, AAPL\\*\n\n[https://imgur.com/0wdvTJB](https://imgur.com/0wdvTJB)\n\n**Gaining Hype:** BA, VXX, ZM, AAL, UPS, PTON, MU\n\n[https://imgur.com/hpakS2h](https://imgur.com/hpakS2h)\n\n\\*AAPL was losing hype on the weekly trend, but up on the daily trend Thursday &amp; Friday from a good performance.  \n\n# Consolidating Tickers\n\nThese tickers are ones that have once been a \u201cmeme\u201d, but have since settled down, and perhaps a good entry point if your technicals are right, it aligns with your strategy, and want to avoid FOMO-ing into hot stocks. \n\n[https://imgur.com/5YsYE1a](https://imgur.com/5YsYE1a)\n\n# The classic tale of doing the inverse of WSB\n\nToday we\u2019ll take a look at VALE, a stock that was almost never mentioned a single time in the last month on r/WallStreetBets until September 18th. At that point, the stock had risen 10% in the week before and VALE was then seen all over the comment section of the sub. Comment volume for VALE jumped to 10% of total comment volume on the sub-reddit at which point many WSB members initiated positions. Within the next several trading days the stock tanked 15% leaving WSB holding the bag (yet again). For more details on this, please read \u201cHow not to FOMO into trades\u201d. \n\n[https://imgur.com/oZ7xY0B](https://imgur.com/oZ7xY0B)\n\n**Swaggy DD (due diligence) released this week - GME (Gamestop)** \n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n\nWhen I look at the sentiment surrounding GameStop, it doesn\u2019t take very long to see comments like these, yet here we are. What\u2019s going on? Are people that stupid? Just jumping on the new console cycle? Idiots not pulling their gains and going to zero? When even r/wallstreetbets thinks the stock is a dud, it must be right? Nearly 120% short interest, yet the stock is up nearly 40% this week.\n\nIts no secret GameStop has been hurting. The secular shift to digital has been pressuring them for some time with their highest margin category - used video software \u2013 under significant distress. Each year their gross margins contract with net income in the red these past few quarters. Everybody has written them off as the easiest short in the world, however I'm going to try to explain whats going on and tell you that buying GameStop may not be as bad as you think.\n\n**II. CONSOLES**\n\nJust to start things off, you have to remember we\u2019re in the beginnings of the new console cycle. But what does that even mean? Well the advent of new consoles means new trade-ins, new product, new customers, and a fresh spike in GameStop\u2019s popularity. Sales have stagnated the years prior, and they are all but certain to go up and remain elevated for the next 1-2 years. Note that against all counts, the company was actually profitable during the 2019 holiday season, with new consoles you can bet that they will annihilate all expectations and proceed into 4-8 more positive quarters off the cyclic shift. This is pretty unanimous, and everyone accepts that they will start reporting positive going forward. In fact, new console cycles are where GME has historically spiked.\n\n[Click here to continue reading the DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ivs6dw/bankrupting_institutional_investors_for_dummies/)\n\n# Swaggy Play &amp; Trade Idea - JPM\n\nWhat's up everyone, market has been choppy as FK and almost un-tradeable the last several weeks. Still, not much has changed fundamentally over the last 3-4 weeks and here we are with a 10-20% haircut on stocks depending which tickers you follow. I've been sitting on my hands for a while, but entered a trade today. Keep in mind this is not advice on what or how to trade, simply posting my trade here and if you want to discuss some opinions, lets do it.\n\nWhy JPM? It has been in a fairly tight channel over the last 3-4 months, staying in the range of $90-100. I entered this exact play back in July when the stock dropped to similar levels to where it is currently at right now, and closed at max profit back then. \n\n[Check out the full play details (reasoning + risks)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/izmt2r/swaggyplay_trade_idea_jpm/)\n\n# Unusual Option Activity\n\nSome big volume in option flow was spotted this week in some names: AAPL, ADBE, C, CLDR, ORCL, PBR, and WRTC.\n\n**ADBE \u2013 Adobe**\n\nADBE saw a massive call block come through on Friday. 5,000 January 2021 CALLs at the $420 strike (10% ITM). Total position size was $40 million. ADBE was about 10-15% off the recent highs and has bounced multiple times off the $470 level. IF this sell-off is truly over, we might see a good bounce in tech and some of these block purchases seem to be positioning for it. \n\n[Read Full Post: Weekly Option Flow Summary, Week of Sept 20-2020: AAPL, ADBE, C, CLDR, ORCL, PBR, WRTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/j0rev4/unusual_option_flow_summary_for_the_week_aapl/)\n\n**What\u2019s on the watchlist this week**\n\nStill looking for a bounce in tech. Here are some stocks I either like and have a position or I\u2019m looking for entry points on (stock price + Implied Volatility charts)\n\n**AAPL - Apple**  \n\nAAPL is currently near a short-term low. Does it have room to go down more? Sure, but I think when you dig below the current levels you will be finding more buyers as we get closer to $100. IMO a good entry point for a long-term hold. IV is also moderately high for options. They are set to report earnings by end of October and also have catalyst of rumored 5g iPhone release.\n\n**AMD - Advanced Micro Devices**  \n\nAMD has shown some strength at the $78 level of support through these last few weeks of downside pressure. AMD also reports towards the end of October, but will have some volatility into MU (Micron Technology) earnings next week. IV is pretty high right now for AMD to buy calls. A more efficient play might be to sell CSP (cash-secured put), credit PUT spreads, or purchase shares.\n\n**DOCU - Docusign**  \n\nA second-wave covid-play I\u2019m looking at is DOCU. DOCU just reported earnings that weren\u2019t accepted well by Wall Street. The stock has dropped nearly 30% since it\u2019s peak of $290 not long ago. You can also see the IV has dropped significantly after earnings. Average IV was as high as 140% pre-earnings and is now sitting around 55%. IMO this is a fundamentally strong company with solid branding. If you\u2019ve ever needed to sign important documents online, chances are you\u2019ve used Docusign before and it is quickly becoming a household name. I like this play for a long-term hold and also as we get into the fall months as a covid play.",

        "selftext": "Ok guys, I know this long weekend is tough on us all.  Not being able to throw my portfolio 100% into a stock I haven't researched whatsoever is making me wonder if it really is Monday or if my Step-Dad actually turned the stock market off like he kept threatening to do...\n\nI've decided to help my WSB brethren through this long and difficult day of no ~~investing~~ gambling by sharing a newfound gift with you all.  For those out of the loop, I have been chosen by the Gods as the new Prophet, translator of strange tongues and oracle of oration.  I first discovered this gift 2 days ago while deciphering the sacred writings of u/Jaecer and his [Divine Prophecy of GDP Q3 up BIGLY: The Coming of Hulk Dildo Tuesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/impkrk/donald_pump_said_gdp_in_3rd_quarter_and_other/g42e9b2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  While pouring over the manuscript I felt a strange power grip hold of me tighter than a Bear's rectum gripping green candlesticks.  It was as though the matrix were shooting up, through my balls and out my finger tips as my hands flew across the keyboard.  Rainman had been awakened and through my body, a mere vessel of foot fungus and dandruff, he was decoding the gibberish and nonsensical ramblings posted to WSB to uncover their true meaning.\n\n\"blsh blsh blshjshfjenmrjg fuck auto mod your gay af eriahjguwehbtinu askjryhdnviSZJUEf\"\n\nIt was so obvious, this simple acronym contained the codex:\n\n \"*Buy Low Sell High, Buy Low Sell  High, Buy Low Sell High Just Sell High For Jerome Even Noobs Make Retard  Jerkoff Gains fuck auto mod your gay af, Every Retard Is A Hero Just  Going Up With Each Heroic Bullish Trade Inflation's Not Unflation, Any  Savant Knows Jerome Recently YOLO'ed His Donald November Volatility  Investment SHORT ZOOM JAN800c ELON faggots\"*\n\n...and then a new vision emerged!  The angel u/greenpaint11 appeared, as if to tell me I was right to transcribe the acronyms so that the retards would know what to trade, to push me to fulfill my destiny, and bearing this message from God himself: \"Jakriisbwsb\"\n\nFaster than a fapping fucktard the message: \"*Jaecer And Koala Recommend Inversing Intelligent Strategies Because Wall Street Bets*\" shot out my thumbs and I came all over my screen.\n\nSo anyway, that made two successfully translated acronyms in a row so we're clearly on a hot streak, and you always double down on a hot streak.  Anyone ever won their first roll at a craps table and walked away?  Of course not, that would be ridiculous.\n\nWhat's the plan?  When our divine beings u/Jaecer and u/greenpaint11 grace us with their presence, the first reply to their comments that is a string of gibberish letters (no numbers, can't have your autism manipulating God's message,) shall be translated by yours truly, in an attempt to combine the unintelligible ramblings of Wall Street Babylon's many tongues to reveal what J-Po &amp; Elon are planning.  From these translations we will know what this week brings and I will update OP with positions based upon these holy translated acronyms.  Acronyms should be between 11 and 58 letters, as these were the lengths of the first two messages from the endless above where the great Battery lives.\n\nAND SO IT SHALL BE DONE.  I HAVE SPOKEN.",

        "selftext": "## Daily Synopsis \n\n* The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.1% on this quadruple-witching expiration Friday, as losses spread out from technology stocks to all 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors. The Nasdaq Composite also declined 1.1%, followed by the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.9%) and Russell 2000 (-0.4%). \n* Many viewed the download ban as a negotiation tactic to get a revised deal between Oracle (ORCL 59.75, -0.43, -0.7%) and TikTok that better protects U.S. data. Tencent's WeChat called the decision \"unfortunate\" and said it will continue to discuss solutions with the U.S., but there were still concerns about potential retaliation against U.S. technology companies. \n* The information technology sector (-1.7%) exerted influential weakness as a result, and an early rotational trade into cyclical/value stocks lost some stream as tech stocks accelerated losses. The materials (-1.7%), utilities (-1.8%), and real estate (-2.0%) sectors were other laggards, while the health care (-0.1%) and financials (-0.2%) sectors outperformed on a relative basis. \n* The market did close off session lows, thanks to a buy-the-dip mindset in the afternoon, but it's worth noting that the S&amp;P 500 closed below its 50-day moving average (3343). \n* Tesla (TSLA 442.15, +18.72, +4.4%) was a notable exception to the negative trend, rising 4.4% after Piper Sandler raised its price target on the stock to $515 from $480 ahead of its Battery Day event next week. \n* U.S. Treasuries finished little changed in a tight-ranged session. The 2-yr yield remained unchanged at 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index was flat at 92.95.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 7th, 2020.\n\n# **The stock market shakeout is likely not over yet, even with Friday\u2019s comeback  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/04/the-stock-market-shakeout-is-likely-not-over-yet-even-with-fridays-comeback.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The tech wreck is probably not over, despite Friday\u2019s market comeback.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts expect the shakeout in stocks to continue after the long Labor Day weekend, especially in technology names and the Nasdaq, areas of the market that notched the sharpest gains.\n*****\n&gt; After August\u2019s 7% gain in the S&amp;P 500, stocks started September strong, and then just as quickly rolled over. The Nasdaq lost 5% Thursday and was down sharply Friday but pared losses to decline 1.5%. The S&amp;P 500 was down about 2.3% for the week, even after a 3.5% loss Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think this is a good wake-up call and a reminder that there are risks out there,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. \u201cIn August, we did take a little bit off the table.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Analysts expect the week ahead to be busy, with holidays ending and more market pros back at their desks. There is some economic data, most importantly Friday\u2019s consumer price index. The reading on consumer inflation is expected to show little change in core inflation with forecasts for a gain of just 0.2% in August, or 1.6% year over year.\n*****\n&gt; # Froth blowing off\n&gt; The stock sell-off came as market pros were becoming increasingly wary of froth in the market, particularly in tech and momentum names. On Friday, it was revealed that SoftBank was behind billions in large options bets on individual tech stocks, like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Tesla. News reports said the trades were made over the past month, and SoftBank had been building unusually large positions in call options, or those that bet the prices of underlying stocks would rise.\n*****\n&gt; One analyst said the fact that SoftBank was \u201cgunning the market\u201d makes him worry that there is more selling to come in Nasdaq names. As SoftBank bought call options, the sellers had to buy stocks, conceivably driving up prices in a trading feedback loop.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s just a trip to the casino,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cIf they\u2019re supposed to be an investment company taking a long-term horizon, then trying to juice your short-term return through options, you\u2019ve turned into a hedge fund.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan strategists said they expect the market to recover gradually, but there are still presidential election uncertainties looming in the next couple of months.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe significant reduction in previously extreme long positions in Nasdaq by momentum traders should allow the equity market to recover over the coming weeks, as happened after the June 11th correction,\u201d noted JPMorgan analysts. \u201cBut a repeat of the strong gains seen during July and August is less likely over the next two months.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said there could be more selling in the tech and internet companies, or those that were viewed did well as workers stayed home and the economy was shutdown. \u201cIt\u2019s not the start of a big lasting correction, but a forewarning the next couple of weeks and months are going to be choppy. I think it\u2019s going to be a sideways kind of market,\u201d Grohowski said. He added the market could be choppy in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re a little more cautious, not to mention the market is trading at 23 times our earnings estimates for 2021,\u201d said Grohowski. He said the fact there is about $4.5 trillion in money market funds is a bullish signm since that money could find its way into the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the S&amp;P 500 could dip to its 200-day moving average, or 3,092, before rebounding, which would be about a 15% move in total.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t think the sell-off is over. Nasdaq is up 83%s since March 23, the S&amp;P is up 63%,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/34qCxpv.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/1u5feMS.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/WfvTGox.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/sDw87zF7/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bUFp72p.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cgvDyfD.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SJ4plDu.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/g1WP8F6.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/GtFbRTWy/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NcrK823.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NkAezup.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/D3X10mF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Caps Best Day After Labor Day\n\n&gt; In the last 21 years, only Russell 2000 has registered an average gain of 0.16% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have struggled with negative average performance. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have been up five of the last eight years, but DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have fallen for the last three years on Tuesday. On Wednesday the market\u2019s performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 76.2% of the time with an average gain of 0.25%. S&amp;P 500 is worst, up only 42.9% of the time with an average gain of 0.13%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/1422a049f2b0dbca39b1543c5cff0a42/172c7870552d9912-60/s500x750/ff92c03e01c3e886a523a64381a9c44745538da2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big August: Bullish or Bearish?\n\n&gt; Big August 2020 logged the 4th biggest August percent gain for the S&amp;P 500 since 1949 and the 6th biggest since 1930. But, is this bullish or bearish for the market in the coming months? Hopefully the table below provides some perspective by comparing the previous Top 20 S&amp;P 500 Augusts since 1949 to July, September, Q4 and the succeeding \u201cBest Six Months\u201d November-April.\n\n&gt; Subsequent Septembers were down 15 of 20 years for an average loss of -1.0% (median loss of -0.7%). Q4 is positive with gains in 13 of the 20 years for an average gain of 1.0% (median gain of 3.0%). The following Best Six Months are more bullish, up 16 of the 20 years with an average gain of 7.6% (median gain of 8.5%).\n\n&gt; Looking at just the 7 years that were preceded by big Julys shows some improvement for September but Q4s are worse, containing the largest Q4 losses. Back-to-back big Julys and big Augusts were followed by improved Best Six Months results, up in all 7 instances with a higher average and median gain and the top gain.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/7bd7299f2e7714adc709577da928964e/bd54fb998db4a9e1-46/s1280x1920/3363ff03bfc2dead6e88b387771b6bbad2aafece.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Analyzing the Jobs Report\n\n&gt; The jobs market remains strong, as the August nonfarm payrolls came in at a solid 1.37 million jobs created, right in line with expectations. This was the fourth consecutive month of gains, up 10.6 million over this time frame. In March and April more than 22 million jobs were lost, so we still aren\u2019t quite to half of the jobs recovered though.\n\n&gt; This was the second consecutive month there was a very weak ADP private payrolls number ahead of the monthly jobs report, adding to the worries, but the actual nonfarm payroll number was once again quite solid. Don\u2019t forget, just yesterday we saw initial jobless claims come in at 881,000, the lowest number since the week ending March 14, another improving employment number.\n\n&gt; The big surprise in today\u2019s report though was the unemployment rate fell to 8.4%, from 10.2% last month and an expected 9.8%. This was the lowest unemployment rate since 4.4% in March.\n\n&gt; \u201cThis was an impressive report and once again showed the economy remained quite resilient,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut 8% unemployment is 8% unemployment, so let\u2019s not get too excited, but we\u2019ll still take this improving trend in the employment picture.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, even though more than 10 million jobs have been created in the past four months, the sad truth is we are still quite a long way from recovering all the jobs lost due to the pandemic. In fact, looking at previous cycles, it has taken years for all of the lost jobs to come back and this time doesn\u2019t appear any different.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Blog-9.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; One thing to consider is could this solid number make it harder for Washington to agree on the next stimulus plan? We are watching this closely, but with the two sides still close to a trillion dollars apart, today\u2019s report will likely do little to help the two sides come to a quick resolution.\n\n&gt; Last, don\u2019t forget that stocks gained more than 60% in less than six months, so some weakness would be perfectly normal. In fact, looking at the two previous strongest starts to a bull market ever (\u201982 and \u201909) both saw some weakness right around now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Blog-9.4.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3 Charts To Watch If You Are Bullish\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index just closed the door on its best August since 1986, making new all-time highs along the way, while also closing up five months in a row.\n\n&gt; First things first, make no mistake about it; this is a new bull market. That of course doesn\u2019t mean it will last years like previous bull markets, but a nearly 57% gain in 5 months is what we\u2019d classify as a bull market.\n\n&gt; Here are all the bull markets going back to the Great Depression and where this one ranks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Now let\u2019s dig into the 5 month win streak. It is quite rare for stocks to gain from April through August, as the summer months tend to be somewhat tricky. Yet, we found there were six other years that saw these 5 months all close higher and the rest of the year was higher five times, with some solid returns in there. In fact, the only year that was lower the rest of the year was 2018, mainly due to the Fed policy mistake in December 2018.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWhat might surprise many investors is 5 month win streaks are actually incredibly bullish going forward,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, a year after a 5 month win streak has seen the S&amp;P 500 higher 25 of the past 26 times.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 Index gained more than 35% during this 5 month win streak, the most ever. Yet, the future gains after 5 month win streaks is very impressive, higher 25 out of 26 times a year later. An object in motion tends to stay in motion and this sure seems to be the case here.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Historic August Opens Door To Worst Month Of The Year\n\n&gt; What a month August has been so far, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 7%, for the best August since 1984. Not to be outdone, this is the first time in history August saw two separate 6-day (or more) win streaks. Last, with one day to go, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 16 days so far this month, for the most since 16 in April 2019. Meanwhile, it is the most up days for any August since 2003.\n\n&gt; \u201cWell, 2020 has laughed at many of these things, but be aware September is indeed the worst month of the year on average,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut what caught our attention was both September and October have a negative return during election years, with October the worst month of the year. Could investors get election jitters again in 2020?\u201d\n\n&gt; As show in the LPL Chart of the Day, September tends to be a weak month. In fact, it is the weakest month on average since 1950. Additionally, the last two times August was up more than 5% were 1986 and 2000; the S&amp;P 500 fell 8.5% and 5.4% in September those years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Breaking things down by just an election year shows that August actually tends to be strong. That obviously played out this year, but now will the weakness we usually see in September and October play out?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Finally, after today, the S&amp;P 500 will be up 5 consecutive months. Looking at the other years that saw a similar summer rallies, there tended to be more strength the final 4 months of the year, with only the Federal Reserve policy mistake of December 2018 blemishing this impressive track record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chaert-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Yes, this record equity run is extremely stretched, but we would continue to use any pullbacks as an opportunity to add to longer-term core equity holdings, as the economy continues to come back quicker than most expected.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending September 4th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 9.6.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$PTON** \n&gt; * **$WORK** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$CHWY** \n&gt; * **$KR** \n&gt; * **$ZS** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$AEO** \n&gt; * **$HQY** \n&gt; * **$GFN** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$ORCL** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$RH** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$UXIN** \n&gt; * **$MCFT** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$MEIP** \n&gt; * **$NAV** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$NSSC** \n&gt; * **$ABM** \n&gt; * **$SCWX** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$ALOT** \n&gt; * **$CVGW** \n&gt; * **$DSGX** \n&gt; * **$ZUMZ** \n&gt; * **$GIII** \n&gt; * **$AVAV** \n&gt; * **$BIOX** \n&gt; * **$BIGC** \n&gt; * **$LAKE** \n&gt; * **$LTRX** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$VRNT** \n&gt; * **$FARM**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/GtFbRTWy/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/2yRCg7KY/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.7.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.

        "selftext": "# Is the U.S. market sell-off coming to an end this week?\n\n# U.S. Stock Futures Push Higher Amid 3 Merger Deals\n\n[U.S. stock futures](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing) are rising after two weeks of [stock market](https://stockmarket.com/stock-market-trends-articles/what-is-the-stock-market-2020-06-01) sell-off. Is this a sign of bigger upward movements to come? The positive sentiments came from news of high profile acquisition over the weekend. The Dow futures traded 0.82% higher. The [S&amp;P 500](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=SPY) and [Nasdaq 100](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=QQQ) futures were also in positive territory, moving 1.18% and 1.7% higher respectively as of 6.58 a.m. ET.\n\nThere are a few reasons for the strong start of the week. This came after Nvidia ([NVDA Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=NVDA)) reported that it will acquire wireless chip designer Arm Holdings from SoftBank for $40 billion. In addition, China\u2019s ByteDance has reportedly agreed to sell the U.S. operations of TikTok to Oracle ([ORCL Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=ORCL)). So if you\u2019re looking for any trading activity on Monday, the tech sector could be a good place to start.\n\n## Coronavirus Vaccine Hopes Boosts Market Confidence\n\nCoronavirus cases worldwide have surpassed 29 million. Covid-19 deaths are now more than 900,000. In the U.S. alone, coronavirus cases have hit 6.70 million, with deaths above 198,000. However, most importantly will be the impact on market sentiment this week as AstraZeneca ([AZN Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=AZN)) restarted their final-stage trial of its coronavirus vaccine. The trial was paused last week after one fell ill. Thus far, it\u2019s still unclear what the reason was. Perhaps it was related to the vaccine. But it is just as likely that it was totally unrelated.\n\nPfizer ([PFE Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=PFE)) and BioNTech ([BNTX Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=BNTX)) are looking to expand their late-stage coronavirus vaccine trial to 44,000 people, from 30,000. That would allow testing on a more diverse population. The AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine candidates are generally seen as furthest along, with Moderna ([MRNA Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=MRNA)) following closely behind. With a slight \u2018positive\u2019 development from the vaccine manufacturers, the market appears to be optimistic. This likely contributed partly to the rise of the U.S. stock futures on Sunday evening.\n\n## Apple\u2019s September 15 \u201cTime Flies\u201d Event; What To Expect?\n\nApple ([AAPL Stock Report](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=AAPL)) unveils its new lineup of Apple devices on September 15 at 10 a.m PT.\u00a0 This may pave the way for the arrival of the iPhone 12, which will finally find the company embracing 5G technology. On top of that, almost certainly, the trillion-dollar tech company would also introduce a new Apple Watch. The device continues to be a big seller for the company, not to mention being a category-leading product.\u00a0\n\nAnd strings for an \u201cApple One\u201d bundle have shown up in code for an Apple Music app for Android. This is suggesting that Apple may be close to launching its rumored range of subscription bundles. While consumers are no doubt very excited to check out the latest products and services from Apple, investors are trying to get a grasp on how the stock would perform around the event date. Will Apple surprise investors with news that can send AAPL stock higher this week? Stay tuned.\n\n## Federal Reserve Policy Meeting\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday should be closely watched by investors. This comes after weeks following the central bank\u2019s annual economic policy symposium. Recall that officials announced a new framework that is more tolerant of inflation overshooting the 2% target. This reduces the need for officials to raise rates to curtail a run-up in inflation.\n\nWith many expecting the Fed to maintain its dovish stance on policy, investors will continue assessing the recovery of the global economy from the pandemic. Traders are mindful of recent news on volatility in the options markets. After all, that poses a question mark on the sustainability of the market rally in the past few months.\u00a0\n\n## Gold Gains On Weaker Dollar\n\n[Gold prices](https://stockmarket.com/featured/top-gold-stocks-to-watch-in-september-2020-2020-09-01) rose on Monday, supported by a weaker dollar and expectations that the Fed will adopt a dovish stance like we just mentioned. It rose nearly 0.3% to $1,946.67 per ounce as of 3.43 a.m. ET. As major central banks continue to roll out stimulus measures and keep interest rates low, gold prices will continue to find strong support because of its role as a hedge against inflation.\n\n\u201cThe gold market is leaning towards the Fed\u2019s policy,\u201d said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp, adding that the U.S. central bank might not change the current narrative, but there is a strong belief in the market that it would be able to trigger inflation.",
