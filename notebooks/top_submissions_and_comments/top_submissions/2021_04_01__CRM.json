        "selftext": "UWM looks like it could be a good value play for long-term investors. The company's shares are significantly undervalued at the time of writing.\n\nUWM Holdings: A Good Value Play For Long-Term Investors\nApr. 17, 2021 8:56 AMUWM Holdings Corporation (UWMC)\nSummary\n\nUWM looks like a deep-value play for long-term investors.\nThe company's 2020 financial results were outstanding.\nDeutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse all have significantly increased their price targets.\nThis year's interest rate environment still looks positive for UWM.\n\nWith its stock trading at a forward earnings multiple of only 6x, one would be forgiven for thinking that UWM Holdings Corp. (NYSE:UWMC) is one of the most undervalued mortgage companies in the U.S.\n\nWhat UWM Does\nUWM is the #1 wholesale mortgage lender in the U.S. and has held that position for six consecutive years. The company holds a 34% market share and continues to expand its operations at an unprecedented pace. UWM works with independent mortgage brokers across the U.S. to assist them in providing an outstanding client experience that exceeds anything a bank or retail mortgage lender has to offer. The company also helps its entrepreneurial partners to compete, win, and grow their businesses by providing them with the training, technology, and marketing support they need to succeed.\n\nAn Unparalleled Broker and Client Experience\nUWM's mission is to:\n\n1) Make the mortgage process better for their broker partners.\n\n2) Help their broker partners deliver an unparalleled experience to their borrowers.\n\nThis is achieved by focusing on client experience. Only the best people are hired and trained to deliver outstanding, friendly, personal service through each part of the loan process.\n\nThe company's website states: \"We pick up every call, respond to every email and have a system in place that allows us to answer questions and resolve any issues in minutes, not days. Our broker partners are able to provide their clients with a cheaper, faster, easier mortgage process that takes an average of just 17 days from start to finish, compared to the industry average of 45 to 60 days.\" That's certainly a recipe for success and continued growth in market share.\n\nUWM's design and build proprietary technology helps their broker partners to compete on a higher level than any of their competitors and that they are able to use with their clients.\n\nTools like Blink+ allow brokers to accept online mortgage applications 24/7 and include POS, Loan Origination System, and CRM capabilities.\n\nUWM InTouch is a powerful mobile app that lets brokers manage their loans from their phones, and Brand 360 is a marketing tool that allows brokers to easily market themselves to prospects and real estate agents as well as helps them generate repeat and referral business.\n\nUWM Had a Blowout Year In 2020\nUWM's full-year 2020 loan origination was $182.5 billion, a 69% increase over its prior record production for 2019 of $107.8 billion.\n2020 net income of $3.38 billion, a 715% increase over full-year 2019.\nIncreased UWM's equity to $2.37 billion on December 31, 2020, as compared to $661.3 million on December 31, 2019.\n\nDeutsche Bank Analyst Pounds The Table On UWM\nAfter a conversation with UWM's CTO, Ashish Sabadra, an analyst with Deutsche Bank, stated:\n\n\"The company has invested heavily in putting together a world-class modern IT infrastructure that rivals the scale of much larger organizations and efficiently leverages a mix of modern technologies like the public cloud infrastructure and MSA API based software architectures with more traditional on-prem infrastructure.\" (Source)\n\nUWM's investment in technology enables it to improve operations and costs and deliver on its 'Cheaper, Faster, Easier' initiative to offer industry-leading times to close loans with lower costs.\"\n\nSabadra has a strong buy rating on UWM stock with a 12-month price target of $12.00, a 62% upside from the current price (as of this writing, UWM stock is trading at $7.37)\n\nBoth Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse have 12-month price targets of $10.50\n\n2020 Operational Highlights\n\"UWM maintained an average application to clear to close time (\"Days to Close\") of approximately 18 days in Q420, while management's estimate of the industry average grew to approximately 52 days1, 10 days higher than the 9-month average of 42 days1 as of September 2020. For the month of December, UWM Days to Close was approximately 16 days, while management's estimate of the industry average grew to approximately 54 days.1\nOur commitment to high credit quality is evidenced by a weighted average FICO of 760 for the loans closed in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 757 for the full year of 2020. The credit quality of UWM originations is reflected in the MSR 60+ (mortgage servicing rights) delinquency and forbearance rates which are well below industry averages.\nUWM's highly successful Conquest program launch grew even further in the fourth quarter with the addition of the FHA (Federal Housing Administration) product, joining previously released Conquest programs for Conventional and VA products. With this announcement, UWM is extending access to these very low rates to a larger consumer base. Conquest program loans represented 87.6% of total production in 4Q20.\nCommenced plans to restart jumbo offerings which are expected to go live in March 2021 and will also materially increase purchase volume during the remainder of 2021.\" - Source\nUWM Has Positive Tailwinds for 2021\nUWM focuses solely on the wholesale channel, which is viewed as the \"growth channel\" of the residential mortgage industry, representing 17.2% of the total mortgage market for the nine months ending on September 30, 2020 (most recent data available).\n\n\nAnd UWM dominates this channel, growing its market share to 34.4% for the nine months ending on September 30, 2020 (most recent data available).\n\nFor Q12021, the company is forecasting the following:\n\nClosed loan volume between $52 billion and $57 billion, which would represent an increase of 22.6% and 34.4% as compared to $42.4 billion in the first quarter of 2020.\nTotal gain margin (total loan production income divided by total production) of 200-235 bps, which would be an increase of 110.5%-142.1% compared to 95 bps in the first quarter of 2020.\nOn February 3, 2021, UWM also declared its first regular quarterly dividend of $0.10/share.\n\"The fourth quarter and 2020 overall were phenomenal for UWM and the wholesale channel by any measure,\" said UWM President and CEO Mat Ishbia. By going public and accessing the debt markets, we now have the capital and liquidity to not only invest in technology and service as we have always done but also the ability to take advantage of higher profit opportunities when available or otherwise returning excess cash to our stockholders.\"\n\nRecent Insider Buying Is Positive\nOn March 1, 2021, Robert Verdun, a director, purchased 60,000 shares of UWMC for $7.97\n\nPossible 2021 Headwinds\nRising interest rates would be the biggest potential headwind for UWM in 2021, as this would be a possible damper on the housing market and could negatively affect the mortgage market.\n\nNevertheless, Melinda Wilder, COO of UWM, stated last month (March 2021):\n\n\"They (mortgage rates) are ticking up, but still a great opportunity. There's still a lot of refinances to be done. And certainly, there's a lot of purchases to happen, too, so still a really, really great time to buy a home. But again, there's a lot of refinances still out there, even with ticking up rates....if you look over the grand scope -- this is my 20th year in the business, you look over the grand scope of things, it's really still a great time to buy a house. So we're really, really excited for that purchase season that's about to start this spring.\" (Source)\n\nAnd Lawrence Yun, Chief Economist with the National Association of Realtors, stated: \"In 2021, I think rates will be similar or modestly higher (than 2020), maybe 3%\" he says. \"So mortgage rates will continue to be historically favorable.\" (Source)\n\nIn Summary\nUWM is well-positioned for another outstanding year in both top- and bottom-line results. The company holds a dominant share of the wholesale mortgage market and has a wide moat because of its investments in technology, training, and right hiring to provide its clients with an outstanding experience.\n\n\nWith mortgage rates that will likely remain favorable this year and a strong housing market this spring, UWM looks like it could be a good value play for long-term investors. The company's shares are significantly undervalued at the time of writing.",

        "selftext": "**A bit of foreword:** I was focusing on the stocks related to remote work for the last year trying to gather a portfolio that will hedge my main investments. Honestly, I think this \u201cNew Normal\u201d is not going to end anytime soon. \n\nI\u2019ve looked over a dozen small cap companies, but this one really got me. So, here\u2019s the result of some days of my homework - enjoy my first DD. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkzichw0cmq61.png?width=564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae33c8afe8e690faf15ffcedd99147c0f1e0d1af\n\n**The company is called Xigem Technologies (**[here\u2019s](https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/) **the website ) and their ambition is to create a remote work ecosystem.**\n\n**The ticker is $XIGM on CSE and $2C1 on FSE.** \n\nTl;dr: It\u2019s a SAAS company with their own patented software, a plan to roll into several booming markets, and a whole lot of upcoming catalysts. Scroll down for my risks overview and a brief conclusion. \n\n## Company Profile \n\nAfter reading their prospectus I see that their **main objective is to create a diversified pool of intellectual properties focused on the remote work segment**. The acquisitions will provide a halo effect and will be integrated into a one stop shop for all the tools needed for remote business operations. \n\nThey started with an acquisition of a software called iAgent: cloud-based application that provides businesses an ability to control their employees remotely. The solution was patented and it gives me more reasons to believe that these guys are serious in what they are planning to do.\n\n[https://patents.google.com/patent/US10405151B2/](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10405151B2/) \n\n[https://patents.google.com/patent/US10149128B2/](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10149128B2/) \n\n[https://patents.google.com/patent/US9756492](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9756492) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7yj95vc4cmq61.png?width=2353&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9758a06038a4970a1e6cdbda7840ea7b1d70c24\n\nAs a starting point they intend to sell this solution to **insurance, telehealth and e-learning clients.** \n\nFrom my point of view, the main reason for these niches is their market size and connections that a board of directors has. A huge market that they can tap into and a seasoned board is almost a key for success when we are talking about small cap companies.\n\nSome studies, articles and graphs that make me think that telehealth and remote care are going up: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **A nice wrap-up from Intel**  \n[**https://cli.co/L7i6Ylr**](https://cli.co/L7i6Ylr) \n* **Healthcare insurer Cigna report**  \n[**https://www.cigna.com/static/www-cigna-com/docs/about-us/newsroom/innovation/cigna-covid-trends-factsheet-virtual-and-behavioral-health.pdf**](https://www.cigna.com/static/www-cigna-com/docs/about-us/newsroom/innovation/cigna-covid-trends-factsheet-virtual-and-behavioral-health.pdf) \n* **McKinsey study summary by Reuters**  \n[**https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-consumer-idUSKBN2BA0FR**](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-consumer-idUSKBN2BA0FR) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bd7x3hz5cmq61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a84f98029acffbbc3d5e9571caefa34a1dd849c\n\nThere\u2019s a ton of other underdeveloped industries that could use the platform, just to guess a few:  \n\n* Delivery companies that don\u2019t have money to develop their own service like that;\n* Construction contractors; \n* Home renovation companies; \n* Service companies. \n\nLike with any other SaaS/PaaS solutions once the core application is built it is pretty easy to adjust it towards a new industry, this enables a high scalability potential.\n\n## How This Thing Is Going To Work\n\nHere\u2019s a tl;dr version of patented workflow:  \n[https://patents.google.com/patent/US9756492](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9756492) \n\nOnce you get this Xigem app (iOS, Android or a Web client), you get a dashboard with all the control options. You can literally play it like a good old strategy game:\n\n* You can see all your units (aka employees) in their locations in real time; \n* You can see their availability status, work hours, next tasks, list of completed tasks, ratings; \n* You can see all the equipment they have on them as well as their qualifications ; \n* You can see all the incoming customers' calls or requests and send them your closest or the most qualified worker in an instant (or group them for more difficult tasks); \n* The closest available employee engages with a client (of course, they talk via the app server) and gets all the info to finish the task \n\nWhen your field unit is on site - you can control his work with: \n\n1. Timestamp photos; \n2. Customer signature; \n3. Live location updates. \n\n### Why do I think business will use it? \n\nInstead of having call center book appointments with a prospective client multiple days in advance, they would be able to direct a nearby agent to their home, reducing cancellations and no-shows that naturally occur when such appointments are booked. \n\nAs a nice addition, with a sufficient number of salesforce you can market your business with ASAP delivery guarantee claims \u201cWe will do whatever you need in 30 minutes from your call\u201d and actually stand for your word.\n\n## So, why $XIGM and not other stocks - Bullish stuff\n\nA few reasons that - I think - justify all the good perspectives with Xigem: \n\n1. They already have the platform in testing with dates and deadlines - several real catalysts; \n2. They got their first clients who are ready to pay once the platform is adjusted to their specifications   \n\\- FluBusters   \n[https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-to-develop-remote-technology-platform-for-flubusters-inc/](https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-to-develop-remote-technology-platform-for-flubusters-inc/)  \n\\- and ISI  \n[https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-to-enhance-cloud-based-technology-platform-for-insurance-supermarket-inc/](https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-to-enhance-cloud-based-technology-platform-for-insurance-supermarket-inc/); \n3. They are tapping into huge and growing industries (check the overview above);\n4. Their experienced board of directors looks like they know what they\u2019re doing and it\u2019s not made of 20-yo startup maniacs with ReVoLuTiOnArY ideas (Check Brian Kalish, Connor Bill, Stephen Coates, Scott WIlson, all have more than 20 years of experience, and ability to raise capital, you can check the profiles on website [https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/board-of-directors/](https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/board-of-directors/)); \n5. Their platform is flexible and scalable and has a build-in diversification; in case something goes tits up they will be able to change the industry (as it\u2019s stated in the core structure in patents). \n\n## Financials\n\nThey have been listed recently and do not have a cash flow yet (and that\u2019s why it\u2019s on the market for $0,3 per share, duh) so I hope to make a DD with all the proper numbers when they\u2019ll start. You have all the dates, though. So far - found these: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/210wawlgcmq61.png?width=1132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be3dd0582aafd0e578d86d8ec4a0a0ad36b7e15a\n\nAlso - they have a budget on each part of the plan: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zi6yyiohcmq61.png?width=984&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbf859f6d162e8840c3b579fb5a2d0296cbc1c08\n\nAnd so it goes: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xb5ry3hicmq61.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8db02abe12c90e54daf8dcc47568c85721699123\n\n## What Makes Me Nervous - Some Bearish Stuff\ud83d\udcf7\n\nI easily get overly-excited about stuff I like, so I do my best to double-check all the \u201cintuitive\u201d decisions. Here are the things that I worry about, let\u2019s play some Devil\u2019s advocate here: \n\n1. There is no cashflow. I can\u2019t see all the major numbers I would look for in other DDs, like price to sales or debt to equity. It\u2019s understandable since we\u2019re talking about a new company, but it makes the whole thing quite risky; \n2. They may fail to raise additional capital to complete the customization for the telehealth industry, since the initial platform was built for insurance companies; \n3. Customer acquisition costs, since its B2B where average lead cost ranges around \\~$1000 it makes them dependent on strategic partnerships and alliances. Will see how many LOIs they will be able to generate in the next months; \n4. Again - a good old boring B2B solution, so Elon Musk tweets or WSB apes are less likely to give it a moonshot. \n\n# Why am I balls deep now?\n\nBecause they already have 2 letters of intent and the release dates show that there will be more: \n\n* LOI with Insurance Supermarket on March 23\n* LOI with FluBusters on March 25\n\nMy theory is that before the major catalysts (Alpha Version release) - **they\u2019re going to close more clients.** We still didn\u2019t see the e-learning and telemedicine companies they mention in their strategy. Therefore, major LOIs are coming up, making ME closer to a red ass Lamborghini (jk, I actually have a taste). \n\nHere are the key takeaways from their official press-release, with a number of dates when I hope people will start FOMOing it (aka major events that are supposed to move the price)\n\n* **May, 2021** \\- Customization and testing of its Platform will be completed and **alpha version released**\n* **August, 2021** \\- Beta testing of the platform for Insurance company \n* **March, 2022 -** Adjust platform for telehealth\n\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned previously they are not developing the app from scratch, so I do not have any doubts about a successful completion of these milestones.\n\n## Conclusion \n\nFrom what I see, XIGEM is focusing on several booming remote work markets with a Pokemon-style intent to \u201ccatch 'em all\u201d.  As any other tournament, it\u2019s risky, but the potential win seems to be a realistic perspective for those who join the party early enough. \n\nA room to grow, a nice market specialization, a product that already works, several clients who already want it - all \ud83d\udc4c. Risk factors?\ud83d\udc4c  as well, we still don\u2019t have some important info, and that\u2019s why it is where it is so far. \n\nAs of right now $XIGM is on CSE and FSE @ 0,28-0,3. It looks like some serious undervaluation that is likely to end in the upcoming months with all the tests success and new LOIs. I prefer to think that I\u2019ve reserved myself a seat on this ride up. \n\n**P.S.** Since the title mentions my balls, I guess y\u2019all want to know the size, how exactly deep I am in this. As of now, I've put $8k averaging .28 per share. Will see how many LOIs they will be able generate and will increase my positions before main catalysts.\n\n**P.P.S.** I\u2019m in no way a financial advisor, and if I couldn\u2019t talk myself out of it - doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t as well. Feel free to ask any questions in the comments, I\u2019ve spent several days on this one and I\u2019ll try to answer them if possible. \n\n**P.P.P.S.** In my thread on DD instructions in the sub next door some days ago (thanks everyone who answered!) there was a guy who said he likes rocket ships.

        "selftext": "[Universe Pharmaceuticals](http://www.universe-pharmacy.com/companyprofile.html?type=company) ($UPC) is a pharmaceuticals and medical research company specializing in the manufacturing, marketing, sales, and distribution of traditional Chinese medicine derivatives products targeting the elderly with the goal of addressing their physical conditions in the aging process and promoting general well-being. \n\nThe company also sells biomedical drugs medical instruments, Traditional Chinese Medicine Pieces, and dietary supplements manufactured by third-party pharmaceutical companies. Its products are under two categories namely treatment and relief for common chronic health conditions in the elderly designed to achieve physical wellness and longevity (Chronic Condition Treatments), and cold and flu medications.\n\nAs of today, UPC stock price declined to $4.75 with 75,017 million shares trading. All dips are being bought back up. UPC benefits from a low share float: 8.52M. 2 Week +13.9% - Low 3.75 - High 11.99 - SPY +5.1%). \n\nThere is a potential Short Squeeze about to happen because of an increase in short volume over the past 2 days with very little cover volume. Inflow is garbage, with some more serious volume &amp; resumed buying will move UPC in an upwards trajectory. \n\nThe US market is a big scam because of the hedge short-sellers and it's making real retail investors disappointed. Price won't go up without buyers slapping the ask and holding. A lot of people just can't stand to wait. If you didn't get the deferred-gratification gene, you've got to work very hard to overcome that. \n\nTrimming down my positions in Tesla, Amazon, Netflix, and Salesforce a few years back has been among the costliest decisions of my life. And the best way to alleviate this problem is not to sell at all, unless your bullish thesis is fundamentally broken. Executing on such an idea requires a disposition that most investors lack. \n\nStart your position now and stage your buys. Don\u2019t sell. Long hold periods are not simply a preference. They are an absolute necessity to achieve life-changing returns. If you hold a stock that is compounding at 20% annually for 25 years, you returned 100 times your money. \n\nMost investors don't realize that they need to protect their portfolio first and foremost from themselves.

        "selftext": "Hello Traders and Investors! What a week right?! So many stories and earnings! Here is my weekly recap which I share every Friday to help to wrap your head around these markets! Feel free to DM me any of your questions and happy trades! \n\nThe S&amp;P 500 opened at $4138.78 today, lower than its previous Friday\u2019s close of $4185.67 and its 52 week high of 4,191.31. Recovery from COVID has seen significant gains in the market as prices pull back from last week\u2019s all-time-highs. \n\nReports released Thursday that President Biden could propose a capital gains tax increase to 39.6% on individuals earning $1 million dollars or more, nearly double the current nominal rate of 20%. Additionally, a 3.8% investment tax currently exists to fund Obamacare. This potentially pushes the tax rate 43.4% which conflicts with long standing tax practices that have historically seen investment income lower than labor taxes. Such an increase seeks to address long standing notions of wealthy individuals paying lower tax rates than middle and low-income workers, a sentiment that President Biden campaigned on and championed. \n\nMembers of the GOP suggest the increase will halt economic growth, leading those affected to hoard assets in order to avoid the tax. It is unclear if these claims will hold water, as historically there has been a low correlation between increases to the capital gains tax and the market. In 2013 the S&amp;P experienced stellar growth of 30% despite an increase to capital gains tax of over 86%. \n\nJobless claims dropped more than 7% from last week according to the Labor Department. This coincides with robust gains in the market as a whole as the country recovers from last year\u2019s COVID pandemic. Current job loss from pre-COVID era still hovers around 8 million. Increase in national vaccine rollouts, averaging 3 million per day, should expedite this recovery. Approximately 40% of Americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine.  \nSeveral major travel companies reported earnings this week. This includes American Airlines, United Airlines, Royal Caribbean. The International Air Transport Association has commented on the situation, citing potential losses in the sector of $48 Billion for the 2021 fiscal year. These numbers are over a 25% increase from previously released estimates of $38 Billion. Although significant, losses are down significantly from last year, where the industry suffered a $126.4 Billion loss in the wake of COVID shutdowns. \n\nAmerican Airlines posted dismal earnings of -$5.54 per share Thursday. A spokesperson for American Airlines said the company is spending around $30 Million per day in operations costs, despite reducing annual operating costs by $1.3 Billion. The company continues to consolidate and revealed it expects to reduce its workforce by 1,600 in the coming months. In addition, American Airlines reportedly reached a deal with Boeing to delay delivery of twenty-three 737 jets for up to 3 years. American Airlines posted revenue of 4.01 Billion, just under half of it\u2019s posted revenue only a year ago. Airports are functioning at around 60% of their capacity. \n\n\"We continued to excel in growing customer relationships in our market focus areas of mobility, fiber and HBO Max,\" said AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey in reference to a favorable Q1 Earnings report for the communications giant. Q1 Earnings reports reveal an excellent quarter for the company, who continues to grow in cell-service subscribers. AT&amp;T also posted favorable results for its HBO Max service, which it received in its 2018, $85 Billion acquisition of Time Warner. \n\nA Tesla vehicle was involved in a fatal crash that killed two people over the weekend. The car was suspected to have been functioning on Autopilot by investigators as it was found with no occupant in the driver\u2019s seat. Tesla has revealed that they have no data that suggests the vehicle was on Autopilot during the crash at this time Tesla did not rule out the possibility that further investigation may reveal the vehicle was in-fact on autopilot, but declined to make any additional comments at this time. \n\nDiscord, a popular chat application developed for gamers, has ended months-long acquisition talks with tech giant Microsoft. Market Valuation of Discord has skyrocketed to $10 Billion from last year\u2019s June valuation of $3.5 Billion. This comes at a time where many social media platforms are looking to develop and integrate chat functions in a way to capture user engagement and capitalize on the increase in remote work. Discord now intends to stay independent and pursue an IPO. \n\nThe decision by Discord comes as Salesforce looks to acquire Slack in Q2 \u201821 for $27 Billion. Slack operates a chatroom not unlike Discord, but targeted at businesses as opposed to consumers. The acquisition is currently pending a U.S. Justice Department probe that will determine whether or not it will continue. Microsoft's attempted acquisition of Discord on the heels of Slack\u2019s pending acquisition is likely a response to increased competition for Microsoft from Salesforce in the B2B and B2C technology markets. \n\nNetflix reached 208 million subscribers in Q1, just missing its projection of 210 million. The tech giant blames this miss on societal normalization as COVID regulations ease and more people return to work. Quarantine mandates saw a massive increase of 16 million new subscribers in the early months, and just over 10 million between April and June of 2020. In contrast, January through April of 2021 saw only 4 million new subscribers.  Regardless, the streaming giant reported an earnings per share of $3.75, versus $1.57 the year prior, which beat Wall Street predictions. Netflix\u2019s 2020 subscriber boom showed massive financial gains in revenue, operating income, and operating margin. Q2 forecasts project a slight correction to this growth due to job growth and general societal rebound.\n\n**Some of the companies who reported earnings this week:**\n\n**Monday, April 19th:**\n\nCoca-Cola Co.: $0.55\n\nIBM Corp.: $1.77\n\nUnited Airlines: -$7.50\n\n**Tuesday, April 20th:**\n\nJohnson and Johnson: $2.32\n\nProcter and Gamble: $1.63\n\nNetflix: $3.75\n\nPhillip Morris: $1.57\n\nLockheed Martin: $6.56\n\n**Wednesday, April 21st:**\n\nProgressive: $1.72\n\nVerizon: $1.27\n\nChipotle: $5.36\n\nEquifax: $1.97\n\nNasdaq: $1.73\n\nDiscover: $5.04\n\nHalliburton: $0.19\n\nBaker Hughes: $0.12\n\n**Thursday, April 22nd:**\n\nIntel $1.39\n\nSnap $0.00\n\nBiogen $5.34\n\nSouthwest Airlines -$1.72\n\nVeriSign $1.33\n\nQuest Diagnostics $3.76\n\nBoston Beer Company $5.26\n\nAmerican Airlines -$4.32",

        "selftext": "UWM Holdings: A Good Value Play For Long-Term Investors\nApr. 17, 2021 8:56 AMUWM Holdings Corporation (UWMC)\nSummary\n\nUWM looks like a deep-value play for long-term investors.\nThe company's 2020 financial results were outstanding.\nDeutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse all have significantly increased their price targets.\nThis year's interest rate environment still looks positive for UWM.\n\nWith its stock trading at a forward earnings multiple of only 6x, one would be forgiven for thinking that UWM Holdings Corp. (NYSE:UWMC) is one of the most undervalued mortgage companies in the U.S.\n\nWhat UWM Does\nUWM is the #1 wholesale mortgage lender in the U.S. and has held that position for six consecutive years. The company holds a 34% market share and continues to expand its operations at an unprecedented pace. UWM works with independent mortgage brokers across the U.S. to assist them in providing an outstanding client experience that exceeds anything a bank or retail mortgage lender has to offer. The company also helps its entrepreneurial partners to compete, win, and grow their businesses by providing them with the training, technology, and marketing support they need to succeed.\n\nAn Unparalleled Broker and Client Experience\nUWM's mission is to:\n\n1) Make the mortgage process better for their broker partners.\n\n2) Help their broker partners deliver an unparalleled experience to their borrowers.\n\nThis is achieved by focusing on client experience. Only the best people are hired and trained to deliver outstanding, friendly, personal service through each part of the loan process.\n\nThe company's website states: \"We pick up every call, respond to every email and have a system in place that allows us to answer questions and resolve any issues in minutes, not days. Our broker partners are able to provide their clients with a cheaper, faster, easier mortgage process that takes an average of just 17 days from start to finish, compared to the industry average of 45 to 60 days.\" That's certainly a recipe for success and continued growth in market share.\n\nUWM's design and build proprietary technology helps their broker partners to compete on a higher level than any of their competitors and that they are able to use with their clients.\n\nTools like Blink+ allow brokers to accept online mortgage applications 24/7 and include POS, Loan Origination System, and CRM capabilities.\n\nUWM InTouch is a powerful mobile app that lets brokers manage their loans from their phones, and Brand 360 is a marketing tool that allows brokers to easily market themselves to prospects and real estate agents as well as helps them generate repeat and referral business.\n\nUWM Had a Blowout Year In 2020\nUWM's full-year 2020 loan origination was $182.5 billion, a 69% increase over its prior record production for 2019 of $107.8 billion.\n2020 net income of $3.38 billion, a 715% increase over full-year 2019.\nIncreased UWM's equity to $2.37 billion on December 31, 2020, as compared to $661.3 million on December 31, 2019.\n\nDeutsche Bank Analyst Pounds The Table On UWM\nAfter a conversation with UWM's CTO, Ashish Sabadra, an analyst with Deutsche Bank, stated:\n\n\"The company has invested heavily in putting together a world-class modern IT infrastructure that rivals the scale of much larger organizations and efficiently leverages a mix of modern technologies like the public cloud infrastructure and MSA API based software architectures with more traditional on-prem infrastructure.\" (Source)\n\nUWM's investment in technology enables it to improve operations and costs and deliver on its 'Cheaper, Faster, Easier' initiative to offer industry-leading times to close loans with lower costs.\"\n\nSabadra has a strong buy rating on UWM stock with a 12-month price target of $12.00, a 62% upside from the current price (as of this writing, UWM stock is trading at $7.37)\n\nBoth Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse have 12-month price targets of $10.50\n\n2020 Operational Highlights\n\"UWM maintained an average application to clear to close time (\"Days to Close\") of approximately 18 days in Q420, while management's estimate of the industry average grew to approximately 52 days1, 10 days higher than the 9-month average of 42 days1 as of September 2020. For the month of December, UWM Days to Close was approximately 16 days, while management's estimate of the industry average grew to approximately 54 days.1\nOur commitment to high credit quality is evidenced by a weighted average FICO of 760 for the loans closed in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 757 for the full year of 2020. The credit quality of UWM originations is reflected in the MSR 60+ (mortgage servicing rights) delinquency and forbearance rates which are well below industry averages.\nUWM's highly successful Conquest program launch grew even further in the fourth quarter with the addition of the FHA (Federal Housing Administration) product, joining previously released Conquest programs for Conventional and VA products. With this announcement, UWM is extending access to these very low rates to a larger consumer base. Conquest program loans represented 87.6% of total production in 4Q20.\nCommenced plans to restart jumbo offerings which are expected to go live in March 2021 and will also materially increase purchase volume during the remainder of 2021.\" - Source\nUWM Has Positive Tailwinds for 2021\nUWM focuses solely on the wholesale channel, which is viewed as the \"growth channel\" of the residential mortgage industry, representing 17.2% of the total mortgage market for the nine months ending on September 30, 2020 (most recent data available).\n\n\nAnd UWM dominates this channel, growing its market share to 34.4% for the nine months ending on September 30, 2020 (most recent data available).\n\nFor Q12021, the company is forecasting the following:\n\nClosed loan volume between $52 billion and $57 billion, which would represent an increase of 22.6% and 34.4% as compared to $42.4 billion in the first quarter of 2020.\nTotal gain margin (total loan production income divided by total production) of 200-235 bps, which would be an increase of 110.5%-142.1% compared to 95 bps in the first quarter of 2020.\nOn February 3, 2021, UWM also declared its first regular quarterly dividend of $0.10/share.\n\"The fourth quarter and 2020 overall were phenomenal for UWM and the wholesale channel by any measure,\" said UWM President and CEO Mat Ishbia. By going public and accessing the debt markets, we now have the capital and liquidity to not only invest in technology and service as we have always done but also the ability to take advantage of higher profit opportunities when available or otherwise returning excess cash to our stockholders.\"\n\nRecent Insider Buying Is Positive\nOn March 1, 2021, Robert Verdun, a director, purchased 60,000 shares of UWMC for $7.97\n\nPossible 2021 Headwinds\nRising interest rates would be the biggest potential headwind for UWM in 2021, as this would be a possible damper on the housing market and could negatively affect the mortgage market.\n\nNevertheless, Melinda Wilder, COO of UWM, stated last month (March 2021):\n\n\"They (mortgage rates) are ticking up, but still a great opportunity. There's still a lot of refinances to be done. And certainly, there's a lot of purchases to happen, too, so still a really, really great time to buy a home. But again, there's a lot of refinances still out there, even with ticking up rates....if you look over the grand scope -- this is my 20th year in the business, you look over the grand scope of things, it's really still a great time to buy a house. So we're really, really excited for that purchase season that's about to start this spring.\" (Source)\n\nAnd Lawrence Yun, Chief Economist with the National Association of Realtors, stated: \"In 2021, I think rates will be similar or modestly higher (than 2020), maybe 3%\" he says. \"So mortgage rates will continue to be historically favorable.\" (Source)\n\nIn Summary\nUWM is well-positioned for another outstanding year in both top- and bottom-line results. The company holds a dominant share of the wholesale mortgage market and has a wide moat because of its investments in technology, training, and right hiring to provide its clients with an outstanding experience.\n\n\nWith mortgage rates that will likely remain favorable this year and a strong housing market this spring, UWM looks like it could be a good value play for long-term investors. The company's shares are significantly undervalued at the time of writing.",

        "selftext": " Alright lads, this gem of a company is what you would get if $PLTR and $GME had a baby (they may have..).\n\nBefore I go into the long ass DD, I\u2019ll provide a quick TL;DR for all the fellow apes out there, so just scroll to the bottom!\n\nThe case for $ETWO:\n\nE2Open, or $ETWO, provides cloud-based, on-demand software for supply chains for everything from computers, electronics systems and, well, essentially any company wanting to have an edge on it\u2019s competitors . And let\u2019s be serious, data is the modern day oil. Here is their Investment Thesis:\n\n[https://imgur.com/M95UL86](https://imgur.com/M95UL86)\n\nAnd seeing how my only claim to success is a massive GME yolo back in November, I\u2019ll let someone with better credentials describe this company. Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Merwin initiated coverage on $ETWO and gave it a BUY rating (note: Loop Capital also just recently upgraded it to BUY). He had this to say about it:\n\n\"E2Open is a provider of supply chain management (SCM) solutions to the enterprise. While the SCM space is relatively mature, E2Open has assembled an impressive suite or products - organically and through M&amp;A - which cover all functional areas of supply chain management, and importantly break down data silos to provide deeper insights into and efficiencies for the supply chain. With an improving cross-sell motion providing a $1bn of expansion\n\nopportunity within its customer base today, we see long-term runway for at least low double digit top line growth along with 30%+ EBITDA margins through FY24. With shares trading at 6.1x/18.9x our CY22 revenue and EBITDA forecasts relative to similar growth peers median at 8.9x/22.2x we see an attractive entry point at current levels.\"\n\nAnother notable thing worth mentioning is that the company was founded as a joint project of 8 major companies: Hitachi, IBM, LG Electronics, Matsushita, Nortel, Seagate, Solectron, and Toshiba. In other words, $ETWO had some goliaths backing them from the start.\n\n[u/DragonfruitAccurate3](https://www.reddit.com/u/DragonfruitAccurate3/) had a solid DD on $ETWO not long ago. Instead of trying to put it in my own words, I\u2019ll just use his, as his DD is flawless IMO:\n\n*Why E2Open is likely undervalued*\n\n*Insight Partners, the private equity firm that owns E2Open has a ridiculously strong history of taking midsized SaaS companies like E2Open from valuations of hundreds of millions to multi billion dollar valuations. Other companies in Insight Partner's portfolio include:*\n\n*- Qualtrics (invested at $850mm valuation, sold in 2018 for $8bn and 9.4x+ return)*\n\n*- Shopify (invested in 2013, IPOed at $17/share in 2015 and is now $1,225/share for a likely 100x+ return)*\n\n*- DocuSign (invested in 2017 they IPOed in 2018 at $29/share in 2018 and is now $244.93/share)*\n\n*- Twitter (invested in 2009, it was valued at $100mm in 2008 and now has a $43bn market cap)*\n\n*- Diligent (bought in 2016 for $624mm and currently valued at $4bn for a 6.4x return)*\n\n*- Chegg (invested in 2009, IPOed in 2013 at $12.50/share, currently at $92/share)*\n\n*- Alteryx (invested in 2014, IPOed in 2017 at $14/share, currently at $129/share)*\n\n*- E2Open (bought in 2015 for $273mm, current enterprise valuation is around $2.57bn for a 9.4x return)*\n\n*The top 2 managing directors of Insight Partners: Adam Berger and Deven Parekh both sit on the E2Open board. They're known as active investors heavily involved in the strategic direction and acquisition strategy of E2Open. Deven Parekh was the lead for the early Twitter investment in 2009 that saw a return north of 40,000%. The guy is nothing short of a visionary.*\n\n*The most similar company to E2Open in Insight Partner's portfolio is Diligent. They're both SaaS platforms with long sales cycles, and have almost identical revenue ($340mm for Diligent vs $335mm for E2Open), and a similar product strategy of rapid acquisition and integration. Despite the similarities, Diligent is valued substantially more ($4+bn for Diligent, while only $2.73bn for E2Open), leading one to believe that E2Open is currently undervalued.*\n\n*Further evidence of E2Open's undervaluation is in its enterprise value relative to EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). E2Open's value is only 21.3x EBITDA, which is on par with the average software EBITDA of 20-24x, while its closest peers Descartes is at 29.2x and Kinaxis is at a whopping 59.1x. Significant upside remains in E2Open's future growth.*\n\n*E2Open\u2019s approach to acquiring industry leaders has enabled them to acquire a stable of tech clients such as AMD, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Nvidia, as well as top industrial, consumer and transportation clients such as Honda, GE, Raytheon, Gap, Nike, New Balance, CocaCola, Peloton, Tapestry (Coach), DHL, UPS, and many others. They have over 1,000+ customers and the top 100 clients have yearly subscriptions with E2Open that top $1.5mm+ in revenue each, which is substantial for any SaaS platform.*\n\n*E2Open customers include:*\n\n[*https://imgur.com/RG6rryD*](https://imgur.com/RG6rryD)\n\n*E2Open's strategic acquisitions of the past 7 years (at least 11 companies) allows end-to-end supply chain data visibility, the holy grail for tech and consumer goods companies. This allows them to compete in the big leagues against incumbents such as SAP and Oracle while leaving single use-case disruptors in the dust.*\n\n*E2Open has yet to fully realize its data integration potential involving artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and ESG/sustainability. E2Open has plenty of avenues to pursue multipliers in shareholder value. It wouldn't surprise me that E2Open were to acquire an AI/ML supply chain company in the following quarters to boost shareholder value.*\n\n*If E2Open successfully executes their strategy of fully integrated end-to-end supply chain visibility, it's possible that they'd be acquired by SAP, Oracle, Amazon, Shopify or even Salesforce in the coming years at multiples of their current valuation. The potential value and unique competitive advantage of the data and tech E2Open offers is far too valuable for these companies to ignore.*\n\n*Product stickiness is a key differentiator for E2Open. It boasts of gross retention rates above 95%. The exceedingly low churn rate, a key health indicator of SaaS platforms, is a strong positive indicator of future growth.*\n\n*E2Open is one of the largest software firms focused on the supply chain sector with the following actual and expected revenue and is PROFITABLE:*\n\n*2019A- 205M*\n\n*2020A- 305M*\n\n*2021E- 335M*\n\n*2022E- 367M*\n\n*Current institutional investors PRE-MERGER include Goldman Sachs, Blackstone Group, and many big filing claims coming including this recent submission:* [*https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1581655/000089914021000056/c011321a.htm*](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1581655/000089914021000056/c011321a.htm)\n\nNow for the juicy bit my friends:\n\nThe SHORT SQUEEZE.\n\nThe most perplexing thing I came across while researching $ETWO was the insanely high amount of Short Interest. Here is a shot from finviz on 4/26/2021 (The day I\u2019m writing this):\n\n[https://imgur.com/9A7W7EC](https://imgur.com/9A7W7EC)\n\nThe % of the float short is a whopping 48%! In contrast, $MVIS\u2019s % of float shorted is a little over 19%, $CLOV is at 35% and $GME is around 20%. Stock grid has a good visual representation of $ETWO\u2019s short %:\n\n[https://www.stockgrid.io/shortinterest/etwo](https://www.stockgrid.io/shortinterest/e2)\n\nYou will also notice, on both finviz and stockgrid, the short ratio. For you fellow apes out there who can barely read, The short ratio tells investors approximately how many days it would take short sellers to cover their positions if the price of a given stock were to increase. The higher the short ratio, the longer it will take to buy back those borrowed shares. The Short ratio for $ETWO is a whopping 7 days! In contrast, $GME\u2019s is at 0.23 days, $MVIS is 3.4 days, and $CLOV is 4.2 days. This means it will take a full week (more than that, considering trading weeks are only 5 days) for the shorts to cover their asses. A sharp uptick in price will have them bending over in no time.\n\nAnother key indicator that convinces me that this stock is going to the moon is one of [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) \u2018s favorites: Insider Buying. The following chart shows the latest insider buyer action:\n\n[https://imgur.com/TTs5qqZ](https://imgur.com/TTs5qqZ)\n\nYou can see that insiders are buying the shit out of this stock, and not selling. It\u2019s always a great confirmation bias when the company insiders like the stock.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n$ETWO is an upcoming Supply Chain Software company with 48% of it\u2019s float shorted. It\u2019s fundamentals are sound, it\u2019s potential is huge, and it\u2019s currently heavily undervalued. It\u2019s\n\nbeing backed by Hitachi, IBM, LG Electronics, Matsushita, Nortel, Seagate, Solectron, and Toshiba.\n\nSome of it\u2019s notable customers are: MD, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Nvidia, as well as top industrial, consumer and transportation clients such as Honda, GE, Raytheon, Gap, Nike, New Balance, CocaCola, Peloton, Tapestry (Coach), DHL, UPS, and many others. They have over 1,000+ customers and the top 100 clients have yearly subscriptions with E2Open that top $1.5mm+ in revenue each, which is substantial for any SaaS platform.\n\nThe % of the float shortest is a whopping 48%! It\u2019s short ratio is 7 (It will take shorts 7 days to cover their positions if the stock ticks up).\n\nEven shorter TL;DR:\n\nI like the stock. It\u2019s undervalued. It\u2019s about to go on a short squeeze ride to the moon, and even the big wigs over at JP Morgan are saying this thing is a steal. Oh, and it\u2019s clients are of the likes of FB, Google, Intel, MSFT, NVDA, NKE, etc (Look at the above list for more).\n\n$ETWO Positions:\n\n12/17/21 12.5c,\n\n12/17/21 15c,\n\n12/1721 17.5c",

Majority Leader Schumer (D-NY) had argued a 1974 law allows budget resolutions to be revised, with which the parliamentarian concurred. Ruling opens key legislative pathway for Biden's expected two-phase infrastructure and stimulus plan but process still likely to be challenging as Democrats need to prevent any defections from their caucus, and more moderate Sens. Manchin and Sinema have argued against using reconciliation again this year. Reconciliation can also eat up large amounts of legislative floor time as both parties can offer multiple amendments. And not all bills can be passed through reconciliation (recall a minimum-wage component was stripped from Biden's $1.9T American Rescue Plan).\n   * **February job openings higher than expected, companies need workers:**\n      * Job openings increased by 268K, or 3.8% in February to just under 7.4M, well ahead of the 6.9M consensus. JPMorgan noted that the 615K increase in January and February represented the largest two-month gain for the series going back to 2000, apart from the sharp recovery in the early stages of the pandemic. Job openings rate increased by 0.2pp to 4.9%, and the hiring rate increased by 0.2pp to 4.0%. The quits rate was unchanged at 2.3%. Fits with heightened focus on labor market recovery following blowout March payrolls data last Friday. [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-05/u-s-airlines-step-up-pilot-recalls-as-travel-demand-rebounds?sref=L75TRUmI) discussed how airlines are bringing back more pilots as travel demand rebounds.

Noted that worker shortfall is hardly limited to hospitality.\n   * **Credit Suisse discloses $4.7B hit from Archegos fallout:**\n      * Credit Suisse said today it will take a $4.7B writedown related to the forced liquidations of positions held by Archegos Capital, the \\~$10B family office of Bill Hwang, who founded and ran Tiger Asia. The bank said the charge will result in a pretax loss of 900M francs for Q1, cut its dividend by two-thirds and suspended share buybacks to protect its balance sheet. It also announced that the head of its investment bank and chief risk officer are both leaving the firm, though its CEO will stay on. In addition, it unloaded another $2.3B worth of stocks tied to Archegos on Monday. While analysts have been fairly quick to dismiss the systemic risks from the Archegos implosion, there have been concerns that the episode could ultimately lead prime brokers to implement more stringent capital requirements and dial back on credit availability, exacerbating thin liquidity conditions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Afternoon headlines:**\n\n* **Economy:**\n   * Businesses struggling to hire enough workers as economic reopening gains momentum ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fast-food-labor/fast-food-struggles-to-hire-as-demand-soars-u-s-economy-roars-idUSKBN2BT1GB), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-06/u-s-jobs-come-roaring-back-surprising-employers-and-economists?sref=L75TRUmI), [WSJ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-06/u-s-jobs-come-roaring-back-surprising-employers-and-economists?sref=J9GPLx1B))\n* **Economic policy/stimulus:**\n   * FL Rep.

        "selftext": " The case for $ETWO:\n\nBefore I go into the long ass DD, I\u2019ll provide a quick TL;DR for all the fellow apes out there, so just scroll to the bottom!\n\nE2Open, or $ETWO, provides cloud-based, on-demand software for supply chains for everything from computers, electronics systems and, well, essentially any company wanting to have an edge on it\u2019s competitors . And let\u2019s be serious, data is the modern day oil. Here is their Investment Thesis:\n\n[https://imgur.com/M95UL86](https://imgur.com/M95UL86)\n\nAnd seeing how my only claim to success is a massive GME yolo back in November, I\u2019ll let someone with better credentials describe this company. Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Merwin initiated coverage on $ETWO and gave it a BUY rating (note: Loop Capital also just recently upgraded it to BUY). He had this to say about it:\n\n\"E2Open is a provider of supply chain management (SCM) solutions to the enterprise. While the SCM space is relatively mature, E2Open has assembled an impressive suite or products - organically and through M&amp;A - which cover all functional areas of supply chain management, and importantly break down data silos to provide deeper insights into and efficiencies for the supply chain. With an improving cross-sell motion providing a $1bn of expansion\n\nopportunity within its customer base today, we see long-term runway for at least low double digit top line growth along with 30%+ EBITDA margins through FY24. With shares trading at 6.1x/18.9x our CY22 revenue and EBITDA forecasts relative to similar growth peers median at 8.9x/22.2x we see an attractive entry point at current levels.\"\n\nAnother notable thing worth mentioning is that the company was founded as a joint project of 8 major companies: Hitachi, IBM, LG Electronics, Matsushita, Nortel, Seagate, Solectron, and Toshiba. In other words, $ETWO had some goliaths backing them from the start.\n\n[u/DragonfruitAccurate3](https://www.reddit.com/u/DragonfruitAccurate3/) had a solid DD on $ETWO not long ago. Instead of trying to put it in my own words, I\u2019ll just use his, as his DD is flawless IMO:\n\n*Why E2Open is likely undervalued*\n\n*Insight Partners, the private equity firm that owns E2Open has a ridiculously strong history of taking midsized SaaS companies like E2Open from valuations of hundreds of millions to multi billion dollar valuations. Other companies in Insight Partner's portfolio include:*\n\n*- Qualtrics (invested at $850mm valuation, sold in 2018 for $8bn and 9.4x+ return)*\n\n*- Shopify (invested in 2013, IPOed at $17/share in 2015 and is now $1,225/share for a likely 100x+ return)*\n\n*- DocuSign (invested in 2017 they IPOed in 2018 at $29/share in 2018 and is now $244.93/share)*\n\n*- Twitter (invested in 2009, it was valued at $100mm in 2008 and now has a $43bn market cap)*\n\n*- Diligent (bought in 2016 for $624mm and currently valued at $4bn for a 6.4x return)*\n\n*- Chegg (invested in 2009, IPOed in 2013 at $12.50/share, currently at $92/share)*\n\n*- Alteryx (invested in 2014, IPOed in 2017 at $14/share, currently at $129/share)*\n\n*- E2Open (bought in 2015 for $273mm, current enterprise valuation is around $2.57bn for a 9.4x return)*\n\n*The top 2 managing directors of Insight Partners: Adam Berger and Deven Parekh both sit on the E2Open board. They're known as active investors heavily involved in the strategic direction and acquisition strategy of E2Open. Deven Parekh was the lead for the early Twitter investment in 2009 that saw a return north of 40,000%. The guy is nothing short of a visionary.*\n\n*The most similar company to E2Open in Insight Partner's portfolio is Diligent. They're both SaaS platforms with long sales cycles, and have almost identical revenue ($340mm for Diligent vs $335mm for E2Open), and a similar product strategy of rapid acquisition and integration. Despite the similarities, Diligent is valued substantially more ($4+bn for Diligent, while only $2.73bn for E2Open), leading one to believe that E2Open is currently undervalued.*\n\n*Further evidence of E2Open's undervaluation is in its enterprise value relative to EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). E2Open's value is only 21.3x EBITDA, which is on par with the average software EBITDA of 20-24x, while its closest peers Descartes is at 29.2x and Kinaxis is at a whopping 59.1x. Significant upside remains in E2Open's future growth.*\n\n*E2Open\u2019s approach to acquiring industry leaders has enabled them to acquire a stable of tech clients such as AMD, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Nvidia, as well as top industrial, consumer and transportation clients such as Honda, GE, Raytheon, Gap, Nike, New Balance, CocaCola, Peloton, Tapestry (Coach), DHL, UPS, and many others. They have over 1,000+ customers and the top 100 clients have yearly subscriptions with E2Open that top $1.5mm+ in revenue each, which is substantial for any SaaS platform.*\n\n*E2Open customers include:*\n\n[*https://imgur.com/RG6rryD*](https://imgur.com/RG6rryD)\n\n*E2Open's strategic acquisitions of the past 7 years (at least 11 companies) allows end-to-end supply chain data visibility, the holy grail for tech and consumer goods companies. This allows them to compete in the big leagues against incumbents such as SAP and Oracle while leaving single use-case disruptors in the dust.*\n\n*E2Open has yet to fully realize its data integration potential involving artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and ESG/sustainability. E2Open has plenty of avenues to pursue multipliers in shareholder value. It wouldn't surprise me that E2Open were to acquire an AI/ML supply chain company in the following quarters to boost shareholder value.*\n\n*If E2Open successfully executes their strategy of fully integrated end-to-end supply chain visibility, it's possible that they'd be acquired by SAP, Oracle, Amazon, Shopify or even Salesforce in the coming years at multiples of their current valuation. The potential value and unique competitive advantage of the data and tech E2Open offers is far too valuable for these companies to ignore.*\n\n*Product stickiness is a key differentiator for E2Open. It boasts of gross retention rates above 95%. The exceedingly low churn rate, a key health indicator of SaaS platforms, is a strong positive indicator of future growth.*\n\n*E2Open is one of the largest software firms focused on the supply chain sector with the following actual and expected revenue and is PROFITABLE:*\n\n*2019A- 205M*\n\n*2020A- 305M*\n\n*2021E- 335M*\n\n*2022E- 367M*\n\n*Current institutional investors PRE-MERGER include Goldman Sachs, Blackstone Group, and many big filing claims coming including this recent submission:* [*https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1581655/000089914021000056/c011321a.htm*](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1581655/000089914021000056/c011321a.htm)\n\nNow for the juicy bit my friends:\n\nThe SHORT SQUEEZE.\n\nThe most perplexing thing I came across while researching $ETWO was the insanely high amount of Short Interest. Here is a shot from finviz on 4/26/2021 (The day I\u2019m writing this):\n\n[https://imgur.com/9A7W7EC](https://imgur.com/9A7W7EC)\n\nThe % of the float short is a whopping 48%! In contrast, $MVIS\u2019s % of float shorted is a little over 19%, $CLOV is at 35% and $GME is around 20%. Stock grid has a good visual representation of $ETWO\u2019s short %:\n\n[https://www.stockgrid.io/shortinterest/etwo](https://www.stockgrid.io/shortinterest/e2)\n\nYou will also notice, on both finviz and stockgrid, the short ratio. For you fellow apes out there who can barely read, The short ratio tells investors approximately how many days it would take short sellers to cover their positions if the price of a given stock were to increase. The higher the short ratio, the longer it will take to buy back those borrowed shares. The Short ratio for $ETWO is a whopping 7 days! In contrast, $GME\u2019s is at 0.23 days, $MVIS is 3.4 days, and $CLOV is 4.2 days. This means it will take a full week (more than that, considering trading weeks are only 5 days) for the shorts to cover their asses. A sharp uptick in price will have them bending over in no time.\n\nAnother key indicator that convinces me that this stock is going to the moon is one of [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) \u2018s favorites: Insider Buying. The following chart shows the latest insider buyer action:\n\n[https://imgur.com/TTs5qqZ](https://imgur.com/TTs5qqZ)\n\nYou can see that insiders are buying the shit out of this stock, and not selling. It\u2019s always a great confirmation bias when the company insiders like the stock.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n$ETWO is an upcoming Supply Chain Software company with 48% of it\u2019s float shorted. It\u2019s fundamentals are sound, it\u2019s potential is huge, and it\u2019s currently heavily undervalued. It\u2019s\n\nbeing backed by Hitachi, IBM, LG Electronics, Matsushita, Nortel, Seagate, Solectron, and Toshiba.\n\nSome of it\u2019s notable customers are: MD, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Nvidia, as well as top industrial, consumer and transportation clients such as Honda, GE, Raytheon, Gap, Nike, New Balance, CocaCola, Peloton, Tapestry (Coach), DHL, UPS, and many others. They have over 1,000+ customers and the top 100 clients have yearly subscriptions with E2Open that top $1.5mm+ in revenue each, which is substantial for any SaaS platform.\n\nThe % of the float shortest is a whopping 48%! It\u2019s short ratio is 7 (It will take shorts 7 days to cover their positions if the stock ticks up).\n\nEven shorter TL;DR:\n\nI like the stock. It\u2019s undervalued. It\u2019s about to go on a short squeeze ride to the moon, and even the big wigs over at JP Morgan are saying this thing is a steal. Oh, and it\u2019s clients are of the likes of FB, Google, Intel, MSFT, NVDA, NKE, etc (Look at the above list for more).\n\n$ETWO Positions:\n\n12/17/21 12.5c,\n\n12/17/21 15c,\n\n12/1721 17.5c",

        "selftext": " \n\nOculus Visiontech (OVTZ) has two major events that happened since last market close on Friday: Raising 3 million USD to further the development of Forget-Me-Yes, and General Availability of Forget-Me-Yes.\n\nForget-Me-Yes is a SAAS service that helps companies deal with privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA. These laws stipulate that persons have the Right to be Forgotten, Right of Erase, and others and can file a request at any time. **Companies then need to erase all data related to that person within a limited time window**, like 30 days. **Non-compliance fines are huge**. The **customer might be a long-time relation that has generated lots of revenue for the business, or it might just be a passing cold called person from a database that has never generated any revenue.

These laws stipulate that persons have the Right to be Forgotten, Right of Erase, and others and can file a request at any time. **Companies then need to erase all data related to that person within a limited time window**, like 30 days. **Non-compliance fines are huge**. The **customer might be a long-time relation that has generated lots of revenue for the business, or it might just be a passing cold called person from a database that has never generated any revenue.

The group brings together well-established and profitable small companies with a buy-and-hold perspective. MBH Corporation benefits from a new approach to building a robust group of companies, pioneering a strategic growth model, called Agglomeration.\n\nThe core principle is that the corporation protects and preserves what made a business profitable, then places the same into a community of like-minded businesses with the sole intention of enhancing the value of each individual group company.\n\nWith Agglomeration, profitable companies convert their private shares into public shares in MBH Corporation plc at an agreed multiple. Locked up for 365 days, company owners are then incentivized to accelerate their growth trajectory using the resources of the plc including expertise, skill transfer of best class practices, cross selling to other group companies and where appropriate, zero cost funding for new growth projects\n\n**How Its Doing:**\n\n* In February MBH acquired GBS Partners, its first in the food manufacturing sector, its second deal of the year and its third purchase in the USA in the past six months. \n* The month before, the group added 3Ks Engineering, which was the first company in a new engineering vertical. \n* The month before, Victoria Gosden Travel (VGT) was acquired as the group\u2019s 12th acquisition \n* MBH now has 25 companies in its portfolio, recently acquiring 4X Taxis into its portfolio \n* Its 2020 Half Year Report, the company reports \u00a327.4M in revenue and EBITDA of \u00a31.5M\n\n**MBH Subsidiary details** \n\n***Engineering:***\n\n*3Ks Engineering* \n\n3Ks Engineering was established in 1969 in South Wales, United Kingdom. 3K Engineering offers a one stop shop for Large Fabrication &amp; Heavy Machining service and is one of the largest companies offering this invaluable dual role to remain in the UK.

The technology allows for parental control through a child\u2019s daily diary.  The software also has a smart solution for  payments via an integrated CRM and billing system that automates the billing process and administrative actions. According to the Parenta group, fee collection from parents represents, on average, an annual loss of GBP 2.99m for nursery schools because they are not allowed to collect money directly via direct debitor. Vocational training completes the offer of the Parenta group. More than 2500 early year students in apprenticeship at levels 2 and 3 are trained annually. These programs are 90% covered by the state.\n\n*Acacia Training Ltd* \n\nThe subsidiary Acacia delivers vocational training under several accreditation frames across England.

The firm is based in Newcastle-under-Lyme (UK) and has a current occupancy rate of 100%. The deal includes the acquisition of a property that was valued at GBP 1.8m.

Our strengths in ecommerce, digital media and technology, combined with our ongoing investment in creative talent, are resonating with clients as their markets recover and they seek to transform their offer for future growth. This week\u2019s launch of our new global data company, Choreograph, adds a further dimension to the WPP proposition as clients look for trusted partners to help them navigate a fast-changing data landscape.\n\n\u201cWe have already secured a number of important assignments in 2021, including Absolut (global creative), JP Morgan Chase (global media), Salesforce (technology operations) and Sam\u2019s Club (US creative). We were also delighted to renew our valued partnership with the US Navy.\n\n\u201cLast week we made an industry-leading commitment to target net zero carbon emissions across our entire supply chain by 2030, putting our $60 billion of media billings behind this initiative. We will work with our clients, media owners and the industry on this collaborative effort.\n\n\u201cThe roll-out of vaccines is improving visibility in many markets, although there is inevitably uncertainty over the pace of recovery. We are making good progress on our transformation programme, which will deliver significant efficiencies to reinvest in growth, and are confident of delivering our growth and profitability guidance for 2021.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.wpp.com/news/2021/04/first-quarter-trading-update",

        "selftext": " The case for $ETWO:\n\nBefore I go into the long ass DD, I\u2019ll provide a quick TL;DR for all the fellow apes out there, so just scroll to the bottom!\n\nE2Open, or $ETWO, provides cloud-based, on-demand software for supply chains for everything from computers, electronics systems and, well, essentially any company wanting to have an edge on it\u2019s competitors . And let\u2019s be serious, data is the modern day oil. Here is their Investment Thesis:\n\n[https://imgur.com/M95UL86](https://imgur.com/M95UL86)\n\nAnd seeing how my only claim to success is a massive GME yolo back in November, I\u2019ll let someone with better credentials describe this company. Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Merwin initiated coverage on $ETWO and gave it a BUY rating (note: Loop Capital also just recently upgraded it to BUY). He had this to say about it:\n\n\"E2Open is a provider of supply chain management (SCM) solutions to the enterprise. While the SCM space is relatively mature, E2Open has assembled an impressive suite or products - organically and through M&amp;A - which cover all functional areas of supply chain management, and importantly break down data silos to provide deeper insights into and efficiencies for the supply chain. With an improving cross-sell motion providing a $1bn of expansion\n\nopportunity within its customer base today, we see long-term runway for at least low double digit top line growth along with 30%+ EBITDA margins through FY24. With shares trading at 6.1x/18.9x our CY22 revenue and EBITDA forecasts relative to similar growth peers median at 8.9x/22.2x we see an attractive entry point at current levels.\"\n\nAnother notable thing worth mentioning is that the company was founded as a joint project of 8 major companies: Hitachi, IBM, LG Electronics, Matsushita, Nortel, Seagate, Solectron, and Toshiba. In other words, $ETWO had some goliaths backing them from the start.\n\n[u/DragonfruitAccurate3](https://www.reddit.com/u/DragonfruitAccurate3/) had a solid DD on $ETWO not long ago. Instead of trying to put it in my own words, I\u2019ll just use his, as his DD is flawless IMO:\n\n*Why E2Open is likely undervalued*\n\n*Insight Partners, the private equity firm that owns E2Open has a ridiculously strong history of taking midsized SaaS companies like E2Open from valuations of hundreds of millions to multi billion dollar valuations. Other companies in Insight Partner's portfolio include:*\n\n*- Qualtrics (invested at $850mm valuation, sold in 2018 for $8bn and 9.4x+ return)*\n\n*- Shopify (invested in 2013, IPOed at $17/share in 2015 and is now $1,225/share for a likely 100x+ return)*\n\n*- DocuSign (invested in 2017 they IPOed in 2018 at $29/share in 2018 and is now $244.93/share)*\n\n*- Twitter (invested in 2009, it was valued at $100mm in 2008 and now has a $43bn market cap)*\n\n*- Diligent (bought in 2016 for $624mm and currently valued at $4bn for a 6.4x return)*\n\n*- Chegg (invested in 2009, IPOed in 2013 at $12.50/share, currently at $92/share)*\n\n*- Alteryx (invested in 2014, IPOed in 2017 at $14/share, currently at $129/share)*\n\n*- E2Open (bought in 2015 for $273mm, current enterprise valuation is around $2.57bn for a 9.4x return)*\n\n*The top 2 managing directors of Insight Partners: Adam Berger and Deven Parekh both sit on the E2Open board. They're known as active investors heavily involved in the strategic direction and acquisition strategy of E2Open. Deven Parekh was the lead for the early Twitter investment in 2009 that saw a return north of 40,000%. The guy is nothing short of a visionary.*\n\n*The most similar company to E2Open in Insight Partner's portfolio is Diligent. They're both SaaS platforms with long sales cycles, and have almost identical revenue ($340mm for Diligent vs $335mm for E2Open), and a similar product strategy of rapid acquisition and integration. Despite the similarities, Diligent is valued substantially more ($4+bn for Diligent, while only $2.73bn for E2Open), leading one to believe that E2Open is currently undervalued.*\n\n*Further evidence of E2Open's undervaluation is in its enterprise value relative to EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). E2Open's value is only 21.3x EBITDA, which is on par with the average software EBITDA of 20-24x, while its closest peers Descartes is at 29.2x and Kinaxis is at a whopping 59.1x. Significant upside remains in E2Open's future growth.*\n\n*E2Open\u2019s approach to acquiring industry leaders has enabled them to acquire a stable of tech clients such as AMD, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Nvidia, as well as top industrial, consumer and transportation clients such as Honda, GE, Raytheon, Gap, Nike, New Balance, CocaCola, Peloton, Tapestry (Coach), DHL, UPS, and many others. They have over 1,000+ customers and the top 100 clients have yearly subscriptions with E2Open that top $1.5mm+ in revenue each, which is substantial for any SaaS platform.*\n\n*E2Open customers include:*\n\n[*https://imgur.com/RG6rryD*](https://imgur.com/RG6rryD)\n\n*E2Open's strategic acquisitions of the past 7 years (at least 11 companies) allows end-to-end supply chain data visibility, the holy grail for tech and consumer goods companies. This allows them to compete in the big leagues against incumbents such as SAP and Oracle while leaving single use-case disruptors in the dust.*\n\n*E2Open has yet to fully realize its data integration potential involving artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and ESG/sustainability. E2Open has plenty of avenues to pursue multipliers in shareholder value. It wouldn't surprise me that E2Open were to acquire an AI/ML supply chain company in the following quarters to boost shareholder value.*\n\n*If E2Open successfully executes their strategy of fully integrated end-to-end supply chain visibility, it's possible that they'd be acquired by SAP, Oracle, Amazon, Shopify or even Salesforce in the coming years at multiples of their current valuation. The potential value and unique competitive advantage of the data and tech E2Open offers is far too valuable for these companies to ignore.*\n\n*Product stickiness is a key differentiator for E2Open. It boasts of gross retention rates above 95%. The exceedingly low churn rate, a key health indicator of SaaS platforms, is a strong positive indicator of future growth.*\n\n*E2Open is one of the largest software firms focused on the supply chain sector with the following actual and expected revenue and is PROFITABLE:*\n\n*2019A- 205M*\n\n*2020A- 305M*\n\n*2021E- 335M*\n\n*2022E- 367M*\n\n*Current institutional investors PRE-MERGER include Goldman Sachs, Blackstone Group, and many big filing claims coming including this recent submission:* [*https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1581655/000089914021000056/c011321a.htm*](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1581655/000089914021000056/c011321a.htm)\n\nNow for the juicy bit my friends:\n\nThe SHORT SQUEEZE.\n\nThe most perplexing thing I came across while researching $ETWO was the insanely high amount of Short Interest. Here is a shot from finviz on 4/26/2021 (The day I\u2019m writing this):\n\n[https://imgur.com/9A7W7EC](https://imgur.com/9A7W7EC)\n\nThe % of the float short is a whopping 48%! In contrast, $MVIS\u2019s % of float shorted is a little over 19%, $CLOV is at 35% and $GME is around 20%. Stock grid has a good visual representation of $ETWO\u2019s short %:\n\n[https://www.stockgrid.io/shortinterest/etwo](https://www.stockgrid.io/shortinterest/e2)\n\nYou will also notice, on both finviz and stockgrid, the short ratio. For you fellow apes out there who can barely read, The short ratio tells investors approximately how many days it would take short sellers to cover their positions if the price of a given stock were to increase. The higher the short ratio, the longer it will take to buy back those borrowed shares. The Short ratio for $ETWO is a whopping 7 days! In contrast, $GME\u2019s is at 0.23 days, $MVIS is 3.4 days, and $CLOV is 4.2 days. This means it will take a full week (more than that, considering trading weeks are only 5 days) for the shorts to cover their asses. A sharp uptick in price will have them bending over in no time.\n\nAnother key indicator that convinces me that this stock is going to the moon is one of [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) \u2018s favorites: Insider Buying. The following chart shows the latest insider buyer action:\n\n[https://imgur.com/TTs5qqZ](https://imgur.com/TTs5qqZ)\n\nYou can see that insiders are buying the shit out of this stock, and not selling. It\u2019s always a great confirmation bias when the company insiders like the stock.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n$ETWO is an upcoming Supply Chain Software company with 48% of it\u2019s float shorted. It\u2019s fundamentals are sound, it\u2019s potential is huge, and it\u2019s currently heavily undervalued. It\u2019s\n\nbeing backed by Hitachi, IBM, LG Electronics, Matsushita, Nortel, Seagate, Solectron, and Toshiba.\n\nSome of it\u2019s notable customers are: MD, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Nvidia, as well as top industrial, consumer and transportation clients such as Honda, GE, Raytheon, Gap, Nike, New Balance, CocaCola, Peloton, Tapestry (Coach), DHL, UPS, and many others. They have over 1,000+ customers and the top 100 clients have yearly subscriptions with E2Open that top $1.5mm+ in revenue each, which is substantial for any SaaS platform.\n\nThe % of the float shortest is a whopping 48%! It\u2019s short ratio is 7 (It will take shorts 7 days to cover their positions if the stock ticks up).\n\nEven shorter TL;DR:\n\nI like the stock. It\u2019s undervalued. It\u2019s about to go on a short squeeze ride to the moon, and even the big wigs over at JP Morgan are saying this thing is a steal. Oh, and it\u2019s clients are of the likes of FB, Google, Intel, MSFT, NVDA, NKE, etc (Look at the above list for more).\n\n$ETWO Positions:\n\n12/17/21 12.5c,\n\n12/17/21 15c,\n\n12/1721 17.5c",

A huge market that they can tap into and a seasoned board is almost a key for success when we are talking about small cap companies.\n\nSome studies, articles and graphs that make me think that telehealth and remote care are going up:\n\nA nice wrap-up from Intel[https://cli.co/L7i6Ylr](https://cli.co/L7i6Ylr)\n\nHealthcare insurer Cigna report[https://www.cigna.com/static/www-cigna-com/docs/about-us/newsroom/innovation/cigna-covid-trends-factsheet-virtual-and-behavioral-health.pdf](https://www.cigna.com/static/www-cigna-com/docs/about-us/newsroom/innovation/cigna-covid-trends-factsheet-virtual-and-behavioral-health.pdf)\n\nMcKinsey study summary by Reuters[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-consumer-idUSKBN2BA0FR](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-consumer-idUSKBN2BA0FR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere\u2019s a ton of other underdeveloped industries that could use the platform, just to guess a few:\n\n* Delivery companies that don\u2019t have money to develop their own service like that;\n* Construction contractors;\n* Home renovation companies;\n* Service companies.\n\nLike with any other SaaS/PaaS solutions once the core application is built it is pretty easy to adjust it towards a new industry, this enables a high scalability potential.\n\n## How This Thing Is Going To Work\n\nHere\u2019s a tl;dr version of patented workflow:[https://patents.google.com/patent/US9756492](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9756492)\n\nOnce you get this Xigem app (iOS, Android or a Web client), you get a dashboard with all the control options. You can literally play it like a good old strategy game:\n\n\u0422 \u0422, \\[02.04.21 00:51\\]\n\n* You can see all your units (aka employees) in their locations in real time;\n* You can see their availability status, work hours, next tasks, list of completed tasks, ratings;\n* You can see all the equipment they have on them as well as their qualifications ;\n* You can see all the incoming customers' calls or requests and send them your closest or the most qualified worker in an instant (or group them for more difficult tasks);\n* The closest available employee engages with a client (of course, they talk via the app server) and gets all the info to finish the task\n\nWhen your field unit is on site - you can control his work with:\n\n1. Timestamp photos;\n2. Customer signature;\n3. Live location updates.\n\n## Why do I think business will use it?\n\nInstead of having call center book appointments with a prospective client multiple days in advance, they would be able to direct a nearby agent to their home, reducing cancellations and no-shows that naturally occur when such appointments are booked.\n\nAs a nice addition, with a sufficient number of salesforce you can market your business with ASAP delivery guarantee claims \u201cWe will do whatever you need in 30 minutes from your call\u201d and actually stand for your word.\n\n## So, why $XIGM and not other stocks - Bullish stuff\n\nA few reasons that - I think - justify all the good perspectives with Xigem:\n\n1. They already have the platform in testing with dates and deadlines - several real catalysts;\n2. They got their first clients who are ready to pay once the platform is adjusted to their specifications- FluBusters[https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-to-develop-remote-technology-platform-for-flubusters-inc/](https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-to-develop-remote-technology-platform-for-flubusters-inc/)\\- and ISI[https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-to-enhance-cloud-based-technology-platform-for-insurance-supermarket-inc/](https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-to-enhance-cloud-based-technology-platform-for-insurance-supermarket-inc/);\n3. They are tapping into huge and growing industries (check the overview above);\n4. Their experienced board of directors looks like they know what they\u2019re doing and it\u2019s not made of 20-yo startup maniacs with ReVoLuTiOnArY ideas (Check Brian Kalish, Connor Bill, Stephen Coates, Scott WIlson, all have more than 20 years of experience, and ability to raise capital, you can check the profiles on website [https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/board-of-directors/](https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/board-of-directors/));\n5. Their platform is flexible and scalable and has a build-in diversification; in case something goes tits up they will be able to change the industry (as it\u2019s stated in the core structure in patents).",

        "selftext": "Hello, \n\nPlease hear me out on the following investment thesis (my first one here on WSB is up 100% over 6months and still has another 3-5x on a *relative valuation basis* (to other SAASs with same growth profiles). ...this next one (Aspen Group, Inc) is a 3-4 bagger to fair value (relative to peers) and 10-20x longer term. As you'll see below, because of Aspen's ($ASPU) 11-to-1 operational leverage, \"long-term\" could be as little as 2 years if it can get some needed publicity and scale faster. If so, 10x is reasonable given the metrics below. And, most importantly, ASPU is efficiently solving a **HUGE  societal** problem.....\n\n....So, first, imagine in a previous life, you built an internet advertising business from the ground up and sold it to Yahoo for hundreds of millions, then you decide to use your marketing expertise to solve the insane cost of higher education (the cause of an epic student loan crisis which can't be solved by just cancelling student loans). That is just what the CEO, Michael Matthews has set out to do and he's succeeding... \n\n....ASPU is backed by billionaire and investing legend, Leon Cooperman. ASPU, **even without the advantage of significant scale**, is able to create the following results:\n\n\\- ASPU is earning **$11 in revenue for every $1 dollar of marketing spend**.\n\n\\- ASPU is earning $11-for-$1 return **even while allowing students to earn back their** **entire** **investment in less than 2 years.**  \n\n\\- ASPU's graduation rate is a full 20% higher than the industry average (80% vs. 60%).\n\n\\- For the first time in decades, ASPU has made higher education affordable...the majority of students graduate debt-free by choosing a low, monthly payment plan. **Debt-less education.** \n\n\\- **Revenue is growing at 30-40%**, the company is **debt-free** &amp; all business units are profitable. Furthermore, the entire market cap is 10x next year\u2019s earnings from a SINGLE location (phoenix) of 1 of its 3 business units (all profitable). ASPU plans on 12 locations by 2025 (that is beside the the 2 other business units mentioned above). \n\n\\- The RSI (relative strength index) is $23.51 but the stock is trading at $5.30. \n\nThat is my investment thesis for Aspen Group Inc., ($ASPU).  It\u2019s **not easy to debt-free small caps run by proven management, backed by big money, earning 1,000% on marketing dollars.** There are few businesses out there that can legitimately \u201cchange the game\u201d \u2013 ASPU is an education technology company that has already proven to change the game even as a small-cap. If there is a company that deserves more growth capital from \u201ccapital allocators\u201d (i.e., investors), this is that company. \n\nThe technical acumen of the management is first-rate \u2013 they\u2019ve **created an algorithmically informed, custom CRM which results in the highest ad-conversion rates in the industry. Those savings, due to advertising and operational efficiencies, are passed on to students.** What this means is that every dollar allocated to this great company results in one less student (like me) who is saddled with $50,000 of student loan debt, all to obtain an overpriced degree that will never pay for itself. \n\nThanks for listening.

In reality, they are just a brokerage dressed up as a tech company. \n\nIf Compass's main evaluation criteria for being considered a tech company is their exclusive content such as, CRM, CMS and other proprietary tech resources for agents, then wouldn't their agents usage of 3rd party tech tools not help their case in being a tech company? \n\nTo me, it would be like the Salesforce Sales team not using Salesforce as their CRM, but more damaging.\n\nData:\n\nSometimes real estate agent websites will have at the bottom banner the tech provider they are using.

        "selftext": " The case for $ETWO:\n\nBefore I go into the long ass DD, I\u2019ll provide a quick TL;DR for all the fellow apes out there, so just scroll to the bottom!\n\nE2Open, or $ETWO, provides cloud-based, on-demand software for supply chains for everything from computers, electronics systems and, well, essentially any company wanting to have an edge on it\u2019s competitors . And let\u2019s be serious, data is the modern day oil. Here is their Investment Thesis:\n\n[https://imgur.com/M95UL86](https://imgur.com/M95UL86)\n\nAnd seeing how my only claim to success is a massive GME yolo back in November, I\u2019ll let someone with better credentials describe this company. Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Merwin initiated coverage on $ETWO and gave it a BUY rating (note: Loop Capital also just recently upgraded it to BUY). He had this to say about it:\n\n\"E2Open is a provider of supply chain management (SCM) solutions to the enterprise. While the SCM space is relatively mature, E2Open has assembled an impressive suite or products - organically and through M&amp;A - which cover all functional areas of supply chain management, and importantly break down data silos to provide deeper insights into and efficiencies for the supply chain. With an improving cross-sell motion providing a $1bn of expansion\n\nopportunity within its customer base today, we see long-term runway for at least low double digit top line growth along with 30%+ EBITDA margins through FY24. With shares trading at 6.1x/18.9x our CY22 revenue and EBITDA forecasts relative to similar growth peers median at 8.9x/22.2x we see an attractive entry point at current levels.\"\n\nAnother notable thing worth mentioning is that the company was founded as a joint project of 8 major companies: Hitachi, IBM, LG Electronics, Matsushita, Nortel, Seagate, Solectron, and Toshiba. In other words, $ETWO had some goliaths backing them from the start.\n\n[u/DragonfruitAccurate3](https://www.reddit.com/u/DragonfruitAccurate3/) had a solid DD on $ETWO not long ago. Instead of trying to put it in my own words, I\u2019ll just use his, as his DD is flawless IMO:\n\n*Why E2Open is likely undervalued*\n\n*Insight Partners, the private equity firm that owns E2Open has a ridiculously strong history of taking midsized SaaS companies like E2Open from valuations of hundreds of millions to multi billion dollar valuations. Other companies in Insight Partner's portfolio include:*\n\n*- Qualtrics (invested at $850mm valuation, sold in 2018 for $8bn and 9.4x+ return)*\n\n*- Shopify (invested in 2013, IPOed at $17/share in 2015 and is now $1,225/share for a likely 100x+ return)*\n\n*- DocuSign (invested in 2017 they IPOed in 2018 at $29/share in 2018 and is now $244.93/share)*\n\n*- Twitter (invested in 2009, it was valued at $100mm in 2008 and now has a $43bn market cap)*\n\n*- Diligent (bought in 2016 for $624mm and currently valued at $4bn for a 6.4x return)*\n\n*- Chegg (invested in 2009, IPOed in 2013 at $12.50/share, currently at $92/share)*\n\n*- Alteryx (invested in 2014, IPOed in 2017 at $14/share, currently at $129/share)*\n\n*- E2Open (bought in 2015 for $273mm, current enterprise valuation is around $2.57bn for a 9.4x return)*\n\n*The top 2 managing directors of Insight Partners: Adam Berger and Deven Parekh both sit on the E2Open board. They're known as active investors heavily involved in the strategic direction and acquisition strategy of E2Open. Deven Parekh was the lead for the early Twitter investment in 2009 that saw a return north of 40,000%. The guy is nothing short of a visionary.*\n\n*The most similar company to E2Open in Insight Partner's portfolio is Diligent. They're both SaaS platforms with long sales cycles, and have almost identical revenue ($340mm for Diligent vs $335mm for E2Open), and a similar product strategy of rapid acquisition and integration. Despite the similarities, Diligent is valued substantially more ($4+bn for Diligent, while only $2.73bn for E2Open), leading one to believe that E2Open is currently undervalued.*\n\n*Further evidence of E2Open's undervaluation is in its enterprise value relative to EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). E2Open's value is only 21.3x EBITDA, which is on par with the average software EBITDA of 20-24x, while its closest peers Descartes is at 29.2x and Kinaxis is at a whopping 59.1x. Significant upside remains in E2Open's future growth.*\n\n*E2Open\u2019s approach to acquiring industry leaders has enabled them to acquire a stable of tech clients such as AMD, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Nvidia, as well as top industrial, consumer and transportation clients such as Honda, GE, Raytheon, Gap, Nike, New Balance, CocaCola, Peloton, Tapestry (Coach), DHL, UPS, and many others. They have over 1,000+ customers and the top 100 clients have yearly subscriptions with E2Open that top $1.5mm+ in revenue each, which is substantial for any SaaS platform.*\n\n*E2Open customers include:*\n\n[*https://imgur.com/RG6rryD*](https://imgur.com/RG6rryD)\n\n*E2Open's strategic acquisitions of the past 7 years (at least 11 companies) allows end-to-end supply chain data visibility, the holy grail for tech and consumer goods companies. This allows them to compete in the big leagues against incumbents such as SAP and Oracle while leaving single use-case disruptors in the dust.*\n\n*E2Open has yet to fully realize its data integration potential involving artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and ESG/sustainability. E2Open has plenty of avenues to pursue multipliers in shareholder value. It wouldn't surprise me that E2Open were to acquire an AI/ML supply chain company in the following quarters to boost shareholder value.*\n\n*If E2Open successfully executes their strategy of fully integrated end-to-end supply chain visibility, it's possible that they'd be acquired by SAP, Oracle, Amazon, Shopify or even Salesforce in the coming years at multiples of their current valuation. The potential value and unique competitive advantage of the data and tech E2Open offers is far too valuable for these companies to ignore.*\n\n*Product stickiness is a key differentiator for E2Open. It boasts of gross retention rates above 95%. The exceedingly low churn rate, a key health indicator of SaaS platforms, is a strong positive indicator of future growth.*\n\n*E2Open is one of the largest software firms focused on the supply chain sector with the following actual and expected revenue and is PROFITABLE:*\n\n*2019A- 205M*\n\n*2020A- 305M*\n\n*2021E- 335M*\n\n*2022E- 367M*\n\n*Current institutional investors PRE-MERGER include Goldman Sachs, Blackstone Group, and many big filing claims coming including this recent submission:* [*https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1581655/000089914021000056/c011321a.htm*](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1581655/000089914021000056/c011321a.htm)\n\nNow for the juicy bit my friends:\n\nThe SHORT SQUEEZE.\n\nThe most perplexing thing I came across while researching $ETWO was the insanely high amount of Short Interest. Here is a shot from finviz on 4/26/2021 (The day I\u2019m writing this):\n\n[https://imgur.com/9A7W7EC](https://imgur.com/9A7W7EC)\n\nThe % of the float short is a whopping 48%! In contrast, $MVIS\u2019s % of float shorted is a little over 19%, $CLOV is at 35% and $GME is around 20%. Stock grid has a good visual representation of $ETWO\u2019s short %:\n\n[https://www.stockgrid.io/shortinterest/etwo](https://www.stockgrid.io/shortinterest/e2)\n\nYou will also notice, on both finviz and stockgrid, the short ratio. For you fellow apes out there who can barely read, The short ratio tells investors approximately how many days it would take short sellers to cover their positions if the price of a given stock were to increase. The higher the short ratio, the longer it will take to buy back those borrowed shares. The Short ratio for $ETWO is a whopping 7 days! In contrast, $GME\u2019s is at 0.23 days, $MVIS is 3.4 days, and $CLOV is 4.2 days. This means it will take a full week (more than that, considering trading weeks are only 5 days) for the shorts to cover their asses. A sharp uptick in price will have them bending over in no time.\n\nAnother key indicator that convinces me that this stock is going to the moon is one of [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) \u2018s favorites: Insider Buying. The following chart shows the latest insider buyer action:\n\n[https://imgur.com/TTs5qqZ](https://imgur.com/TTs5qqZ)\n\nYou can see that insiders are buying the shit out of this stock, and not selling. It\u2019s always a great confirmation bias when the company insiders like the stock.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n$ETWO is an upcoming Supply Chain Software company with 48% of it\u2019s float shorted. It\u2019s fundamentals are sound, it\u2019s potential is huge, and it\u2019s currently heavily undervalued. It\u2019s\n\nbeing backed by Hitachi, IBM, LG Electronics, Matsushita, Nortel, Seagate, Solectron, and Toshiba.\n\nSome of it\u2019s notable customers are: MD, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Nvidia, as well as top industrial, consumer and transportation clients such as Honda, GE, Raytheon, Gap, Nike, New Balance, CocaCola, Peloton, Tapestry (Coach), DHL, UPS, and many others. They have over 1,000+ customers and the top 100 clients have yearly subscriptions with E2Open that top $1.5mm+ in revenue each, which is substantial for any SaaS platform.\n\nThe % of the float shortest is a whopping 48%!

        "selftext": "\\*Disclaimer\\* **Not** financial advice/encouragement - this is research on an airline which stands to make big $$ in the reopening of the country/world. - the $ and other figures are from Fidelity's website.\n\nJetBlue - JBLU ($6.7B MC) is the airline you want to bet on during the recovery. I jumped in at $14.50 months ago and sold like a dope when it wasn't moving for a few weeks.  Now shares are at $21 because God hates me.  Anyways, reasons to consider JBLU are:\n\n\\*Somewhat small outstanding share count: **316M** (compare to LUV at 590M or AAL at 639M)\\* See price movement quicker here than other airlines with hundreds of millions of shares more.\n\n\\*Price point is good compared to others: **$21** (compared to UAL $60, LUV at $63.50 even AAL at $24)\n\n\\*JetBlue is different because it focuses on not only important high traffic markets, it is one of the few airlines here in the states that can get you to the **Caribbean or Puerto Rico** almost any time on nearly any day - this makes for good play for those who travel to and from these islands for family reunions, holidays, funerals/births, etc.\\* (these trips obviously are higher $$value too! more revenue)\n\n\\*Institutional ownership of JBLU **(79%)** is higher now than AAL, UAL, DAL **(49%, 62%, 62%)** \\- this means big money makers trust their money with JBLU over the bigger airlines!\\* ownership #s are diff from marketwatch but you can still see JBLU is higher than everyone else  [JBLU Institutional Owners and 13F Filers (JetBlue Airways) (marketbeat.com)](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/JBLU/institutional-ownership/) \n\n\\*I also feel with regards to where big firms are putting their money, they will likely remove $$ from tech stocks and push it into travel (airlines / hotels / cruises) because tech has boomed and they are probably ready to cut their profits en masse. (Paypal, Salesforce, ZenDesk, Zoom, etc. are all super pricey right now, could benefit from a cool-off)\\*\n\n\\*JBLU does not use the Boeing aircrafts that are getting negative press in the news constantly, they use AirBus planes\\*\n\n\\*Oh and did I mention...today Morgan Stanley (ever heard of them?) increased their price target on JBLU to **$30**! This means they see about 30% upside from now and price targets for banks/airlines/hotels have all been increasing the last few weeks\\*\n\n*\\*also...not that this has much to do with anything - but I work for one of America's most recognizable credit card companies and see thousands of accts a week and what is being charged to them. Right now, cruises and airlines are getting booked at rates we haven't seen in over a year!!\\**",

        "selftext": "Alright lads, this gem of a company is what you would get if $PLTR and $GME had a baby (they may have..).\n\nBefore I go into the long ass DD, I\u2019ll provide a quick TL;DR for all the fellow apes out there, so just scroll to the bottom! \n\nThe case for $ETWO:\n\nE2Open, or $ETWO, provides cloud-based, on-demand software for supply chains for everything from computers, electronics systems and, well, essentially any company wanting to have an edge on it\u2019s competitors . And let\u2019s be serious, data is the modern day oil. Here is their Investment Thesis:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/M95UL86\n\nAnd seeing how my only claim to success is a massive GME yolo back in November, I\u2019ll let someone with better credentials describe this company. Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Merwin initiated coverage on $ETWO and gave it a BUY rating (note: Loop Capital also just recently upgraded it to BUY). He had this to say about it: \n\n\"E2Open is a provider of supply chain management (SCM) solutions to the enterprise. While the SCM space is relatively mature, E2Open has assembled an impressive suite or products - organically and through M&amp;A - which cover all functional areas of supply chain management, and importantly break down data silos to provide deeper insights into and efficiencies for the supply chain. With an improving cross-sell motion providing a $1bn of expansion\n\nopportunity within its customer base today, we see long-term runway for at least low double digit top line growth along with 30%+ EBITDA margins through FY24. With shares trading at 6.1x/18.9x our CY22 revenue and EBITDA forecasts relative to similar growth peers median at 8.9x/22.2x we see an attractive entry point at current levels.\"\n\nAnother notable thing worth mentioning is that the company was founded as a joint project of 8 major companies: Hitachi, IBM, LG Electronics, Matsushita, Nortel, Seagate, Solectron, and Toshiba. In other words, $ETWO had some goliaths backing them from the start.\n\nu/DragonfruitAccurate3 had a solid DD on $ETWO not long ago. Instead of trying to put it in my own words, I\u2019ll just use his, as his DD is flawless IMO:\n\n*Why E2Open is likely undervalued*\n\n*Insight Partners, the private equity firm that owns E2Open has a ridiculously strong history of taking midsized SaaS companies like E2Open from valuations of hundreds of millions to multi billion dollar valuations. Other companies in Insight Partner's portfolio include:*\n\n*- Qualtrics (invested at $850mm valuation, sold in 2018 for $8bn and 9.4x+ return)*\n\n*- Shopify (invested in 2013, IPOed at $17/share in 2015 and is now $1,225/share for a likely 100x+ return)*\n\n*- DocuSign (invested in 2017 they IPOed in 2018 at $29/share in 2018 and is now $244.93/share)*\n\n*- Twitter (invested in 2009, it was valued at $100mm in 2008 and now has a $43bn market cap)*\n\n*- Diligent (bought in 2016 for $624mm and currently valued at $4bn for a 6.4x return)*\n\n*- Chegg (invested in 2009, IPOed in 2013 at $12.50/share, currently at $92/share)*\n\n*- Alteryx (invested in 2014, IPOed in 2017 at $14/share, currently at $129/share)*\n\n*- E2Open (bought in 2015 for $273mm, current enterprise valuation is around $2.57bn for a 9.4x return)*\n\n*The top 2 managing directors of Insight Partners: Adam Berger and Deven Parekh both sit on the E2Open board. They're known as active investors heavily involved in the strategic direction and acquisition strategy of E2Open. Deven Parekh was the lead for the early Twitter investment in 2009 that saw a return north of 40,000%. The guy is nothing short of a visionary.*\n\n*The most similar company to E2Open in Insight Partner's portfolio is Diligent. They're both SaaS platforms with long sales cycles, and have almost identical revenue ($340mm for Diligent vs $335mm for E2Open), and a similar product strategy of rapid acquisition and integration. Despite the similarities, Diligent is valued substantially more ($4+bn for Diligent, while only $2.73bn for E2Open), leading one to believe that E2Open is currently undervalued.*\n\n*Further evidence of E2Open's undervaluation is in its enterprise value relative to EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). E2Open's value is only 21.3x EBITDA, which is on par with the average software EBITDA of 20-24x, while its closest peers Descartes is at 29.2x and Kinaxis is at a whopping 59.1x. Significant upside remains in E2Open's future growth.*\n\n*E2Open\u2019s approach to acquiring industry leaders has enabled them to acquire a stable of tech clients such as AMD, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Nvidia, as well as top industrial, consumer and transportation clients such as Honda, GE, Raytheon, Gap, Nike, New Balance, CocaCola, Peloton, Tapestry (Coach), DHL, UPS, and many others. They have over 1,000+ customers and the top 100 clients have yearly subscriptions with E2Open that top $1.5mm+ in revenue each, which is substantial for any SaaS platform.*\n\n*E2Open customers include:*\n\n[*https://imgur.com/RG6rryD*](https://imgur.com/RG6rryD)\n\n*E2Open's strategic acquisitions of the past 7 years (at least 11 companies) allows end-to-end supply chain data visibility, the holy grail for tech and consumer goods companies. This allows them to compete in the big leagues against incumbents such as SAP and Oracle while leaving single use-case disruptors in the dust.*\n\n*E2Open has yet to fully realize its data integration potential involving artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and ESG/sustainability. E2Open has plenty of avenues to pursue multipliers in shareholder value. It wouldn't surprise me that E2Open were to acquire an AI/ML supply chain company in the following quarters to boost shareholder value.*\n\n*If E2Open successfully executes their strategy of fully integrated end-to-end supply chain visibility, it's possible that they'd be acquired by SAP, Oracle, Amazon, Shopify or even Salesforce in the coming years at multiples of their current valuation. The potential value and unique competitive advantage of the data and tech E2Open offers is far too valuable for these companies to ignore.*\n\n*Product stickiness is a key differentiator for E2Open. It boasts of gross retention rates above 95%. The exceedingly low churn rate, a key health indicator of SaaS platforms, is a strong positive indicator of future growth.*\n\n*E2Open is one of the largest software firms focused on the supply chain sector with the following actual and expected revenue and is PROFITABLE:*\n\n*2019A- 205M*\n\n*2020A- 305M*\n\n*2021E- 335M*\n\n*2022E- 367M*\n\n*Current institutional investors PRE-MERGER include Goldman Sachs, Blackstone Group, and many big filing claims coming including this recent submission: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1581655/000089914021000056/c011321a.htm*\n\nNow for the juicy bit my friends:\n\nThe SHORT SQUEEZE.\n\nThe most perplexing thing I came across while researching $ETWO was the insanely high amount of Short Interest. Here is a shot from finviz on 4/26/2021 (The day I\u2019m writing this):\n\n[https://imgur.com/9A7W7EC](https://imgur.com/9A7W7EC)\n\nThe % of the float short is a whopping 48%! In contrast, $MVIS\u2019s % of float shorted is a little over 19%, $CLOV is at 35% and $GME is around 20%. Stock grid has a good visual representation of $ETWO\u2019s short %: [https://www.stockgrid.io/shortinterest/](https://www.stockgrid.io/shortinterest/e2)etwo\n\nYou will also notice, on both finviz and stockgrid, the short ratio. For you fellow apes out there who can barely read, The short ratio tells investors approximately how many days it would take short sellers to cover their positions if the price of a given stock were to increase. The higher the short ratio, the longer it will take to buy back those borrowed shares. The Short ratio for $ETWO is a whopping 7 days! In contrast, $GME\u2019s is at 0.23 days, $MVIS is 3.4 days, and $CLOV is 4.2 days. This means it will take a full week (more than that, considering trading weeks are only 5 days) for the shorts to cover their asses. A sharp uptick in price will have them bending over in no time. \n\nAnother key indicator that convinces me that this stock is going to the moon is one of u/DeepFuckingValue \u2018s favorites: Insider Buying. The following chart shows the latest insider buyer action: \n\n[https://imgur.com/TTs5qqZ](https://imgur.com/TTs5qqZ)\n\nYou can see that insiders are buying the shit out of this stock, and not selling. It\u2019s always a great confirmation bias when the company insiders like the stock. \n\nTL;DR:\n\n$ETWO is an upcoming Supply Chain Software company with 48% of it\u2019s float shorted. It\u2019s fundamentals are sound, it\u2019s potential is huge, and it\u2019s currently heavily undervalued. It\u2019s \n\nbeing backed by Hitachi, IBM, LG Electronics, Matsushita, Nortel, Seagate, Solectron, and Toshiba. \n\nSome of it\u2019s notable customers are: MD, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Nvidia, as well as top industrial, consumer and transportation clients such as Honda, GE, Raytheon, Gap, Nike, New Balance, CocaCola, Peloton, Tapestry (Coach), DHL, UPS, and many others. They have over 1,000+ customers and the top 100 clients have yearly subscriptions with E2Open that top $1.5mm+ in revenue each, which is substantial for any SaaS platform. \n\nThe % of the float shortest is a whopping 48%!  It\u2019s short ratio is 7 (It will take shorts 7 days to cover their positions if the stock ticks up).\n\nEven shorter TL;DR:\n\nI like the stock. It\u2019s undervalued. It\u2019s about to go on a short squeeze ride to the moon, and even the big wigs over at JP Morgan are saying this thing is a steal. Oh, and it\u2019s clients are of the likes of FB, Google, Intel, MSFT, NVDA, NKE, etc (Look at the above list for more). \n\n$ETWO Positions: \n\n12/17/21 12.5c, \n\n12/17/21 15c, \n\n12/1721 17.5c",

        "selftext": "**Preamble:** One of the main questions that I had and I see recurring on this sub is how to identify and invest in emerging stocks before it becomes mainstream news. I did not have the time to actively track social media and decided to build a program that does it for me.\n\n**How it works:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).\n\nHere is the stock picked by the program and my DD\n\n**Stock:**   **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ($TSM)**\n\nWeek on Week increase in mentions: **130%**\n\nMonth on Month increase in mentions: **324%**\n\nAverage sentiment across mentions: **+29.5%**\n\n**DD**\n\n**Core Product**\n\nTSMC was founded in 1987 by Morris Chang, who previously had worked in Texas Instruments. TSMC can be considered as possibly the most important company in the world that few people have heard of. This is because it is practically a chokepoint of the $470 Billion semiconductor industry and is instrumental in supplying chips to almost all the major players. Currently, the company supplies to Apple for their A14 chips and ARM-based chips for their Mac products, Qualcomm, MediaTek, AMD, Intel, and Nvidia.\n\nThe company is the world\u2019s largest semiconductor foundry. They are in the pure-play foundry business. This means that they do not produce any processors for their own products but they manufacture and sell chips to companies such as AMD, Intel, and Apple. The main reason for which companies such as Apple and AMD source chips from TSMC is that they do not have to build their own expensive silicon fabrication plants (the CapEx of the plans run into 10s of billions of dollars and it takes an extremely long time to set up) to manufacture their chips. TSMC is currently the world\u2019s 11th largest company by market capitalization ($554 B).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TSMC absolutely dominates the advanced chip market ](https://preview.redd.it/qx1btw29krq61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61ce94bf883480c99f5e74a43bdea79bbf9d4d9f)\n\nAs you can see from the above chart, TSMC absolutely dominates the advanced chip market (&lt;10nm, think phone processors) which also has the highest margins. The company effectively controls more than half (54% to be exact) of the world\u2019s made-to-order chip market.\n\n**Financials**\n\nTSMC posted its best-ever quarter in Q4\u201920 with revenues jumping 22% to a record $12.68 Billion and profits increasing 23% to $5.1 Billion. They are also expected to invest heavily this year with capital expenditure for production and development of advanced chips to be between $25-$28 Billion. (60% higher than the amount TSMC spend in 2020)\n\nThey also have a very strong financial position with $23 Billion in cash vs a long-term liability of only $10 billion (YE 2020). The company has also predicted a record first-quarter revenue between $12.7 Billion and $13 Billion, which is almost a 30% growth from the same period last year. We do have to note that their share price has jumped more than 140% over the past 12 months giving it the current valuation of $554 Billion.\n\n**Potential and Hype Factors**\n\n**Technology moat:** Compared to peers, TSMC is easily the leader in chip production technology. The company has delivered over 1 Billion 7nm chips by 2020 whereas Intel is still trying to master its 7nm development process. For those who are unaware of chip manufacturing, in general, the smaller the node size (measured in nanometer (nm)), the better the performance and power management. This is why the companies making the top-end chips want the smallest node size available.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w6mw9ehakrq61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a70944796b31b7b971e743f497854c29d9b797d1\n\nTSMC is currently in the process of producing 5nm chips (20% of their total wafer revenue) and is already ramping up for 3nm production by the end of 2022. It takes a long time to spin up a new silicon fabrication factory (3-4 years is the average time it takes for a factory to go from planning to production).\n\nThis leadership in technology would be one of the key drivers for growth in the coming years. The $28 Billion Capex spending also reflects on the management\u2019s confidence about the long-term demand for the advanced chips.\n\n**Strong long-term demand:** Even though the current shortage faced by automakers is mainly due to a supply chain issue, cars, in general, are getting more and more complicated and EV\u2019s tend to need better hardware and chips. This will force the automakers to rush to lock in future supply. Even though the margins produced from the auto-chips are not as high as the phones/laptops, the producers of the chips are definitely going to benefit in the long run.\n\n**Risk and Competition**\n\nThere are multiple risks associated with TSMC. First and foremost, at the current valuation, the stock is definitely not cheap. The current PE ratio is 33 which puts them in the same bucket as Apple and AMD. While this might be representative of their future growth potential, it is on the higher side for a manufacturing company.\n\nThe company might face a short-term crisis in production as Taiwan is currently facing its most severe water shortage in 56 years. Taiwan\u2019s chipmakers have begun stocking up on truckloads of water to prepare for shortages. During a similar drought in 2015, Taiwan was forced to implement water restrictions for industrial companies. This can cause a significant impact on the top and bottom line as TSMC is currently producing at 100% capacity. A weakening USD can also have a significant impact on TSMC\u2019s EPS as \\~99% of their sales are in US dollars whereas only 15% of its COGS is in US dollars.\n\nA long-term risk for TSMC is that their increasingly dominant position in chip manufacturing is starting to attract political attention. The current shock from the auto chip shortage is forcing governments to bring vital supply chains back into their countries in order to make them less vulnerable to disruption. In the US, lawmakers are citing the chip shortage as proof that the country needs to revive more semiconductor manufacturing at home. This has forced TSMC to build a $12 billion plant in Arizona. This political climate can be beneficial for Intel, given their current foray into fabrication. (I do not think Intel can effectively compete with TSMC in fabrication without significant help in trade restrictions. As we can see from the process roadmap, Intel is currently years behind TSMC in the manufacturing process and they could not make their products work even when they had the best process technology years back)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTSMC is currently one of the world\u2019s largest companies and they are definitely not resting on their laurels. They have been continuously working on building more capacity and advancing their nodes. Even though there are some short-term and long-term risks in terms of their exposure to the US dollar, rising geopolitical tensions, etc., I believe TSMC\u2019s current technological moat, a monopoly level market share in advanced chips, and the rising use of smartphones and IoT devices put TSMC in a very strong position over the long term!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. I currently do not own any stock of TSM. Please do your own extensive research before investing in any stock*",

This can cause a significant impact on the top and bottom line as TSMC is currently producing at 100% capacity. A weakening USD can also have a significant impact on TSMC\u2019s EPS as \\~99% of their sales are in US dollars whereas only 15% of its COGS is in US dollars.\n\nA long-term risk for TSMC is that their increasingly dominant position in chip manufacturing is starting to attract political attention. The current shock from the auto chip shortage is forcing governments to bring vital supply chains back into their countries in order to make them less vulnerable to disruption. In the US, lawmakers are citing the chip shortage as proof that the country needs to revive more semiconductor manufacturing at home. This has forced TSMC to build a $12 billion plant in Arizona. This political climate can be beneficial for Intel, given their current foray into fabrication. (I do not think Intel can effectively compete with TSMC in fabrication without significant help in trade restrictions. As we can see from the process roadmap, Intel is currently years behind TSMC in the manufacturing process and they could not make their products work even when they had the best process technology years back)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTSMC is currently one of the world\u2019s largest companies and they are definitely not resting on their laurels. They have been continuously working on building more capacity and advancing their nodes. Even though there are some short-term and long-term risks in terms of their exposure to the US dollar, rising geopolitical tensions, etc., I believe TSMC\u2019s current technological moat, a monopoly level market share in advanced chips, and the rising use of smartphones and IoT devices put TSMC in a very strong position over the long term!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. I currently do not own any stock of TSM. Please do your own extensive research before investing in any stock*",

As a few stocks had been getting suspended in trading in both buying/selling quite frequently prior to RH restrictions. \n\nNow that a couple months have passed looking back.

President Joe Biden just recently began a 100-day assessment of the risks to supply chains, noting that the US\u2019\u2019 need for secure, diverse, dependable goods in notable sectors such as pharmaceuticals, semis, EV batteries, and rare earth minerals. This is where E2Open ($ETWO) comes into play.\n\n**COMPANY SUMMARY**\n\n*\u201cLeaders win through logistics. Vision, sure. Strategy, yes. But when you go to war, you need to have both toilet paper and bullets at the right place at the right time. In other words, you must win through superior logistics.\u201d  \\~ Tom Peters*\n\nEssentially an unknown up-and-coming company that provides cloud-based, on-demand supply chain software that offers customers a significant value proposition. ETWO helps customers reduce inventory costs (10-20%), reduce direct materials procurement operating costs (50%), improve inventory forecasts (15-50%), and reduce supply chain staff (15%).\n\nETWO has only recently went public on February 21\u2019, yet this relatively new company has already acquired and secured clients such as Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Facebook, AMD, Nike, and many more (See Image Below for a better overall picture of its customer base). Another notable point is it\u2019s founders. According to Wikipedia, *the company was founded as a joint project of 8 major companies: Hitachi, IBM, LG Electronics, Matsushita, Nortel, Seagate, Solectron, and Toshiba.* This is no small matter, as these are massive companies that have large teams of experts making these decisions. The company is also trading very cheap in comparison to it\u2019s fundamentals and it\u2019s peers (Scroll down for a slightly deeper dive).\n\n* *A Snapshot of its largest customer base:*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uwe5biyquuw61.png?width=679&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd2bc97da035fdd0cc0d84e11686aa40166f5c91\n\n* *A Snapshot Of Their Investment Thesis:*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m1v3wk1uuuw61.png?width=1212&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3530ce3826ed67513c7797afd4bb1a3a0d54e56a\n\n**Key Qualities Of ETWO, and Competitive Advantages It Has Over Its Competitors:**\n\n* Multi-enterprise network combining data with best-in-class intelligent applications\n* integrated cloud platform delivering meaning ROI across supply chain\n* First mover advantages from data connectors and harmonization\n* Long term relationships with blue-chip, large enterprise customer base\n* Attractive industry tailwinds and large TAM with significant white space\n* Category-defining End-to-End provider of mission-critical software\n* Strong network effects enhanced by flexible and integrated data model\n\n**Key issues for current supply chains and how $ETWO is solving them:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tm9r4jdyuuw61.png?width=632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd452f13403ddf6f1c43151b9fca9415d9aa1826\n\n*A Visual Of $ETWO 's business model:*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pts7oo10vuw61.png?width=1885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b50c7097f059b98ffb48f2e8134628860fccf700\n\n**VALUATION**\n\nThe stock itself offers value to shareholders due to it\u2019s very cheap valuation compared to its peers, as well as it\u2019s massive potential for growth. At its current valuation, $ETWO is trading at an estimated EV/Rev multiple of 7 compared to an average of 11.7 among it\u2019s peers. It also boasts an EV/EBITDA of 21.3 compared to 29.2 and 59.1 from it\u2019s two closest competitors, Descartes and Kinaxis. \n\nOne of the most important value factors for SaaS platforms is in the recurring cash flow. In $ETWO's case, this comes from it's subscription sales, which provides some much valued predictability in these uncertain times . This is another strength that $ETWO possesses, as the company boasts an extremely low churn rate - which is a an indicator of a massive moat, which can allow $ETWO to retain profits from its competitors. This only further demonstrates that the company is due for strong future growth. Below are some visuals which exemplify the value of ETWO:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Strong Performance on Key Metrics:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wirah1d2vuw61.png?width=1838&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75ae35151c09a121def921cb6bd42c03c947c563\n\n* Attractive Long Term Financial Profile:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9intlpp3vuw61.png?width=1869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba50479fab89957024b271cc1223ddb2e25d83a1\n\n* Growth and Profitability:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52quo145vuw61.png?width=1854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93bbeb7ace2f303d45c68a5cf90bd616cff90c8\n\n**What Wallstreet is Saying**\n\n*\u201cIt takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it.  If you think about that, you\u2019ll do things differently.\u201d  \\~ Warren Buffett,*\n\nAlthough it is a relatively new and low profile company (for now), it seems Wall Street is already taking notice. Loop Capital just recently rated it a BUY. Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Merwin also initiated coverage on $ETWO, and gave it a BUY rating as well. His words on the company:\n\n*\"E2Open is a provider of supply chain management solutions to the enterprise. While the Supply Chain Management space is relatively mature, E2Open has assembled an impressive suite or products - organically and through M&amp;A - which cover all functional areas of supply chain management, and importantly break down data silos to provide deeper insights into and efficiencies for the supply chain. With an improving cross-sell motion providing a $1bn expansion opportunity within its customer base today, we see long-term runway for at least low double digit top line growth along with 30%+ EBITDA margins through FY24. With shares trading at 6.1x/18.9x our CY22 revenue and EBITDA forecasts relative to similar growth peers median at 8.9x/22.2x we see an attractive entry point at current levels.\"*\n\n**One Final and Intriguing Note:**\n\nA few popular, and reputable websites that display a company's short interest, state that $ETWO has a whopping percentage of it\u2019s float shorted (48% on finviz, at the time of this post).\n\nShort Interest:\n\n[https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;f=sh\\_opt\\_option,sh\\_short\\_high&amp;o=shortinterestshare&amp;t=ETWO](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;f=sh_opt_option,sh_short_high&amp;o=shortinterestshare&amp;t=ETWO)\n\nI am not sure what to think about this, as I also see that the put/call ratio for ETWO is a miniscule 0.02 on Barchart. Maybe someone can comment on this and maybe shed some light.\n\nPut/Call Ratio:\n\n[https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/ETWO/put-call-ratios](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/ETWO/put-call-ratios)\n\nAnyone interested in some further reading on the company, should check out this solid write up on $ETWO, as it makes some great points that I missed in mine:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/trakstocks/comments/kzmar3/pcpl\\_cc\\_neuberger\\_principal\\_holdings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/trakstocks/comments/kzmar3/pcpl_cc_neuberger_principal_holdings/)\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nThe cheaply valued ETWO and it\u2019s value proposition, it\u2019s allstar customer base (Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Facebook, etc), as well as it\u2019s unique competitive advantage through their award winning software, offers its clients as well as its shareholders and potential shareholders, a bargain that is hard to resist. The growth potential is massive, the fundamentals are strong, and I believe we are looking at, in ETWO, the future of the supply chain management industry.\n\n*Disclosure: This is by no means financial advice. I just like the stock. I also must disclose that I have both shares and December call options for $ETWO. I am an individual investor, with no association whatsoever with the company.*",

Loop Capital just recently rated it a BUY. Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Merwin also initiated coverage on $ETWO, and gave it a BUY rating as well. His words on the company:\n\n*\"E2Open is a provider of supply chain management solutions to the enterprise. While the Supply Chain Management space is relatively mature, E2Open has assembled an impressive suite or products - organically and through M&amp;A - which cover all functional areas of supply chain management, and importantly break down data silos to provide deeper insights into and efficiencies for the supply chain. With an improving cross-sell motion providing a $1bn expansion opportunity within its customer base today, we see long-term runway for at least low double digit top line growth along with 30%+ EBITDA margins through FY24. With shares trading at 6.1x/18.9x our CY22 revenue and EBITDA forecasts relative to similar growth peers median at 8.9x/22.2x we see an attractive entry point at current levels.\"*\n\n**One Final and Intriguing Note:**\n\nA few popular, and reputable websites that display a company's short interest, state that $ETWO has a whopping percentage of it\u2019s float shorted (48% on finviz, at the time of this post).\n\nShort Interest:\n\n[https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;f=sh\\_opt\\_option,sh\\_short\\_high&amp;o=shortinterestshare&amp;t=ETWO](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;f=sh_opt_option,sh_short_high&amp;o=shortinterestshare&amp;t=ETWO)\n\nI am not sure what to think about this, as I also see that the put/call ratio for ETWO is a miniscule 0.02 on Barchart. Maybe someone can comment on this and maybe shed some light.\n\nPut/Call Ratio:\n\n[https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/ETWO/put-call-ratios](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/ETWO/put-call-ratios)\n\nAnyone interested in some further reading on the company, should check out this solid write up on $ETWO, as it makes some great points that I missed in mine:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/trakstocks/comments/kzmar3/pcpl\\_cc\\_neuberger\\_principal\\_holdings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/trakstocks/comments/kzmar3/pcpl_cc_neuberger_principal_holdings/)\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nThe cheaply valued ETWO and it\u2019s value proposition, it\u2019s allstar customer base (Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Facebook, etc), as well as it\u2019s unique competitive advantage through their award winning software, offers its clients as well as its shareholders and potential shareholders, a bargain that is hard to resist. The growth potential is massive, the fundamentals are strong, and I believe we are looking at, in ETWO, the future of the supply chain management industry.\n\n*Disclosure: This is by no means financial advice. I just like the stock. I also must disclose that I have both shares and December call options for $ETWO. I am an individual investor, with no association whatsoever with the company.*",
