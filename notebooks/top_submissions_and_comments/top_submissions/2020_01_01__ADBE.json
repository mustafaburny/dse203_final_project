        "selftext": "Alright, I've been analyzing this stock for a bit of time now. The earnings call is tomorrow and I'm considering a call option. I'm probably not going to, but I definitely have a couple of shares already in the game. Here are the relevant stats I've gathered:\n\n2019 Fourth Quarter...\n\n[Cyber Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/03/cyber-monday-online-sales-hit-record-9point4-billion-adobe-says.html) (Black Friday) -- $9.4B spent, up 19.7% from previous year\n\nDecember 26th [report](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/12/26/online-sales-hit-record-jumping-18-holiday-season-report-says/2748182001/) \\-- 18.8% increase in online holiday shopping from previous year\n\nStatistical [Analysis](https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec_current.pdf) of online shopping trends heavily imply that amazon will earn more 2019-Q4 than 2019-Q2, or -Q3.\n\nThus, I reason that Amazon is undervalued and will spike tomorrow after the expectations for their earnings call will be shattered. Is my analysis valid?",

        "selftext": "27th January 2020\n\nUS equity futures are falling ahead of the cash open given the continued coronavirus contagion which saw the global cases reach 2700 and the deaths toll topped 80 over the weekend. Travel focussed stocks, such as **United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwestern Airlines (LUV)** are trading in the red, with some holding losses of over 4% on travel disruption concerns, as is **Trip.com (TCOM)**. Casino names like **Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Melco (MLCO)** are facing even further pressure as the confirmed cases in Macau increased to five. Copper miner **Freeport McMoran (FCX)** is lower as copper prices fall to 8-week lows on global growth concerns, while **gold miners (GOLD, NEM)** are benefitting as the precious metal rises in a safe haven bid. China listed ADR\u2019s **(BABA, JD, BIDU)** also hit as the death toll increases.\n\n\nThis week\u2019s Barron\u2019s articles highlight that the Super Bowl will be a huge opportunity for sports betting names, as it focuses on expansion in mobile sports betting, highlighting that the street has been enthusiastic in the rising stock price in **Diamond Eagle Acquisition (DEAC).** Further on the Super Bowl, Barron\u2019s says that advertisers like **Omnicom (OMC) and Interpublic Group (IPG)** hold less appeal, amid a further inflow of larger tech names partaking in the advertising space. Elsewhere the journalists highlight that largest tech companies such as **Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL)** are competing for a larger share in esports. Finally, Barron\u2019s notes investors in **HP (HPQ)** are likely to benefit as it has made it clear it would prefer to lever up and buy back large amounts of shares, instead of submitting an offer to **Xerox (XRX).**\n\n\n#DOW\n\n\n**Apple Inc. (AAPL)**  Ahead of its earnings on Tuesday, Credit Suisse analyst Matthew Cabral is looking for continued improvements in iPhone revenue trends due to a strong start for the iPhone 11.

Elsewhere, RBC Capital analyst Muller maintains an outperform rating on the tech giant with a USD 330 PT (last closing price 318.31). The analyst states his data checks suggest its estimates for Q1 are reasonable, whilst highlighting a slight beat on consensus figures could be seen due to strength in iPhone and wearable sales.\n\n**Boeing Company (BA)** A Boeing jet reportedly crashed in Ghazni, Afghanistan, which was operated by Ariana Afghan. The number of casualties is currently unclear, however, separate reports state the airline denied the crash. Elsewhere, Boeing successfully staged its first flight of its 777X jet.\n\n**Exxon Mobil Corp.

I recently got into index investing so this is my split:\nVCN.TO - 25%\nXUU.TO - 10%\nXAW.TO - 45%\nZAG.TO - 20%\n\nLike I mentioned, I recently got into index investing and was previously investing strictly in stocks with my TSFA. Last year was quite bullish and I have made good gains on my stocks. However, now that I am shifting to index investing, would you recommend I sell all my stocks to stick with one method even if I anticipate upcoming gains?

        "selftext": "\nThis is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares.

        "selftext": "This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.
