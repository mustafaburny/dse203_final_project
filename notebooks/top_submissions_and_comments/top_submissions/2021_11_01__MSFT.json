        "selftext": "I hold no position of INTC long or short just a person who used to reverse engineer this stuff, and then worked in a datacenter for many years.  \n\nThere has been a noticeable amount of INTC posts but non of these delve into their technical shortfalls compared to their competitors AMD NVDA TSM ARM etc\n\nI wrote this many years ago https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/\n\nand the gap in technology is even bigger in AMD's favor.  Since 2016 I've been super bullish on AMD at $1.80, cloud computing stocks MSFT AMZN, energy stocks like TSLA etc. \n\nIf you've ever been in a datacenter it consumes a ton of energy and why I think the future of computing is AMD NVDA TSM ARM MSFT AMZN  and energy efficiency stocks.  \n\nINTC lacks this and is falling way behind in tech and design, still far behind and I literally called it years ago almost on the dot.   \n\nOther users have noticed this too\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qkihov/intc_cluster_buy_by_510_directors_and_ceo/hiwxuit/\n\nMy post pointing out that since 2016 AMD NVDA TSM have been superior in design efficiency and stock price was promptly deleted on that sub.  I reminded them that since 2016 AMD price has increased close to 6800%, NVDA 3400%, TSM 500%, cloud computing has taken off and MSFT is up 600% AMZN 500%.\n\nIntel is gone up maybe 30% in the biggest stock run and semiconductor/cloud computing run.\n\nSo be weary of INTC suggestions.  Not saying you can't make money it is up 30% in 5-6 years but there are way better investments and the opportunity costs of missing out better tech like AMD NVDA TSM MSFT AMZN etc.",

Facebook has, and frequently is in, a shaky PR right now. But their balance sheets are amazing; they have lot\u2019s of cash flow and all of the necessary parts (VR, User base, and software) to make the Metaverse the next big thing. Many big tech companies and people, such as NVDA and even Elon Musk, believe that the Metaverse is the future of social media. Not to mention that FB is very low right now and has proven to be reliable during its worst times.\n\nAny advise on how you would compare Google and Microsoft?

        "selftext": "LEAPs -\n\nI\u2019ve been looking at Ford\u2019s quiet EV development. TSLA may be getting a lot of hype at the moment, but the one company I think will have a huge splash in the American EV race is Ford.\n\nI'm thinking along the lines of a Mac vs PC, iOS vs Android situation, two giants going toe toe for the American dollar like Apple and Microsoft.\n\nWe can already see this happening with Ford's introduction with the F150 Lightning. The lightning was unveiled with a practical presentation of its features, suggesting consumers just care about having a practical vehicle in their garage based on market interest research.\n\nTesla, on the other hand, has a Silicon Valley luxury brand/service feeling to it (like Apple) making their products seem a little less practical, but sophisticated. Pretty much, Ford is using a hammer, Tesla is using its hands to develop its car.\n\nIt's also worth noting that, while it's cool that Tesla got chosen to provide a fleet to Herz, Ford has a lot more sway in logistics and delivery. They have a huge stake of interest in small businesses, a presence in big companies like FedEx, USPS, DHL, etc. (Also has the huge interest in the labor working civilian market)\n\nI'm only using TSLA as a comparison because it's a huge company with lots of influence in vehicle production standards and culturally. I like Teslas the most for 'regular' transportation.\n\nWith that DD out of the way, 2024 seems like a reasonable point to reach steady development and releases of Ford vehicles. This is a hunch, but shouldn't we be expecting the supply chain and labor issues to be solved? Regardless of the president, I think Ford is the prized child of the US, so they will probably never fold without assistance from the Federal Government.\n\nI know it's a gamble, but it seems like a pretty safe one. After market close, 30c Jan 2024 cost $1.44 each. I have some profits I may roll over into those and go for a wild ride.\n\nWhat do you think?",

It makes more sense in the context of Etsy and Target. They're the same fucking brand \n\nTarget would end up acquiring a company with 500 million monthly active users around the world, where the demographics are 70-80% women. From a global perspective, that's a long-term growth potential when it comes to purchasing power of women.\n\nThis is also disregarding Pinterest business analytics and deep partnership with Target in the first place, nor is it considering their ability to ship multichannel features on applications like Etsy, TikTok or Shopify.\n\n\nHave you ever seen women use social media?  It's amazing. I rest my case.  Honorable mentions are Google (search), Amazon (shop), or Apple (to stick it to FB even more)",
