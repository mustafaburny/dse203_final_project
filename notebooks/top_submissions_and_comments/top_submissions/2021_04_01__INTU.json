        "selftext": "Recently I took a small position in Hammerson PLC. Not a long term play but that should be a good rebound play as lockdowns ease up. However, the company has got some debt problems. Many investors are viewing Hammerson as the next Intu. However, reports of flocking to stores / massive increase in footfall has me bullish on the stock and that its current property valuations may undergo an impairment reversal in the near future. \n\nLike other investors, I'm concerned about the debt and how management is going to handle it. \n\nWhat factors do you look out for when determining whether or not a company is going to go bankrupt?\n\nHere is my list;\n\n* Is it generating enough operating cash flow to service debt repayments?\n* What is the interest cover on the company \n* How liquid is the balance sheet? \n* What type of assets does the company own?\n* Is there any massive insider selling? \n* Is the company breaching covenants / re-negotiating?\n* Is the debt callable? \n* Is the debt publically or privately held? \n* Are board members leaving during this challenge?",

        "selftext": "Mastercard Inc said on Monday it had agreed to buy digital identity verification company Ekata in a deal valued at $850 million, as the global payments processor bets on a boom in demand for companies in the digital security space.\n\nEkata's products allow businesses to separate fraudsters from legitimate customers during digital interactions like opening an online account or making digital payments. It operates in three industries: e-commerce, payments and financial services, according to its website.\n\n\"The acceleration of online transactions has thrust global digital identity verification to the forefront as one of the biggest opportunities to build digital trust and combat global fraud,\" said Rob Eleveld, chief executive officer of Ekata, in a statement.\n\nSeattle-headquartered Ekata counts more than 2,000 companies as its partners, including credit reporting company Equifax Inc and software firm Intuit Inc, its website showed.\n\nIts products, which include Ekata Identity Graph and Ekata Identity Network, allow companies to combat online fraud, it said.\n\nIn February, Ekata said its revenue had surged in 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of e-commerce, boosting demand for services to safeguard against cyber fraud.\n\nEkata added 300 new customers last year, including food and grocery-delivery startup Postmates, which was acquired by Uber Technologies last year. (https://bwnews.pr/32qaUG7)\n\nThe payments processor said the deal is expected to close in the next six months, adding that it does not expect the deal to be a drag on its business for more than two years.\n\n[Source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-buy-digital-id-verification-134157685.html)",
