        "selftext": "Calls on $RST (Rosetta Stone) for ER today AMC. Scroll to bottom for TLDR.\n\nThe value of RST isn't its consumer language business, it's Lexia, their EdTech company (which I'll get to later).  Language has been a dying business for them and the equity isn't priced for growth in that sector. That being said, consumer language is still extremely high margin; look at google search trends on rosetta stone with focus on Q1 activity:\n\n [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=rosetta%20stone&amp;geo=US](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=rosetta%20stone&amp;geo=US) \n\nAnd look at \"learn language online\" to show the interest in response to COVID:\n\n [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=learn%20language%20online](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=learn%20language%20online)  \n\nIn their PQ earnings calls they said \"In Q1, Consumer Language is off to strong start\". This was before COVID. See remarks in investor letter below (read whole thing). \n\n [https://investors.rosettastone.com/static-files/04718fc3-8017-4cc6-91df-91f1f720b19c](https://investors.rosettastone.com/static-files/04718fc3-8017-4cc6-91df-91f1f720b19c)  \n\nAgain, the equity is not about consumer language, the value in RST is in EdTech.\n\nRST owns Lexia, which is an EdTech company focused on K-12 literacy. It is doing really, really well even before COVID and is an award-winning SaaS business that doesn't have much competition. Quick link on Lexia accolade:\n\n [https://pr.rosettastone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-report-lexia-core5-reading-finds-percentage-k-3-students](https://pr.rosettastone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-report-lexia-core5-reading-finds-percentage-k-3-students) \n\nLook at what just happened with CHGG. Look at GSX (Chinese SaaS EdTech) reported this morning; although it may be corrupt Chinese fraud, they reported 307% QoQ growth in users. The CEO is a former Goldman Banker, it's a well run company, no doubt RST has been taking advantage of this situation.\n\nSee investor letter above - RST has focused on handing out licenses to schools. This is sticky business. RST usually has an extremely quiet calendar Q1 as the school sales cycle is end of summer / early fall. So expectations are low. I expect they will crush earnings and show tons of new users across all their platforms/applications. \n\nHere are really good VIC articles about the business and valuation:\n\n [https://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/ROSETTA\\_STONE\\_INC/1602994739](https://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/ROSETTA_STONE_INC/1602994739) \n\n [https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/ROSETTA\\_STONE\\_INC/1193337407](https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/ROSETTA_STONE_INC/1193337407) \n\nTLDR: \n\n$RST calls. Language business will benefit from COVID. EdTech market will also benefit and is key growth engine going forward. Stock is cheap. Use limit orders on options, vol is low.\n\nRST 20c 6/19\n\nRST 22.5c 9/18\n\nRST 30c 12/18",

        "selftext": "Today Vegas will most likely announce reopening for **June 4th**. It's not official yet but pretty much everyone knows that's the date. $**MGM** was one of the hardest hit of the Vegas stocks, $**WYNN** and $**LVS** are good plays too but I prefer MGM. If there is anyone who is likely to take a risk on Corona is gonna be the gamblers and Johns. People forget Johns are a huge portion of Vegas business. Corona is nothing compared to HIV or Hepatitis B that Johns risk every day. What about reduced casino capacity? they will take out low limit tables, which will force the cheap players to up their game and lose money faster on medium level tables. There is plenty of slutmachines, they are never close to 50% utilized. So no issues there. The only problem is corporate events that are cancelled, but you are playing the news so that doesn't matter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBombardier recreational division ($**DOOO**) will be reporting this week. They had an amazing quarter and sold a lot of ATVs, sea-doos and Can-Am bikes to people with stimulus cheques. They also benefited from stronger USD since the make a lot of their stuff in Canada. They had a poor 2019 because of short winter selling few ski-doos, so expectations are low. Also people who are not going on family vacations due to social distancing are buying a lot of Sea-doos. **Earnings call June 28th BMO.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDocuSign (**$DOCU**) and Zoom ($**ZM**) are reporting next week. Both are Corona stocks. I expect both will report spectacular earnings but not sure how the market will react since Pandemic is cancelled. [https://preview.redd.it/sh02gkdo32151.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2100c6d2236e1c22ce1083af5fa18c1edf19cc4b](https://preview.redd.it/sh02gkdo32151.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2100c6d2236e1c22ce1083af5fa18c1edf19cc4b) I closed my DOCU positions but keeping ZM up until day before earnings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **Aritzia** ($**ATZ.TO)** is essentially Lululemon for people who are too cool for Lulu. They had an amazing online sales due to pandemic. They are also benefiting from stronger US dollar since they are based in Canada just like LULU. This is a Becky stock and they report **June 28th AMC.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sea World (**$**SEAS)**  gets most of its revenue year round compared to the other theme parks. It's very seasonal but less so than SIX or Disney parks. It's EXACTLY half the price of February highs. It has no competition when it comes to #dolphinEntertainment. Since #PandemicIsCancelled, the **upside is 1X**. Never bet against dolphins and killer whales.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$**SPCE** Thursday morning all headlines are going to read '*America enters a new space age*'. Wednesday will be the first human launch from USA since 2011.  [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/26/spacex-demo-2-nasa-astronaut-launch-everything-you-need-to-know.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/26/spacex-demo-2-nasa-astronaut-launch-everything-you-need-to-know.html) . Now SPCE has nothing to do with SpaceX but that's not gonna stop $SPCE from going to moon.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not your financial advisor.

        "selftext": "Good Afternoon Retards and Faggots alike.\n\nThis is my second earnings play (1st was JD.com, which went well, but first is always free.)\n\nEVRI Reports earnings June 2nd AMC (After Market Close), with an expected EPS of (.03) and Revenue 140.08M.\n\nEveri develops, sells, and leases games and gaming machines, gaming systems and services\n\nEveri Holdings reports its results of operations within two operating segments: Games and FinTech.\n\nEveri Games provides gaming operators with gaming technology products and services, including: (a) gaming machines, primarily comprising Class II and Class III slot machines, including TournEvent\u00ae machines, placed under participation or fixed-fee lease arrangements or sold to casino customers; (b) TournEvent\u00ae system software, licenses, and ancillary equipment;(c) providing and maintaining the central determinant systems for the video lottery terminals (\u201cVLTs\u201d) installed in the State of New York and similar technology in certain tribal jurisdictions; (d) business-to-consumer (\u201cB2C\u201d) and business-to-business (\u201cB2B\u201d) interactive gaming activities; and (e) managing our TournEvent of Champions\u00ae national slot tournament.\n\nEveri FinTech provides gaming operators with financial technology products and services, including: (a) services and equipment that facilitate casino patron\u2019s self-service access to cash at gaming facilities via Automated Teller Machine (\u201cATM\u201d) cash withdrawals, credit card cash access transactions and point-of-sale (\u201cPOS\u201d) debit card purchase and cash access transactions; (b) check warranty services; (c) self-service player loyalty enrollment and marketing equipment, including tools and promotion management software; (d) software and services that improve credit decision making, automate cashier operations, and enhance patron marketing activities for gaming establishments; (e) equipment that provides cash access and other cash handling efficiency-related services; and (f) compliance, audit, and data solutions.\n\nEssentially, Games handles the actual machines, while their FinTech deals mostly with cash related transactions. \n\"ATM cash withdrawal transactions represent the largest category of electronic payment transactions that we process, as measured by dollars processed and transaction volume.\"\n\nNow some numbers: \n\n2018 vs 2017 Revenue:\n469M vs 410M (Growth of 14%)\n\n2018 vs 2017 Expenses:\n383M vs 328M (Increase of 20%)\n\n2019 vs 2018 Revenue \n533M vs 469M (Growth of 14%)\n\n2019 vs 2018 Expenses\n439M vs 383M (Increase of 14%)\n\nSo Revenue has gone up by 14% each of the last 2 years, while expenses has dropped from 20% to 14% - Good sign.\n\nTheir Net Cash Available has actually doubled from 81M to 160M from 2018 to 2019. \n\nAs we all know, Casinos have been closed with COVID, however you are starting to see them opening up in Oklahoma (one of their largest operating grounds), and Vegas, while not confirmed, have started seeing Casinos take reservations for arrival end of May and Beginning of June. \n\nThis boasts well for their earnings call on June 2nd. We also know numbers don't mean everything in this market. The outlook is the most important. While I cant foreshadow how their earnings will look, their outlook going forward should be good. Gambling addicts dont quit gambling. We will see people running to Casinos again, and this is good news for Evri with their equipment and ATM transaction fees.\n\nThe stock has already climbed to $5.57 as of writing this, a 33% increase in the last week, but this could easily climb back to pre covid levels of above $10 by EOY. \n\nOptions are really cheap too, with a 6/19 7.5C sitting at $.33 at market close today. IV is high at 139%, so beware there, but this can still climb.\n\nTL;DR:\nEVRI has a good chance to climb post earnings given the outlook they can submit with casinos reopening. Earnings could look bad, but outlook &gt; numbers right now\n\nPositions: 100 Shares at 4.30 Cost Basis \n6/19 7.5C\n\nEdit: Not related, but I will be researching CHWY as well in the coming days and posting that as they report earnings the following week (I am bullish on them)",

There are **tons** of different gap trading strategies, some of which allow you to profit from them going up from buying and selling and others that allow you to profit from them going down from short-selling and covering.\n\n**Example 1**: Some stocks will gap up and continue running throughout the day\u2026 known as a \u201cgap and go.\u201d These make great buy opportunities. Not all gap ups will gap and go, but you can use both fundamental and technical analysis to find ones with the highest probability of doing so.\n\n**Example 2**: Other gap ups will come straight back down at the open. These are usually stocks with poor fundamentals and a history or dilution/offerings. If you have an account with a broker that allows short-selling, these often make great short opportunities that allow you to profit from them coming back down after they gap up.\n\n**Example 3**: A lot gap downs will become very oversold and end up bouncing back up a bit after the market opens. Depending on the news and the individual company, gap downs can offer a great opportunity to get shares at a discount before a bounce.\n\nAt the end of the day, I hope this just shows that I am **not** posting these to show what has been missed out on, but to hopefully give some good day trade opportunities.

But other studios including **Disney** (NYSE:DIS) chose to hold back the release of some films until theaters are open again.\n\nOf course, none of those sent to VOD had the remarkable success of Universal's *Trolls*, but it caused the studio to think it would be a good idea that even after the theaters open again, sending more movies directly to pay-per-view would be a good idea. AMC Entertainment had other ideas.\n\nAdam Aron, the theater chain's CEO, told Universal chairman Donna Langley, \"AMC believes that with this proposed action to go to the home and theaters simultaneously, Universal is breaking the business model and dealings between our two companies.\" AMC said it will never run another Universal movie in its theaters again.\n\nThe ace...\n\nStudios can't make nearly as much money going the home route as they can going into theaters first and then hitting the rental market afterward.\u00a0And if they anger theater owners by bypassing them, they could find themselves shut out and with much lower total receipts.\n\nThat's why AMC has the backing of Cineworld, which also said it \"will not be showing movies that fail to respect the windows\" of theatrical release before going to VOD.\u00a0\n\n**\\[Source: The Motley Fool, found via Beeken io\\]**\n\n**My thoughts**\n\nThis pandemic has changed how people are consuming media, given the time horizon before things go back to \"normal\" if ever, I can see some consumer habits/expectations shifting.

        "selftext": "Hey, I bought an AMC put for about $70 a week or two ago when the rumors about Amazon buying them out were swirling around. When it came out that it was actually AMCX they were talking about, I put the put option thinking it would go down when people realized. But it's been trading relatively flat since then, if anything, it's been trending up. \n\nNot sure if I should wait a few more days to see if it dips or just get out now. It's only worth $23 today down 63.49%. I only bought one contract so if it goes to zero I really don't care all that much but $23 is still $23 that I could take out now and put somewhere else if it inevitably goes to zero. Any thoughts on my position? Thanks. I'm very new to options trading.",

        "selftext": "Hello, rookie options trader here with a few months under my belt. Right now my main positions are spreads with few DTE bull plays and 30-45 DTE bear plays.\n\nThe spread in question was a SPY 22.05 295/294 (10 contracts) bull put I opened on 20.05 when SPY was 296.XX, I figured hey the fed is still printing trillions I might make some petty cash in the meantime. Come Friday and the ETF is giving me the sweats, dipping as low as 293 in the few hours after open. I don't get assigned and continue to rally to 295.1 AMC. My account shows that my liquidity has increased by the credit amount of \\~300$, however I get a \"bulletin announcement\" in the trading platform that I will be force liquidated because I have sold ITM puts even though the max loss on the spread was something in the vicinity of 600$ which I'm more than capable of handling. \n\nMy pondering in this situation is as following: Since the spread was -0.1 OTM on the short leg why would anyone want to sell their shares at a loss. I know that options are settled DTE+1, but after close SPY is at 295.44 so even further away from the strike. Or is this a case if futures tank on monday the long contract holder can choose to exercise before open and shaft me? Why am I getting liquidated when I have enough free capital to cover the cost of exercising my long leg even if the short one goes ITM?\n\nTo clarify, as of this point in time nothing has been liquidated and my money is where I want it to be, but I want to take preemptive action so my currently profitable positions do not get closed out automatically if IB has a tendency to do so.\n\nAs I said I'm a novice and if any of the assumptions stated above are wrong, please correct me.",
