        "selftext": "Listen up retards. You ever want to play earnings for TSM, AMD, MU, Intel but can't choose which? What if I told you that you can play all of them, at the same damn time.\n\nVanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) is an index of the 25 largest semiconductor manufactures in the world. TSM, Intel, AMD, Texas Instruments, MU...you name it.\n\nThese two weeks are the time of the year when every company in the industry has their Q4 earnings. 10 out of the 25 companies in the index have earnings the next 2 weeks, accounting for 52% of the entire weighted average of the index.\n\nTSM, Intel, AMD, ASML, TXN, LRCX, XLNX, KLAC, STM and some others.\n\nThe semiconductor industry has been on fire, Q4 earnings are generally pumped up, the China deal on Wednesday will give a boost to the whole industry, and when paired with these earnings catalysts I see a bump coming through end of month. 1/31 calls look awfully tasty and are not expensive.",
