        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 8, 2020**\n\nStocks rose again today, extending yesterday\u2019s frankly unexpected gains, with the major benchmarks opening at their highest levels in about a month. Market participants digested a new round of jobless claims, dimming hopes of stimulus, even for stand-alone bills, and progress in Covid-19 therapeutics following Pres. Trump\u2019s discharge from the hospital.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.54% up. The S&amp;P (SPY) led the day, up 0.85% and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.48% up. \n\nToday, the Labor Department released their weekly jobless claims report. There were 840,000 additional first-time jobless claims this week, slightly above the 820,000 prediction of analysts. While 840,000 is the lowest level since March, jobless claims have stagnated the past month, a sign of slowing economic recovery. Continuing claims, which are the number of people who have already filed an initial claim and who have experienced a week of unemployment and then filed a continued claim to claim benefits for that week of unemployment, fell below 11 million, dropping almost 1 million compared to the week before. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said, \u201cThe decline in continuing claims is welcome, but initial claims offer a better read on the real-time state of the labor market, and the downward trend has stalled, more or less.\u201d\n\nAccording to CNBC, there are still 25.5 million workers claiming some form of unemployment benefits, according to totals through Sept. 19. More than half that total, or about 13.4 million, comes from those collecting under pandemic-related programs set up for those who normally wouldn\u2019t be eligible, showing the toll the pandemic has put on the labor market. \n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi further curbed expectations that any form of stimulus will be unleashed before the November election. Today, in response to a bill designed to provide relief to the airline industry, Pelosi said, \u201cThere is no stand-alone bill without a bigger bill.\u201d In other words, she opposes passing smaller, stand-alone stimulus bills in the absence of more comprehensive measures. Yesterday, after calling for his representatives to stop negotiations for overarching stimulus, Pres. Trump signaled he would support a smaller, targeted bill. In response to Trump\u2019s recent tweets about stimulus, Ed Mills, policy analyst at Raymond James said, \u201cIt\u2019s been the question of the day, as to why we got the tweets we got over the last 24 hours, the market reaction we got into \\[Tuesday\u2019s\\] close, and then the rally.\u201d Needless to say, the current market is hyper-responsive to the comments of Trump and other top officials.\n\nShares of Regeneron (REGN) jumped after the drugmaker said it had submitted a request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization of its Covid-19 antibody treatment, which had been taken by President Donald Trump after his Covid-19 diagnosis. In a video on Twitter today, Pres. Trump openly endorsed the move saying \u201cI took this medicine \\[during his stay at Walter Reed Hospital\\] and it was incredible.\u201d\n\nIn other nice news, the World Trade Organization (WTO) announced that South Korea\u2019s trade minister and the former Nigerian finance minister are the two finalists in the race to become the next director-general.
