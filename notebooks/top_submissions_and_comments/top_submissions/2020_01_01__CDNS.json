        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNew to investing about a week ago and am trying to look at trends in directors buying selling and the subsequent changes in market price to get an idea of triggers to allow me to  do some short term investing.\n\nLooking at Finviz insider trading I came across  a director and a company VP both selling shares at $73 and creating an option at the same time for a higher number of shares at $12 and $17 dollars respectively.\n\nI can't see dates on the options but it looks like they are expecting the stock to dive from my inexperienced eyes? am I right?\n\nIs this a stock to avoid because of the director sentiment or am I missing something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Finviz link here](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CDNS&amp;b=2)\n\nThanks for any help",

        "selftext": "You have to be literally autistic not to go all-in on these guys. Main supplier of AMD/AAPL/NVDA. Pretty much the main supplier for everyone aside from INTC or some shit, and who gives a shit about those clowns who can't even break 10nm. It's rumored they'll be manufacturing with TSMC too.\n\n5nm/3nm? Only 2 boys going hard on this, globalfoundries and TSMC. What the fuck is even a goldenfoundry, imagine actually paying Singaporean wages when you can pay Taiwanese wages.  Also Samsung apparently has some foundry or some shit but who cares about those gooks. \n\nEDA big boys - CDNS and SNPS - pretty much decide the market and no one even knows about them. They pretty much engineer the entire back end flow of IC manufacturing. What is their #1 foundry partnership? You guessed it. They don't even use technology libs from other foundries. If their customers go with alternative foundries they will spend millions resolving quality issues related to incompatibility between tools.\n\nWhen market goes into 5nm/3nm, 2-3 years from now, I bet these niggas at TSMC will completely dominate the market. Oh and coronavirus doesn't affect it, Taiwan is a literal island, but people will be scared of it because it's China, so I'm betting FEB/MAR will be the best months to buy, then it's moon only.",

        "selftext": "\nThis is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.
