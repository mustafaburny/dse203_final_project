        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 15th, 2021.\n\n# **Inflation remains the hot topic in week ahead as Walmart and other key retailers report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/12/inflation-remains-the-hot-topic-in-week-ahead-as-walmart-and-other-key-retailers-report.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Consumers are in the spotlight in the week ahead, with the imminent release of retail sales for October and earnings from major chain stores.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales is the big economic report for the week, when the Census Bureau releases October data on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said he\u2019s also looking at the New York Federal Reserve\u2019s Empire state manufacturing survey Monday for updates on prices paid. The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, a measure of growth in that region, is released Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat\u2019s going to be key, outside of that it\u2019s retail sales,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think the inflation story will continue to dominate the headlines and the news flow in markets and what the Fed does.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the outcome of the virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday evening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s good that they would be on a talking basis,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything would come out of it unless there\u2019s some shocking change in the tariff situation, but I doubt anything will happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Chain store earnings\n&gt; The earnings season is winding down, but the big-box stores have yet to report. Walmart and Home Depot release results Tuesday, and Target reports Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWalmart is a pretty big barometer for the health of the consumer for sure, and it will be interesting to see how they handle margins,\u201d National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. Rising costs have been pressuring companies across industries, and many have raised prices in response.\n*****\n&gt; Based on the latest sentiment data Friday, consumers are getting worried about rising prices. The University of Michigan\u2019 consumer sentiment index dropped to a 10-year low of 66.8 in the preliminary November report, from 71.7 in October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s so important to look at what consumers do, versus what they say,\u201d Hogan said. He said retail sales are expected to be up 1.1%, compared to a 0.7% gain in September.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe trend that we\u2019re looking for in the next week is sequential improvement in economic data,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThat\u2019s the important thing to focus on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Other data in the coming week includes industrial production Tuesday. Housing starts and building permits data will be released Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; Inflation also proved to be a problem in the stock market this past week, after both producer prices and consumer prices increased more than expected. The consumer price index jumped 6.2%, a three-decade high.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks snapped a five-week winning streak, and all major indices were lower in the past week. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.3% for the week, at 4,682. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 saw the biggest declines, falling 0.7% and 1% respectively.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner to combat inflation.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.57% on Friday afternoon, and the 2-year yield traded at 0.52%. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The best performing major S&amp;P equities sector was materials, an inflation play that gained more than 2.5%. The worst performer was the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers: It declined nearly 3.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said even with inflation fears, he expects stocks to continue to rise.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we continue to grind higher. We did the larger reset that we needed, which was six weeks - in September and two weeks of October,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good news is demand hasn\u2019t been destroyed. It\u2019s been delayed.\u201d Hogan said supply chain issues should get sorted out. He noted that some components of CPI, like higher used car prices, show that the inflation should be temporary.\n*****\n&gt; Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said he expects the market to continue its march higher. \u201cWhat would make me call for a correction in the market would be two things \u2014 hubris and debt,\u201d he said. Neither of those are currently a problem, since he does not see signs of \u201cmanagement gone awry\u201d and many companies restructured their debt.\n*****\n&gt; Managements are not engaging in arrogant behavior that would be more common at a market top, like excessive spending, he said.\n*****\n&gt; Parker said he expects mid-single digit earnings growth. \u201cI think we could be pretty constructive for the next couple of quarters,\u201d he said.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/8rAJUHO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dhxVRcM.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/oHCQ5zT.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/NocMP7O.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/rHLkf6i.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SRRbBhh.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/68bpNyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lF2TUFo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YuhpIuh.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/45es3q2.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nhff0sq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1xc0qaI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7FUnt2B.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best and Worst S&amp;P 500 Stocks Since September 30th\n\n&gt; The past month has seen the S&amp;P 500 pivot and rally higher after declines throughout the month of September. Since the end of Q3, the S&amp;P has now gained 8.6%, which is slightly off the highs from earlier this month. Earnings season has been in full swing over the past few weeks meaning there have been plenty of stocks with catalysts for big moves since the end of September. Below we show the stocks that have risen and fallen the most since September 30th.\n\n&gt; Topping the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH) having rallied 67.77% in the past month and a half. The bulk of that gain came after earnings as the stock leaped 24.65% the day after reporting and plenty of follow-through in the days after. Arista Networks (ANET) is also up over 50%. Like ENPH, a large portion of ANET's move came from an over 20% gain on earnings in response to a triple play. There are 18 other stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have risen by more than 25% since the end of September. The largest of those are NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).\n\n&gt; Only 18% of the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower since September 30th, and by far the biggest decliner has been Moderna (MRNA). Although it has fallen a dramatic 41% in a short span, that eats into what have been very strong gains this year. Even after its decline so far in Q4, MRNA has still more than doubled year to date. The only other biggest decliners since September that are still up year to date are Garmin (GRMN), Allstate (ALL), Carnival (CCL), and Dish Network (DISH).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111221-930.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Week Before Thanksgiving, DJIA up 19 of 28, but weaker lately\n\n&gt; Next week is not only November\u2019s monthly option expiration week, but it is also the last full week of trading before Thanksgiving. DJIA has a reasonably solid track record over the last 28 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.41%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks have not been as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 18 years with a median loss of 0.09%.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.24% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.16% median loss. NASDAQ is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.28% and down 9 of the last 18, +0.07% median gain. Russell 2000 is up 15 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.54% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.20% median loss. If weakness does manifest next week, it may be a good set up for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/680c740a2fcf7b877a85ecba425f6bda/3d24fe398b06ac0c-55/s500x750/1ee3ab95c65a7c99a01105d66f8864bc7cdac8a7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n&gt; As we reach the home stretch of 2021, there is a lot to be thankful for. Stocks are having an amazing year, the economy is improving, and COVID-19 trends are going the right direction. Let\u2019s look at some reasons to be thankful.\n\n&gt; What an amazing year and incredible recent run in stocks. The S&amp;P 500 Index just made 8 consecutive all-time highs for the first time since 1997 and it was up 17 out of 19 days for the first time since 1971. Along the way, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 25% year-to-date in the month of November, making it one of the best years ever.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs this year, tied for the second most in any year ever (tied with 1964), with only 77 in 1995 higher. Although it is still a longshot, there\u2019s a chance we could see 13 more new highs and break the record, something to be thankful for indeed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.10.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cAlthough the economy did slow in the third quarter, it looks like that was a one-off event due to supply chain issues and the Delta variant,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe fully expect growth to pick up over the coming quarters as the economy continues to rebound thanks to a very healthy and strong U.S. consumer.\u201d\n\n&gt; From the best services number ever, to job growth beating expectations, to inflation and supply chain issues showing signs of peaking, to consumers with trillions of dollars in savings, there are many reasons to expect the economy to remain strong as we head into 2022.\n\n&gt; At the end of the day, though, it is all about earnings. So, while the economy might have slowed in the third quarter, earnings once again came in much better than expected, showing how agile corporate America can be. S&amp;P 500 earnings are tracking to a 39% year-over-year increase in the third quarter, more than 12 percentage points above expectations with still more than 40 index constituents left to report. As our Earnings Season Dashboard shows below, there is a lot to be thankful for as it pertains to earnings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.10.21-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the trends in COVID-19 are going the right way, with the number of hospitalizations down more than 50% from the September peak. With booster shots on the way and kids allowed to get vaccinated, there are many tailwinds to a continuation of the reopening we\u2019ve been seeing. This is definitely something to be thankful for.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Steadily Moving Higher\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has encountered some selling pressure this week, but that hasn't stopped sentiment from continuing its grind higher. The weekly AAII sentiment survey saw 48.0% of respondents report as bullish this week up from 41.5% last week. That puts bullish sentiment at the highest level since the first week of July when it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it is now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears as less than a quarter of respondents reported having negative sentiment for the first time since the last week of July. Similar to bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment is now at the lowest level since the first week of July when it came in at 22.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment continues to favor bulls to a wide margin. As a result of the inverse moves in sentiment, the bull-bear spread rose to 24 from 15.5 last week. Again, that is levels not seen since early July.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling by 4.5 percentage points to 28%. Unlike bullish and bearish sentiment, that reading is basically in the middle of the past several months' range as the reading has generally hovered around the 30% level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Economic Outlook Dour\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released the results of their October survey of small business sentiment. The report saw small business sentiment fall for the second month in a row. At 98.2, the index is now back to the same level it was at this past March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-HL.png))**\n\n&gt; With the decline in the headline reading, breadth was terrible with only one index that is an input to the optimism index\u2014Plans to Make Capital Outlays\u2014moving higher month over month. The various indices are now all over the place with regards to their own historical ranges. For example, Higher Prices, Compensation, and Compensation Plans all hit a record high while Expectations for the Economy to Improve and Credit Conditions for Regular Borrowers are just off of record lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Sales and earnings-related topics weighed on optimism in October. A net negative percentage of responding firms reported weaker actual and earnings changes. Meanwhile, the weakest percentage of respondents reported now as a good time to expand since February. Alongside that weaker reading, Outlook for General Business Conditions continues to collapse and is now at the second-lowest level on record; only slightly above the low from nine years ago. One potential factor playing into that weak sentiment is higher prices as that index hit another record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Sales.png))**\n\n&gt; While the headline Small Business Optimism index has declined, it has held up considerably well relative to the massive drop in the Outlook for General Business Conditions. As shown below, the spread between the two is now at a record high dating back to 1986.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; While there were some signs of cooling in October, overall the employment metrics in the report continue to be historically strong. Hiring Plans were unchanged at 26 which is off the late summer peak but still above any pre-pandemic level. While firms do not plan to take on as many workers as they had planned a few months ago, they are at least paying them better. Both Compensation and Compensation Plans continue to surge to new record highs. That has appeared to have some effect as the number of firms reporting Job Openings as Hard to Fill fell modestly. Additionally, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, fewer businesses are reporting labor problems as their biggest concern.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Emp.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/45es3q2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EKBM7mR.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/9je3wSW.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pviG7w8.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/hADm01O.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/peAqPvP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.16.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EP2afcX.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AJnWJ7J.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ev2lXWy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ep2sGdL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SYzRwze.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ruo795N.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/nzonZUm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. $166.81\n&gt; **Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

        "selftext": "**The Companies** \nMAXN - Maxeon is a spin off from SunPower that focuses only on manufacturing solar panels.\n\nSPWR - SunPower is a solar solution provider and installer, that is primarily focused on the service installation and operation of solar solutions. Prior to October 2020, SPWR made their own solar panels. After October 2020, MAXN makes the solar panels and is owned as a partnership of TZS, SPWR and Total.\n\nENPH - Enphase makes batteries, microinverters and software that is used to convert the energy generated by solar panels into usable electricity for your home.\n\n**The Relationships**\n\nSPWR used to manufacture their own panels, but then spun off MAXN so they can have two lines of business with different expenses and revenue streams. ENPH partners with MAXN and SPWR to integrate microinverters into solar panels: https://enphase.com/installers/acm/sunpower\n\nMAXN is primarily sold and installed by SPWR. So if SPWR has a bad quarter, expect MAXN to hurt. And similarly, ENPH is a canary in a coal mine. When ENPH has bad news, it will take MAXN and SPWR with them.\n\n**Historical performance**\n\nBack in April, MAXN put out an awful Q1 and lowered year long estimates. They also coupled this by putting out an offering redeemable at $18. Overall, it was a triple beatdown that saw MAXN drop from $40 to $15. Also, during that drop, there were regular price cuts by Raymond James, a bullish analyst.\n\nIn Q3, we have a real interesting mix of sentiment. SPWR had a bad quarter with earnings despite revenue being up. This hurt the stock price by 8%. MAXN had a sympathy slide of about 15% in reaction. ENPH on the other hand blew out investor expectations and jumped 25% and is holding strong.\n\nMAXN in Q2: https://corp.maxeon.com/static-files/16f85525-3954-42f9-9109-b8e4d5003af2\n\nRevenue was only up 5% both QoQ and YoY for Q2.\n\n**Projections and Valuation**\n\nMAXN has Q3 revenue projections of $220M, which is 20% higher than their Q2 revenue of $175. SPWR was targeted for $329M in revenue but only hit $323M.\n\nIf MAXN hits $220M, and closes the year at $700M in revenue, their P/S ratio would be 1.35. Both CSIQ and JKS operate at P/S ratios of 0.55. SEDG operates at a P/S of 10, but SEDG offers more products in a higher margin space.\n\nI think unless MAXN blows it out of the water, we can expect a price slide back to $18.\n\n**The company catalysts**\n\nThe biggest bet on MAXN is the end of the polysilicon contract that they current have which was obtained above market:\nhttps://stockspinoffinvesting.com/spin-offs/maxeon-solar-technologies-deep-dive/\n\nThe catalyst for MAXN is that the contract for their above market polysilicon supply is going to expire in 2022. Using their Q2 numbers (https://corp.maxeon.com/static-files/16f85525-3954-42f9-9109-b8e4d5003af2) We can see that MAXN has an additional expense of $12M in Q2 because of above market polysilicon. This means that once the contract ends, they will immediately have $12M in savings, which is about 10% of their current revenue per quarter. Unfortunately, this $12M doesn't make them profitable, but it decreases their operating loss by almost 25%. It doesn't affect their P/S ratios, but it helps their EPS and cash flows, which could give them some runway.\n\nOverall, I think MAXN is going to provide middling numbers and coupled with SPWR's lower results, the polysilicon offset won't be enough to pump MAXN beyond $25.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 15th, 2021.\n\n# **Inflation remains the hot topic in week ahead as Walmart and other key retailers report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/12/inflation-remains-the-hot-topic-in-week-ahead-as-walmart-and-other-key-retailers-report.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Consumers are in the spotlight in the week ahead, with the imminent release of retail sales for October and earnings from major chain stores.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales is the big economic report for the week, when the Census Bureau releases October data on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said he\u2019s also looking at the New York Federal Reserve\u2019s Empire state manufacturing survey Monday for updates on prices paid. The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, a measure of growth in that region, is released Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat\u2019s going to be key, outside of that it\u2019s retail sales,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think the inflation story will continue to dominate the headlines and the news flow in markets and what the Fed does.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the outcome of the virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday evening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s good that they would be on a talking basis,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything would come out of it unless there\u2019s some shocking change in the tariff situation, but I doubt anything will happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Chain store earnings\n&gt; The earnings season is winding down, but the big-box stores have yet to report. Walmart and Home Depot release results Tuesday, and Target reports Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWalmart is a pretty big barometer for the health of the consumer for sure, and it will be interesting to see how they handle margins,\u201d National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. Rising costs have been pressuring companies across industries, and many have raised prices in response.\n*****\n&gt; Based on the latest sentiment data Friday, consumers are getting worried about rising prices. The University of Michigan\u2019 consumer sentiment index dropped to a 10-year low of 66.8 in the preliminary November report, from 71.7 in October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s so important to look at what consumers do, versus what they say,\u201d Hogan said. He said retail sales are expected to be up 1.1%, compared to a 0.7% gain in September.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe trend that we\u2019re looking for in the next week is sequential improvement in economic data,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThat\u2019s the important thing to focus on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Other data in the coming week includes industrial production Tuesday. Housing starts and building permits data will be released Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; Inflation also proved to be a problem in the stock market this past week, after both producer prices and consumer prices increased more than expected. The consumer price index jumped 6.2%, a three-decade high.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks snapped a five-week winning streak, and all major indices were lower in the past week. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.3% for the week, at 4,682. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 saw the biggest declines, falling 0.7% and 1% respectively.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner to combat inflation.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.57% on Friday afternoon, and the 2-year yield traded at 0.52%. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The best performing major S&amp;P equities sector was materials, an inflation play that gained more than 2.5%. The worst performer was the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers: It declined nearly 3.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said even with inflation fears, he expects stocks to continue to rise.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we continue to grind higher. We did the larger reset that we needed, which was six weeks - in September and two weeks of October,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good news is demand hasn\u2019t been destroyed. It\u2019s been delayed.\u201d Hogan said supply chain issues should get sorted out. He noted that some components of CPI, like higher used car prices, show that the inflation should be temporary.\n*****\n&gt; Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said he expects the market to continue its march higher. \u201cWhat would make me call for a correction in the market would be two things \u2014 hubris and debt,\u201d he said. Neither of those are currently a problem, since he does not see signs of \u201cmanagement gone awry\u201d and many companies restructured their debt.\n*****\n&gt; Managements are not engaging in arrogant behavior that would be more common at a market top, like excessive spending, he said.\n*****\n&gt; Parker said he expects mid-single digit earnings growth. \u201cI think we could be pretty constructive for the next couple of quarters,\u201d he said.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/8rAJUHO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dhxVRcM.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/oHCQ5zT.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/NocMP7O.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/rHLkf6i.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SRRbBhh.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/68bpNyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lF2TUFo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YuhpIuh.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KQOTTn6.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nhff0sq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1xc0qaI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7FUnt2B.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best and Worst S&amp;P 500 Stocks Since September 30th\n\n&gt; The past month has seen the S&amp;P 500 pivot and rally higher after declines throughout the month of September. Since the end of Q3, the S&amp;P has now gained 8.6%, which is slightly off the highs from earlier this month. Earnings season has been in full swing over the past few weeks meaning there have been plenty of stocks with catalysts for big moves since the end of September. Below we show the stocks that have risen and fallen the most since September 30th.\n\n&gt; Topping the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH) having rallied 67.77% in the past month and a half. The bulk of that gain came after earnings as the stock leaped 24.65% the day after reporting and plenty of follow-through in the days after. Arista Networks (ANET) is also up over 50%. Like ENPH, a large portion of ANET's move came from an over 20% gain on earnings in response to a triple play. There are 18 other stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have risen by more than 25% since the end of September. The largest of those are NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).\n\n&gt; Only 18% of the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower since September 30th, and by far the biggest decliner has been Moderna (MRNA). Although it has fallen a dramatic 41% in a short span, that eats into what have been very strong gains this year. Even after its decline so far in Q4, MRNA has still more than doubled year to date. The only other biggest decliners since September that are still up year to date are Garmin (GRMN), Allstate (ALL), Carnival (CCL), and Dish Network (DISH).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111221-930.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Week Before Thanksgiving, DJIA up 19 of 28, but weaker lately\n\n&gt; Next week is not only November\u2019s monthly option expiration week, but it is also the last full week of trading before Thanksgiving. DJIA has a reasonably solid track record over the last 28 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.41%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks have not been as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 18 years with a median loss of 0.09%.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.24% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.16% median loss. NASDAQ is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.28% and down 9 of the last 18, +0.07% median gain. Russell 2000 is up 15 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.54% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.20% median loss. If weakness does manifest next week, it may be a good set up for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/680c740a2fcf7b877a85ecba425f6bda/3d24fe398b06ac0c-55/s500x750/1ee3ab95c65a7c99a01105d66f8864bc7cdac8a7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n&gt; As we reach the home stretch of 2021, there is a lot to be thankful for. Stocks are having an amazing year, the economy is improving, and COVID-19 trends are going the right direction. Let\u2019s look at some reasons to be thankful.\n\n&gt; What an amazing year and incredible recent run in stocks. The S&amp;P 500 Index just made 8 consecutive all-time highs for the first time since 1997 and it was up 17 out of 19 days for the first time since 1971. Along the way, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 25% year-to-date in the month of November, making it one of the best years ever.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs this year, tied for the second most in any year ever (tied with 1964), with only 77 in 1995 higher. Although it is still a longshot, there\u2019s a chance we could see 13 more new highs and break the record, something to be thankful for indeed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.10.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cAlthough the economy did slow in the third quarter, it looks like that was a one-off event due to supply chain issues and the Delta variant,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe fully expect growth to pick up over the coming quarters as the economy continues to rebound thanks to a very healthy and strong U.S. consumer.\u201d\n\n&gt; From the best services number ever, to job growth beating expectations, to inflation and supply chain issues showing signs of peaking, to consumers with trillions of dollars in savings, there are many reasons to expect the economy to remain strong as we head into 2022.\n\n&gt; At the end of the day, though, it is all about earnings. So, while the economy might have slowed in the third quarter, earnings once again came in much better than expected, showing how agile corporate America can be. S&amp;P 500 earnings are tracking to a 39% year-over-year increase in the third quarter, more than 12 percentage points above expectations with still more than 40 index constituents left to report. As our Earnings Season Dashboard shows below, there is a lot to be thankful for as it pertains to earnings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.10.21-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the trends in COVID-19 are going the right way, with the number of hospitalizations down more than 50% from the September peak. With booster shots on the way and kids allowed to get vaccinated, there are many tailwinds to a continuation of the reopening we\u2019ve been seeing. This is definitely something to be thankful for.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Steadily Moving Higher\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has encountered some selling pressure this week, but that hasn't stopped sentiment from continuing its grind higher. The weekly AAII sentiment survey saw 48.0% of respondents report as bullish this week up from 41.5% last week. That puts bullish sentiment at the highest level since the first week of July when it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it is now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears as less than a quarter of respondents reported having negative sentiment for the first time since the last week of July. Similar to bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment is now at the lowest level since the first week of July when it came in at 22.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment continues to favor bulls to a wide margin. As a result of the inverse moves in sentiment, the bull-bear spread rose to 24 from 15.5 last week. Again, that is levels not seen since early July.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling by 4.5 percentage points to 28%. Unlike bullish and bearish sentiment, that reading is basically in the middle of the past several months' range as the reading has generally hovered around the 30% level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Economic Outlook Dour\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released the results of their October survey of small business sentiment. The report saw small business sentiment fall for the second month in a row. At 98.2, the index is now back to the same level it was at this past March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-HL.png))**\n\n&gt; With the decline in the headline reading, breadth was terrible with only one index that is an input to the optimism index\u2014Plans to Make Capital Outlays\u2014moving higher month over month. The various indices are now all over the place with regards to their own historical ranges. For example, Higher Prices, Compensation, and Compensation Plans all hit a record high while Expectations for the Economy to Improve and Credit Conditions for Regular Borrowers are just off of record lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Sales and earnings-related topics weighed on optimism in October. A net negative percentage of responding firms reported weaker actual and earnings changes. Meanwhile, the weakest percentage of respondents reported now as a good time to expand since February. Alongside that weaker reading, Outlook for General Business Conditions continues to collapse and is now at the second-lowest level on record; only slightly above the low from nine years ago. One potential factor playing into that weak sentiment is higher prices as that index hit another record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Sales.png))**\n\n&gt; While the headline Small Business Optimism index has declined, it has held up considerably well relative to the massive drop in the Outlook for General Business Conditions. As shown below, the spread between the two is now at a record high dating back to 1986.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; While there were some signs of cooling in October, overall the employment metrics in the report continue to be historically strong. Hiring Plans were unchanged at 26 which is off the late summer peak but still above any pre-pandemic level. While firms do not plan to take on as many workers as they had planned a few months ago, they are at least paying them better. Both Compensation and Compensation Plans continue to surge to new record highs. That has appeared to have some effect as the number of firms reporting Job Openings as Hard to Fill fell modestly. Additionally, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, fewer businesses are reporting labor problems as their biggest concern.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Emp.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 12th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmulEWE-T6Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.14.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$TSN $OEG $OTLY $AAP $IDEX $CSPR $WMT $HD $SE $STNE $LZB $DLO $TGT $BIDU $LOW $TJX $BILI $NNOX $NVDA $CSCO $VSCO $BABA $JD $M $BJ $WOOF $AMAT $WDAY $INTU $PANW $WSM $FL**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/KQOTTn6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MrpShLB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/9je3wSW.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pviG7w8.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/hADm01O.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/peAqPvP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.16.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EP2afcX.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AJnWJ7J.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ev2lXWy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ep2sGdL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SYzRwze.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ruo795N.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/nzonZUm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n&gt; **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/smallstreetbets. :)",

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 15th, 2021.\n\n# **Inflation remains the hot topic in week ahead as Walmart and other key retailers report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/12/inflation-remains-the-hot-topic-in-week-ahead-as-walmart-and-other-key-retailers-report.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Consumers are in the spotlight in the week ahead, with the imminent release of retail sales for October and earnings from major chain stores.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales is the big economic report for the week, when the Census Bureau releases October data on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said he\u2019s also looking at the New York Federal Reserve\u2019s Empire state manufacturing survey Monday for updates on prices paid. The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, a measure of growth in that region, is released Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat\u2019s going to be key, outside of that it\u2019s retail sales,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think the inflation story will continue to dominate the headlines and the news flow in markets and what the Fed does.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the outcome of the virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday evening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s good that they would be on a talking basis,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything would come out of it unless there\u2019s some shocking change in the tariff situation, but I doubt anything will happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Chain store earnings\n&gt; The earnings season is winding down, but the big-box stores have yet to report. Walmart and Home Depot release results Tuesday, and Target reports Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWalmart is a pretty big barometer for the health of the consumer for sure, and it will be interesting to see how they handle margins,\u201d National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. Rising costs have been pressuring companies across industries, and many have raised prices in response.\n*****\n&gt; Based on the latest sentiment data Friday, consumers are getting worried about rising prices. The University of Michigan\u2019 consumer sentiment index dropped to a 10-year low of 66.8 in the preliminary November report, from 71.7 in October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s so important to look at what consumers do, versus what they say,\u201d Hogan said. He said retail sales are expected to be up 1.1%, compared to a 0.7% gain in September.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe trend that we\u2019re looking for in the next week is sequential improvement in economic data,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThat\u2019s the important thing to focus on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Other data in the coming week includes industrial production Tuesday. Housing starts and building permits data will be released Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; Inflation also proved to be a problem in the stock market this past week, after both producer prices and consumer prices increased more than expected. The consumer price index jumped 6.2%, a three-decade high.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks snapped a five-week winning streak, and all major indices were lower in the past week. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.3% for the week, at 4,682. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 saw the biggest declines, falling 0.7% and 1% respectively.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner to combat inflation.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.57% on Friday afternoon, and the 2-year yield traded at 0.52%. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The best performing major S&amp;P equities sector was materials, an inflation play that gained more than 2.5%. The worst performer was the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers: It declined nearly 3.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said even with inflation fears, he expects stocks to continue to rise.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we continue to grind higher. We did the larger reset that we needed, which was six weeks - in September and two weeks of October,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good news is demand hasn\u2019t been destroyed. It\u2019s been delayed.\u201d Hogan said supply chain issues should get sorted out. He noted that some components of CPI, like higher used car prices, show that the inflation should be temporary.\n*****\n&gt; Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said he expects the market to continue its march higher. \u201cWhat would make me call for a correction in the market would be two things \u2014 hubris and debt,\u201d he said. Neither of those are currently a problem, since he does not see signs of \u201cmanagement gone awry\u201d and many companies restructured their debt.\n*****\n&gt; Managements are not engaging in arrogant behavior that would be more common at a market top, like excessive spending, he said.\n*****\n&gt; Parker said he expects mid-single digit earnings growth. \u201cI think we could be pretty constructive for the next couple of quarters,\u201d he said.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/8rAJUHO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dhxVRcM.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/oHCQ5zT.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/NocMP7O.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/rHLkf6i.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SRRbBhh.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/68bpNyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lF2TUFo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YuhpIuh.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KQOTTn6.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nhff0sq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1xc0qaI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7FUnt2B.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best and Worst S&amp;P 500 Stocks Since September 30th\n\n&gt; The past month has seen the S&amp;P 500 pivot and rally higher after declines throughout the month of September. Since the end of Q3, the S&amp;P has now gained 8.6%, which is slightly off the highs from earlier this month. Earnings season has been in full swing over the past few weeks meaning there have been plenty of stocks with catalysts for big moves since the end of September. Below we show the stocks that have risen and fallen the most since September 30th.\n\n&gt; Topping the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH) having rallied 67.77% in the past month and a half. The bulk of that gain came after earnings as the stock leaped 24.65% the day after reporting and plenty of follow-through in the days after. Arista Networks (ANET) is also up over 50%. Like ENPH, a large portion of ANET's move came from an over 20% gain on earnings in response to a triple play. There are 18 other stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have risen by more than 25% since the end of September. The largest of those are NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).\n\n&gt; Only 18% of the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower since September 30th, and by far the biggest decliner has been Moderna (MRNA). Although it has fallen a dramatic 41% in a short span, that eats into what have been very strong gains this year. Even after its decline so far in Q4, MRNA has still more than doubled year to date. The only other biggest decliners since September that are still up year to date are Garmin (GRMN), Allstate (ALL), Carnival (CCL), and Dish Network (DISH).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111221-930.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Week Before Thanksgiving, DJIA up 19 of 28, but weaker lately\n\n&gt; Next week is not only November\u2019s monthly option expiration week, but it is also the last full week of trading before Thanksgiving. DJIA has a reasonably solid track record over the last 28 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.41%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks have not been as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 18 years with a median loss of 0.09%.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.24% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.16% median loss. NASDAQ is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.28% and down 9 of the last 18, +0.07% median gain. Russell 2000 is up 15 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.54% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.20% median loss. If weakness does manifest next week, it may be a good set up for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/680c740a2fcf7b877a85ecba425f6bda/3d24fe398b06ac0c-55/s500x750/1ee3ab95c65a7c99a01105d66f8864bc7cdac8a7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n&gt; As we reach the home stretch of 2021, there is a lot to be thankful for. Stocks are having an amazing year, the economy is improving, and COVID-19 trends are going the right direction. Let\u2019s look at some reasons to be thankful.\n\n&gt; What an amazing year and incredible recent run in stocks. The S&amp;P 500 Index just made 8 consecutive all-time highs for the first time since 1997 and it was up 17 out of 19 days for the first time since 1971. Along the way, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 25% year-to-date in the month of November, making it one of the best years ever.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs this year, tied for the second most in any year ever (tied with 1964), with only 77 in 1995 higher. Although it is still a longshot, there\u2019s a chance we could see 13 more new highs and break the record, something to be thankful for indeed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.10.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cAlthough the economy did slow in the third quarter, it looks like that was a one-off event due to supply chain issues and the Delta variant,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe fully expect growth to pick up over the coming quarters as the economy continues to rebound thanks to a very healthy and strong U.S. consumer.\u201d\n\n&gt; From the best services number ever, to job growth beating expectations, to inflation and supply chain issues showing signs of peaking, to consumers with trillions of dollars in savings, there are many reasons to expect the economy to remain strong as we head into 2022.\n\n&gt; At the end of the day, though, it is all about earnings. So, while the economy might have slowed in the third quarter, earnings once again came in much better than expected, showing how agile corporate America can be.

With booster shots on the way and kids allowed to get vaccinated, there are many tailwinds to a continuation of the reopening we\u2019ve been seeing. This is definitely something to be thankful for.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Steadily Moving Higher\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has encountered some selling pressure this week, but that hasn't stopped sentiment from continuing its grind higher.

For example, Higher Prices, Compensation, and Compensation Plans all hit a record high while Expectations for the Economy to Improve and Credit Conditions for Regular Borrowers are just off of record lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Sales and earnings-related topics weighed on optimism in October. A net negative percentage of responding firms reported weaker actual and earnings changes. Meanwhile, the weakest percentage of respondents reported now as a good time to expand since February. Alongside that weaker reading, Outlook for General Business Conditions continues to collapse and is now at the second-lowest level on record; only slightly above the low from nine years ago. One potential factor playing into that weak sentiment is higher prices as that index hit another record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Sales.png))**\n\n&gt; While the headline Small Business Optimism index has declined, it has held up considerably well relative to the massive drop in the Outlook for General Business Conditions. As shown below, the spread between the two is now at a record high dating back to 1986.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; While there were some signs of cooling in October, overall the employment metrics in the report continue to be historically strong. Hiring Plans were unchanged at 26 which is off the late summer peak but still above any pre-pandemic level. While firms do not plan to take on as many workers as they had planned a few months ago, they are at least paying them better. Both Compensation and Compensation Plans continue to surge to new record highs. That has appeared to have some effect as the number of firms reporting Job Openings as Hard to Fill fell modestly. Additionally, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, fewer businesses are reporting labor problems as their biggest concern.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Emp.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 12th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmulEWE-T6Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.14.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$TSN $OEG $OTLY $AAP $IDEX $CSPR $WMT $HD $SE $STNE $LZB $DLO $TGT $BIDU $LOW $TJX $BILI $NNOX $NVDA $CSCO $VSCO $BABA $JD $M $BJ $WOOF $AMAT $WDAY $INTU $PANW $WSM $FL**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/KQOTTn6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MrpShLB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/9je3wSW.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pviG7w8.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/hADm01O.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/peAqPvP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.16.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EP2afcX.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AJnWJ7J.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ev2lXWy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ep2sGdL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SYzRwze.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ruo795N.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/nzonZUm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n&gt; **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket. :)",

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 15th, 2021.\n\n# **Inflation remains the hot topic in week ahead as Walmart and other key retailers report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/12/inflation-remains-the-hot-topic-in-week-ahead-as-walmart-and-other-key-retailers-report.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Consumers are in the spotlight in the week ahead, with the imminent release of retail sales for October and earnings from major chain stores.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales is the big economic report for the week, when the Census Bureau releases October data on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said he\u2019s also looking at the New York Federal Reserve\u2019s Empire state manufacturing survey Monday for updates on prices paid. The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, a measure of growth in that region, is released Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat\u2019s going to be key, outside of that it\u2019s retail sales,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think the inflation story will continue to dominate the headlines and the news flow in markets and what the Fed does.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the outcome of the virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday evening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s good that they would be on a talking basis,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything would come out of it unless there\u2019s some shocking change in the tariff situation, but I doubt anything will happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Chain store earnings\n&gt; The earnings season is winding down, but the big-box stores have yet to report. Walmart and Home Depot release results Tuesday, and Target reports Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWalmart is a pretty big barometer for the health of the consumer for sure, and it will be interesting to see how they handle margins,\u201d National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. Rising costs have been pressuring companies across industries, and many have raised prices in response.\n*****\n&gt; Based on the latest sentiment data Friday, consumers are getting worried about rising prices. The University of Michigan\u2019 consumer sentiment index dropped to a 10-year low of 66.8 in the preliminary November report, from 71.7 in October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s so important to look at what consumers do, versus what they say,\u201d Hogan said. He said retail sales are expected to be up 1.1%, compared to a 0.7% gain in September.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe trend that we\u2019re looking for in the next week is sequential improvement in economic data,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThat\u2019s the important thing to focus on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Other data in the coming week includes industrial production Tuesday. Housing starts and building permits data will be released Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; Inflation also proved to be a problem in the stock market this past week, after both producer prices and consumer prices increased more than expected. The consumer price index jumped 6.2%, a three-decade high.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks snapped a five-week winning streak, and all major indices were lower in the past week. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.3% for the week, at 4,682. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 saw the biggest declines, falling 0.7% and 1% respectively.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner to combat inflation.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.57% on Friday afternoon, and the 2-year yield traded at 0.52%. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The best performing major S&amp;P equities sector was materials, an inflation play that gained more than 2.5%. The worst performer was the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers: It declined nearly 3.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said even with inflation fears, he expects stocks to continue to rise.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we continue to grind higher. We did the larger reset that we needed, which was six weeks - in September and two weeks of October,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good news is demand hasn\u2019t been destroyed. It\u2019s been delayed.\u201d Hogan said supply chain issues should get sorted out. He noted that some components of CPI, like higher used car prices, show that the inflation should be temporary.\n*****\n&gt; Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said he expects the market to continue its march higher. \u201cWhat would make me call for a correction in the market would be two things \u2014 hubris and debt,\u201d he said. Neither of those are currently a problem, since he does not see signs of \u201cmanagement gone awry\u201d and many companies restructured their debt.\n*****\n&gt; Managements are not engaging in arrogant behavior that would be more common at a market top, like excessive spending, he said.\n*****\n&gt; Parker said he expects mid-single digit earnings growth. \u201cI think we could be pretty constructive for the next couple of quarters,\u201d he said.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/8rAJUHO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dhxVRcM.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/oHCQ5zT.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/NocMP7O.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/rHLkf6i.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SRRbBhh.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/68bpNyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lF2TUFo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YuhpIuh.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/45es3q2.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nhff0sq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1xc0qaI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7FUnt2B.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best and Worst S&amp;P 500 Stocks Since September 30th\n\n&gt; The past month has seen the S&amp;P 500 pivot and rally higher after declines throughout the month of September. Since the end of Q3, the S&amp;P has now gained 8.6%, which is slightly off the highs from earlier this month. Earnings season has been in full swing over the past few weeks meaning there have been plenty of stocks with catalysts for big moves since the end of September. Below we show the stocks that have risen and fallen the most since September 30th.\n\n&gt; Topping the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH) having rallied 67.77% in the past month and a half. The bulk of that gain came after earnings as the stock leaped 24.65% the day after reporting and plenty of follow-through in the days after. Arista Networks (ANET) is also up over 50%. Like ENPH, a large portion of ANET's move came from an over 20% gain on earnings in response to a triple play. There are 18 other stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have risen by more than 25% since the end of September. The largest of those are NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).\n\n&gt; Only 18% of the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower since September 30th, and by far the biggest decliner has been Moderna (MRNA). Although it has fallen a dramatic 41% in a short span, that eats into what have been very strong gains this year. Even after its decline so far in Q4, MRNA has still more than doubled year to date. The only other biggest decliners since September that are still up year to date are Garmin (GRMN), Allstate (ALL), Carnival (CCL), and Dish Network (DISH).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111221-930.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Week Before Thanksgiving, DJIA up 19 of 28, but weaker lately\n\n&gt; Next week is not only November\u2019s monthly option expiration week, but it is also the last full week of trading before Thanksgiving. DJIA has a reasonably solid track record over the last 28 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.41%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks have not been as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 18 years with a median loss of 0.09%.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.24% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.16% median loss. NASDAQ is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.28% and down 9 of the last 18, +0.07% median gain. Russell 2000 is up 15 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.54% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.20% median loss. If weakness does manifest next week, it may be a good set up for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/680c740a2fcf7b877a85ecba425f6bda/3d24fe398b06ac0c-55/s500x750/1ee3ab95c65a7c99a01105d66f8864bc7cdac8a7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n&gt; As we reach the home stretch of 2021, there is a lot to be thankful for. Stocks are having an amazing year, the economy is improving, and COVID-19 trends are going the right direction. Let\u2019s look at some reasons to be thankful.\n\n&gt; What an amazing year and incredible recent run in stocks. The S&amp;P 500 Index just made 8 consecutive all-time highs for the first time since 1997 and it was up 17 out of 19 days for the first time since 1971. Along the way, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 25% year-to-date in the month of November, making it one of the best years ever.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs this year, tied for the second most in any year ever (tied with 1964), with only 77 in 1995 higher. Although it is still a longshot, there\u2019s a chance we could see 13 more new highs and break the record, something to be thankful for indeed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.10.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cAlthough the economy did slow in the third quarter, it looks like that was a one-off event due to supply chain issues and the Delta variant,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe fully expect growth to pick up over the coming quarters as the economy continues to rebound thanks to a very healthy and strong U.S. consumer.\u201d\n\n&gt; From the best services number ever, to job growth beating expectations, to inflation and supply chain issues showing signs of peaking, to consumers with trillions of dollars in savings, there are many reasons to expect the economy to remain strong as we head into 2022.\n\n&gt; At the end of the day, though, it is all about earnings. So, while the economy might have slowed in the third quarter, earnings once again came in much better than expected, showing how agile corporate America can be. S&amp;P 500 earnings are tracking to a 39% year-over-year increase in the third quarter, more than 12 percentage points above expectations with still more than 40 index constituents left to report. As our Earnings Season Dashboard shows below, there is a lot to be thankful for as it pertains to earnings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.10.21-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the trends in COVID-19 are going the right way, with the number of hospitalizations down more than 50% from the September peak. With booster shots on the way and kids allowed to get vaccinated, there are many tailwinds to a continuation of the reopening we\u2019ve been seeing. This is definitely something to be thankful for.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Steadily Moving Higher\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has encountered some selling pressure this week, but that hasn't stopped sentiment from continuing its grind higher. The weekly AAII sentiment survey saw 48.0% of respondents report as bullish this week up from 41.5% last week. That puts bullish sentiment at the highest level since the first week of July when it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it is now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears as less than a quarter of respondents reported having negative sentiment for the first time since the last week of July. Similar to bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment is now at the lowest level since the first week of July when it came in at 22.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment continues to favor bulls to a wide margin. As a result of the inverse moves in sentiment, the bull-bear spread rose to 24 from 15.5 last week. Again, that is levels not seen since early July.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling by 4.5 percentage points to 28%. Unlike bullish and bearish sentiment, that reading is basically in the middle of the past several months' range as the reading has generally hovered around the 30% level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Economic Outlook Dour\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released the results of their October survey of small business sentiment. The report saw small business sentiment fall for the second month in a row. At 98.2, the index is now back to the same level it was at this past March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-HL.png))**\n\n&gt; With the decline in the headline reading, breadth was terrible with only one index that is an input to the optimism index\u2014Plans to Make Capital Outlays\u2014moving higher month over month. The various indices are now all over the place with regards to their own historical ranges. For example, Higher Prices, Compensation, and Compensation Plans all hit a record high while Expectations for the Economy to Improve and Credit Conditions for Regular Borrowers are just off of record lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Sales and earnings-related topics weighed on optimism in October. A net negative percentage of responding firms reported weaker actual and earnings changes. Meanwhile, the weakest percentage of respondents reported now as a good time to expand since February. Alongside that weaker reading, Outlook for General Business Conditions continues to collapse and is now at the second-lowest level on record; only slightly above the low from nine years ago. One potential factor playing into that weak sentiment is higher prices as that index hit another record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Sales.png))**\n\n&gt; While the headline Small Business Optimism index has declined, it has held up considerably well relative to the massive drop in the Outlook for General Business Conditions. As shown below, the spread between the two is now at a record high dating back to 1986.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; While there were some signs of cooling in October, overall the employment metrics in the report continue to be historically strong. Hiring Plans were unchanged at 26 which is off the late summer peak but still above any pre-pandemic level.
