        "selftext": "This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

However, looking at the latest period alone can be very limited since there can be noise from temporary or short-term events. In this post, we will look beyond the latest period to come up with the list of historically consistent performers in the market using advanced filters feature.\n\n.\n\nThe characteristics of quality companies we are searching for in this case are as followed. First, companies are in a growing business. Despite the growth, companies should make money while it is growing and efficiently allocating its resources. This leads to our second characteristic, strong profitability. Thirdly, to be able to last an infinite game of business, companies should not be overloaded with debt. And lastly, and most importantly, all these criteria should be consistent historically. From these requirements, we select the following 4 criteria for our screener.\n\n.\n\n1) 5-year Average Revenue growth of at least 8%\n\nWe select average revenue growth to capture the fact that business is in a growing trend. The company can be in a stagnant business while still growing its bottom line through improving its efficiency (while this type of company is also good, but it is not in the context of this screen).\n\n.\n\n2) ROIC is greater than or equal to 15% for at least 8 years from the past 10 years\n\nAlthough the companies were growing, this criterion dictates that they must not give up a certain level of return on capital. We select 8 years from the last 10 years period instead of 10 straight years since we want to relax the criteria a bit as companies might face with black swan event (COVID-19 Shutdown, 1-time Cost, 1-time fine, etc.) while they are still quality companies.\n\n.\n\n3) Net Profit Margin (NPM) is at least 15% for 4 years from the latest 5 years\n\nThis criterion helps filter the business with little or healthy competition. \n\n. \n\n4) Debt-to-Equity ratio is less than 2 but not negative\n\nFor this criterion, it is straightforward. The companies must not be overloaded with debt.\n\n.\n\nCombining all the criteria presented above, as of September 7th, 2020, we found 27 stocks. Many of them are big names in their industries for example GOOGL, MSFT, V, INTU, etc. Check out the full list at [https://www.inveszy.com/?search=yt8nO](https://www.inveszy.com/?search=yt8nO) \n\nHoping this list would be useful before digging down further into their 10-k, 10-Q, valuation, and other analysis.\n\n.\n\nPS.
