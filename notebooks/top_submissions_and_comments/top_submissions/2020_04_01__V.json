        "selftext": "Hello, friends -\n\nIt's me, Fuzzy. Welcome back. I know, I know. I'm excited too. I had this up at market open but it got spiked by automod \\*twice\\* so I'm hoping third time's the charm. \n\nDid you guys see that movie, *The Accountant*? The one where [Sad Ben Affleck](https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ab58b2922f093031d9fb8fa/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Fry-The-Great-Sadness-of-Ben-Affleck.jpg) plays an autistic accountant for organized crime who doubles as a stone-cold killer? Yeah, me neither.  I mainly remember it exists because it features Anna Kendrick, a Fuzzy Fave (TM). In the March Madness for my heart, she's a 4 or 5 seed in her conference for sure (look out, u/pokimane). Anyway, that's what we're going to be talking about today. No, not March Madness (never got the fuss) or Sad Ben Affleck (21st century existential icon) - not even Fuzzy's Faves. Today, we're all about bean-counting - specifically, EBITDA, the magic number that makes all of your accounting problems disappear. I figured it was time you autists got to learnin' how businesses can lose money on paper but still be in the green with their creditors - especially at the moment, what with the bat flu and all, when many businesses are trying to explain that no one should panic and they're still in the black (even though they're definitely not). Let's get started.\n\nNow - disclaimer - I am **not** an accountant (obviously). If you are, feel free to flex in the comments and explain to me how mastery of forward-looking deduction writeoffs or some other fucking word jumble would make me a more complete human and save me $0.03 on my taxes every second five-year rolling addback window. The thing is, like most people that wind up on the human facing side of the finance industry, I cared too much about getting laid in college to give a shit about how to make numbers dance on a P/L statement, so I never really bothered to learn much more than the basics.  Once you hit the real world, though, those pocket-protecting calculator jockeys get preeeetty important, pretty fast. Tax, forensics, regular ol' corporate book-keeping - in business-land, you name it, you need an accountant to either do it for you or sign off on it before you send it to the board. So, you know, accountants. Not all bad.\n\nAnyway, even though I'm not an accountant, one thing I **do** know a lot about is EBITDA. Why? Because it's one of the most hotly contested battlegrounds of modern corporate finance, so I deal with it every day. \"But Fuzzy! How can you negotiate something that's an established accounting concept? Isn't that like trying to change 2+2 so it equals 5?\" And the answer - if EBITDA was a regular accounting concept - would be yes. But fortunately for borrowers, private equity cowboys and corporate finance lawyers (as well as lovers of weasel words everywhere), it's not, so you can. See, there's a difference between GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) and... well everything that's not GAAP. You can't fuck with GAAP. How something \\*becomes\\* or even \\*became\\* GAAP in the first place... unclear. I guess in ancient times some bespectacled prophet came down from Mt. Nerd with spreadsheets carved on stone tablets, and whatever was on them wound up being generally accepted. I don't know, I'm not a fucking theologian. But however it happened, you can't fuck with it. Happily, though, EBITDA is non-GAAP, so like all the best girls, it's whatever you want it to be.\n\nBut we're getting ahead of ourselves. Today's post is going to be a tale of two halves. We're going to go through what EBITDA is and why it's important, and then we're going to go through a meme-tastic example to show how it can be manipulated - using everyone's favorite manufacturer of tendie-powered cars, rocketships, and flamethrowers... $TSLA!\n\nIf you want to play along at home, here's [$TSLA's 10-K](https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/07bfcb70-aba1-4a27-af09-4f101678320c). Now I know people get all hot and bothered about $TSLA for whatever reason (did you know there's a dedicated Tesla investors subreddit? fucking weird). So let's get this clear from the jump - every single company does this, and I'm not implying that $TSLA is doing anything 'wrong' or 'bad'. I don't give a shit about the ticker or the cars or Elon's mission to put weed on Mars or whatever the fuck he's doing these days, so don't come at me in the comments about any of that shit. They're just the example we're using to work through this exercise. They've actually got a fascinating debt structure that is worthy of its own post (Musk or his family can take it private at any point without triggering a change of control under the docs... what?!), but today we're limiting our scope to the way they're allowed to calculate EBITDA.\n\nOK. Ready? Let's do this. Sincere and/or funny questions in the comments answered as always.\n\n1. **EBITDA - A User's Guide**\n\nWhen it comes to people, it's pretty easy to measure performance. Where you went to school, how much you make, where you live, how hot your wife is, how long... you get the idea. The point is that life is full of concrete, objective measures to help you figure out how worthwhile (or not) you really are as a human. Stretch out to the \"All Time\" view on your RH graph to give yourself an idea of where you sit.\n\nBusinesses have a bunch of these metrics they can look at. Profits, cashflow, sales... the list goes on. The issues with most of those, though, is that running a business is a pretty complicated job. There's a whole lot of shit that goes into those numbers each financial year, and not all of it is necessarily indicative of the 'normal' baseline of performance. Maybe you have a bad quarter because of the 'rona (pour one out for $WFC..... yikes). Maybe you get slugged with a tax bill, or a big interest repayment from your bank. Now that might hurt your operating profit on a one-off basis, but it's not something you expect to keep happening. You don't want your shareholders to freak out over nothing. That's where EBITDA comes in (say it like EEE-BIT-DAH).\n\nEBITDA stands for **E**arnings **B**efore **I**nterest **T**axes **D**epreciation and **A**mortization. The idea is essentially to find that baseline - to produce a number which reflects the true earnings of the business when the pernicious influence of taxes, financing, and accounting is taken out of the equation. Basically, you calculate it by **adding back** non-cash expenses to your baseline operating income. That's it. Simple, right? \"OK Fuzz, but what's a non-cash expense? Couldn't that be like... anything?\" Exactly.\n\nBecause EBITDA as a concept is more malleable than your more... black and white metrics, borrowers like to use it in loan documentation - particularly in leveraged finance, where it typically serves as the measure of earnings for the company. It's also used as a building block of incurrence baskets - the higher your EBITDA, the more you get to utilize under a particular basket. Usually this is done by way of a either/or construct - you can have $50 million **or** $25%  (or whatever) of your EBITDA, whichever is greater. It also turns up in financial covenants and step-downs in asset sale sweeps, excess cash flow sweeps, and pricing. There's a bunch of other non-finance ways it gets used too, but we're just going to stick to this for now.\n\nSometimes companies will try and flex their 'record EBITDA' numbers in a 10-K. But if you read on, you'll see  that every time they do this, it's qualified by the fact that it's non-GAAP and not accepted blah blah blah. So just be mindful of that when you're reviewing those documents and always read the real numbers before you make a call on how the business is actually doing.\n\nAnyway, let's see how it can be manipulated.\n\n2. **Cookin' With Elon - The $TSLA Example**\n\nLet's take a peek under the hood of [$TSLA's Credit Agreement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000119312519095913/d625340dex1068.htm) to see what's going on with their EBITDA. Remember how I said you could calculate EBITDA by just adding back non-cash expenses to operating income? That's right... in theory. Have a look at this (just skim it, reading it cold will give you a headache. I'm going to break it down for you anyway - this is just for illustrative purposes):\n\n&gt;\u201cConsolidated EBITDA\u201d shall mean, for any period, Consolidated Net Income for such period (without giving effect to (w)\u00a0any extraordinary gains or losses, (x)\u00a0any non-cash income, (y)\u00a0any gains or losses from sales of assets other than those assets sold in the ordinary course of business, or (z)\u00a0any foreign currency gains or losses) adjusted by (A)\u00a0adding thereto (in each case to the extent deducted in determining Consolidated Net Income for such period (other than clause (ix)\u00a0below which need not be so deducted)), without duplication, the amount of (i)\u00a0total interest expense (inclusive of amortization or write-off of deferred financing fees and other original issue discount and banking fees, charges and commissions (e.g., letter of credit issuance and facing fees (including Letter of Credit Fees and Facing Fees), commitment fees, issuance costs and other transactional costs)) of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (ii)\u00a0provision for taxes based on income and foreign withholding taxes for the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries (including state, franchise, capital and similar taxes paid or accrued) determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (iii)\u00a0all depreciation and amortization expense of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (iv)\u00a0in the case of any period, the amount of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transaction (including in connection with any amendments to the Credit Documents) during such fiscal quarter, (v)\u00a0any unusual or non-recurring cash charges, (vi)\u00a0any cash restructuring charges or reserves (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include retention, severance, system establishment costs, excess pension charges, contract and lease termination costs and costs to consolidate facilities and relocate employees) for such period (a)(x) incurred in connection with an Acquisition consummated after the Effective Date or (y)\u00a0otherwise incurred in connection with the Company\u2019s and its Consolidated Subsidiaries\u2019 operations in an aggregate amount for all cash charges added back pursuant to this clause (vi)\u00a0not to exceed 15% of Consolidated EBITDA in any Test Period (calculated before giving effect to this clause (vi)), (vii) any expenses incurred in connection with any actual or proposed Investment, incurrence, amendment or repayment of Indebtedness, issuance of Equity Interests or acquisition or disposition, in each case, outside the ordinary course of business for such period, (viii)\u00a0expenses incurred to the extent covered by indemnification provisions in any agreement in connection with an acquisition to the extent reimbursed in cash to the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries and such indemnification payments are not otherwise included in Consolidated Net Income, in each case, for such period, (ix)\u00a0proceeds received by the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries from any business interruption insurance to the extent such proceeds are not otherwise included in such Consolidated Net Income for such period, (x)\u00a0all other non-cash charges of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (xi) \\[RESERVED\\], and (xii)\u00a0any expenses associated with stock based compensation and (B)\u00a0subtracting therefrom (to the extent not otherwise deducted in determining Consolidated Net Income for such period)\u00a0(i) the amount of all cash payments or cash charges made (or incurred) by the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries for such period on account of any non-cash charges added back to Consolidated EBITDA pursuant to preceding sub-clause (A)(x) in a previous period and (ii)\u00a0any unusual or non-recurring cash gains. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that, to the extent any amounts are excluded from Consolidated Net Income by virtue of the proviso to the definition thereof contained herein, any add backs to Consolidated Net Income in determining Consolidated EBITDA as provided above shall be limited (or denied) in a fashion consistent with the proviso to the definition of Consolidated Net Income contained herein\n\nYowza. That's a mouthful, huh? So in this bullshit alphabet soup are some key phrases that we are going to look at to see how businesses can manipulate their YOY figures to appear a bit... better than they would be otherwise. There are your normal should be in there things too, but most is bullshit. Let's pick out the five big ones. My comments on how these can be manipulated are in ALL CAPS after each one.\n\n(1) Transaction costs (with respect to both closing date transactions and other permitted transactions) THIS BASICALLY MEANS THEY CAN SPEND HOWEVER MUCH MONEY THEY WANT ON WHATEVER THEY WANT AS LONG AS IT'S ALLOWED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THEY CAN ADD IT BACK. THEY CAN ALSO INCLUDE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LAWYERS (BECAUSE WE'RE EXPENSIVE), ACCOUNTANTS, CONSULTANTS, WITCH DOCTORS, STRIPPERS... YOU GET THE IDEA. THIS IS ONE WAY THAT CASHFLOW NEGATIVE COMPANIES CAN HAVE A POSITIVE EBITA - YOU SPEND EVERYTHING ON MORE SHIT AND YOU GET CREDITED FOR IT. TSLA ARE A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF A COMPANY THAT WOULD USE THIS ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT MODE. ALL THAT CRAZY SHIT ELON DOES THAT PISSES AWAY MONEY WOULD GO RIGHT HERE AS A CREDIT TO THE BUSINESS.\n\n(2) Cash restructuring charges / reserves (capped at 15% of EBITDA) DOWNSIZING, CONSOLIDATION, FURLOUGHING PEOPLE, PAYING TO GET PEOPLE KILLED - IF IT MEANS A CHANGE TO YOUR BUSINESS THAT INVOLVES MOVING PEOPLE AROUND OR GETTING RID OF THEM, YOU CAN ADD IT BACK HERE. SAME GOES FOR CASH RESERVES YOU'VE ESTABLISHED. GET A DOUBLE CREDIT FOR SPENDING **AND** NOT SPENDING MONEY!\n\n(3) Pro forma cost savings projected to be realized from any material business acquisition (exceeding &gt; of $60 million / 1% of total assets) THIS ONE IS ALWAYS FUNNY TO ME. THE IDEA IS THAT IF YOU BUY SOMETHING THAT COMPLEMENTS YOUR EXISTING BUSINESS, EVEN IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS ACTIVELY LOSING MONEY, YOU CAN GET A CREDIT FOR THE SYNERGIES IT WILL HAVE WITH YOUR EXISTING BUSINESS. COMBINE WITH ADDBACK (1) ABOVE FOR A REALLY GOO TIME - DOUBLE DIP ON BUYING CASH BURNING BUSINESSES AND JUST TELL PEOPLE IT'S SYNERGISTIC. WOO, FISCAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING!\n\n(4) extraordinary losses PRETTY MUCH WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. IF SOMETHING FEELS WEIRD TO YOU, YOU CAN PROBABLY ADD IT BACK HERE. THERE IS NO BASELINE FOR THIS. IT'S WHATEVER YOU WANT IT TO BE AT ANY POINT IN TIME AND THE BANK CAN'T STOP YOU.\n\n(5) unusual and/or non-recurring cash charges WHERE YOU CLAIM WRITEOFFS FOR YOUR CEO'S WIFE'S BOYFRIEND'S SECRET FAMILY IN OMAHA'S CHRISTMAS PRESENTS. YOU CAN SERIOUSLY USE THIS FOR WHATEVER YOU WANT AS LONG AS YOU CAN SAY IT'S (I) NOT SOMETHING YOU'D DO EVERY DAY AND (II) IT PROBABLY WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. INTERESTINGLY SOME BUSINESSES ARE TRYING TO CLAIM CORONA-RELATED CREDITS HERE TO STEER THEM THROUGH THIS EARNINGS SEASON WITHOUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH NEGATIVE EBITDA.\n\nThis is just $TSLA, and honestly their definition isn't even that complicated. Seriously - go to your favorite ticker's 10-K, find the credit agreement, and CTRL+F \"Consolidated EBITDA\" and \"Consolidated Net Income\". Try and read it for yourself and tell me if you think that makes up anything other than a shitty madlib - let alone a real performance metric for a business.\n\nAnyway. That's today's post. $LYV breakdown later in the week. $LULU on Friday.\n\nFuzzy",

        "selftext": "Jk, it\u2019s going to go down.\n\nFor those retards that have been here since 2018, you\u2019ll recall that I called for a V shape rebound in the December China growth scare sell off. I\u2019m usually a big fat bull (see flair), but I have to be realistic given the landscape.\n\nThe market will have a big pivot this week on Monday to trigger a new down move. Why?\n\n1. Market is out of steam - Thursday should have been much higher following the fed announcement. One of the largest packages in history met with a whimper +1.5% when the VIX is north of 40. What does that mean? At these levels, government support is, say it with me, PRICED IN. Yes, jobless claims numbers were bad but that was known.\n\n2. Banks announce next week, and the commentary will be awful - Look, everyone knows Q2 outlook will be shit except a lucky few (amzn, zoom, cost, etc.). Management is growing to throw everything and the kitchen sink because they have a free pass this quarter. However, the reality is they don\u2019t have visibility into later in the year, let along 2021. Who is going to stick their neck out and not speak grim death with unemployment rising to 20%? Earnings is where the rubber meets the road when all the macro/emotion driven swings subside, and the reality is no one can say with confidence what the E in PE will be going forward.\n\n3. Followup to point #2. Consensus numbers from Wall Street are literally retarded. 5% earnings decline in 2020 with a rebound to $170 on the SPX in 2021. I know the market expectations are for a worse 2020, but consensus is for 2021 to exceed 2019. Show me another recession, let alone one this sharp, rebounds like that. You think animal spirits of 2019 will be back later this year after all this? It\u2019s risk off and gradual rebuild for several years. 80% of layoffs / furloughs outside of effected industries will be permanent. Effected industries will downsize as well. Main Street businesses and consumers are wiped out. Risk off, everywhere.\n\nCould I be wrong? No, I can\u2019t. We\u2019re drilling on Monday after a higher open, bookmark this.\n\nFor you retards who were stubborn enough to hold your puts 3 weeks too early, congrats you finally made it to the other side.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "I just finished my watchlist after evaluating 300+ companies. It took me two weeks of full-time reading financials, calculate the maths and look up news around the companies for the last year. You don't have to take anything for granted, I'm not a professional analyst, just a guy with a lot of time and a decent look on financials. I'm not here for credit, I just think it might help some people and since it took a lot of time, it feels like a waste if I didn't share it. \n\nIt's a lot of tech, but I feel like it's also the way to go, especially during this crisis. I'm mostly staying away from the financial and real estate, but will invest more when there's a more clear image on the situation later this year. Healthcare, Industrial, Military and Energy are very dependent on political changes, so I'm also careful with those. Anyway, here we go.\n\n\\- ALPHABET -A-. Cash king, enough to pay off all their liabilities easily. Very nice growth over the years, even when they're so big. Most of the times, you see blue chips / market leaders stagnate, but not Google. Advertising will take a hit and there might be restrictions on online privacy in the upcoming years, but they are still very strong armed to take on those setbacks. \n\n\\- ARISTA NETWORKS. Same as Google, very strong financials, growth and cash position. Only negative, is that they had a growth setback in Q4 of last year, but nothing indicates it's gonna keep on decaying. They will keep on gaining market cap from Cisco. Very innovative management team with experience in networking. They create high performance cloud networks for big datacenters. Microsoft and Facebook are some of their biggest clients.\n\n\\- FACEBOOK. This is double, I feel like next two years is a make or break for Facebook. On one hand, they still need to improve a lot on AI and control on fake news. They had (and probably still have) privacy issues as well and they will lose a lot of advertising revenue this year. On the other hand, Facebook is expanding a lot to different parts of tech. They have Oculus coming out for VR and they just started with FB Gaming. It's also not only Facebook, but they own WhatsApp and Instagram as well. To me, those are great companies at the moment and have an insane amount of users. Their growth over the past 5 years was close to 300% and they are also cash heavy. \n\n\\- GALAPAGOS. To give you some numbers: in comparison to 2017, they increased revenue by 469%, while expenses only increased by 111%. In comparison to 2015, numbers are 1391% and 253%. Their cash position is double the total liabilities and 10 times their expenses in 2019. You might say they're very ready to take on this crisis. On the operational side, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases and they're backed by biotech giant Gilead Sciences. \n\n\\- INCYTE GENOMICS. Another biotech company with great financials. They even reduced expenses since 2017, while they generated 40% more revenue. This year, 25% more hedgefunds have bought into Incyte, making it a total of 46 hedgefunds who own shares in this company. There is also 17,10% of the company owned by insiders, which shows they strongly believe in their company as well. The average insider percentage of all companies in my watchlist will be 6-8%\n\n\\- LULULEMON ATHLETICA. Steady growth. Cult-like following with their fitness programs. It's a real millennial staple. Very strategic store openings as well. I see a lot of growth potential, especially when they can get some celebrity athletes to wear their clothing. That will make their young and hip image even bigger. Quality wise, they are way better than giants like Nike and Under Armour, which will also result in better image and growing customer fanbase. \n\n\\- MASTERCARD. Very big profit margins (57% last year). One of the least best on financials in this list, but indispensable with a heavy growing e-commerce. Some might rather look at Visa, but I feel like Mastercard is more innovative. They invested in AI-powered authentication and cybersecurity. They are also more used by fintech companies, which is a sector that also will only grow the next 5-10 years.\n\n\\- MICROSOFT. No brainer. Biggest company in the world. Since their new CEO, they're headed definitely in the right direction. Microsoft changed focus from hardware to cloud computing. The cloud services are still in their early year, I see an enormous growth potential. Also very big usage of Teams. It's a personal opinion, but with those quarantine restrictions, I feel like a lot of companies will realize letting their employees work from home has a lot of financial advantages, which will result in sale of more virtual working devices. \n\n\\- NVIDIA. Market leader on semiconductors, making chips that process AI mathematic operations. They didn't grow that much in the last 3 years, but they are very cash heavy and ready to invest in the future. They are invested in all the big things for the future. Cloud, data, AI, gaming,... Some say GPU's are the best investment for the next 5, 10, 25 years, since you will find them in literally everything. For example, it will become an essential part of self-driving cars. \n\n\\- VEEVA SYSTEMS. One of the youngest company in this list, specialized in cloud computing in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. Best of both world if you ask me. It's revenue is mostly based on subscriptions, so there are almost no surprised there. That's also the main reason why this stock is so expensive. They have beaten revenue expectations for 20 quarters in a row now. Innovative CEO, who will keep on searching to diversify and growing, getting more into data and programmatic advertising. Financial wise, they also have enough cash to pay off all their liabilities and to get through at least one year without any income.\n\nOne last thing: These companies are picked based on financials and future outlook, I didn't take value into account. I know companies like Lululemon Athletica and Veeva Systems are expensive, quite overvalued. I'm not buying into them right now, but maybe in the future.\n\nHope it helped at least one of you out there, enjoy the Easter weekend!\n\nTL;DR. Stonks only go up.",

        "selftext": "We are getting to the point in the rally where bears are beginning to really drop, having lost it all.  More posts are beginning to query people's mental health to ensure they don't so something stupid. Like this\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6uku3/i\\_may\\_have\\_lost\\_4m\\_but\\_the\\_fed\\_has\\_cost\\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6uku3/i_may_have_lost_4m_but_the_fed_has_cost_this/)\n\nThis has probably been posted before but **these things will fuck you**.  Banish that shit from your mind.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Assuming you would have sold at ATH\n\nYou see this all the time in crypto; *I bought in at 1 dollar and if only I held to $10,000 I would be a dickillionaire.*   [This comment has it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g76wkr/heavy_losses_since_nov_2019_from_tesla_shopify/fofai9k?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).\n\nDon't do this.  If you bought in at a dollar and you doubled your investment you likely would have sold.  Or possibly you would have sold at 3X or 5X.  The idea that you would have held on for 1000X is ludicrous.  Gambling is not for long term investment. Options are not for long term investment. You wouldn't have sold at ATH so stop giving your future self a reach around when present you is getting bummed. \n\n# Equating the money to the real world.\n\nPoker players know this rule inside out.  Inside out.  **It is not real world money**.  It stopped being real world money the minute you put it in play.  It is not 6 month's rent.  It is not school tuition.  If you think like that you will fuck yourself up and your decision making will be destroyed. \n\nSet aside the money.  Say I am willing to YOLO it.  If you cannot do that; then take the real-world money back out and slap yourself for suffering from FOMO.  Look in the mirror and say 'I nearly gave away this money to some cunt trying to bankrupt me.  Fuck FOMO and fuck them'. \n\nIt is not real world money.  If it was real world money, it would not be in Robin Hood or TOS. \n\n# Waking up every 2 mins to check your account\n\nSee above.  If this is stopping you from sleeping then your strategy and approach is fuk.  \n\nSet your stop losses or whatever and sleep soundly.  Market goes up and down; the only thing that should affect you is..***.did it hit my entry or exit point?***  That's it.  Until one of those things happens; who gives a fuck?  Enjoy memes and sleep. \n\n# Refusing to learn from the experience\n\nPrinciples.  Feedback loops.  If you lose money, take a few days to emotionally recover.  Then work out what happened and why.  The answer is never *the market*.  I have lost 60% of my bankroll being a bear but I have learned so much about the Federal Reserve and credit generation.  I will never make this mistake again. [https://www.aier.org/article/powells-new-monetary-regime/](https://www.aier.org/article/powells-new-monetary-regime/)\n\nA poster on this very forum said \"You have never seen a face-ripping rally like a bull rally out of a drop\".  Even u/variation-separate told WSB what would happen from 220 to 280.  \n\nYou paid for this so learn from it.  Are you an options trader, really?  Or are you a buy and hold investor in the wrong way of investing?  Or are you a penny stock picker in the wrong forum?  Have a real think.  \n\n# Most important...it is just fucking money.  That's all. It is nothing. \n\nInternalise that.  If a central bank can literally print it out of thin air through credit swaps; why would you hurt yourself over it?  Fuck that shit and fuck them.  And fuck everybody that got a problem with Mike Lowry.  Get up and take it to the max everyday. \n\n It is just money and as long you are not homeless and starving; fortunes can change in an instant.\n\n**Staying in the game (life) is more important than the scoreline.** All you need to do is die with a single dollar to have come out ahead. Personally I hope I am overdrawn at my bank... :-)\n\nYou can still cook a kick-ass meal, drink rum, hug your kids, enjoy the sun, all that shit.  As a kid my family was homeless 3 times.  People get through.  You live on peanut butter sandwiches for a month. \n\nStone Cold Steve Austin was down to his last 100 dollars and paid for a sack of potatoes and his gym membership to keep up his calories and routine.  Sylvester Stallone had to sell his fucking dog he was so poor and the Rock was down to his last 8 bucks.  Watch this video, shut the fuck up and come back strong.

        "selftext": "Alright, my bad everyone. This last post was really lazy, and I realize that I had nothing in there this morning after waking up, and seeing 43 comments making fun of a shitpost I labeled as DD.\n\n#LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN\n\nThe initial post had one image in it, and it was apparently only after that it showed no actual information.\n\n[Here's the full image](https://i.imgur.com/NJ6gs2r.png) - It's SPY, on the one day, and we're focusing on the apparent downturn on Friday.\n\nThe reason I'm saying this is going to be a downturn, is because this sentiment is shared with multiple other stocks in the S&amp;P and elsewhere:\n\n[Here's AMD in the same time period with no settings changed.](https://i.imgur.com/lSDnSmv.png) It appears further along in its downturn.\n\n[Here's Visa with the same downturn potential.](https://i.imgur.com/BjVeGPA.png)\n\n[Here's Microsoft](https://i.imgur.com/SK0YdlV.png)\n\n[Here's Apple](https://i.imgur.com/0BFDaR2.png)\n\n[Here's GM](https://i.imgur.com/bwoVCcW.png)\n\n[Here's JPM](https://i.imgur.com/YoY0QNK.png)\n\n[Here's GS](https://i.imgur.com/r6Jqjc4.png)\n\nWhat originally got me taking a look at this is the gobs macking nature of the market, and the \"how could this possibly be up right now\" ideation which everyone has. I started taking a look at downward trends, and tried it from a week out. The key answer is: It's not. On a weekly basis, the market sentiment [is absolutely down, and appears to be falling like a rock](https://i.imgur.com/FjQST1e.png)\n\nThere's nothing really substantial about the MACD settings I have in here. They're a little more sensitive close in, and I prefer over Wilders because It seems to better predict significant movements.\n\n[When drawing support lines](https://i.imgur.com/jwbMUc4.png), taking into account the high, and moving toward the low with the opposite channel, there's a definitive direction taking place. The lower bollinger is midway through the channel, with the low indicating SPY ~190.\n\n[The four hour MACD has already crossed as of Tuesday (May 31st)](https://i.imgur.com/jPURern.png), and once the daily follows, which I am presuming it will, things are going to go down significantly. I'm envisioning an opposite reaction with at least the same force as the [bull trap which was set up here.](https://i.imgur.com/Ktmgr6v.png)\n\nTaking a look at the scale, and time on the daily, it appears that by next Friday, SPY is going to be following its 4 hour downward. It could be even closer if the oil talks do not go well. If they do, this sentiment may be pushed off until the following week.\n\nI do not recommend anybody hold calls for outside next week. I do not recommend that anyone hold stocks past next week, unless they're bull ETFs.\n\nTo explain my sentiment, we're seeing decreasing volume on most stocks. I presume this is because everyone is of the same mind: this bull trend doesn't make sense. We're going to see more COVID deaths, company production is halted, and nothing is being manufactured. There's no way for cash injections to buoy a market which is literally producing nothing. Further, the price of oil will not either. The weekly sentiment is strong down, the 4 hour is peaking down, and this is across the board on all the stocks I've listed above. SPY will eventually follow the separate stock trends, and we're going to see some amazing losses.\n\nSuggested positions:\n\n   * [AAPL - 180p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/pYKw3fD.png)\n   * [AMD - 30p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/IIZYdVp.png)\n   * [JPM - 50p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/z5DzliZ.png)\n   * [SNE - 44p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/KEBLC4Z.png)\n   * [SPY - fuck, I dunno. Maybe 190p, but 180p maybe too - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/dtMWnZm.png)\n   * [DIS - 70p? 65p? 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/PMU1DfA.png)\n   * [YUM - 40p/35p 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/3T4OKS6.png)\n   * [ALLY - they're fucked. I dunno. 6p, 4p - 15 may?](https://i.imgur.com/70ojmh9.png)\n   * [C - 15p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/W4cqqaQ.png)\n   * [GS - 100p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/3k2IW9G.png)\n\n\nOn Ally - they're probably going to go bankrupt. Most of their business is auto loan servicing, something no one has any interest in paying when they're going to need food and need to pay rent. Further, the federal government has had no discussions about auto loan bailouts. I looked into their 10k which was released in Feb, and 5/6ths of their loans are for cars. Further, 40% of those loans were made to people with a sub-700 credit rating. They have been getting into the mortgage game, but it's a modicum of their portfolio. I don't think they're making it out of this year alive.\n\nWe're seeing a pattern here right? All of those images above - The sentiment across the market is clear: we're plumbing depths, and you almost can't fuck this up. Buy a put, make sure the strike price makes sense a little bit, and get. dat. cash.",

        "selftext": "TLDR; Read the bottom of the post\n\nYesterday, [I told you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyvnxt/what_happened_and_why_markets_seem_irrational/) about the events of the past few months and what it will mean for us in the near future. Well, since I had nothing better to do since we're all stuck in our houses for the next few months, I've decided to do another DD where we look back at the history of the stock market, 100-year trends, basic macro-economics, and how we could have SPY at 84 in the next few years.\n\n# A History of the Stock Market and the US Economy\n\n[DJI 1900 - 2020, log scale](https://preview.redd.it/ebvoys6w3as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b415f5f30739160a2e0e8fb855f7735dc2b02575)\n\nThe chart you see above is a log-scale graph of the Dow from 1900 to now. You\u2019ll notice that there\u2019s a long-term support line, which made contact in the depth of the Great Depression, and during the late 1970s. So what does this line represent?\n\nIn the short term, markets are pretty random and irrational. In the long term, stock prices usually reflect earnings, and thus stock indexes grow alongside the economy. The purple line you see here is the exponential growth of the economy\u2019s productivity (and inflation to a certain extent) since the 1900s in cycles of growth driven by technological innovation, with the expectation of growth accelerating the inflation of equity valuations, followed by a crisis changing the fundamentals of the economy, and finally stagnation.\n\n**Pre-1929 - Electrification**\n\nThe period of the beginning of the 1900s to 1930 saw the rise of electricity being used in industries and in households, along with mass production techniques. This led to the workforce being more efficient at making things, leading to an increase in earnings, GDP, and the stock market.\n\n**1930s to mid-1940s - Depression and War**\n\nWe all know what happened during these periods. The Great Depression, which eventually led World War II. What caused this? To this day, economists still argue about what exactly happened, but here\u2019s a simplified version of what most people can agree on.\n\nFirst, what causes a recession? Fundamentally, a recession happens when the supply and demand in the economy become mismatched. If you have a sudden decrease in a supply, we call this a supply shock. This usually happens with an important commodity that\u2019s important to the economy, like oil. We\u2019ll revisit this in the 1970s. A sudden increase in supply is also a supply shock and can also cause an economic decline, such as in Venezuela's case. But in the 1930s, this was a demand shock.\n\nThere was a decrease in demand after the roaring 20s due to the large amount of consumer debt that people took on to fund their new household appliances, like toasters. In other words, consumers and the economy overall was overleveraged. These debt cycles are a natural economic phenomenon, but the economic decline was exasperated by the Fed\u2019s poor decision making; they basically did the opposite of what they\u2019re doing right now. They raised interest rates in an attempt to preserve the dollar\u2019s value, and a liquidity crunch followed where everyone was trying to get their hands on dollars. This caused a deflationary spiral. Banks, with no actual backing from the Fed at this time, started having runs where customers demand to withdraw all their deposits. Since banks usually loan out most of their cash, many of them begin running out of cash and go under, causing more people to panic that they\u2019ll lose all of their deposits and causing more bank runs.\n\nThis depression eventually led to a decade of economic depression, followed by a devastating war that destroyed much of the world\u2019s economy and infrastructure - except for countries in the Americas.\n\n**Late-1940s to early 1970s - The post-war boom**\n\nThe golden age of capitalism. This time instead of it being driven by some new technology, it was a combination of increased global trade, Keynesian economics, and the fact that the US was one of the few countries that didn\u2019t have almost all productive capacity destroyed in WWII.\n\n**1970s - Stagflation**\n\nThis was a period of stagflation, with both high inflation and economic stagnation, and was caused by a supply shock. Specifically, OPEC decided to cut their supply of oil to the US because they didn\u2019t like their support of Israel. Higher oil prices mean higher prices to produce everything and less things being produced. The Fed meanwhile had no idea how to respond to this, since according to Keynesian theory, high inflation and high unemployment were impossible. When you have stagnation, you lower interest rates, but with inflation already rampant this makes a bad situation worse.\n\n**1980s - 2020 - The Information Age**\n\nThe most recent long-term economic boom is the result of improved efficiency from globalization, computers, and the internet. Except for a small blip in 2008 caused by some dumbasses on Wall Street thinking a diversified pool of mortgages to people with no income or assets deserve a AAA rating, the economy has been enjoying a period of consistent growth - but for how long?\n\n**2020 - 2030 - Stagnation?**\n\nThere\u2019s a good argument here that we\u2019re at the top of the long-term business cycle, and that the GDP growth in the recent years has not been from increased productivity but fueled by debt and low interest rates. Think about it - it's been over 10 years since the last recession. Yet, throughout this entire time, the Fed rate has been held to effectively 0 and the government has been maintaining a deficit like we\u2019re still in the 2008 recession.\n\n[Fed funds rate, 1960 - 2020](https://preview.redd.it/05b1ain56as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=126897b35b6d72adce6abe047dc395699abb6732)\n\n[US govt. surplus \\/ deficit](https://preview.redd.it/ywmsfco66as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43cdfcb1d0dfdb820c9e5441b1505ce8c2a898b2)\n\nEven with all this stimulus going on, the GDP is struggling to even get to 3%. If we didn\u2019t have artificially low interest rates and high federal deficits masking the GDP growth numbers, we\u2019d be seeing the US economy slowly head towards yet another period of stagnation. In fact, there\u2019s another very large country that experienced this - Japan.\n\n# Japan - The Economy of the Future\n\n[Bank of Japan interest rates](https://preview.redd.it/v6qj5fhg6as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84cdbd023744e6ff606543bceaba2369cc98b507)\n\n[Japanese Government surplus \\/ deficits](https://preview.redd.it/42za9ewh6as41.png?width=1410&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59f22284c6e2e8292d08ea66f8cc77cad7ed940a)\n\nAfter nearly two decades of low interest rates and budget deficits, Japan can barely get their real GDP growth above 2%.\n\n[Japan GDP](https://preview.redd.it/73v8b9sp6as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b54891a9f59801599f0086b8f799bbdc463682ff)\n\nLet\u2019s look at how the Japanese stock market is doing during this time.\n\n[Nikkei 225, 1980 - 2020](https://preview.redd.it/h0gtdxhr6as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9f4b878d85a18eebc01575a21904c5a03b34a25)\n\nWhat you\u2019re seeing here is the Nikkei 225 growing to its peak in 1990, crashing, and then never recovering to its previous highs. The Lost Score (20 years). But why didn\u2019t it ever recover? Don\u2019t stonks and the economy only go up in the long run?\n\nIn the late 1980s, Japan experienced an asset bubble fueled by **uncontrolled money supply and credit expansion**, overheating the asset market. They started to even start to buy corporate bonds in 2009 and buy stocks in 2010 out of desperation. Huh, this sounds pretty similar to what the Fed is doing right now.\n\n[Japanese Yen Inflation Rate](https://preview.redd.it/oftsdxex6as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfd500c5f8ac4395f4506a0933361767a233dca7)\n\nWhy did they do this? Because they were so reckless in their monetary easing policies that when the asset bubble popped and people stopped spending as much money due to the wealth effect. The Bank of Japan couldn\u2019t do anything to get people to spend money again, having already overheated their markets, and Japan went to two decades of deflation. They\u2019ve caused a **liquidity trap**.\n\nThe Bank of Japan and Japanese government has done everything to try to keep their GDP growing despite nothing actually driving it. Any productivity gains they would have gotten from the adoption of information technology was overshadowed by the decline of their automotive and electronics industries as they became less competitive with the rise of the Asian Tigers, and eventually China.\n\nHistory doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes. We\u2019ve seen that the US economy go into economic stagnation in the past, and modern economies are still in economic stagnation, with nothing except for unsustainable central bank money printing and government debt driving GDP growth. We\u2019ve also seen stock prices rise to new highs, despite nothing fundamentally changing in the real economy justifying the productivity growth across every industry. Low interest rates have also made stock buybacks the norm, with some companies like $PLAY levering themselves to buy back $630M of its own shares in 2019. Their market cap on Jan 1 2020 was around $1.2B. Are we in an asset bubble?\n\n# The Stock Market Bubble\n\nWell, what is an asset bubble? It\u2019s when asset prices surge beyond what the fundamentals of them warrant it. It\u2019s when investors become irrational in their valuation, and assume that the price of an asset will continue to go up in the future with no fundamental reasons justifying why it will other than that\u2019s what happened in the past. People on r/investing start telling people that they should \u201cDollar Cost Average\u201d into the markets when they go down because stocks will go back to new ATHs in a few years.\n\nEven with the argument that stocks will rebound in the near term to new ATHs because that\u2019s what happened in the past, this is only true if you don\u2019t look at data past 50 years ago and you pretend the US stock exchanges are the only ones in the world. Look at what happened in the 1970s. The Dow didn\u2019t make new significant highs in between 1966 and 1982. That\u2019s 16 years. If you account for the high inflation going on at this time, you would have been slowly losing money in real terms. Even more recently, look at the stock market in Japan. 30 years later and the Nikkei 225 still hasn\u2019t recovered to its previous highs. Imaging DCA-ing into that decline. Meanwhile in Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 hasn\u2019t come anywhere close to their 2000 highs from 20 years ago. The idea that the stock market will fundamentally always go up in a time span of a decade, which is the mainstream belief touted by every financial advisor and finance gurus is flawed; history and almost every major country\u2019s stock markets show this.\n\n[Euro Stoxx 50, 1990 - 2020](https://preview.redd.it/yupt7ozt7as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0837c4aff8dd7eb088d28647547d7e7d72d2bcc5)\n\nHow can we tell if we\u2019re in a bubble? Let\u2019s look at the fundamentals of stocks, and what should be driving the true valuation of them - Earnings.\n\n[S&amp;P500 Shiller PE ratio](https://preview.redd.it/gobstuyy7as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96143d6870fdb9c02293bcb6f29a7c069f36a6ec)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know if you\u2019re in a bubble until it bursts.\n\n**The Bottom**\n\nThe US economy is being driven by debt and consumer confidence. What happens when a black swan event happens that causes a supply shock by locking down supply chains, a demand shock by not allowing the service economy to operate, and another supply shock in the opposite direction happens in oil, because OPEC? Uncertainty and consumer confidence and spending to go down. After a decade of easy money, it might be hard for the Fed to do anything to restart consumer confidence, even years after COVID-19 is eradicated.\n\nLet\u2019s look back at the long term resistance in the Dow. If we do go into a decade-long deflationary spiral like Japan, we might be on our way to making contact with it, but it will be a slow, multi-year decline. If it takes 3 years to reach the 100-year trend, that will be the DJI declining to 10000 by 2023. That looks bad right? Let\u2019s calculate what a bottom would look like using another method. During the last two periods of long-term stagnation (1930s and 1970s), we saw the Shiller PE ratio of the S&amp;P500 drop down to 8 at the lowest levels. Today it is at 26. Even with pre-lockdown earnings, when the economy was in \u201cgreat shape\u201d, with low unemployment and high consumer confidence, this would represent a 70% decline in stock valuations, leaving us with the Dow at 7000 and S&amp;P500 at 840. Even going to the historic mean of 17, we should be seeing at least a 35% decline with the Dow at 15400 and S&amp;P500 at 1800.\n\nIn other words, as stock valuations cool down toward normal levels, we\u2019re likely going to see the Dow go to somewhere between 7000 and 15400, and the S&amp;P500 go somewhere between 1800 and 840 in the next few years.\n\n[\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bhat](https://preview.redd.it/qafgn26m8as41.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7227447a2f129e6871e73832472e75b1880ba032)\n\nTLDR; Read the title\n\nEDIT - Turns out you can't buy 2025 puts in Robinhood, so SPY 12/16/2022 175p\n\nInteresting video that goes a bit more in depth about the debt-driven growth of the US economy and stock market, and the liquidity trap its in - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Loj0z43VZ7I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Loj0z43VZ7I)\n\nEDIT2 - u/fancykevin00 brought up an interesting graphic showing the trend with the Fed increasing their balance sheet (QE) and what happened in the stock market during that time - [https://i.imgur.com/3NLR9rx.png](https://i.imgur.com/3NLR9rx.png)",

        "selftext": "I don't think this is a normal recession-recovery situation. It's not a business event. It's a completely artificial event. That means that looking at how this is going to unfold in terms of past recessions \u2014 and particularly a lot of people are going back to the Great Recession about a decade ago \u2014 is probably not going to provide much in the way of useful guidance, at least that's my opinion.\n\nThe worst weeks for unemployment in U.S. history were recorded over the past three weeks: 3.3 million were reported on March 21, 6.9 million on March 28 and 6.6 million on April 4. Before the pandemic, the previous worst unemployment week was recorded in October 1982 when 695,000 people filed jobless claims.\n\nI wanted to share some insights / stats with you and get your opinions.\n\nThe best-case scenario for the COVID crisis is a V-shaped recession. If this happens, the economy will rebound as quickly as it has declined, with minimal long-lasting financial damage. A sharp downturn followed by a quick rebound in growth defines the V-shaped recession. For the COVID-19 recession to be V-shaped, we would need to set up enough coronavirus testing so that people could safely go back to work without creating another surge in cases, and effectively treat existing cases. Around 38% of companies believe that the recovery will be V-shaped, with the economy rebounding by the third quarter of 2020, according to a survey from EY.\n\nIf COVID-19 causes a longer, U-shaped recovery, that could mean the economy wouldn\u2019t begin recovering until the end of 2020 or even early 2021. EY found that 54% of companies believe that a U-shaped recession is likely. \n\nThose arguing for the V-shaped recovery are making two wildly unrealistic assumptions. One, we re-open the economy pretty much all at once, and two, consumers won\u2019t change their behaviors. For example, they start going back to bars and baseball games immediately.\n\nI just sold most of my indices and am thinking about shorting S&amp;P500. The recent rise in the equity indices appears based more on FOMO than on medical developments for dealing with the pandemic. I suspect markets will test previous lows set in March, similar to 2008-2009. \n\nWhat do you think about an upcoming recession, and about the steps needed for a economic recovery?",

As promised on \\[Friday\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu7dmg/everything\\_you\\_always\\_wanted\\_to\\_know\\_about\\_swaps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu7dmg/everything_you_always_wanted_to_know_about_swaps/)), today in the neighborhood we're going to be working through a full breakdown of everybody's favorite low-rent purveyor of curly fries, pinball and sticky-carpeted sadness - Dave &amp; Busters ($PLAY), as suggested by \\[u/leonardnimoyNC1701\\]([https://www.reddit.com/user/leonardnimoyNC1701/](https://www.reddit.com/user/leonardnimoyNC1701/)). Sadly, the question of whether he's a $PLAY bagholder or just a big fan of Street Fighter 2 and shitty beer remains unanswered. Anyway, let's do this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple of reminders for the first time readers and slow learners in the audience (which I imagine applies to most, if not all of you):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I will answer any legitimate question I get asked about the post, no matter how stupid (as long as it is sincere or at least funny). Sometimes it takes me a couple of days but I get around to everybody eventually. I do this because getting flamed by someone who knows what they're talking about is the only way to learn - it's how I learned, and it works. \\*\\*But remember - I don't give advice for free\\*\\*. So please don't ask me what to buy (long $ONIONS), if your 95% OTM option is fucked (almost certainly, unless you're long $BA) or for a strike/exp ($SPY 69p 4/20 blaze it) because I'll just have to repeat that in the comments and you'll look like a big dummy.\n2. The fact that I am posting this is not indicative of any view I have on D&amp;B one way or the other; this was just the most upvoted ticker in Friday's post. I do this shit because (i) I enjoy it and (ii) I want you retards to learn how to do your own legwork.\n3. Most upvoted ticker / financial concept in the comments will get the next breakdown. This will likely be market open Monday \\*\\*next week\\*\\* as I have some more basic financial literacy I'd like to ram down your throats before then.\n4. Finally, and perhaps most importantly - u/pokimane. Girl, WSB is getting a little crazy. Why don't you and me get out of here; my offer to tell you which stonks to buy remains open (as do my DMs).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOK - on with the show. This is actually a pretty interesting case study; D&amp;B have in the last month (i) successfully warded off some adverse interest from KKR  (ii) closed all their locations (iii) lost 90% of their equity value and (iv) against all odds, smashed earnings. Plus, like many of you bagholding autists, as a result of the current market they've also had to open themselves up to taking some deep PIPE - although in their case, that stands for a Public Investment in Private Equity (rather than the more... literal version of 'pipe' that ends with you, your desperation finance OnlyFans channel, and that one 'won't take no for an answer' subscriber named Chuck). Don't worry; I'll explain all of this as we go along (other than the Chuck thing).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR\\*\\* ? Fuck you. This will take you 10 minutes at most to work through and you'll learn something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay. Ready? Let's do this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*1.\\*\\* \\*\\*Things You'll Need To Play Along At Home\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* \\[D&amp;B Credit Agreement\\]([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1525769/000114420417044736/v473864\\_ex10-1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1525769/000114420417044736/v473864_ex10-1.htm))\n\n\\* \\[D&amp;B 10-K\\]([https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1525769/000119312520098060/d832311d10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1525769/000119312520098060/d832311d10k.htm))\n\n\\* \\[Some music\\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLTm5NlcgOw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLTm5NlcgOw))\n\n\\* A drink (at this time in the morning, it may be some coffee; that said, Fuzzy don't judge).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*2. High Score? D&amp;B Target Review\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs always, it's important to understand the entity you're considering when you're doing a breakdown like  this. So, D&amp;B run all-in-one restaurants / bars / arcades; they've got 136 locations in 39 states. That's it. Not exactly a diversified business model, but hey, whatever works. The revenue breakdown is like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* Food - 28% of revenue OKAY\n\n\\* Booze - 13% of revenue WOULD HAVE THOUGHT BOOZE WOULD MAKE UP MORE AS IT'S TYPICALLY A HIGHER MARGIN IN HOSPO BUSINESSES\n\n\\* Arcade games - \\*\\*58% of revenue\\*\\*.  HOLY SHIT, THAT'S A LOT OF PINBALL. THE SPLIT HERE IS 72% TICKET GAMES ('REDEMPTION GAMES - THOSE PLAY TO WIN TICKETS THINGS LIKE WHACK-A-MOLE), 27% NON-REDEMPTION GAMES (VR, SHOOTERS, ETC) AND 1% BILLIARDS AND BOWLING. THIS IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD SPLIT AS THE REDEMPTION GAMES ARE A CIRCULAR ECONOMY - THE PRIZES YOU WIN ARE BOUGHT BY D&amp;B WHOLESALE AND PRICED THROUGH THE ROOF I.E. THE TOTAL REDEMPTION VALUE OF TICKETS WON FAR EXCEEDS THE RETAIL PRICE OF THE ITEM YOU'RE PAYING THEM FOR.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOK. So the takeaway here is that no money is coming in other than in the pockets of people who walk through the front doors of each store. Before we dive into this, let's look at why they had an earnings pop (reporting Q4 and FY 2019, \\*\\*not\\*\\* Q1 2020):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* Total revenues increased 7.1% to $1.355 bn from $1.265 THAT'S A GOOD YEAR\n\n\\* Number of stores increased 12.4% to 136 from 121 AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION MEANS A LOT OF POTENTIALLY WEAK / CASHFLOW NEGATIVE OR NEUTRAL LOCATIONS\n\n\\* Comparable store sales decreased 2.6% OKAY. THESE GUYS ARE PROBABLY THE DOMINANT PLAYER IN THEIR CATEGORY ANYWAY.\n\n\\* Net FY 2019 income totaled $100.3 m, or $2.94 per diluted share (they have 34.1 million shares outstanding), vs. net FY 2018 income of $117.2 million, or $2.93 per diluted share (40.0 million shares outstanding) OKAY\n\n\\* EBITDA increased less than 1% to $280.5 million from $279.3 million LIKE I'VE EXPLAINED BEFORE, EBITDA IS NOT ACTUALLY A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF COMPANY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE BECAUSE OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PERMITS IT TO BE CALCULATED. HERE, THEY TOOK (AMONG OTHER THINGS) A $7M WRITEDOWN IN EXECUTIVE STOCK OPTIONS AND A $1.183M WRITEDOWN IN ASSET DISPOSAL (EVEN THOUGH THEY ONLY CLOSED ONE LOCATION IN FY2019), AND A $20M WRITEDOWN FOR 'OTHER COSTS'. RIIIGHT.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what we can see here is a business operating an aggressive expansion strategy that leases almost all of its locations and is operating on a pretty thin margin. Good earnings caused a pop on the equity price but that was for a non-corona quarter and they'd already lost 90% of the value of the shares. I wonder what effect the ol' bat flu is going to have on their business? Well, we already know they laid off 90% of their employees - let's see what else they've got planned:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;\"We cannot predict how soon we will be able to reopen our stores and, as, our ability to reopen will depend in part on the actions of a number of governmental bodies over which we have no control. Moreover, once restrictions are lifted, it is unclear how quickly customers will return to our stores, which may be a function of continued concerns over safety and/or depressed consumer sentiment due to adverse economic conditions, including job losses. Considering the significant uncertainty as to when we can reopen some or all of our stores and the uncertain customer demand environment, in addition to the actions described above, we:\n\n\\&gt;\n\n\\&gt;\u2022have begun discussions with our landlords, vendors, and other business partners to reduce our lease and contract payments and obtain other concessions;\n\n\\&gt;\n\n\\&gt;\u2022are in discussion with our lenders to obtain covenant relief to avoid events of default; and\n\n\\&gt;\n\n\\&gt;\u2022are in active dialogue with multiple potential investors to secure additional sources of financing.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds super healthy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Teaching moment\\*\\*. Here's a really important part  that would be easy to skip over. Like I've explained before, when you sign up to a Credit Agreement, it comes with a lot of rules. You have to do certain things at certain times in order to keep your banks happy. If you break them, bad things happen. So when you know you're not going to be able to comply, you need to get a waiver. Anyway, one of those rules is delivering them a set of audited financials every year. Seems like D&amp;B had a preliminary conversation with their auditors that... did not go well. How can we tell? Well, in February they sought a waiver of the obligation to deliver these financials to their lenders this year. Why would they do that? The auditor's main job is to tell you that the business is capable of operating as a 'going concern'; i.e., that everything is in order and they're not about to go under. So D&amp;B wrote to their banks and asked... not to send this. They spell it out for you in the 10-K:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;While our lenders have granted a waiver of any event of default associated with receiving an auditor\u2019s report \\*\\*indicating a substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern\\*\\* in connection with our year-end audit,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey go on to talk about how if they didn't get a waiver they would have had to file for Chapter 11. Now, they did get a waiver, so Ch. 11 isn't incoming, but it's important info to realize how precarious the situation of this business is. They have $\\*\\*99,000,000\\*\\* cash on hand, no revenue, continuing lease expenditures, and about $750 million debt exposure. That's..... bad. They also are getting clipped about $5.5 million a quarter on interest payments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*3. Do They Have Extra Lives? A D&amp;B Debt Breakdown\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nD&amp;B actually have a pretty basic debt structure. They currently have $266.5m outstanding under the TL (10-k, cross-ref the definition of \"Term Loan Commitments\") and the full $500m drawn under the revolver (8-k in March, cross-ref \"Revolving Credit Commitments\"). As of Feb the spread on the loans was L+150 (10-K) but the full draw on the revolver will have pushed their latest borrowings to L+200 as they've now exceeded their leverage step-downs ratios (see the definition of \"Applicable Margin\" in the Credit Agreement, cross ref definition of \"Total Leverage Ratio\"). You can calculate total leverage for $PLAY like this: \\*\\*Total funded debt\\*\\* \\*\\*\\*minus\\*\\*\\* \\*\\*cash\\*\\* \\*\\*\\*divided by\\*\\*\\* \\*\\*EBTIDA\\*\\* (see definition of \"Total Leverage Ratio\")\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe facility is maturing in Feb 2022; so they've got 18 months to pull together nearly $800 million in interest and repayments. Hmm. Sounds like they'll be needing some cash soon. Well, we know they've tapped out their revolver; so that's gone (and they couldn't draw that to repay the TL anyway as they mature at the same time plus there are restrictions on use of proceeds in the Credit Agreement for things like this). The big question here is what kind of additional debt they can incur under the facility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs we discussed in our $SEAS and $F breakdowns, credit agreements permit you to go out and incur additional debt only under certain circumstances, using dedicated 'baskets' found in the negative covenants of the document. Normally these have their own dedicated section but this CA has a bit of a weird structure so they're lumped in with all the other covenants. You can find them in Section 8.7 (\\*Borrowings\\*).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe key baskets we're looking for come in three categories: (i) incremental debt (debt that can be incurred \\*outside\\* of the facility (ii) general basket debt (this is known as a 'freebie' or 'dollar' basket and is just straight up debt they can incur without getting permission from the banks (iii) ratio debt (debt they can incur when they are in compliance with a certain leverage ratio). Let's work through them one by one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Incremental Debt\\* \\\\- Let's go to Section 1.16. You can see here that they can incur \"New Term Loans\" (incremental debt) in an amount up to $\\*\\*150m + as much as they want provided they're in in compliance with a secured leverage ratio of 2.50:1.00\\*\\*. They've blown through this so we can safely say this debt incurrence is capped at $150m. There are a couple of other random more technical builders related to cash-flow sweeps and declined proceeds which I won't go into, but I'm listing them here to be complete.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*General Basket -\\* Back to Section 8. See if you can spot the general basket. It's in (k). The cap here is the greater of (i) $20 million and (ii) 10% of the EBITDA. 10% of EBITDA is bigger here, so it's about $28 million.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Ratio Basket\\* \\\\- Unlimited capacity subject to Total Leverage Ratio compliance of 3.50:1.00. They're justttttt in compliance with this so they can tap some of this basket if they wanted to. This is in section 8.07(n).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey're also dealing with a 'financial covenant' that requires them to be in compliance with a Total Leverage Ratio of 3.50:1.00 and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.25:1.00. They are 99% likely to seek relief from these covenants even though they're currently in compliance (because their EBITDA is going to fall dramatically) and they indicate in the 10-K they're already exploring this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*4. $PLAY Wants The $PIPE\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we can see that $PLAY is limited in terms of its debt flexibility and they're going to need some more money to keep going. Now, earlier in the month they resisted some adverse interest from private equity buyers by adopting \\[a new shareholder rights plan (\\]([https://www.marketscreener.com/DAVE-BUSTER-S-ENTERTAIN-11659849/news/DAVE-BUSTER-S-ENTERTAINMENT-INC-ADOPTS-LIMITED-DURATION-SHAREHOLDER-RIGHTS-PLAN-30189266/](https://www.marketscreener.com/DAVE-BUSTER-S-ENTERTAIN-11659849/news/DAVE-BUSTER-S-ENTERTAINMENT-INC-ADOPTS-LIMITED-DURATION-SHAREHOLDER-RIGHTS-PLAN-30189266/))commonly known as a 'poison pill') which attempts to limit the amount of shares that can be owned by a single buyer by forcing them to pay double the market price once they reach a certain ownership threshold (here, it's 15%). This forces anyone who wants to deal with a potential $PLAY acquisition to play nice with the board rather than just try and buy up common at the discount corona-prices. Think about it like the fat friend at the bar. It's there to prevent the cute, distressed opportunity from getting into more trouble than it should. Even though $PLAY wants more cash, it wants to get it on its own terms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut now, $PLAY's sobered up, and, with the security blanket plan in place - surprise - they've dolled themselves up, put on their cutest outfit, and they're out trawling for investments. What they're exploring is referred to as a PIPE - public investment in private equity. This is a pretty ballsy move and its often referred to as financing of last resort because it's risky and expensive; it involves $PLAY putting together a block of preferred equity priced substantially below par, couple it with warrants or other securities, and then sell it to a single investor. This puts them in bed with that investor for a while and pisses off the common stock holders, \\*\\*but\\*\\* can have the effect of driving up price of common due to renewed interest in the long term prospects of the business (plus provides the obvious benefit of a short term cashflow injection).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason that PIPEs can provide a short term boost is because the unregistered pref shares are relatively illiquid - once the investor buys them, they're hard to trade for a little while. This indicates that (i) smart money sees a bottom in the price of the common and (ii) believes that there's long term value in the asset. This is going to be a pretty popular form of financing for the next few months given the number of distressed entities who will have difficulty refinancing their debt without exorbitant rates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat said, the issue of involving yourself with PE investors who will want a say in the operation of the business is substantially different than involving yourself with hands off bankers just looking for long term returns. It's like \\[taking Greek government bonds as collateral\\]([https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-ecb-greece/update-1-greeces-borrowing-costs-fall-after-inclusion-in-ecbs-package-idUSL8N2BC3VA](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-ecb-greece/update-1-greeces-borrowing-costs-fall-after-inclusion-in-ecbs-package-idUSL8N2BC3VA)) (lol) - it's a risky business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUse your noodle and consider all your options given the above information. Good luck out there.",

        "selftext": "Many of you are giddy at the possibility of a v shaped recovery a la Gilead's remdesivir. To burst your drug-fueled bubble, and comfort my dying putfolio, this will not save the economy in time.\n\nEven if Gilead can improve their rate of production to the optimistic timeline for at  scale production of 6-8 months, the availability will rapidly gobbled up by those nearest to death and then only to fill up stockpiles before common use. After a month of treating and finally releasing those nearest to death, they'll still have to deal with the surge of impending hospitalizations from anti maskers, and communities even more retarded than wsb. Demand for the drug will either send its price into the stratosphere, or price control measures will ensure that the drug is not available to the average retard for at least a year. \n\nThe point is that until they have a stockpile of remdesivir or a vaccine or tracking, there are no profitable movie theaters, amusement parks, air travel, etc. \n\nWhen will there be a stockpile? My complete speculation is that it will take 6-8 months (Gilead's own estimate) to make round one of production, which will not be enough to treat everyone who needs it. Keep in mind that many synthesis steps have to be done by trained professionals with at least bachelor degrees (in fucking organic chemistry jesus), so you can't just throw money at it because there's a shortage of qualified employees for this physically and mentally challenging job. It will takes months more to produce and distribute enough so that the growth in remdesivir reserves match the growth rate of the virus, and perhaps longer to surpass it. \n\nObviously some state economies will partially open before then, but many sectors with slim margins and big crowds will be hurting for the next year while pharma catches up with the virus.",

Adjusting for population that would equate to 1,6\u201d jobs added in one month. We have no idea how the job market will act once restrictions begin to lift but it would be reasonable to assume we get an initial boom in employment followed by a slower pace.\n\nJust for fun, let\u2019s do some massive assumptions:\n\nJob losses stops at 30\u201d (two more weeks of losses.. that is optimistic in other words) \n\nInitial boom is 10\u201d for the first month\n4\u201d second month\n3\u201d third month\n2\u201d fourth\n1,6\u201d fifth\nThis leaves us with 9,4\u201d still unemployed\nFollow that up with a slower but still accelerated pace of 400k/month on average it would take an additional 24 months to get back.\nAll in all 29 months to get back to 4% unemployment\n\nSo what does this tell us? **Even if we \u201conly\u201d get another 8\u201d jobs lost AND the first five months have an average 12,5x ***(10+4+3+2+1,6=20,6/1,6=12,5)* **the previous RECORD monthly job growth we could still be looking at 2,5 years before we are back at previous levels...**. And those are optimistic numbers I would argue.\n\nThis at the same time as the rest of the world is trying to do the same. Way more added debt on corporate and national level from already record highs. Fear/caution regarding a second wave. A consumer that dramatically increases their savings-rate (paying off debt / regular savings) as always happens after a crisis. All of this in an economy (the US) that is 70% consumer driven.\n\nTLDR: it\u2019s fucked up. A depression scenario is the most likely for a few years.

        "selftext": "Good afternoon Autists.  I had an epiphany last week while compulsively refreshing my dwindling portfolio that has resulted in a dramatic shift in my trading strategies, I'd like to share it with you.  Full disclosure:  I am not a lawyer, accountant, financial expert, or any person of authority to speak on this matter.  Just some retard with too much time on his hands.  \n\nIt\u2019s been said over and over that the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.  But who defines \u201cirrationality\u201d?  If we go out to get ice cream and I tell you I don\u2019t want any, you might think I\u2019m being irrational because who the fuck doesn\u2019t like ice cream.  That might change when you find out that I\u2019m actually lactose intolerant.  Yes my insides are bitch made but you don\u2019t want me blasting the interior of your Model X with diarrhea as they reject the frozen dairy desert we had previously just enjoyed.  My abstention is now rational because you\u2019ve modified your expectations of what a normal person would do when presented with ice cream.  \n\n**\u201cCool dude, this is both gay and irrelevant.  Strike and expiration or GTFO\u201d**  \n\n\nWe\u2019ll get there.  But first let\u2019s talk about the current market and why I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s acting irrationally:  \n\nI put forth the following theory:  **The Trump Administration is actively engaged in a criminal conspiracy to bribe key figures into keeping the market afloat, forcing a V shaped recovery and maybe even revisiting ATHs.**   \n\n\nIt\u2019s no secret Trump has tied his entire reelection campaign to the economy.  Without the stock market booming his reelection campaign [has nothing else to fall back on](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-campaign-forced-shelve-2020-ad-blitz-touting-economy-because-coronavirus-pandemic-1494583).  Additionally Trump has very likely committed numerous felonies [prior to]( https://www.vox.com/2019/2/27/18243038/individual-1-cohen-trump-mueller) and [during]( https://theintercept.com/2019/10/10/trump-crimes-law/) his stint in office, both at the State and Federal level, which highlight the importance of his reelection.  He will almost certainly face invasive criminal investigation and quite possibly indictment the second he leaves office and is [no longer protected by the Office of the Presidency]( https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/sitting-president%E2%80%99s-amenability-indictment-and-criminal-prosecution).  \n\n\nHis foreign policy is trash, he\u2019s passed no landmark legislation to pin his name to, the wall was never built, Hillary has yet to be locked up, and now the big players are at risk of a huge financial hit if he can\u2019t get this thing turned around.  And let\u2019s be real, that last point is only one that really matters.  \n\n\nSo how do we make the jump from \u201cTrump needs good economy\u201d to \u201cyour puts will die because the market is perfectly rational\u201d?  \n\nEnter William Barr.  \n\nThe US Attorney General has taken a central role in [carrying out Trump\u2019s nefarious plans and shielding him from repercussion]( https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/01/20/william-barr-trumps-sword-and-shield).  He has gotten himself involved in numerous schemes outside the normal  jurisdiction of the Justice Department with [one instance]( https://www.npr.org/2019/10/03/766927045/how-attorney-general-barr-ended-up-at-the-center-of-the-ukraine-controversy) even leading  to Trump\u2019s impeachment and subsequent party-line acquittal.   \n\n\nYou may have found it bizarre that Billy Boy joined the President at his March 23rd COVID-19 Task Force Briefing, but probably waived it off as another sycophant fluffing his way into the President\u2019s good graces.  However, if there is one person in this administration who does not need Trump\u2019s approval to keep his job it\u2019s William Barr.  He\u2019s on a very exclusive list of people who told Trump to [kiss his balls]( https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raises-possibility-of-suing-those-involved-in-prosecuting-roger-stone/2020/02/18/238279fc-5250-11ea-9e47-59804be1dcfb_story.html) and still kept his job and subsequent power.  Power that he\u2019s glad to wield on behalf of Trump, so long as Trump himself stays the fuck out of his way.  \n\n\nSo why was Barr up there on the 23rd?  Was he going to announce charges against vendors in the Chinese wet markets?  Institute martial law to keep people in quarantine?  You can read the transcript of the briefing [here]( https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-9/) but the TL;DR boils down to \u201cwe\u2019re cracking down on hoarding supplies\u201d.  So the nation\u2019s top prosecutor, who essentially calls his own shots, was dragged on stage to give a meaningless update on a problem that was already being solved by simply [intercepting supplies destined for other nations]( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/mask-wars-coronavirus-outbidding-demand#maincontent).  Or, even more simply, by not giving a fuck.  \n\nDo you believe that?  Because I don\u2019t.  \n\nOn the contrary, I believe Bill Barr\u2019s presence at the meeting was as *power move*, meant as a display to MMs and Business Leaders that the Attorney General was now on board.  Let me play out a hypothetical scenario for you:  \n\nTrump, knowing he\u2019s fucked, approaches these folks with an ultimatum.  \u201cPlay along and I\u2019ll take care of you like no one else ever has.  It\u2019ll be the best quid pro quo in the history of this country, trust me.  Don\u2019t fight it or else you\u2019ll be very sorry\u201d.  \n\n\u201cFuck\u201d the MM\u2019s think.  \u201cThis dipshit has no idea what he\u2019s doing.  He\u2019ll destroy the market and get us all locked up.  Do we play along and let this ride, or cover our asses the best we can?\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cUnlimited QE and I\u2019ll buy your Junk Bonds\u201d says JPow  \n\n\u201c$2T Bailout with more to come\u201d says Mitch McConnell  \n\n*\u201dBarr will protect you\u201d assures DJT*  \n\n\nThat last one though, what assurances could Barr possibly offer?  He\u2019s not the head of the SEC, the Treasury, or the IRS.   \n\n\n[Turns out the SEC has no criminal authority]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission#Divisions) and can only refer charges to the DOJ, headed by Barr\n\n[Same thing with the IRS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRS_Criminal_Investigation_Division#Investigative_process)  \n\n[And the enforcement arms of the Treasury] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury#2003_Reorganization) (Bonus, Barr\u2019s own daughter landed a job at FinCEN in February of last year)  \n\n\nSo if you were worried about getting involved with DJT and his backroom bullshit, Barr\u2019s presence in that backroom would be quite the reassurance given his [propensity to make small annoyances like written law disappear]( https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-moves-to-drop-charges-ira-russians-indicted-mueller-2020-3) when they get in the way a good time.  Similarly, knowing the power Barr wields at the President\u2019s behest - would you be eager to cross him?  Would you want to be the first one to unload and trigger a mass selloff?  Do you want all those 3-letter agencies sniffing around your company during the greatest economic crisis of the last century?   \n\n\nOK but what if it this doesn\u2019t work?  What if Congress steps in and regulates how the allocated funds are spent?   \n\n\nSimple, [eliminate their oversight ability]( https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/27/trump-coronavirus-inspector-general/)  \n\nAnd while we\u2019re at it, [what the fuck let\u2019s just send them all home for a while]( https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-threatens-to-adjourn-congress-11586992100).  \u201cYeah that\u2019s right, they\u2019re [refusing to approve my judges]( https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-appointing-historic-number-federal-judges-uphold-constitution-written/) so what other do choice do I have in this time of crisis!\u201c  \n\n\nTaken individually these are all crackpot conspiracy theories with no real evidence for being grounded in reality.  I\u2019m not an idiot, I know that\u2019s what it looks like.  \n\n\nBut take a step back and look at the whole picture.  You have a criminal president who has an established track record of lawlessness.  This President is backed into a corner, facing potential prosecution once he leaves office and his only shot at reelection is circling the drain.  He\u2019s dragged all of his lieutenants down with him, implicating them in what is likely a vast conspiracy to defraud the United States on multiple occasions.  But, he also has the power to \u201cprint money\u201d, the power to distribute it as he pleases, and the power to cover it up.  He also has the power to make the lives of anyone who doesn\u2019t play along very, very uncomfortable.  And what\u2019s more, he\u2019s already beat these charges once before, just a few short months ago.  He\u2019s untouchable as long as everyone\u2019s making money!  \n\n\nFor this reason **I believe Trump has yet again resorted to criminal activity, promising to use the power of the Executive Branch to bribe key players into manufacturing a recovery in order to secure a strong economy for use in his reelection campaign.**  \n\n\nIf  you are willing to accept that as a possibility, if not a likelihood or outright truth, then look at how the market is behaving and ask yourself what is **rational**.  If you have an off the books agreement from the highest branches of Government securing your financial solvency and profits at no risk of penalty, do you care if:  \n\n\n- Unemployment is skyrocketing \n- Earnings are well below expectations and will continue to be well into the year \n- Small and Medium size businesses are declaring bankruptcy \n- States are perpetually extending shutdowns further and further into the spring\n- The virus is not contained and we still lack adequate testing measures \n- Consumer spending takes a nosedive\n- The supply chain is in shambles  \n\n\nFuck no you don\u2019t.  Keep the bad news coming because none of it matters.  Go ahead you fucking retards, short the market and see what happens.  We\u2019re riding this thing till the wheels come off and if/when that happens it\u2019ll be Trump they line up against a wall, not us.  \n\n\nSo everyone holding those SPY puts expiring  May \u2013 July expecting a major drop any day now are going to be sorely disappointed when that just doesn\u2019t happen.   Your account is going to bleed dry because no revelation with regards to the Virus or subsequent shutdown is going to trigger that selloff.  That\u2019s my theory.   \n\n\nYou followed u/variation-separate \u2018s awesome posts and bought puts at 270 expecting the dip.  The logic was sound but the markets don\u2019t care  \n\n\nYou followed u/fuzzyblankeet \u2018s post about 10-K\u2019s and bought puts on F.  The logic was sound but the markets don\u2019t care  \n\nThere is no amount of logic, TA, or fundamentals that can be applied to a market that is operating exclusively off a wink and nod behind closed doors.  \n\n\nSo as for advice, I am personally avoiding short ETF positions and instead looking at some of the quality DD relating to individual tickers.  I plan to maintain a few long dated puts on vulnerable sectors like real estate and dumb consumer goods, while holding a large cash reserve and making small intraday plays when opportune.  You shouldn\u2019t do this though because I truly have no clue what the fuck I\u2019m talking about.  \n\nA few things I\u2019m looking for that would indicate a downturn if my theory is correct:  Congress getting tough on oversight of the funds, McConnell breaking ranks and refusing additional funding, friction between Trump and Barr/Powell, power players from Trump\u2019s corner getting mouthy.  If any of those are followed by a 2-3 day dip I\u2019ll probably buy back in.  \n\nPositions:  My portfolio is fucked after diamond hands, but I\u2019ve realigned for intraday calls on SPY, tech giants, essential manufacturing and distribution (KMB, PG, MDLZ because I work with those companies), VNQ $60p 6/19 (because I do believe REITs are actually fucked) \n\nThanks for reading.  I\u2019ll take my ban like a champ \n\nOh one last thing, remember Barr\u2019s March 23rd pep rally?  [Funny how that little dog and pony show worked out, isn\u2019t it?]( https://i.imgur.com/P8OAMra.png)  Happy trading retards  \n\n**TL;DR** Whoops, forgot this.  Trump admin is possibly engaged in criminal market manipulation, will continue unimpeded unless stopped by congress or others.  Do not look at COVID-19 related news to time your short, look at congress or others who would attempt to stop him\n\n*I will periodically be editing for format as I typed this in MS Word and it looks like trash on reddit",

Jpow's intention was to ^(soften) the blow and stabilize the crash and he did a pretty good job but spy should not be where it is at right now. volume on spy is slowly decreasing, macd is falling, and investors are getting weary. \n\nWe will leg down slowly but surely for the next couple weeks.

        "selftext": "WTI just hit its lowest level in about 20 years so gotta fucking YOLO that shit long, right? If only mommy had given you your allowance that week in 2016 when crude double bottomed... you would've made some mad tendies riding that shit up, right?\n\n*Wrong.*\n\nI'm here after reading u/fuzzyblankeet 's recent contributions to WSB and feeling ashamed that I haven't done my part to give back. So here is part one (likely of one) of a series to help you degenerates make some tendies (or at least lose fewer). Mr. Fuzz is smart enough to be in credit; I'm dumb as fuck so I'm stuck in a job fighting it out in public markets. Read on if you want; if not then go ahead and buy oil and give free money to traders at hedgies like me.\n\nIf there's demand... I'll do a part two on equity factors and how to use factors to decide what companies to buy options for.\n\n**Commodity Term Structure Basics**\n\nMr. FuzzyBlankeet, Esq. [touched upon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsbto9/the_ballad_of_big_dick_vick_onions_futures_and/) futures in his last post, so I'm not going to go into more detail on the basics, but something he left out was a little something called term structure.\n\nTerm structure exists in futures because the same item is priced differently depending on what month you buy it for. \n\n1) Seasonality\n\nSeasonality happens when demand for something changes depending on what time of year it is. Like how y'alls girlfriends get yeast infections every winter from fucking their boyfriends in hot tubs and demand &amp; price for vagisil spikes up every winter. This would be priced in and the futures curve for vagisil would look something like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Curve of NG futures on Feb. 5th 2019](https://preview.redd.it/mhppxteld7q41.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4457ed01999ae6f3d039206ac04da1d955d12362)\n\n2) Backwardation\n\nDemand for something near-term is much higher than the supply. Like facemasks. No one gives a fuck about buying facemasks for 2 years from now... they need that shit now and they'll pay a premium for it. If facemasks had a futures contract, that shit would be in massive backwardation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Term structure of palladium in Jan. 2019](https://preview.redd.it/lttoxhx4f7q41.png?width=639&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=137e3f654b59d71958e188ac1013259b94eb4340)\n\n3) Contango\n\nThe opposite of backwardation. All you autists are stuck at home with your girlfriends who aren't able to fuck their boyfriends. Near-term demand for condoms drops and condoms term structure is in contango.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Platinum term structure in Jan. 2019.](https://preview.redd.it/ps16dldhf7q41.png?width=639&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd41569181ca9f4502dcc65e00eb92218b3eafec)\n\n**How term structure will kill your trade**\n\nSo what? Well let's do a walk-through of what your long WTI trade would've really looked like in 2016 at the bottom:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[WTI in 2016](https://preview.redd.it/8ju6z7bvj7q41.png?width=1504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62a84791bd7cb160557feaa79532dbcbe1d237a1)\n\n1) It's February 11th, 2016 and you're looking for something to trade. You see crude double bottom b/c you're a technical analysis masta and you YOLO at $26 like the fucking champ you are.\n\n2) Crude's going to the fucking moon so you diamond hands that shit until you start hitting lower lows in 2017 and fuck it.... CL pushes down to $42 so you sell that shit.\n\n3) Sell price of $42 is off the peak, but still fucking good, right? +62% would've been the greatest trade of your life!\n\n*Well... not quite.*\n\nThat chart you're looking at is the \"generic\" crude oil chart. It's a chart of each of the 1st month futures tacked together over time. When the current contract expires, the chart switches to the newest current month.\n\nSo why is the return from the chart different from the actual return? Roll yield (or negative roll yield b/c of contango)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Term Structure of WTI on Feb. 11th, 2016](https://preview.redd.it/mcufe9kyo7q41.png?width=1501&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7f4c6a5382008696934b51d318ce9a7184da55e)\n\nThis chart is the term structure of WTI on Feb 11, 2016 right at the double bottom. Sure, you may have bought WTI right at the bottom, but what happens when the contract expires and you have to roll it over? You sell the cheaper 1st month and buy the more expensive 2nd month. One month later you do the same thing... As long as the term structure stays in contango, you're constantly selling low and buying high - something I'm sure all you autists are very used to.\n\nSo how much of your profit gets killed by the roll? The best way to see is just by comparing the WTI chart (which shows the day to day price movement of oil) and $USO (the 1x crude ETF that contains roll yield)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[White: CL1, Green: $USO... Normalized on Feb. 11th, 2016](https://preview.redd.it/z6f85w6kr7q41.png?width=1505&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f634d2309dfb48eede4ad92cc1dca152679b79b5)\n\nThe white line is WTI and the green line is $USO (both normalized to 100 on Feb. 11th, 2016). Red line is that exit point I picked before.\n\nThe spread between the two occurs because of the negative roll yield. You're not making +62% on this trade... you're making the +8% that $USO made you.\n\nBut what about the autists that know about roll yield and want to pull one over on the evil \"market makers\" by just buying the July 2017 contract from the start? CLN17 on Feb 11th was $39.8... Congrats on your +5.5% gainz buying at $39.8 and selling at $42!\n\n**Current Term Structure**\n\nBut that's 2016... what about now?\n\nIn 2016, the 2nd month futures price was around 9.5% higher than the first month... that level of contango returned around a -54% roll yield (Excess Return \\[$USO +8%\\] = Change in Spot \\[WTI +62%\\] + Roll Yield \\[x = -54%\\])\n\nRight now contango between the first month and second month is a monster 18.4%. All else equal, roll yield will be even higher today than 2016.\n\nTo oversimplify: essentially if the term structure stays the same... if you're long crude, the price of crude oil has to go up 18.4% each month for you to break even.\n\nTerm structure and carry is why shorting VIX (RIP $XIV) during market stability (when VIX futures is in contango) makes you tendies (and why shorting VIX in backwardation right now will screw you even if spot VIX stays the same). It's why shorting natural gas post 2018 spike has been the greatest secret-to-retail trade of the past year+. It's why unless you're the market timing GOAT and you can time the bottom of a V-shaped recovery, you shouldn't be going long oil.\n\nWhat if I look at all the term structures of all the commodities and go long the backwardated ones and short the ones in contango? Congrats, you've discovered what hedgies call commodity carry, essentially the #thetagang trade of the commodity world.\n\n**tl;dr:** Going long crude oil w/ 18.4% 1st, 2nd month contango (2nd month June contract is 18.4% more expensive than the current first month May contract right now) will destroy your gains if you're right about the direction and massively add on to your losses if you're wrong.",

        "selftext": "Volume is low, volatility is dropping and everyone seems to think the worst is behind us. \n\nQuite the opposite is about to occur.\n\nInvestors are being blinded by a Fed who are building a wall of money to contain this credit crisis. Printing trillions hoping this monstrosity of bad policy will be swiftly overlooked, and for the most part it has. Never before have we seen the level of support the fed has been willing to give and investors think that is enough. When the Fed backs you, you keep pumping. Because of the broad nature of the assistance, I believe neither Mnuchin nor Powell know, or care about the actual consequences. They've cast a wide net in hopes that they've solved every problem that will come there way in this crisis. I'm not quite sure if they're stupid, or if they're drinking the same Kool-aid this admistration is pumping out. We all know its bullshit and there is no way we see new highs by Q1 of next year. BOTH Mnuchin and Powell should be on the hook for this; Mnuchin for embezzelment and fraud and Powell for accessory to it. They make Bernanke and Paulson look like choir boys. \n\nWhen the reality sets in, and everyone realizes there will be no V-shaped recovery, it will be too late. The bets being placed now on a speedy recovery are the final nail in the coffin and this time, the fed will be completely out of ammo. With rates stuck at 0 for the foreseeable future, and a deficit well beyond our means, the fed will be forced to ask the Congress again for extra powers akin to socialism. There will be no recovery, no rebound, no making whole of the people.\n\nThis is the end of The Great Expansion. The end of capitalism as we know it and most likely the beginning of the end of the United States as a world power and the end of the Dollar as the reserve currency. Dark days ahead.\n\nShould pale death,\nwith treble dread, \nmake the ocean caves our bed, \nGod who hears the surges roll, \ndeign to save the suppliant soul.",

        "selftext": "Mandatory **THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVISE** merely just my current thought process \n\n**1.** **The rally is dying**\n\nYou obviously might say how is that possible if everyday we've been reaching newer highs than the day before. A rally, in order to be successful, it has to have volume behind to support it. The rally, since our lows, has been steadily decreasing showing there's no will to keep trying to push it for higher highs.\n\n*Processing img 037amwhl8tt41...*\n\nIf there's just been an overall decrease in volume it just comes to show that this rally soon is going to reverse down. As well to note Thursday(4/16/20) when it was announced that Trump is intending to reopen the economy and more than half of the states are at the point they can open up. We were at a point before Friday up 3% and throughout the day we were just slowly dropping, the markets didn't care about the potential reopening. Then for the last hour the market was just pushing higher and higher making sure we end the day a fair amount above 50% fib, and not the usual of one day above and the next day below 50% fib it pushes us towards the next target.\n\n**2. Case for Reversal**\n\nWith us above 50% fib by a fair amount it shows the next point of resistance in this dying rally will be 61.8% fib of $292.93. With the volume dying as we keep reaching new highs a break past 61.8% fib will not be sustainable in the current market we are in right now. As well as sequential indications pointing to a turning point leading to a possible shift in momentum from this rally\n\n[Sequential indicator](https://preview.redd.it/kv0jaqmh1wt41.png?width=2201&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80a089702afe11a854f84136e2509f5ef1503f34)\n\nThe indicator is showing a sell formation occurring the number 9. This is the key number in following this, the last time the a sell formation was formed with it ending at 9 was right before the crash we experienced. It's also backed by a rising wedge formation that's nearing its completion(look at the first photo of crayons). The time frame from this potential sell of is positioned to be either this week or early next week. The large accumulation of shares these last few days by major players in the market can easily be the trigger event to the next leg down.\n\nAs well as a quick pointer in the closing minute there were overall massive buys into puts but 1 block was very interesting.\n\n[Put sales](https://preview.redd.it/88jq3lfk6wt41.png?width=2264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85d65e5937f2f8d5eaa0326020ac9fd5529fffdc)\n\nThis one block split into multiple smaller ones was a total of 120,000 put orders totaling to a nice price of $*40,080,000*. Who would want to put that much on a random bet if we're in a rally right now?\n\n**3. The case for a V-shape recovery**\n\nIt's just short and simple for this one. It draws up on how 61.8% fib holds and how much the FEDs will keep this market propped up. 61.8% fib is the next major testing point if we will have another drop in the market, if this rally manages to break through this then the V-shape recovery will be almost bound in blood from Donny Pump himself. The only way I could see this happen if the FEDs won't ease off the gas and keep pouring their infinite amount of money to save up from a recession. In my opinion if we break past 61.8% fib I feel like the average investor and people who normally don't invest will start to idealize this V shape and start pouring money in it making it come true. This right now doesn't seem realistic because the FEDs are already starting to slowly ease up their infinite QE. Right now they're normal people trying to get into the market with their belief that was the bottom but that is almost never the case with true bottoms in a recession people aren't fearful yet in what is to come.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\n1. There's a sell formation formed on sequential indicators showing a potential reversal.\n2. This sequential formation is also backed by a rising wedge.\n3. Volume has been dying as this rally is pushing each day higher and higher.\n4. The accumulation of puts.\n\nWith that my prediction is that there should be a sell off at some point this week or early next week kicking off the next leg down. This leg down will be a slower burn. I want to assume that liquidity has been drawn back in at record levels, but then again there's too much liquidity now.\n\nThink and plan accordingly with whatever you intend on doing and stay safe.\n\nOnce again **NFA**",

        "selftext": "With Tesla moving back towards its ATH, I thought I would provide my perspective on the supreme-meme stock. Before the Tesla cultists jump on me and spam ban requests for my account, I want to give a bit of background. I bought Tesla 10 years ago when it was less than 1/10 of todays price, and sold a few years ago for a profit. I love Tesla's products and would gladly buy one of their cars myself. However, this is strictly about the value of their stock which I feel is very overvalued right now. Those of you who think you are visionaries if you are just now buying this company in 2020, lol. You are very late to the party and at this point are being spoonfed a lot of ideas by the new mainstream that are not supported by deductive reasoning or data.\n\nBefore I go on, I am aware that Tesla does not follow fundamentals nearly as well as other stocks. The wild speculations and cult-like following make the short-term prospects for this stock very unpredictable. I am just attempting to make an educated guess about the long term performance of this stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Bull Thesis\n\n1. Tesla's cars are the best thing since sliced bread or the first iPhone. They have the highest owner satisfaction of any car, and will become the most prevalent car on earth in the future and monopolize the market\n2. Tesla is not just a car company, they are also a solar/battery/autonomy/AI company. Thus they are a premium, innovative technology company more comparable to Apple than GM. They will monopolize several of these different markets\n3. The company is not profitable now, but its income will continue to grow exponentially in the future due to our society's moving to green technology, and Tesla's prime position to capitalize\n4. One fund manager (Cathy Wood) says she expects the stock to hit $7000 in the next 4 years (lol!)\n5. New factory in China = \\~1.5 billion Teslas sold (I'm being facetious)\n\nThe Bear Thesis\n\n1. Not much of a point in focusing on current fundamentals or TA, since based on its current stock price Tesla's market cap is larger than the 3 major US automakers combined. Everybody knows their current sales are nowhere near justifying this valuation\n2. We are on a 12 year bull run that many (most?) are predicting is over. In a recession/depression, the animal spirits that kept Tesla flush with cash despite their losses will fade away\n3. Also in a depression/recession, less people are buying expensive electric cars or new cars period\n4. Tesla investors want to believe it is a tech company, but a car manufacturer's profit margins are highly unlikely to ever match traditional \"tech companies\" (software &amp; electronics) in the future. There is a ton of competition, large overhead costs to produce and ship these products and the auto industry as a whole has been declining for years.\n5. Electric vehicles are limited by infrastructure. The world's population is mostly urbanized and increasingly so. Where do you charge an electric car for an hour+ if you live in a small apartment, as is the case for nearly the entire millennial+ generation?\n6. Tesla will suffer due to rock bottom oil prices. Going green is nice but ultimately economics are the strong guiding hand towards electric cars. It appears that oil will be cheap for at least a few years. Additionally, Trump is likely to win the next election (I don't like him myself, but I think this is the harsh reality). His presence will not benefit green companies like Tesla for the next 4-5 years\n7. Government incentives that helped a lot with their early growth are drying up\n8. Tesla has never paid a dividend and the company is very leveraged. Comparing it to other brand-name tech companies is silly based on this fact alone. Just look at their 10-k history, without the dreamer aspect it just looks atrocious. There is a reason this 17 year old (they are 17 years old and still not profitable!) company's debt is still junk rated by the major credit rating agencies. In contrast, Apple has had a net income of well over a billion dollars since 2005, before the iPhone even came out. Pretty much every other big tech company is the same, massive sustained profits for a long time.\n9. By the way, since they were rated junk prior to March 22 Tesla does not qualify for Fed bailout money if things start to look bad\n10. Tesla is seen as a leader in a few green fields right now largely *because they are allowed operate at a loss.* Other companies do not have this same luxury and are expected to return big profits. Toyota can't just go full electric and operate at giant losses, their shareholders will go nuts. Tesla has been allowed to do this for a surprisingly long time because of animal spirits. As soon as these green energy fields become profitable and the infrastructures start to take shape other companies will immediately jump aboard in droves. GM already has the Bolt which is actually a great electric city car. Volkswagen has spent tons of cash on EV development. I am sure as soon as total EV sales numbers become more than just a small niche their EV portfolio will take off, along with many other manufacturers\n11. \"Tesla is also a solar/battery/autonomy/AI company\". I see this quote nearly everywhere Tesla is mentioned. None of those are profitable for Tesla and all of them have major competitors. I think it is unlikely for Tesla to be a monopoly in any of these fields. Facebook/IBM/Nvidia/Google/Amazon are way ahead of Tesla in anything AI related, they are all filled with Stanford/MIT/Berkeley etc. graduates with 6 figure salaries. Similar statements can be made for autonomy, in which Tesla is also not the leader. Ford and GM are doing surprisingly well in autonomy, arguably they are outpacing Tesla  [https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882724/ford-autonomous-cars-vehicles-av-austin-texas-taxi-delivery](https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882724/ford-autonomous-cars-vehicles-av-austin-texas-taxi-delivery)\n12. There are competing core car technologies. Hydrogen fuel cells, while inferior at the moment, have had several breakthroughs that may propel their green technology further in the next 10 years.  See here:  [https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52328786](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52328786). A lot of Tesla's value is hinged on their absolute dominance of their type of electric vehicle technology in the long term future. Challenges to this thesis substantially hurt their valuation\n13. \"The future is self-driving taxis everywhere, and they will all be Teslas.\" Another common point that is made, which is quite unlikely due to existing competition. Uber has a big leg up already. But also, going back to fuel cells: fuel cells recharge in the same time as gas, a couple min. Tesla's batteries take well over an hour to fully charge. Time charging is time not spent driving, which is lost revenue for a taxi. For now electric batteries are the winner, but it is not certain that in the long term future this will be the case\n14. Many Tesla cultists think the growth will be exponential and soon their cars will be in every driveway. Just like when the iPhone came out, it grew exponentially for a long time. This thinking is flawed. For one thing, the iPhone has saturated in market share. At this point in time almost everybody who wants a smartphone has one and the phones are starting to blend together, we are entering a new period for the phone industry. Tesla will saturate the same way, their market isn't even a new field like the iPhone's was since people already have good cars. Once the early adopters have their cars, Tesla becomes less of a novelty. You are already seeing this in rich neighborhoods in California. If 3 of my rich neighbors have Teslas I want something unique. This is one of the main reasons no car company has ever been totally dominant.\n15. Covid-19 will likely change the world, telecommuting will likely become much more of a thing. Jim Bianco talks about this a lot  (see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frLz2PJnj1M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frLz2PJnj1M)). Historically a lot of people have never telecommuted and didn't know how to do it. Businesses needed to figure out how to structure themselves to operate in such a manner. Now that they have overcome this hurdle, telecommuting will become much more prevalent. Less driving to work = less need for an expensive car like a Tesla. For my weekend car, I'll stick with the manual transmission Porsche which is much more fun to drive for a couple miles\n16. China. They opened up a factory in China, great. China has never stolen anybody's technology before (/s). The iPhone, made in China but its sales there have always been crap. They only recently hit single digit millions in a country of over 1b since the government actively promotes domestic brands, and strongly takes their side in courts. If a Chinese company makes a \"Resla\" that is an exact copy of the Model 3 and then sues Tesla for IP violation, you better believe they will win in China. China is experiencing massive GDP losses right now and an uncertain future, both politically and economically. There are many talks right now of reducing our reliance on China due to Covid and punishing them. IMO this all does not bode well for future sales of Tesla's pricey electric cars\n\nTLDR:\n\nOverall, I think that Tesla is a great company that will do amazing things in the future. We just have a lot of \"dreamer\" investors right now who think Tesla has some kind of infinite magic sauce. People who bought the stock early did well. And in 8 years, I think you will probably be able to buy their stock for $500 and enjoy a decent dividend and some more steady growth to follow. I think the people buying and holding at today's prices will see more crashes and no/low profits for a long time. I can see it retesting and crossing the limits that were hit in the crash a month ago, as Covid is far from gone at this point. I would only buy this stock if it goes below $200, and definitely would sell right now if I was holding.",

        "selftext": "I recently watched a great ELI5 of the ETF bubble theory proposed by Burry: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTzXLIT__6U\n\nThis left me with some concerns and questions. \n\nLike many others, my main strategy for long-term retirement investments is to DCA into [index fund] ETFs. Since my horizon is 20+ years, everything I've read tells me this is the best thing I can do, especially if I don't want to spend much time actively managing my investments.\n\nSo understandably Burry's theory has me concerned. What happens in 2050 if my chosen ETF has gone bankrupt, or has seriously underperformed the market (or active funds)?\n\nBut is this even a concern if I'm not panic selling during a crash when others are doing the same? If I just buy and hold long term, and sell as needed during retirement, will this bubble theory even affect me?\n\nI'm also left wondering why he focuses on ETFs. What about managed funds? Are they not affected in the same way?\n\nActually, even after watching the video, I have to admit I don't understand how exactly this is an issue.\n\nLet's say I buy **1** share of an ETF **\"ABC\"** for **$100** per share. The ETF  contains **100** companies that have share prices of **$1** each. One of these companies is **\"DEF\"**.\n\nWhen I buy my **1** share of ETF **\"ABC\"**, does the ETF not have to go out and purchase **1** share of **\"DEF\"** (along with 99 other shares)?

Thus, the market continues to gain.\n\nCovid is far from over, the global economic damage shutting down the economy is not reflected in the stock market today.

        "selftext": "The model that everybody seems to get tits up excited about is this one.\n\n [https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america) \n\nIt's by a group that was initially funded by the Bill and Malinda Gates foundation. It is predicting that the last death in the USA will be recorded around May 30th. Everybody can celebrate, buy the fuck out of their favorite stocks, and have one hell of a gay bull orgy fest on May 31st when the bars finally open.\n\nAnd it's wrong. Here's my argument.\n\nFirst, the model is based on recorded deaths in the USA. We know for a fact that recorded deaths is incomplete data. Basically, there is A LOT of evidence that there are people who died of pneumonia recently that have not been tested for the COVID-19. \n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/coronavirus-death-toll-americans-are-almost-certainly-dying-of-covid-19-but-being-left-out-of-the-official-count/2020/04/05/71d67982-747e-11ea-87da-77a8136c1a6d\\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/coronavirus-death-toll-americans-are-almost-certainly-dying-of-covid-19-but-being-left-out-of-the-official-count/2020/04/05/71d67982-747e-11ea-87da-77a8136c1a6d_story.html)\n\nThey stopped testing a lot of patients because there is very little healthcare value in doing so. The tests should be focused on people it can help. \n\nGarbage in, garbage out. The model isn't factoring in the hundreds or possibly thousands of deaths that haven't been confirmed. It also doesn't know about the thousands \n\nSecond, unless we have sufficient testing, confirmed cases and deaths are meaningless. This is the opinion of Nate Silver. The guy who predicted before the 2016 election that Trump had a 33% chance of winning the election when everybody else said he had a 10% chance. \n\n[https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/)\n\nThird, if you download Nate's \"covidia\" excel model, and look at the default values for this model, you'll see that after the peak you have to wait 95 days before the virus effectively dies out (less than \\~300 new infections, which is 30x the population of \"covidia\"). That's with an anemic R0 value of 0.6 (meaning social distancing reduced how contagious the virus is by about 5X, which is pretty reasonable). \n\nWe haven't seen a peak in detected cases. Even if it was last Saturday, according to Nate's mental exercise model,  we're still looking at July 4th before there are only 300 new cases. AND those 300 cases are still enough to start a new outbreak. Realistically, we need to wait a couple more weeks past the last confirmed case for it to die down.\n\nFour, do you think the stupid fuck Trump is going to force you to stay home with \"only\" 500 confirmed cases in the USA? What about DeSantos who only closed Florida after there were 163 deaths and 8000 confirmed cases. Would he keep Florida closed with \"only\" a thousand non-recovered cases? Yeah, the lack of science in our politicians is going to fuck us. To stop a second wave, we have to stay in quarantine for weeks AFTER the last confirmed case. Basically, our politicians are spinless globs of cherry jello. \n\nFive, the second-third-fourth-fifth wave. If we don't wait long enough to open up and reverse social distancing, the R0 value goes back up. Even with contact tracing and all the titillating stuff South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan have done, they still have an increase in cases. Contact tracing and lots of testing is not sufficient to drop the R0 value below 1.\n\n [https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) \n\nSix, you don't need a full lockdown to fuck our economy sixteen ways sideways. Our economy was 11 years into a bull run. The market was begging for a recession, but Donald Pump couldn't help but inject all his magic juice into his bubble for reelection. You get debt, you get debt, you get debt, EVERYBODY GETS DEBT. Debt doesn't create a strong economy. The stupid fuck doesn't realize that you can't just declare bankruptcy and the economy goes on hunky dory. \n\nThere was WAY too much optimism in the economy. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's only bad if too many people are buying Mercedes on subprime refinances on their house. It's bad when people are spending $100k on credit or in subprime business loans to remodel a restaurant in the fucking mall.  \n\nWe're at the first wave of bankruptcies and business failures with the 2% increase in unemployment. The second and third and fourth waves are down the line, even if we could get back to work on May 30th. Delta and Lufthansa get this shit. There is a reason why they are putting planes in long term storage and grounding planes indefinitely. Hint: It's not because they think in 2 months they will be flying the same volume they were 2 months ago. Someone in their management has been through these shit storms and know it's going to last longer than the virus.\n\nI'm almost certain what we got on this new bull run is a lot of money managers saying \"we hit the bottom, everything is ON SALE! We're going to have a V shaped recovery.\" Money managers are basing those opinions on exactly 1/4 of their morning jizz stain. Listen to any economist and they say \"indicators say we got a V recovery coming.\" More, they have no fucking clue. The reason, they don't base their opinions on Jizz. Instead, they base them on the indicators in the economy. And they simply don't have any data to point to a recovery. \n\nSo that leaves me with our bull run. It's based on Hope. Hope that there will be a V shaped recovery. Hope in investing is the fastest way to get you fucked. Wallstreet is like a dark alley with rapists everywhere. Hope won't stop them.\n\nDisclosure: I'm short a shit ton of oil and hotel stocks. Short BA. I got a couple covered calls on WMT and AMD. I also have a few spreads on airlines and real estate because this market went fucking sideways with it's FOMO. I'm also holding about 40% of my portfolio in cash. Basically, I'm stupid fuck, so don't take my word for any of this.",

        "selftext": "**A tail-risk hedge fund advised by Nassim Taleb, author of \u201cThe Black Swan,\u201d returned 3,612% in March**, paying off massively for clients who invested in it as protection against a plunge in stock prices.\n\nThe fund, Universa Investments, was founded in 2007 by Mark Spitznagel, who is also runs the fund as the Chief Investment Officer.\n\nNassim Taleb is Universa's Distinguished Scientific Advisor.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2004, Spitznagel and Taleb ran Empirica, a hedge fund which applied very similar tail hedging strategies to Universa.\n\nUniversa made huge gains in 2008 - as the S&amp;P 500 dropped 38.5% by the end of 2008, the fund increased its investors's money tenfold.\n\nOf course, even when a recession hits, Universa's investors won't starve - they have enough money to invest more than $50 million, which is Universa's minimum investment, and this will be a relatively small part of their overall portfolio.\n\nUniversa essentially offers a \"black swan protection protocol\", telling clients to think of the fund as catastrophe insurance that allows them to pursue returns more aggressively, without the need for more traditional approaches to risk mitigation.\n\nMark Spitznagel, who runs the fund, is known for the phrase:\n\n**\"I spend all my time thinking about looming disaster\"**\n\nIn fact, a [Forbes profile from 2011](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0627/money-guide-11-spitznagel-black-swan-cnbc-protect-tail.html#5349ecbe3857) claims that on roughly 95 trades out of 100 they lose money, yet Spitznagel is unruffled as he sits in his office listening to classical music and losing money each day.\n\n**To simplify, here's the essence of how it works:**\n\n**Universa purchased far out-of-the-money \"put\" options on stocks and broad market indices.**\n\n**A put option gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset at a set price within a specified time period. It's a bet that a stock or market is going down.**\n\nAs it is ultimately a bet, it is a very attractive market for degenerate gamblers!\n\nIf the market price falls below the agreed-upon price, you make money.\n\nUniversa makes a lot of small bets and watches most of them go bad (hence the 95 out of 100 trades they lose money line).\n\nHowever, when one hits, it hits big...\n\n**For example, back in September 2008, when the S&amp;P 500 was trading around 1200, Universa bought S&amp;P 500 Index put options with a strike price of 850, due to expire late October.**\n\n**They were betting an \u201cunlikely\u201d drop would occur.**\n\n**They paid around 90 cents for those options. By October 10th, the S&amp;P had dropped 300 points in a month. The options Universa purchased for 90 cents were now trading for $60 each. Universa cashed out of its position around $50, good for a gain of 5455%.**\n\nNow, as a reminder, this is a hedge - investors will have a relatively minimal percentage of their portfolio in Universa.\n\nEssentially, the fund is designed to make an absolute killing if the market crashes and therefore ensures that their investors have insurance if the market suddenly nosedives.\n\nSpeaking of diving, let's take a dive into the [Investor Letter](https://www.scribd.com/document/455607584/Universa-Letter-April-2020#download&amp;from_embed):\n\nIn what has been a terrible period for many investors, this is what Universa investors were greeted with on the first page:\n\n**Based on your required invested capital at the start of the year, in March 2020 you experienced a 3,612% net return on capital; year-to-date you have experienced a 4,144% net return on capital.**\n\nSpitznagel then flexes The Risk Mitigation Scorecard, which showed that a portfolio invested 96.7% in the S&amp;P 500 and *just 3.3%* in Universa's Tail Hedge fund, would have had a positive return in March, a month when the S&amp;P dropped 12.4%.\n\nThe same portfolio - which eliminates the adverse effect on compounding from downside shocks - would have produced a 11.5% CAGR since inception in March 2008 versus 7.9% for the S&amp;P 500.\n\n(CAGR just means Compound Annual Growth Rate)\n\nI mentioned eliminating the adverse effect of compounding from downside shocks, well this is crucial and he makes a great point here:\n\n**Due to the mathematics of compounding, the big losses are essentially ALL that matter to your rate of compounding, not the small losses - and** ***not even*** **the big or small gains.**\n\nThis goes back to Warren Buffett's wise words:\n\n**\"Rule number one: Never lose money**\n\n**Rule number two: Never forget rule number one\"**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoWI76Pu9JI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoWI76Pu9JI)",

        "selftext": " This will be the first and last time I post. \n\nWhy first ? I\u2019m posting because I\u2019ve seen some retarded DD on here last 2 days that would offend retarded people. \n\nWhy Last ? I got better things to do. \n\nMy credentials ?  Insider in this space for over 10 years.    ( excuse the grammars. English is my fourth language). \n\nThis is a very dumbed down version as I can\u2019t very well write 100 pages on wsb post.  There are books, seminars, certifications on this stuffs. \n\nCredit Card processing is very important as it\u2019s a key indicator for consumers spending.   Scroll down for  Puts/Calls.\n\n**Parties Involved to make it work ?**\n\n1.) Consumer   --- end user. Credit Card holder. \n\n2.) Merchant   --- Business establishment accepting  payment. These guys pay out all the fees\n\n3.) Card Brand   ---- Visa, Mastercard, Discover (Diner Club,  Union Pay), American Express, \n\n4.) Sponsoring Bank   --- handles risks, daily balancing, funding the merchant. \n\n5.) Issuing Bank --- Issue the credit card. If your credit card say \u201c Chase\u201d, then Chase is the issuing bank. \n\n6.) Processor  --- transactions run through these guys. Think of them as a highway to run  and verify transactions\n\n7.) ISO --- Independent sales office. These guys are the one who call business to sign them up with \u201c use my company  \n\n for cheaper rates\u201d \n\n**How**  **does each Parties make money ?** \n\n1.) Consumer --- they don\u2019t  anything as they are the purchaser.\n\n2.) Merchant --- they pay out all the fees. At the end of the month, they get a bill for the privilege of being able to accept credit card.  \n\n3.) Card Brand --- Card Brand is pretty much god. They make about 15% of total fees paid out to merchant.   Look up  FANF, dues &amp; assessments. If Visa need money, they just increase their rates, that\u2019s it. More on this later. \n\n4.) Sponsoring Bank -- these guys make the least out of everyone in the group. About  0.01% -0.03%  ( 1 to 3 BP) of total processing volume.  \n\n5.) Issuing bank -- \u201cinterchange\u201d is paid out to the issuing bank. These fees account for about 75% of all total fees.  Card Brand dictate interchange. I\u2019m not going to go into qualifications, etc\u2026.. Interchange rates is publish for each card brand. Look it up. \n\n6.) Processor --- these guys usually make money on per transaction counts. About $0.02 -$0.05 per transaction and bunch of other misc fees. \n\n7.) ISO --- whatever is left over goes to the sales group.  In a normal business niche ( not high risk or CBD/ cannabis), profit is about 0.30% - 0.50% of total processing volume. \n\n**Profit Math**\n\nMerchant\u2019s fee \u2013 ( issuing bank + card brand ) = ISO\u2019 Gross - ( Processor + Sponsoring Bank) = ISO\u2019s Net.\n\n \n\n**Fees:** \n\nAlways have 2 parts.   \n\na.)  Percentage  multiply by the processing volume. \n\nb.)  Fix charge multiply by the transaction.\n\nWhat if you as a sales office  charged merchant 2.75% ( SQUARE) and  nothing else? you would  net negative on any transactions under $10 and  net positive on any transaction over $40.00\n\nWhy ? because interchange for a signature regulated debit is  0.05%+ $0.22( per transaction) not including all the other costs. \n\n**State of the world.**\n\nAll 50 states have stay-at-home orders. Some states are talking about opening up again ( GA, FL).  Guess what ? it\u2019s the Consumers who\u2019s going to decide when to \u201copen\u201d up. Household spending account for 70% of annual GDP. \n\nThe rest of the world is on lock down. Even after opening up, it\u2019s still bad. \n\n[https://www.barrons.com/articles/chinas-reopening-is-missing-consumers-thats-a-bad-sign-for-u-s-51587476793](https://www.barrons.com/articles/chinas-reopening-is-missing-consumers-thats-a-bad-sign-for-u-s-51587476793)\n\n**Great\u2026\u2026**  **Give me puts or calls\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..**\n\n1.) Card Brand   ---- \n\na. Visa ( V)  -- earning is on 04/30. They are  the god in this business. They have the greatest exposure in US and overseas. There is no place in asia or Europe that does not take Visa. They increase their rates twice a year. Rate increases scheduled for this April was pushed back to July.  Their earnings will be absolutely horrible as the rest of the world started shutting down in Feb and US in march. \n\ni.  Waiting to be fill --- V 01 May $160P  \n\nii. Waiting to be fill --- V 19 June $135P \n\nb. Mastercard -- earning is on 04/29 -- They have the second highest processing in US. Also like Visa. If you are playing earning, any puts within 5% will be good. \n\nc. Discover ( DFS)  (Diner Club,  Union Pay) --- Earning  4/22 -- I had  15 X $2.72 01 May $34C going into earning. CALLS?? WTF?? 1.) they announced dividends right before earnings. 2.) They own debit networks. Think grocery stores, liquor stores, cannabis shops. 3.) Dinner club, union pay, paypal all goes through them to process on a traditional level. \n\nResults: \n\nQ1 GAAP EPS of -$0.25 misses by $1.61.\n\nRevenue of $2.89B (+4.7% Y/Y) beats by $10M.\n\nShares -5.3% AH.\n\nGoing to exit my position at open with probably 40% losses. \n\nThis is good, if  DFS  missed by bad, the rest will be way way worst. \n\nd. American Express ( AXP) ---  rich people\u2019s credit card. \n\n2.) Sponsoring Bank   ---\n\na. FITB -- 4/21 --  missed earning. Went down on 4/21 then went back up. \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n3.) Issuing Bank --- I would not touch issuing bank as they are too diversified.\n\na. Chase\n\nb. Bank of America\n\n4.) Processor  -- do your own research.  \n\na. Global Payments\n\nb. Fiserv\n\n**Other:** \n\nSQ ( Square) -- earning 05/06. I did not talked about Payment facilitator. Which is kinda of what they are.   Here was a post on here  \u201c Square InC, SQ Puts\u2014let\u2019s be rational. Right direction but wrong DD. \n\nSquare  is all domestic and make their money primary from \n\n1.)  Credit Card processing --- they will give merchant, 2.75% or $275 total fees. Their credit card processing  is net negative since inception. The reason is because of their client base ( mom and pop, start up, small transactions type businesses). 2.75% is a good percentage on volume but the $0.00 per swipe is killing them by the time they have to pay out interchanges  and dues assessments.  Their average ticket have to be over $25.00 to be profit. But the business model will not allow it. Small mom and pop go to them because lax underwriting,  and it\u2019s a lot easier vs a traditional model. Most of their merchants is under 10k in processing. \n\n2.) Hardware sales  --- very minimal 1 time revenue \n\n3.) SAS ( Service as a subscription) -- Minimal revenue when comparing to credit card processing. They are also waiving all the software subscription fees for the month of April. \n\n4.) Others\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\n**I WOULD NOT TOUCH SQUARE.** \n\n1.)  In fintech, you don\u2019t need to be making money. You can have years of losses and stock will go up. Why ? because it\u2019s about acquiring a large merchant base. \n\n2.) Jack Dorsey -- yes the Twitter guy. He\u2019s the founder and ceo of Square. He\u2019s the Elon Musk of this  space. And you don\u2019t mess with papa  Elon. \n\n3.)  SQ is  APPROVED to make Emergency Small-Business Coronavirus loans.

        "selftext": "Alright I've got some nitty gritty details on a shit ton of restaurants. I'm a doordash driver (this is what diamond hands gets you. I went from $157 to $7500 to $850). I've got some DD on a few restaurants, some of this info might be super useful, some might not.\n\n* Chipotle \u2013 this is the main DD, the big papi. As you know from their earnings, they've been absolutely crushing sales. Every time I go theres at least 5 bags awaiting pickup, and sometimes there's up to 20. Today they've even instituted an alphabetical distribution because they just have so fucking many bags. The cooking staff was not taught how to wear masks, though, and they just wear them around their necks. There are people straight up talking to each other while looking down directly over freshly cooked steak. If they've got the virus it is becoming acquainted with every burrito bowl and quesadilla they prepare. I'm not sure if they can be held accountable for this, but I suspect Chipotle is directly responsible for a significant amount of virus spreading (albeit, this is anecdotal evidence). If a few workers get sick, though, they will quickly spread it to each other and we can expect some sort of headline or strike or something. Keep in mind Chipotle's past issues with food safety.\n* MacDonald \u2013 sir, this is a MacDonald. MCD's is crushing it as well, but not as strongly as some of the other fast food joints like chick fil a and popeyes. With that said, MCD is the cleanliest of any restaurant I've been to since the pandemic started. Everyone's got masks and gloves on properly, and inside it is cleaner than ever. Also, MCD has a presence on many different delivery platforms and is open all night so I think they're at least doing a good job staying above water.\n* Cheesecake factory \u2013 only been getting orders on weekend nights for the most part. They're doing pretty poorly right now and the quantity of orders seems to be far from where it needs to be. This may be a shit estimate, but based on my anecdotal experience they could have lost 80%+ of business. Cheesecake Factory's main value driver (besides the cheesecake obviously) is the experience and atmosphere of going to the restaurant. Otherwise, it's basically just microwave meals that people can just buy at the grocery store frozen. They've got the social distancing going well though and are more high tech than all the other restaurants. Drivers are alerted when to come into the restaurant to pick up the food. Surprisingly, nobody else does this. \n* Taco Bell \u2013 drive thru has a steady flow and to be honest how many people actually go and sit inside a taco bell in the first place. People are still getting baked and driving thru or ordering probably at or near the same quantity before the pandemic. Although, I'll add that the drive thru clerk has not had a mask or gloves and is probably handling a decent amount of cash money. \n* Wendy's \u2013 I decline orders for Wendy's since making the mistake of accepting the first one I got. The line is usually around the block for the drive thru, and that was the only option for drivers. Safe to say that they're totally crushing business, but that they haven't learned a single fucking thing in operations management. Learn how to fucking handle the crowd of people that literally want to hand you their money. Chick fil a does this right but is unfortunately not publicly traded. Chick fil a had 250 cars easily when I went and I declined the order as well. But at least they have a parking lot management team with people running orders out to cars, and a separate spot for doordash/delivery drivers so they don't have to wait in the same line. \n* Dunkin \u2013 I expect Dunkin is not doing nearly as well as they usually do. Doordash orders are kinda atypical in the first place because who needs coffee brought to them? Some people I guess. But my theory with this one is that all the college students and young professionals who rely on Dunkin every morning for their job/school work have cut down significantly. Hours are down at a lot of locations and social distancing makes it so that only 4-6 people can wait in line in a typical dunkin. They are suffering. Also, most of their stores don't have a drive thru.\n\nSo I obviously only included public companies, but hopefully this info can provide some utility to you gambling idiots. I myself have lost like 95% of the value on almost every one of my puts and I'm using my doordash earnings to yolo on LSD penny stocks so take my words with a grain of salt. Also, word is that Doordash and other gig economy companies have stopped onboarding because there are too many people on the job. \n\nPositions: SPY $195 5/1, V $140 5/1, GSX $17.5 5/15, HOG $10 5/15, YELP $13 5/15, HOG 8/21 $14\n\nSome positions omitted out of sheer embarrassment.",

Hell, the hospitals stopped testing for a couple weeks, for what I believe was a lack of testing kits.\n\n\nDrive by any of the plants, and you'll see the media trying to get an answer, but they won't for a while. You would think they would try to temporarily close and sanitize, but who knows how well that will work.\n\n\nHere's a little back story. Tyson has a subsidiary known as BPI or BPI Tyson.

        "selftext": "Looking for some spirited back and forth from my fellow reddit investors and capitalists. Feel free to rip me, or drop an \"atta boy\" -- That's why we're all here!\n\nDisclaimers: I'm not a FA, and don't pretend to be one. New to reddit, but not to the market. Securities I  currently own are **bolded** so you can check my bias. :)\n\nWMT - Talk about a ship that has been steady through the storm. I sold all of mine back in 2016, fearing cuts to entitlement programs would essentially cut their workforce by 30% overnight. Those cuts never came, and now I want back in.  Grocery pickup and delivery has been the future for a while, but COVID seems to have fast tracked that transition. IMO, it will remain highly popular post pandemic, Walmart will expand on it, and 5 years from now &gt;70% of grocery sales will be a direct competition between them and **AMZN**. I'm taking this one as soon as the right opening appears, with the expectation of holding it long term.  \n\n**KO** \\- First share I ever bought, never let it go, added to it over the years, and might be adding more tomorrow.  Not much to say here. It's priced well and has a scheduled earnings report before opening bell on Tues.  The recent relative success of consumer markets (WMT, **AMZN**, **TGT**, COST) leads me to think that will be a positive report, and if I see nothing indicating otherwise, I'll try to stock up and ride the wave.  Big fan of **PEP** as well -- more diversified than **KO**, but KFC/Tacobell/PH will probably slow any aggressive gains for a while.\n\n**MSFT** \\- Grain of salt time. This is my favorite holding on the market, bar none. **MSFT** and **AMZN** have essentially held up the whole average during this rebound period. It's all about those beautiful beautiful clouds y'all. (military contracts don't hurt either, see **BA**...) It's always a good time to buy Microsoft. \n\nGOOG/**GOOGL** \\- has a bright future in similar areas to **MSFT**, but I hate companies that live and die by advertisement revenue. For that reason I have a very limited holding in only 1 out of the 2, and I stay away from FB and TWT as well.  ITS ALWAYS A GOOD TIME TO BUY MICROSOFT.\n\nT and **DAL** \\- like Coke, they both have earnings to report this week. I think Delta will produce a decent report which will confuse some who don't fully understand that the pandemic split quarters, and much of the carnage won't be known until the end of Q2. If it does bump up, I'll offload shares and buy back lower in the early summer. **DAL** has the best balance sheet as well as the second best executive team in the whole airline industry, and I don't see it going anywhere. T on the other hand looks to be primed for injury if they report negative earnings.  If they fall back below 26, I'm an AT&amp;T buyer all day long. \n\nNFLX - If it were my money, I'd wait for the (very likely) record high earnings report coming up, ride the wave, and sell high.  I'm not a fan of companies who can't seem to be profitable despite overwhelming popularity. Average NFLX account is accessed by &gt;8 users, but only paid for by 1. New competitors emerging. The whole company model just sketches me out. Go prove me wrong Netflix.... but I'll continue to pass for now.\n\nSNE - Gaming has grown in quarantine, Playstation 5 is set to release in the next 2 months, and the stock still has solid rebound potential from its high. I'm at a solid buy here, and I've never owned it before.... so thats exciting!\n\n**V** and **MC** \\- Every single reputable study shows that the very first debt people default on in a recession is their credit card bill. BE VERY CAREFUL HERE.\n\nTSLA - Volatile, Bullish, Enigmatic.... I have no idea what's happening here.  Tesla fanboy's overwhelming enthusiasm make market predictions hard. I'll buy if it drops below 580 again. Don't own any now. Damn sure wish I did....\n\nOther stuff I like right now - **BA**, **JNJ**, **LOW**, **SAVE**, **TDOC**, MDT, HD, **ABT**\n\nOther stuff I'm neutral on - **PG**, LUV, DIS, **NKE**, SHOP, **AMD**, **Oil stocks** (will likely go even lower next month), and **many many many others**.....\n\nOther stuff I hate right now - **AAPL**, cruise lines, or any company that can't survive another big dip. Nobody knows if it's coming. be smart.\n\nDo your thing Reddit, Have a spectacular week, and GOD BLESS AMERICA!",

Nordic American Tankers CEO Herbj\u00f8rn Hansson said on CNBC that they charge $70,000 for a day storing oil. He also said they have operational costs of $8,000 so that boils down to an average of $60,000 profits per tanker. Given that they have 23 Tankers in their fleet as of right now, that's roughly $1,380,000 per day. If they would ONLY have this price for 50 days in the quarter, that would yield $69,000,000 profits. (This is assuming that made ZERO money the other 40 days). Given Shares outstanding of 142,571,000 that would yield an EPS of $0.49. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blqp2f0YBj8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blqp2f0YBj8)) \n\nHIGH Earning Estimates expect an EPS for the quarter is .35 and consensus EPS forecast is .25. Given all that, they report earnings on May 12 and should comfortably outperform the consensus. Given that tankers can charge up to $200,000 a day, and assuming they have this price for at least 50 days and making ZERO money the remaining days of the quarter, the projections are still conservative. What do you guys think? I'm long $NAT with a Credit Spread.  \n\n\nThis is obviously a short-term play but seems like a comfortable position.",

        "selftext": "We know by now that there likely won't be a V shaped recovery during these weird times.  Recession is here and that means the best stocks you want to hold in your portfolio are those that move **inversely** to the market.\n\nWhich ones are those?  Well I did my homework for you retards:\n\n1. ZM.  This company has top-line revenue growth of 115%+/year (geometric average) over the last 3 years. The phenomenal growth rate ranks in the top 5% percentile of all companies.  This is also not even including the most recent quarter, which I'm sure blow by expectations because of the shift to online communication platforms.  I work in academia and I know that 80%+ of academic institutions are using Zoom on a regular basis due to lockdown.  Sure there are privacy and security concerns with the software but the widespread adoption of this technology will far outweigh these problems.  The stock price is trading at only 35% over the highs before the crisis so if we take into account the recent surge, there\u2019s upside value. \nMost importantly, ZM has no long-term debt and positive free cash flow to equity already, even though it is a relatively new publicly traded company.  Usually, companies in rapid growth phase have negative FCFE (i.e., NFLX).  Six-month price target: $175\n2. REGN. Revenue growth is at 22%/year over the last 5 years.  EPS growth of 43%/year.  No long-term debt.  Positive FCFE in the each of the last 5 years.  This stock was a winner before the lockdown.  They are one of the top companies currently working on a rona vaccine.  My personal favorite healthcare stock at this time.  Six-month price target: $650\n3. AMZN. This stock has only increased by 10-15% since before lockdown.  It's so rare to see a $1.1 trillion market cap stock that is still growing revenues by 24%/year.  Their purchase of Whole Foods turned out to be strategically sound.  FCFE/share has increased from 11 --&amp;amp;gt; 27 --&amp;amp;gt; 40 in the last 3 years.  Sky's the limit.  I mean fuck, you can tell how well they are doing because they are hiring 175,000 people during these times.  They report their earnings in 10 days and I expect to see them smash it. AMZN 2200c 4/24 (if you can afford it)\n4. TDOC. Interesting stock that someone else here mentioned.  They have 64%/year revenue growth in the last 4 years but negative FCFE in each of those years.  They are still ramping up but I do believe in the quick adoption of tele-medicine in the near future.  Doctors and patients no longer want to see face to face.",

        "selftext": "This post is stemming from a comment I liked which asks some intelligent questions:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/dragonuity/comments/fvj24m/my_magnum_opus/fnaiaf7/\n\nOriginally, that was meant to just be an archive subreddit. Changed my mind when I received some nice comments lmao.\n\nTo preface: Yea I'm borderline insane.\n\nOk Wallstreetbets.\n\nhere goes nothing. . .\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyqgre/itll_soon_be_apparent_that_the_us_is_going_to/ \n\n&gt;I saw that post made on wsb, I think I linked it somewhere actually, and it made me pretty happy that my claims were being substantiated by someone within academia independently. If what he claims is true, and the IMHE model is, as I have heard myself, simple curve fitting. I find that pathetic; it can be done on python linear regression modules in a couple of minutes. \n\nI recently looked through one of the most recent models produced by Morgan Stanley (I don\u2019t have an exact date but my friend acquired it sometime during the weekend), I suppose I can point out in detail which part of the current models I hate the most. It\u2019s everything after the top-- which I think will be fairly accurate: \n\nToo many assumptions are being made on containment that get egregiously worse on the way down. Each inaccuracy from the top down build on one another creating a giant avalanche of error. It certainly doesn\u2019t help that the predictions closer to the bottom become very quickly, much more difficult. Alright here\u2019s the graph and I\u2019ll provide some of my personal commentary as well as expectations. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Where the next wave of models might go wrong.** (Notice: I purposely didn't use 'When')\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/GhiQZgh \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n0 : The top. This is going to be fairly accurate with the current data. Might still be a little off even. \n\n1: Initial dropoff. Wishful thinking at best. They\u2019re still assuming ideal conditions for such a sharp dropoff. Last time I checked we didn\u2019t have any mandatory/enforced lockdowns to warrant this steep of an initial dropoff nor the will to. Also when has anything related to testing been on schedule? Is the virus suppose to go away with the heat? It\u2019s not. Ideal. Conditions. \n\n2:  Road to containment. It\u2019s starting to get bullshit. Google+Apple colab is op-in optional, what I'd guess &lt;30% which won\u2019t be significant at all. Everyone still remembers Snowden\u2019s warnings in the back of their minds about a surveillance state. We\u2019re not South Korea. Even Singapore got put into lockdown recently despite its initial success against the virus. An un-containable virus is not going away without drastic measures. Our government officials have demonstrated as much that they are not willing to resort to said measures. Their reactions reflect the feelings of their constituents-- we also hate following rules that infringe on our own privacy and freedoms; the country has to date only been told to stay at home-- even kids won\u2019t listen, why would adults? As far as I see it, the risk is worth the reward. Without compelling reason to, people are not going to change their habits of going out and give up their social lives overnight. Humans are inherently social creatures. Furthermore:\n\nNobody in their right minds, unless they\u2019re forced to, is going to stay at home for over a full month, especially not Americans. If 1. relied on 10 things going right, 2. relies on a magnitude higher, 100.  \n\n3: Containment. Is this some type of fairy tale? This virus has not been contained anywhere yet. There\u2019s too many things wrong with this. It\u2019s not disappearing by August. And what\u2019s to say a 2nd wave of infections is gonna wait conveniently months after the first wave and not start before the 1st wave is over? What about a possible 3rd 4th wave? What if that makes the 1st wave never stop? Why only 2? Why are there periods with 0 cases of the virus in this graph? That alone makes me want to tear it up. If there\u2019s any cases, there\u2019s going to be a lot; we know that much. It\u2019s not going away without a vaccine. I don\u2019t even know why they had the audacity to put a 2nd wave anywhere on this fucking graph without putting asterisks everywhere. Might as well buy a lotto ticket. This part of the graph is about as accurate as winning a jackpot or finding a miracle cure. Did they superimpose China\u2019s graph for this part?  Their entire biotechnology research team should be axed for using China\u2019s pandemic data as legitimate data-points, ridiculous.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;I\u2019m not providing any evidence. The evidence is everywhere. I\u2019m rambling. But I\u2019m more coherent then whoever was drunk enough to green-light these graphs without the blatant intention of misleading the public. They might as well have drawn a straight line down from the peak to 0. If the virus was going to magically go away anyways, why not all at once? Why wait? There\u2019s no room for any sort of setback for this graph. The real thing is going to be drawn out by many months at least. Anyways. . .\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n0 &gt;&gt; 1 &gt;&gt; 2 &gt;&gt; 3 in terms of difficulty to predict as well as number of underlying conditions that have to go favorably or on schedule. We have not been on schedule on anything so far. Why do we expect the federal government and state governments to suddenly start working together? They\u2019re currently still outbidding each other on medical supplies. There\u2019s too many assumptions for this to be a proper model. Why are they still modeling Covid after previous diseases? \n\n&gt;My personal feelings: I don\u2019t think we\u2019re returning work in any way shape or form until, at the very earliest, fall. And that\u2019s me being overly optimistic. We might not be able to return back at all, except in small quantities, to be perfectly honest. Any Covid graph that looks easy on the eyes and clean should be illegal. It might as well be drawn free-handed. I would really like to know how these things graphs are generated with no evidence. This graph doesn\u2019t even deserve to be called an estimate. It\u2019s so incredibly lazy and bullshit. *It's because it doesn't matter. They can always adjust it later on, just like the rest of their \"forecasts\" on the economy.*\n\nAny actual estimate would have to take over 1000 pages to look at hundreds of moving parts/components and verifying every underlying assumption. They most likely procrastinated really hard and had around 10 if I had to guess. I bet 5 of them relied on empty-nothing burger promises being rolled out/executed properly by our model government, and the other 5 relied on faulty data from China\u2019s \u201cmiracle containment story\u201d or low number case behavior from role-model countries, Taiwan, South Korea, ect.. It ain\u2019t their first rodeo. We\u2019re the noobs this time, not them. Bad graphs are easy to make if you\u2019re allowed to make endless assumptions with little to no care. Good graphs are not, because you can\u2019t afford to. It\u2019s not their job to make good graphs. This *thing* will never be fully contained, no matter how much we test, without a vaccine. \n\nEnd of ultra speculative section. \n\n&gt;The graph was so bad I struggled to write this section. I could\u2019ve cleaned every up and made it sound nice. But I\u2019m honestly flabbergasted. I\u2019m incredulous. They can\u2019t be serious. Why am I taking something seriously that wasn't meant to be? This begs the question . . .\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen might these new models break?\n\n Watch how the peak forms and as it goes into the initial dropoff. If it\u2019s not a steep dropoff you can bet your asses they\u2019re going back to the drawing board soon. It\u2019s a weird getup where any changes especially near the top of the pyramid as it\u2019s coming downwards will only amplify the issues with these forecasts. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Actually none of anything above this section matters. It's the wrong frame of mind. But it makes good practice for myself.**\n\n&gt;Sorry to disappoint you. Well then that was a total waste of time wasn\u2019t it? Not really, but we shouldn\u2019t care have to care when forecasts turn sour because they don\u2019t matter anymore. These graphs are not meant to be accurate. I\u2019m sure that they\u2019re going to be making their moves well before this happens again. But it\u2019s an important exercise to see where they\u2019re at. It\u2019s an unspoken agreement between all the firms. They\u2019re buying time for *something*. Even if this was meant to be internal and passed around like hot cakes it\u2019s to make their average employees believe in the Cinderella story, that they\u2019re working for a better cause. But make no mistake, there\u2019s some super secret restricted model/predictions only seen by a couple higher-ups most likely. I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and guess here, but it\u2019s not going to be nearly as pretty. Or is there? No that can't possibly be!\n\nWe arrive then at the seemingly obvious conclusion:\n\n*The Fed/gov/banks must be conspiring against us. Their actions are dangerous to the American people.* But . . .\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**This conclusion can also be considered close-minded and should be relinquished in my opinion.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI for one, am guilty guilty of thinking like this not to long ago-- actually when the fed announced they were going to buy junk bonds that was my initial reaction. But after looking back, reality is often much more elegant and not the least crude or brute-forced-- electrical engineers reading this will know exactly what I'm talking about. . . as will many others. So, why then? If. . .\n\nThey are not conspiring against anyone. Then. . .\n\nWhat are they buying time for?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Absolutely nothing.** \n\n&gt;Sorry to disappoint you. A crash is detrimental to them too; especially after the restrictions put on banks after the last financial crisis. The fed, the gov, the shitty graphs, QE,  and every single god damn revision they've made to their economic forecasts. All of it is done to prevent panic, relax expectations, and shank the natural crash that would've otherwise occurred before it could run. They\u2019re doing their best to buy time and delay the downturn because that\u2019s all that they can do. There doesn\u2019t have to be a conspiracy theory. There doesn\u2019t have to be brilliant reason. Sometimes the best explanation is the most obvious one.\n\nFed buying anything and everything? They\u2019re trying to prevent certain firms, that are leveraged to the tits with junk, from blowing up and causing a chain reaction. In their view, that\u2019s the best way for them to protect the financial system and serve the American people. However, It also happens to be the easy way out, the other path less traveled, despite being the obvious choice to the rest of us, is unknown, uncertain, and untested. It\u2019s scary, and it should be; because it's never been done before. They\u2019re human too, and it\u2019s easier to make easy decisions as one (especially for a bunch of boomers).\n\n&gt; ok Boomer. And yes, to answer the obvious, they won't be held accountable because when it's our turn to deal with this shit they'll suddenly pretend be senile. *Go figure.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThen why did I say when we switched to these more drawn out forecasts it\u2019d matter?\n\nBecause it happens to cancel the U-V shaped recovery story or the virus \u201cmagically\u201d going away narrative currently being preached by the media. That\u2019s the only reason why I cared about this current revision. It's big. That's it. There is going to be a relatively large base case shift or fundamental change because of it. I don\u2019t think anybody should put in the mental effort to care about how firms make models and tweak them after they\u2019re finished switching and started publishing their \u201crevised\u201d bullshit this time around. That or I just like being lazy and ignoring things I don\u2019t think matter anymore or will soon become irrelevant. Either way, soon we can all forget about virus models/forecasts because they\u2019ll only be a worthless distraction and serve as comedic relief soon.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHowever. Back to the current timeline. . .\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhy does matter is that if these new models are getting passed around internally?\n\nIt means they will soon go for public release in a week or so. And we'll have our promised downturn. I hate shitty graphs.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The concluding discussion:**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBack to my favorite kind of speculation. \n\n&gt;I over-explained graphs that didn\u2019t mean anything in the first place. Then argued for a faulty statement. Kindof like yodeling in space. *Go figure.* \n\n&gt;To balance things out I\u2019m going to be concise about the next part which might be relevant.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe assumption I\u2019m making: **We won\u2019t breach next fib level.** If we do and don\u2019t get rejected immediately, please proceed to chuck everything I say here out the window. The market will have changed, and I will have had no idea what I\u2019m talking about and we should start to seriously consider buying precious metals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* Last week's rally was driven by both fundamental/technical factors but due to the ferocity of the rally we have since diverged, *bigly.*\n* Notice Monday: money was flooding into strong stocks like Amazon/Netflix/AMD ect.. but shit stocks like Ford/Airlines/Lyft were getting sucked dry. It would appear that MMs are currently positioning for some sort of broader downturn as we continue to go sideways but sorta upwards in the meantime. \n* If you think of TA as Sin(), and Fundamental as Cos(), I believe they\u2019re just about to close in on a point of maximum divergence soon.\n* What happens when they start converging again? idk. you tell me.\n* If you do TA yourself or follow any number of TA charters, one term that is currently being echoed is \u201cbeautiful TA\u201d Why is it considered beautiful? Why are the charts suddenly so clean and elegant? Why were the magic crayons swapped out for an artisan's brush?\n* Stubborn traders that only look at the fundamentals and complain about the divergence have become blind to a real beauty passing by on the other side. They will continue to lose in the coming weeks.\n* Last week a wet towel was wrung out once, it is customary to wring a towel a 2nd time to get the remaining water out.\n* For this reason we are most likely going to follow the TA and complete the ascending wedge for the rest of this week at least. This channel will most likely finish somewhat close to the next fib level.\n* My base case is an eventual slow, and drawn-out downturn for reasons highlighted in the useless chunks before this section. *It will not be easy to profit off of.* Don\u2019t be tricked: We may enter a downturn soon, but it will be one where Circuit-breakers will most likely be both sparse and scarce in between; likewise the same can be said about VIX spikes. We won\u2019t be seeing a lot of them anytime soon until a crash  occurs in one of the credit-markets in a couple of months. Meanwhile, if they are doing everything in their power to delay whatever they\u2019re trying to prevent, make no mistake, **it will be delayed.**\n* Prognosis for the next couple of weeks: Gay. 50 shades of it. The elevators are all broken but we might hop off some stairs a couple times; I still think it\u2019s going to be a delayed/drawn-out downturn regardless-- simply because that\u2019s what **they** are trying to do.\n* Try to daytrade. If you\u2019re long gamma look for short trades. Be a bandit. *Be like water.* Any positions (excluding LEAPS) held for more than a week is going to end up going belly up. \n\n&gt;**We're in a vast ocean, the ocean won't shed a tear when you lose all your investments. There is no such thing as easy money. Be safe in your trades and irl. GLHF**\n\nWith that being said, looking back I may sound like I'm against anyone betting on a big drop so i wanted to clarify:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you see an opportunity for calls/puts, execute on your intuition. I don't intend to dissuade anyone from making money, but I implore you to have the time-frame in question well thought out ahead of time. There's going to be a lot bullshit happening in between lucrative+volatile time-frames during \"dry-out periods\". Don't be caught in one of these FOMOing. There's money to be made, but it's not going to be as no-brainer as mid-Feb to mid-March, because everybody is expecting it. That's the main purpose of this piece.",

As far as the US goes, the political situation is looking bleak, and I don't expect it to recover soon.

I trust our policy in dealing with Covid and the economy much more than I do the US right now.

When we were at 28,000 I was telling my friends that this thing needs to go to at least 18 to 16,000. And it did go to 18,000 and I still did not pull the trigger. I was looking at Disney visa JP Morgan Exxon chevron and a few others and I didn\u2019t do a damn thing. When it got to 18k and all kinds of crap was going on and we started bailing people out again I thought we may be going to 15k. I was wrong.\nWe don\u2019t seem to even care about unemployment, we just print more cash and lower rates.  I doubt the deaths in us even get to 50k now.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 27th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks face headwinds as investors look forward to a big earnings week, a Fed meeting and state reopenings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/24/stocks-face-headwinds-as-investors-look-forward-to-a-big-earnings-week-a-fed-meeting-and-state-reopenings.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The stock market is struggling to make headway, as a big week of events rolls around, including a Federal Reserve meeting, the first look at post-shutdown economic growth and earnings from more than a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 companies.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s a busy week for earnings, and some of the biggest blue chips are likely to join the growing list of companies withdrawing guidance amid the uncertainty of how the coronavirus and shutdowns are impacting their business. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Boeing and McDonald\u2019s are among about 140 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting first quarter results.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the progress of the reopening of business activity in some states, like Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma and South Carolina. At the same time, President Donald Trump said he may extend social distancing guidelines into early summer. Many states, including the hardest hit, remain completely shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher Friday, but the major indices had their first negative week in three as oil prices cratered and then steadied in the mid-teens. The S&amp;P 500 has been trading on both sides of the key 2,800 level, as investors focused on murky corporate outlooks and uncertainty surrounding the timing of the reopening of the economy. Even though several states are resuming some activities, Trump said he disagreed with Georgia\u2019s plan to reopen.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P closed at 2,836, down 1.3% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the first quarter have been bleak so far, down about 14% based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Second quarter results are expected to be far worse, declining 32.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf you take a look where the real battle is in the market, it\u2019s a fundamental story,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. \u201cThe fundamentals are that the market should be lower, and on the other hand, the Fed is kind of putting their thumb on the scale in favor of the market.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said it\u2019s the potential for recurrences of the outbreak that\u2019s being watched to see if businesses can remain open once they start back up. \u201cPeople are watching what\u2019s going on in places like Georgia, but they\u2019re also watching what\u2019s going on in Singapore and places in Asia that are opening up,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s really one thing that really matters. It\u2019s not the Fed. The virus is going to own the agenda, whether we want it to or not.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed bazooka\n&gt; The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, and while it\u2019s not expected to take any new action, it will likely discuss the many programs it quickly rolled out to support the economy and provide liquidity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m anticipating no actions in terms of anything with purchases or interest rate movements,\u201d said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to hear a lot more in terms of their description of what\u2019s working and the things that still need to happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tilley said the Fed\u2019s job is also to instill confidence, and its asset purchase and other programs to support mortgages, corporate credit and municipal bonds, helped bring back in spreads that had been widening out across the credit markets. \u201cIt looked like we were headed for a seizure in credit markets, but they\u2019ve come back in,\u201d he said, adding he expects the Fed to also discuss programs like its support for the small business lending program.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is also expected to sound optimistic about the central bank\u2019s ability to help the economy, despite the uncertainty as the economy falls into an unprecedented decline in the second quarter. Tilley said he expects the economy to contract in the second quarter by 40%.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said this Fed meeting isn\u2019t as important as others have been, since the central bank has already taken so many extraordinary policy steps and promises to do more as needed.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed has made it clear if they need to provide liquidity to the market, they\u2019re not going to wait for a meeting to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re borrowing from a bank or whether you\u2019re borrowing in the capital markets, that capital is available so the economy can move ... the net effect is it also pushes the stock market up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Economic impact\n&gt; First quarter gross domestic product numbers are expected Wednesday, and it will be the first look at how the early weeks of the shutdown impacted the broader economy. Forecasts are wide ranging, and the consensus forecast from Refinitiv is now for a contraction of 4.1%. Economists expect the second quarter to take the biggest hit of the recession, and it is forecast by many to show a contraction of more than 30%.\n*****\n&gt; Some of the early second-quarter data will be released in the coming week. Vehicle sales slowed to a trickle in April, and auto makers shut down production.\n*****\n&gt; The impact of that should show up in Friday\u2019s April vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing, but the single-most important data point will be Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims, expected again to show millions of workers signed up for unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; So far, 26.5 million unemployment claims have been filed in the last five weeks, wiping out all the job gains made since the end of the Great Recession. The employment report for April will be released on May 8, and economists say unemployment will likely peak in April or May before falling off.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ll probably see an unemployment rate at 20% or a little higher,\u201d Tilley said.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings\n&gt; Earnings reports are expected from a range of industries, such as tech, health care, energy and defense. Merck, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Humana and Anthem are among health care names reporting. Big oil companies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron both release results on Friday, and their comments on how they are reacting to the shocking decline in crude oil prices this past week will be important.\n*****\n&gt; An oil futures contract for May dove into negative territory Monday and Tuesday, as did prices in many spot markets. That contract expired Tuesday, and the June futures contract for West Texas Intermediate settled at $16.94 per barrel Friday, down about 7.3% for the week and about $5 lower than the price of Brent futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe most important earnings story is not what happens this quarter, It\u2019s how long does it take to get back to peak earnings again,\u201d said Golub. \u201cMy estimate is this is going to take three years to get back to peak profits. But the estimates right now are reflecting that it\u2019s going to turn back to normal by something closer to the third quarter of next year. I think that\u2019s too optimistic.The second part of the earnings story is how fast estimates are coming down.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said first quarter earnings per share look to be down a little more than 12%, though some estimates have them down 16% or 17%. \u201cWe had 10 very healthy weeks and three not healthy weeks. The fact you could have such a negative quarter with only three bad week, that\u2019s really bad.\u201d Golub said. His forecast is for a 40% decline in second quarter profits.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3vJvFZR.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/B4Di7Fh.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/7XXBq3H.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/QyE3rll.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jyp5KqQ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fCYKkgg.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PdPKvec.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sEY6EDm.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/QuCVREP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/gkpOUiT.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GrUMf6m.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Election-year Mays: DJIA\u2019s Second Worst Month\n\n&gt; May officially marks the beginning of the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d for the DJIA and S&amp;P. To wit: \u201cSell in May and go away.\u201d Our \u201cBest Six Months Switching Strategy,\u201d created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader\u2019s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $1,068,826 for November-April in 69 years compared to just $1,461 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 compounded to $823,326 for November-April in 69 years compared to a gain of just $9,537 for May-October.\n\n&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d. It used to be part of what we called the \u201cMay/June disaster area.\u201d From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.\n\n&gt; In the years since 1997, May\u2019s performance has been erratic; DJIA up eleven times in the past twenty-two years (three of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down \u2013 11.9% in 2000, followed by twelve sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010. Election Year Mays rank at or near the bottom, registering net losses on DJIA and S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972) and Russell 1000 and 2000 (since 1980).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fac23214c1353f0b68d7710f6f7886a1/2eed74513d6bc154-86/s400x600/2540f531fb63ceab611b44ad7e0a2c0165670319.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# LPL Office Talk: Putting The Rally In Perspective\n\n&gt; One month ago today the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed after a vicious bear market. Was this the ultimate bottom? We\u2019ll have to wait and see, but what we do know is the rally we\u2019ve seen over the past month is nearly as historic as the drop coming into it was.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe recently had the best 20-day rally for the S&amp;P 500 since March 2009 and one of the best ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLooking back at the previous best 20-day rallies, one thing is consistent: very strong returns going out a year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 10 previous best 20-day rallies for the S&amp;P 500 saw continued gains after some near-term volatility. In fact, six months later stocks were higher 9 of 10 times and a full year later higher 10 of 10 times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Picture-4.23.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why The Recent Strength Has Bulls Smiling\n\n&gt; The huge equity rally continued last week, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up another 3%, on the heels of adding more than 15% in the previous week. The gain during the past two weeks of 15.5% was the greatest since October 1974. Taking it a step further, the 15 trading days ending April 14 saw the S&amp;P 500 up more than 27%, one of the greatest rallies ever. What we\u2019ve been seeing is truly historic, so the big question now is: What could happen next?\n\n&gt; \u201cThis remarkable rally has caught most off guard, but what might surprise many to hear is more gains could eventually be in store in 2020,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve seen similar blasts of extreme short-term strength, stocks have been quite strong going out 6- to 12-months.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was up nine of 10 times six months later and higher every single time a year later after the previous best 15-day gains ever. Be aware though, some of the returns in the near-term were weak, suggesting a pullback after such a strong move is likely. Still, this much strength in such a short timeframe could very well suggest the rest of 2020 could have bulls smiling.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Market-returns-4.20.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dogs of the Dow Performance So Far in 2020\n\n&gt; The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 16.24% on a total return basis so far in 2020. Below we take a look at how the \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy has performed so far this year.\n\n&gt; The \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy is a very passive approach that simply says to buy the 10 stocks in the Dow 30 that have the highest dividend yields at the start of each year. The Dogs list for 2020 was led by Dow Inc. (DOW) with a yield of 5.12% on January 1st. Exxon Mobil (XOM), IBM, Verizon (VZ), Chevron (CVX), Pfizer (PFE), 3M (MMM), Walgreens (WBA), Cisco (CSCO), and Coca-Cola (KO) are the nine other members of the Dogs for 2020.\n\n&gt; As shown in the table below, the Dogs are down an average of 19.37% on a total return basis in 2020, which is a little less than five percentage points worse than the 14.68% decline seen for the 20 non-Dogs this year. Dow Inc. (DOW) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) have been the two worst performing Dogs with respective YTD declines of 39.9% and 37.0%. Dow's dividend yield has risen from 5.12% up to 8.47%, while XOM's yield has risen from 4.99% up to 7.91%. There are no Dogs that are up on the year, but Verizon (VZ) and Pfizer (PFE) have been the best performers of the group with YTD declines of less than 5%.\n\n&gt; Of the non-Dogs, Boeing (BA) has been by far the worst performer with a YTD decline of 60.01%. At the start of 2020, BA had a dividend yield of 2.52%, but that dividend has been suspended. JP Morgan (JPM), American Express (AXP) and Disney (DIS) have all fallen more than 30% YTD, while Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Microsoft (MSFT) are the only three Dow stocks that are up on the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/2020dogs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Investors Giving Companies a Pass on Earnings So Far\n\n&gt; We're now two weeks into the Q1 2020 earnings season, and just over 200 companies have reported their numbers so far. The average one-day price change for the stocks that have reported earnings so far this season has been a gain of 0.89%. That's much stronger than the average one-day gain of 0.06% seen for all stocks that have reported earnings since 2001.\n\n&gt; As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have averaged a one-day price gain of 2.16% on their earnings reaction days. That's stronger than the average one-day gain of 1.89% seen on earnings reaction days for all stocks that have reported since 2001. Stocks that have missed EPS estimates this season have seen a one-day decline of 0.72% on their earnings reaction days. Historically, the average stock that has missed EPS has fallen 3.56% on its earnings reaction day, so this season's decline of just 0.72% suggests that investors are basically giving a pass to companies missing estimates in Q1.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/avgearn.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators\n\n&gt; Even though most economic data releases this week that had forecasts exceeded those estimates (10 of 15), data continues to come in very weak. The Chicago Fed\u2019s National Activity index started off the week coming in at \u20134.19 which was well below estimates of \u20133. Existing home sales followed up on Tuesday, and despite coming in above estimates, sales slowed considerably from February. Elsewhere in housing data, new home sales collapsed down to 627K SAAR compared to 765K last month. Meanwhile, February home prices showed some acceleration. Jobless claims also were better than expected, but they too remain at extremely elevated levels relative to the rest of history. Manufacturing data was a major area of weakness this week. Both the preliminary Markit PMI and Kansas City Fed reading fell significantly despite coming in better than forecast. Hard manufacturing data on Friday was likewise bad at the headline level though under the hood there were some silver linings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Turning to next week, like the earnings calendar, the economic calendar ramps up with a total of 34 releases. We will get the final two regional Federal Reserve indices from Dallas and Richmond on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, followed by the final Markit and ISM reading for April on Friday. Wednesday will be the most closely watched day of the week with the first release of Q1 GDP as well as an FOMC rate decision. Growth in the first quarter is expected to show a 3.8% contraction. Although no change in rates is being forecast, Fed Chair Powell\u2019s following presser will likely be closely watched for a monetary policy update.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and More)\n\n&gt; The earnings calendar has begun to ramp up over the past two weeks and over the next two weeks we will see peak earnings season. Next week there are a total of 784 companies scheduled to release earnings. Of those, there are 178 S&amp;P 500 stocks, which is 35.% of the index.\n\n&gt; In the table below we show the 30 largest stocks (by market cap) that are scheduled to report next week. None of the largest stocks report on Monday, but the two Dow pharmaceutical stocks, Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), kick things off Tuesday morning. The trillion dollar market cap club will all report next week with Microsoft (MSFT) out with earnings Wednesday night and Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) out the following evening. Two other notable releases Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, will be the major payment processors Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). Friday will be capped off with two oil giants: Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Other honorable mentions not on this list reporting next week include industrial bell-weather Caterpillar (CAT), stocks likely benefiting from the COVID economy like Colgate Palmolive (CL) and Clorox (CLX), and finally, some travel and leisure stocks like Expedia (EXPE), Royal Caribbean (RCL), United Airlines (UAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Earnings-table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gold Bounces Right Where It Was Supposed To\n\n&gt; With central banks around the world unleashing waves of liquidity, there have been heightened concerns that one result will be a decline in the purchasing power of our money. For that reason, a number of investors have been flocking to gold. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, gold prices had been in a solid uptrend, and while prices spiked as the crisis first began, they couldn't quite get above the $1,650 - $1,700 range. In mid-March even, prices plummeted with just about every other financial asset before quickly recovering. Once again, though, the rally stalled at resistance. This time around, though, the 50-day moving average was strong enough to provide support and after that test, gold finally got the long-awaited breakout that investors had been waiting for.\n\n&gt; Gold's price spiked as high as $1,787 per ounce in mid-April before running out of momentum. When a stock or commodity breaks out above resistance to new highs and then pulls back, the former resistance level should act as support, and that is exactly what we saw this time around. This week, gold bounced right on cue at around $1,700 and has since rallied 2.6%. With the first test of support proving successful, look for gold to now establish a new range with a floor at around $1,700. At least that's what the technical analysis textbooks would say.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/042320-Gold.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$CBSH** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$GILD** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$AWI** \n&gt; * **$CHKP** \n&gt; * **$MRK** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$WHR** \n&gt; * **$QCOM** \n&gt; * **$BP** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$CLX** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$CMS** \n&gt; * **$CNX** \n&gt; * **$APRN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/lRp3xer.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/Yw1LKpH.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HW4ersg.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KnhCH1m.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XeUrTNF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/20sK5un.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QXrGzmn.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tSP1S0Y.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Sn4QllI.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/DhxQrOU.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1CpjzdJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/raeflTF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/43jb0Pu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/axhdXpO.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/wiL7F9e.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HZkJ2ai.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Amazon.com, Inc. -\n&gt; **Amazon.com, Inc.

Not a new concept on wsb, but I was surprised when I got in at such low premiums. I've already made good tendies and I know that by posting here I'm willing this market to destroy every dollar of gains, but I've lurked long and gained and want to pay it forward. \n\n**NAT (tankers, for the truly retarded) is on a consistent rise for months, the issues with crude supply mean fundamentally it should only continue to rise, it didn't dip when the market did and shouldn't when the market dips again, and it's trying to be the popular girl among tanker tickers**\n\nA few important factors in the next two months:  \n\\- June prices are about to take a big shit, hence USO rolling past June contracts preemptively to [slow their inevitable implosion](https://i.imgur.com/5Cf851d.jpg). Demand for storage will increase.  \n\\- Brent June contracts expire 4/30 , already seeing [the dip](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/brnm20?countrycode=uk)   \n\\- WTI June contracts expire 5/18, the same day as NAT earnings. Earnings are gonna be so Big Dick, that this on top of an inevitable bottom-price, potentially negative (though not as negative) future price is gonna make the news, which we sell.  \n\\- Brent July exp soon after, 5/29\n\nOil prices up oil stocks up?? Etf down?? Up???? Who fucking knows. But oil prices go down BECAUSE supply is too high, and that isn't changing, and even if it does, futures will maintain demand for storage. Something about mangos. Every time oil dips below $10 we are gonna get more news, and people will throw money into tankers.\n\nWhy NAT and not $MYBOYFRIEND'STANKER ?  \nBecause they keep talking about [how big their dick is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blqp2f0YBj8) on fucking cnbc, and if I've learned anything about this market, it's that dumbshit groupthink and popularity is as important, if not more, than any fundamentals.

Also there is a TLDR at the bottom for all of you degenerates out there.\n\nBelow is my case against the price of corn first starting with the supply side then looking at the demand side.\n\n**Supply Side**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Up 8% from last year based on the latest estimate from the USDA [https://release.nass.usda.gov/reports/pspl0320.pdf](https://release.nass.usda.gov/reports/pspl0320.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* About 7% is in the ground now, new reports come out every Monday here [https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/8336h188j](https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/8336h188j)\n* Soybean value and corn v. Soybean rotation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you aren\u2019t going to plant corn then your other option is to plant soybeans and corn is still projected to be more profitable than soybeans. The only potential upside for soybeans was China buying a significant amount of them under the new trade deal but they are actually buying less from the US because they are getting them cheaper from Brazil [https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3081459/coronavirus-us-farm-sales-china-hit-bumper-soybean-crop](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3081459/coronavirus-us-farm-sales-china-hit-bumper-soybean-crop)\n* Its hard to switch last minute because many farmers rotate corn v. Soybeans. If you grow the same crop in consecutive years then you pay a yield penalty due to chemical imbalances in the soil. Whereas if you switch soybeans and corn year after year then you maximize the amount you will grow. So a lot of farmers planning to plant corn would probably pay a yield penalty if they switched to soybeans\n* From what I can tell farmers seem relatively hard headed and will plant corn due to FOMO and/or they are set in their ways [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usda-crops-plantings/us-farmers-plan-huge-corn-crop-despite-price-drop-ethanol-collapse-idUSKBN21I391](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usda-crops-plantings/us-farmers-plan-huge-corn-crop-despite-price-drop-ethanol-collapse-idUSKBN21I391)\n* If anything I think farmers will plant more corn than expected\n\n**Demand Side**\n\n[http://www.worldofcorn.com/#corn-usage-by-segment](http://www.worldofcorn.com/#corn-usage-by-segment)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* animal feed (40%)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Breakdown by animal category [http://www.worldofcorn.com/#corn-feed-by-species](http://www.worldofcorn.com/#corn-feed-by-species)\n* Slaughterhouses/processing plants closed due to COVID. Means that in the short term there are slightly more animals to feed but doesn\u2019t really move the needle. [https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/agriculture/042320-closure-of-us-meat-plants-raises-more-concerns-over-long-term-corn-feed-demand](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/agriculture/042320-closure-of-us-meat-plants-raises-more-concerns-over-long-term-corn-feed-demand) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Another thing to consider is that although animal counts may be elevated short term, feed structure could change to higher fiber diets (less corn) in an effort to make animals grow slower offsetting the potential effect of having more animals to feed [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/meat-shortage-looms-as-coronavirus-shuts-packing-plants-leaving-farmers-with-tough-choices-2020-04-24](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/meat-shortage-looms-as-coronavirus-shuts-packing-plants-leaving-farmers-with-tough-choices-2020-04-24)\n* If there continue to be plant shutdowns farmers will begin depopulating at higher rates. Industry operates on a just in time inventory system and plan which plants they will sell stock to far in advance. If that plant is closed at planned time of harvest they have to destroy product \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* hogs [https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-farmers-trying-to-find-markets-for-their-hogs-and-save-their-livelihoods/569927872/](https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-farmers-trying-to-find-markets-for-their-hogs-and-save-their-livelihoods/569927872/)  \n* chickens [https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/25/us/chickens-depopulated-delmarva-plants-delaware-maryland/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/25/us/chickens-depopulated-delmarva-plants-delaware-maryland/index.html)\n* In general this demand segment will likely have little impact on corn price unless meat plants are shut down longer than expected\n* Ethanol (30% - 40%)\n* US ethanol plants [http://www.worldofcorn.com/#us-ethanol-production-facilities](http://www.worldofcorn.com/#us-ethanol-production-facilities)\n* obviously demand for ethanol is a lot weaker due to gasoline. Ethanol in storage is also at an all time high, meaning even if demand went up there is a massive stockpile that needs to be run through before it makes sense to ramp up production again [https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=W\\_EPOOXE\\_SAE\\_NUS\\_MBBL&amp;f=W](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=W_EPOOXE_SAE_NUS_MBBL&amp;f=W)\n* The big one is the EPA may not require gasoline refineries at all [https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/493402-epa-weighs-lifting-ethanol-requirements-for-oil-refiners](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/493402-epa-weighs-lifting-ethanol-requirements-for-oil-refiners)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Obviously this would destroy the demand for ethanol. The reason I think the chances of this happening are higher than people think is simple: Trump cares about the performance of the market above all. It doesn\u2019t matter if this move is right or wrong all that matters to Trump is how to save the image he has tried to build of being the \u2018stock market president\u2019. Also it makes sense from a purely economic standpoint.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Bankruptcies in U.S. shale would have a much larger impact on the economy than any bankruptcies experienced by corn or ethanol producers. Why? Leverage. U.S. shale is leveraged to the tits. Because of the higher leverage in energy vs. ethanol/agriculture, a dollar saved in oil is worth more than a dollar saved in ag. [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-usa-restructuring/bankruptcy-looms-over-u-s-energy-industry-from-oil-fields-to-pipelines-idUSKCN2250FQ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-usa-restructuring/bankruptcy-looms-over-u-s-energy-industry-from-oil-fields-to-pipelines-idUSKCN2250FQ)\n* Even bigger than that is the impact defaults in U.S. energy could have on debt markets and the overall market in general. Massive bad debt buildups have been the precursor to every major recession or depression [https://moneyweek.com/501844/chart-of-the-week-us-corporate-debt-bubble-ready-to-burst](https://moneyweek.com/501844/chart-of-the-week-us-corporate-debt-bubble-ready-to-burst)\n* There has never been a bigger debt bubble in this country than right now. Corporate debt is now over 50% of the US economy [https://www.salon.com/2020/03/29/the-sad-state-of-us-and-global-economic-affairs\\_partner/](https://www.salon.com/2020/03/29/the-sad-state-of-us-and-global-economic-affairs_partner/)\n* Much of that debt is \u2018junk\u2019 below investment grade status that is was already considered high risk before oil had a double black swan event of demand destruction and supply increase. Energy accounts for 15% of the US junk bond market. \n* If the massive bubble of corporate debt sees major defaults it will burst and we will enter a major global depression. By decreasing the number of defaults in US energy you decrease the odds of the worst case scenario becoming a reality.\n* Oil is more important than ethanol and therefore corn when it comes to limiting overall economic downside.\n\n**Conclusion** A lot of this shit is probably priced in. Everyone knows ethanol demand should be weak. There are also factors that I don\u2019t discuss above: weather, exports, available storage capacity for ethanol and corn, potential timeline for slaughterhouse shutdowns, etc. However I think there are two major things that are not currently priced into corn, and that in general potential downside for this commodity is much larger than potential upside. I don\u2019t think price accurately represents 1: the odds that farmers plant more corn than expected because outlook for the major alternative soybeans has only gotten worse. And 2: I think the chance of the EPA reducing or eliminating ethanol requirements is way higher than the market seems to and in fact I think it would actually make a lot of sense to do this in the short term from a purely economic standpoint. It\u2019s cheaper to pay off farmers and ethanol plants than it would be to see mass defaults in U.S. oil. A massive failure in HY credit markets triggered by energy defaults could lead a U.S. debt crisis sending the entire global economy into a major depression. Even if the EPA keeps the ethanol requirement corn is still fucked, it's probably going to be largest harvest ever and really weak demand.\n\n**TLDR** CORN $12p 11/20",

        "selftext": "Listen up autists. I see a lot of posts complaining about the fed's actions and why the market should not be going up. Disclaimer: I have not a single clue what the market is going to do next week or the next month for that matter.\n\nLet's slow down and think about this though. The federal reserve comes in during times of economic hardship such as '08. What they didn't do in '08 was provide liquidity when we needed it most. This caused mass hysteria and people were worried that the banks were going to go bankrupt. Hence, the market crashed in fear of the whole fucking system going under.\n\nTheir recent actions are an attempt to prevent this crisis from happening again. But what it tells us is that the fed knows we are in deep shit right now. Jerome wouldn't be taking these actions if he truly believed in a v-recovery. The printing right now and uptick in the balance sheet is unprecedented. While one may argue that this goes against the free market, shutting down businesses was the first strike against the free market. The government cannot shut down businesses without supporting them.\n\nWhat does this tell us? It means that the credit market is going to be okay and that the system likely isn't going to fail us. This is good. It also means that growth is likely to be limited during the next couple of years. While the fed can provide stimulus to sustain markets for the present, it cannot flip the switch on the economy. The layoffs and drop in CPI over the last two months will have long term effects and they know that just as much as you do.\n\nBesides being mad at Jpow, read between the lines. \n\nPositions: SPY 7/17 240 P\n\nEdit: positions, spelling",

        "selftext": "Ok idiots, from a fellow retard to other retards here\u2019s my bull case, followed by a bear case. \n\n1) The huge and rapid sell of mid-March was not just corona, it was also a liquidity crisis that had been brewing since the FED started QE and Repo back in Sept. The rapid economic downturn and the JPows printer jumped in hard and fast, providing liquidity for markets. That solved an issue that was helping driving the sell off and has been a huge source of anxiety of the markets pre/corona. If you think corona was the only thing that produced multiple circuit breakers in March then you are stupid and there\u2019s no help. \n\n2) People really do believe that the fundamentals of the world economy and international market systems are not on par with 2008, which was a real financial crisis of epic proportions. Not just the flu with paranoia as a symptom. A leading component of the massive March sell-off was the idea that a recession was in order. But there\u2019s little evidence to suggest that a genuine recession is about to happen. this will be a quick recovery. Aka not really a recession. I\u2019ve driven by multiple car dealerships in the past few days and you know what they are advertising? 64-80 months of 0% APR on cars. What does that tell you? People think that once the virus has calmed down, people are going to go bananas over lower interest rates and start buying shit like crazy. \n\n3) In sum, the virus is overblown and the Fed\u2019s actions have, inadvertently, helped continue a massive bull run. They\u2019ve solved the liquidity crisis that came with the Fed\u2019s plans to roll back QE and repo in April (originally proposed in beginning of Feb, before the virus really hit american markets) and the market panic of March. \n\nSo what we might be seeing is the groundwork being laid for another bull run and a massive bubble. \nV shaped recovery. \n\n***Bear case*** \n\n1) the virus is actually quite bad and opening up the economy will not immediately result in everyone having their jobs back. If the economy even opens back up. Huge unemployment numbers plus the Fed\u2019s desire to reduce the levels of QE and Repo and Bond purchases, will re-introduce the liquidity issue, which combined with huge unemployment numbers, will result in another leg down. \n\n2) solvency issues. How many companies are about to go bankrupt? If movie theaters cannot open until the fall, then Hollywood is down the shitter. Just think about all of those companies with terrible balance sheets, debt that they cannot pay back, negative cash flow (cough Seaworld cough), we will see sectors of the economy, and the millions of jobs attached to them, drop like a lead ballon. \n\nConclusion: \n\nBull case; coronavirus induced massive and unprecedented action by the Fed, which has inadvertently given new legs for another bull run. That\u2019s all premised on most of the economy and most people getting back to work, having money, and being able to buy cars, max our credit cards, get loans, and buy homes, at historically retarded low interest levels. \n\nBear case: Certain industries are beyond fucked and they will tank, and when they tank, unemployment will continue to stay high, which means no one will be able to take advantage of historically low levels of interest rates. They won\u2019t be buying shit cause they got no jobs. Which will result in loan defaults and a real financial crisis. \n\nI\u2019m leaning toward the bear case this week. But I know JPow and his unlimited printers will come out with something novel and unprecedented which will give rise to another short term bull run. \n\nBut it all depends on if people will actually get their jobs back. Unemployment numbers haven\u2019t tanked the marker yet, but that moment is coming, I think. You cannot have these levels of unemployment and markets rising forever. Unless we reopen big and soon. \n\nThoughts?\n\nPositions: your mom, doggy style. Doubled bagged. \n\nSPY 350c 06/15 \n\nOr \n\nSPY 200p 06/17",

Now's your chance to get in on something that hasn't been pRIceD iN.\n\n\nHis original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2kbv8/dd_flir_thermal_cameras/\n](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2kbv8/dd_flir_thermal_cameras/)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo his first point. Yes, high temperature and fever is a symptom of Coronavirus. But, it's turning out a lot of people are actually carrying this virus asymptomatically. It doesn't matter though. A lot of governments, companies, and individuals are itching to get back to normal. Do you seriously think large sporting events, conferences, restaurants, and offices are just going to be shut down for the year? Fuck no! The relatively small cost of a few thousand to placate the public and provide false sense of security is well worth the cost. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBoth the market and public, especially in red/purple states, are eating up the bullshit Donnie is hyping up about America being back to business May 1st. The White House has also released some guidelines about how the businesses can \"safely\" open back up. \n\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/ykRWOGd](https://imgur.com/a/ykRWOGd)\n\nSource: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/#criteria](https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/#criteria)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWell, why don't companies just buy cheap thermal temperature scanners from China? Besides the [obvious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rt26Wn_XE2I&amp;loop=0), advanced thermal scanners allow companies to scan people more rapidly, accurately and safely. \n\nFurther reading: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-thermal-cameras-fo/as-fever-checks-become-the-norm-in-coronavirus-era-demand-for-thermal-cameras-soars-idUSKCN21R2SF\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWell, why FLIR? Because it's public so you can actually fucking trade it, unlike most other thermal imaging companies. They are also [well-positioned](https://www.flir.com/products/flir-a320/) for the upcoming surge in demand as their products are tailored specifically for testing people. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOverall, $FLIR stands well-positioned to profit bigly from governments and companies, whether this virus turns out to be as bad as we \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b's expect or a giant nothingburger, due to pressure from governments and fear from the general public. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOne last note: earnings are expected to be released 4/22, premarket. Not that I think bad earnings this quarter will negatively affect the price in this completely irrational bull trap. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI yolo'd 20x $40c for 5/15 because they were fucking goddamn cheap. The smart play would be either $35c 5/15 or $50c 7/17 per /u/Vainglory27 's advice \n\n\nGoodluck, retards.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: grammatical errors and spacing",

However, i believe i have gone a bit overboard on the safe stocks and i have quite a lot so it might be hard to keep a track of them. i've thought about doing ETFs but i'm using trading 212 which dont offer the good ones like SPY, VOO, QQQ etc so i preferred going for individual stocks.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/TK8542q](https://imgur.com/a/TK8542q)\n\nRun Down:\n\n**Airbus**: Bought this as a more risky stock was between this or boeing and after doing some research i came to the conclusion that airbus was the safer bet.\n\n**Google**: Pretty safe bet, bound to rise long term.\n\n**Amazon**: Pretty self explanatory, personally think it is a must for any portfolio\n\n**Apple**: Again same thought process as google and amazon\n\n**AstraZeneca**: Invested in these as more of a risky bet, I read recently that they had teamed up with oxford university to help develop a cure for COVID-19.\n\n**Delta Air Lines**: A stable (ish) airline bit more risky but hopeful it will rise after this crisis is over.\n\n**Greggs**: I just like greggs as a company being northern myself, i do also believe that they have some room to grow with them successfully going into the vegan pastry market with steak bakes and sausage rolls (which taste nice also). They are also expanding in the southern areas of the UK.\n\n**Global Clean Energy**: I wanted to have something in the clean energy sector but couldn't decide on a single stock so i bought this ETF instead.\n\n**UK Property**: Risky one which is why i haven't put much money on it.\n\n**JPMorgan**: Only one i didn't do much research on but from the few articles i read it look promising to rise long term.\n\n**Mastercard:** Pretty solid one to rise long term\n\n**Visa:** Pretty solid one to rise long term (couldnt decide on a single one so went for both V &amp; MA)\n\n**Microsoft:** Another one i believe should be in any portfolio.\n\n**Nike:** Wanted a stock in retail and nike seemed like the best, good financials and good marketing in the sector\n\n**NAT:** Was a low price and with the current situation bound to rise after the earning report in may\n\n**Nvidia**: I like the work they do with GPU an AI so i believe this will rise long term.\n\n**PXD**: An innovative company in their field from doing research it looks like they will be on the up.\n\n**RTX**: Another risky one but i'm gambling that the price will rise\n\n**Shell**: Unsure wether to sell this one or not, i've seen that they slashed their dividends so guessing it will be a slow recovery.\n\n**Simon Property Group**: Owns a lot of US Malls which open soon so hoping this will go up.\n\n**Sony:** Bought purely for the PS5, although they arn't doing well in other sectors i think this will help them considerably.\n\n**Tesla:** bit controversial but i like the innovation, didn't put that much money into it though as its quite unknown atm.\n\n**Disney**: Again bought for the long term.\n\nOther stocks i was looking at: Netflix, FB, Johnston &amp; Johnstone, Proctor &amp; Gamble, maybe mcdonalds.\n\nEssentially what i want to know is how this is looking for longterm investment, I plan on adding to microsoft and amazon every month, but i didn't know if this want a normal amount of stocks to have or am i better selling some and putting that money back into the big ones like Microsoft, Amazon, Apple etc.",

Those calls are really just a flimsy excuse for casual banter. Arguably, you could drop the facade but doing so is not likely to be acceptable in the longer run. Moreover, quite a few people have voiced irritation with the fact that if you work from home, you're never not at work and days have no structure.

        "selftext": " \n\nTLDR apologies, I might've been trapped inside for too long but...\n\nI keep hearing on most media and among us retailers that the state of the wider economy will be bad for now but that the economy is much stronger than 2008 and the previous recession and we should get a quicker V shaped recovery. I'm confused by this narrative...\n\nGlobal debt has nearly risen two-fold, it is now 85% higher in 2019 than 2008, as we have tried to pump up deflating economies. Inflation has stagnated, asset prices have ballooned way above wages and real-wage growth has reversed and has now been declining since 2015. At the same time we've seen incredible stock market growth, some 120% on the S&amp;P in the decade 2010-20, in my limited understanding in part due to attempted inflationary monetary policy like QE etc.\n\nThat lending increase since 2008 ,on the back of very low interest rates and next to no inflation, means it's very easy for large caps in particular to leverage to the sky. So the 2008 mortgage backed debt default warning seems to me to have gone largely ignored. Many companies of all sizes look ripe for bankruptcy due to pretty tenuous balance sheets after lots of spending on buybacks, lack of investment in growth and lack of protection against demand or supply shocks (like this one right now).\n\nRay Dalio (big fan) has been pointing out for years we are due a massive correction as part of a long running debt cycle and we should see a crisis the like of the great depression, drawing many parallels with the 1920-30's global geopolitical atmosphere and today. I would highly encourage delving into one of his longer interviews or one of his books on the crises (below) where he explains the historical and macro economic precedent and the reasoning he uses.\n\n2018 interview explaining economic theory of the idea in which he predicts a lot of the corporate debt issues that are slowly coming out right now: [https://youtu.be/5C43i3yclec](https://youtu.be/5C43i3yclec)\n\nlink to his free open source book on the possible crisis: [https://www.bridgewater.com/big-debt-crises/Principles-For-Navigating-Big-Debt-Crises-By-Ray-Dalio.pdf](https://www.bridgewater.com/big-debt-crises/Principles-For-Navigating-Big-Debt-Crises-By-Ray-Dalio.pdf)\n\nThe Covid affects might be comparatively limited but the wider economic indicators are not so bullish and IMHO are not being talked about anywhere near as much as they should. I can't help but feel we're not headed for a 30-40% two quarter recession but that cyclical depression which could reset some of the global economic foundations and concurrently cause much greater market pain than many of us are thinking which will last not 6 months to 2 years but far far longer. The Dow took 29 years to reach it's previous high after the great depression (5100 points, 1929-58).\n\nThanks for the long read, please poke holes/ proffer solutions in the economic theory of the thing. I await any thoughts with much curiosity if you made it this far...",

This isn't going to happen, or, this isn't going to happen in the timeframe a retail investor thinks. \n\nSources:\n[1]. https://twitter.com/chigrl/status/1251493231394775041/photo/1\n[2]. https://twitter.com/rahrdes/status/1251528749398589440/photo/1\n[3]. https://twitter.com/bespokeinvest/status/1252220906845470720 JFC - this is a whole second piece on why QQQ is not living in our current recession world... but I'll leave that for someone else.\n[4]. https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/01/uso-hasnt-traded-this-low-ever.aspx - retail money jumping on that \"lowest ever\" FOMO train\n[5]. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-17/u-s-oil-fund-to-move-giant-wti-position-as-market-sours - uh oh\n[6]. https://etfdb.com/etf/USO/#fund-flows\n[7]. https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/crude%20oil%20-%20electronic\n\nObligatory: Not financial advice yada yada\n\nFor those of you following the oil market, you probably saw the headlines that oil is now to its lowest point since 19xx... $11-12 bottom line: crazy, but doesn't matter. What you saw is the tail end of Crude Oil May WTI contracts trading just before its close (tomorrow). This price is shockingly low, but the majority of the traders have already moved on to June contracts. Focus on the June contract (also shocking how much it moved and much more important right now) instead of the nearly dead May one. Let's begin... \n\nBackground:\nWhy are oil prices so low? Saudi Arabia and Russia and OPEC+ created a massive increase in supply after failed negotiations (This is itself an aftershock to a coordinated oversupply of the market in 2016 to fight US shale). This excess supply timed with a drop in demand as the world shut down due to corona virus. The result has meant that the market is flooded with oil and is looking for any place they can to store it. This storage crunch has even resulted in some bizarre cases of negative pricing (Canada in some places). This has all been especially damaging to US shale due to the high cost of extraction, the high levels of debt these companies have, and the slow reaction of the US to secure cuts to global or domestic output and a failure to provide relief money to this industry. \n\nDevelopment looking forward:\nPrices will stabilize when we have a good idea of when and how much demand there will be in the near-term, mid-term, and long-term. I say this in this way since we still do not know how US industry will reopen. Lots of plans are floating around, but what happens when we have a spike in cases in a few months? Boom, back to a shutdown, and guidance is once again thrown out the window. What is really great about looking month by month at oil contracts, is we can see the expected curve of economic recovery/ industrial demand, as the industry currently sees it [7]. What we can also see is today's movement is the dragging down further out contract prices as the nearterm (May / June) prices collapse. As we gain more information about how and when the economy will open, we can expect the price of oil to change accordingly.     \n\nWhat do I see:\nThere is still a ton of room left for oil to come down, but, stop looking at May and look forward. For ETFs like USO, which don't want the physical commodity showing up at their door, must \"roll forward\" their near-to-expiry contracts (cheap), into further out contracts (expensive). Today, as it stands, the near-term contracts (May/June) are massively cheaper than further out contracts. This means, as USO continues to roll its June contracts (22.59) out, they have to pay ~20%+ premium to secure contracts (July: 27.77). ***They are selling low and buying high due to the state of contango. As long as these market conditions persist, they won't begin to climb and will instead keep sinking.*** The oil futures are still pricing in a rather sharp recovery, but the more that gets nudged out, the worse for USO. If we keep saying \"V Shaped recovery, right around the corner\" then (as long as investors have faith in that plan) the commodity prices keep reflecting a V-up. As you approach expiration, and you kick the re-opening can down the road, near-expiry contracts sink (no one wants to pay to store the oil) and you keep contango going. As a result, USO continues downward. Even when this situation undwinds, USO will simply not return to previous highs due to the way it is structured. \n\nWhat am I afraid of:\nRetail investors have flooded USO with money in hopes of a sharp rebound. We know that retail investors are piling on, since the number of individuals has skyrocketed [1][2]. If real ***professional*** traders were the ones adding money, placing long bets, we would not have seen such an exponential increase in the number of accounts with holdings. This tells me the following: As contango continues, and USO drops / fails to grow over the next months, retail money will FOMO / margin call out. This outflow of money could have a drastic impact on the stability of the ETF, and, in turn, the overall US oil market. ***USO currently controls over 25% of all outstanding WTI contracts***. If the recent inflows to USO reverses, with a continued supply glut and decreased demand, we could see a destabilization of the ETF and broader market. If USO needs to quickly sell a massive number of contacts due to fund outflows and rebalancing, then the fund is at risk of a death spiral -&gt; Sell contracts to the market, drop in price due to low demand and high supply -&gt; further losses -&gt; further outflows -&gt; and on and on. This is not a likely situation, this can only happen if there is a massive + sustained + quick drop, followed by a massive and quick pull of funds from the ETF. However, the speed with which the ETF has grown has me worried for the way retail investors will react when their quick 200% sure-thing oil play becomes a -50% loss over the course of a month (or a week).\n\nTLDR: USO, where to Go? \nScared Money: Stay the fuck away from this.\nSmart Money: Call Credit Spreads. Take advantage of all the money which has poured into the fund, and which will continue to do so in the short term. They are waiting for a quick rebound once the economy reopens. The ETF is not structured for this, and will continue to suffer forward rolling loses. Collect your drip drip drip of oil premium and chill. Keep an eye on government intervention, be ready to exit early on bailouts.\nDumb Money: Buy short term calls for swing trading spikes - today might be a good gamble, oversold on the roll forward?\n\nPositions: OXY $7.5/5P 9/18 10 Contracts, EPD covered calls, trying to catch premium before getting assigned and holding for the next 5-10yrs, DRIP shares on the 10%+ dividend.",
