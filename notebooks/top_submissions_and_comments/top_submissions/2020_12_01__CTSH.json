        "selftext": "You're a complete and utter fool.  Let's take a look at the issues:\n\n1) No moat at all.  Sure they have 50% market share but there are competitors.  They're a delivery service - anyone can do what they do.  Not only does this pose a risk to market share, but it poses a huge risk to the already thin profit margins.  At some point (because of 2-4 below) they will have to lower their fees and take rate, which will hurt margins even more.\n\n2) No brand value or brand loyalty.  People couldn't care less who delivers their food, as long as it shows up on time and hot.  Early in COVID I was using Skipthedishes until I got frustrated with poor service so I left.  There is nothing to keep customers loyal to DoorDash if someone else offers better service, or the same service at a better price.\n\n3) Restaurants hate them.  DoorDash takes a huge cut, which forces restaurants to raise their prices.  I posted an example yesterday about a sandwich I ordered that was $13.95 on the restaurant's online menu but $18.95 on the DoorDash menu.  Restaurants have been using them out of necessity but they are already finding ways around it.  Many restaurants offer customers incentives for picking up their food.  There are reports of restaurants grouping together and doing their own shared delivery.  There are even reports of enterprising people starting their own local delivery services at lower rates.\n\n4) Future growth will plummet.  People have been using this service out of necessity but DoorDash doesn't provide a service that will permanently change the way people live.  People love eating in restaurants and will flock back to them as soon as it is safe/allowed to do so.  Do you really think that people are going to continue ordering in on weekends through an overpriced delivery service as soon as they can return to restaurants?\n\n5) The CEO reportedly defended the IPO price by saying they priced it at a level they thought fairly reflected the value of the company.  That means the CEO thinks the company is worth \\~$100/share.\n\nThis IPO was purely a case of ownership taking advantage of timing to raise as much cash as possible.  I wouldn't be surprised if this thing is trading at $30 a year from now.  This is going to be the FIT or GPRO of 2020 IPOs.",

        "selftext": "Hi all. I have been trading for 9 months- and wanted to share my experience for all those trying to navigate this different world. This is for people like me-- no experience in finance, interested in learning and growing knowledge, and starting out with no knowledge. \n\nMy background- Registered nurse in a hospital. I have no affiliations or interests in this post that are to sway anyone. I am posting this because I started out by investing time and lots of mistakes, and if I can help another newbie navigate in this community. \n\nInitial Investment in march: $3000  Current balance: $6200 \n\nPlatform: Webull. I chose it by recommendation of a coworker, and I personally like it but I have nothing to compare it to as its the only one I have used. I do like the afterhours trading ability. \n\nJust a few of many things I have learned.....\n\n1. Be skeptical of many if not most posters on forums. I went in naive, small town gal who believes in good-- that \"wow all these people must be right with their recommendations!\" I now take it lightly, note the ticker and do my due diligence.   I make sure to look at post history of anyone involved in stock discussions. I ignore anyone tagging multiple tickers, in fact block so they don't clog feeds. \n2. Keep a notebook. I write down terms when involved with a discussion that I don't understand to help me further my knowledge. For example, A stock I am investing that I feel will be doing very well very soon-- a discussion had multiple mentions of warrants. So I added to my definition list and went on to understand the companys warrents, what they were and why it is a factor in decisions. I write down definitions, terms I want to research in the future, lists of tickers I want to research, patterns I start to see in certain stocks-- its my little bible.\n3. Beware of some (maybe most) of the big pumpers. I learned this watching a notable twitter pumper that people treat like a god. You will and can make money of their suggestions-- but can also get severly burned. They buy in a stock they know just needs volume to make it go. It can be something that is junk. So they buy a ton of shares really cheap-- then pump it so a massive volume influxes it-- however by the time they post the pump its already gone up a little--- the pumper has made his money and exited and you are stuck when the stock drops rapidly due to exits. I say this with admitting you can be smart and make a couple bucks-- but it also comes with risk.... and ethically its a little gross. I saw this notable pumper brag yesterday about a stock he made 800k off of-- and his kingdom of followers are why. So I post this with caution as yes they can get you in the right direction-- but they use you to do it, and it comes at a cost to many people. I have found a few posters who I follow that post facts and always see posts by people as just a start- and its my duty to follow up. \n4. Read SEC filings. The website is easy to search, and this will keep you up to date on the companys stock filings. I am still learning and understanding the significance of each document.\n5. Find reputable due diligence. I am still developing this skill but so far I read SEC filings, I read releases from the company, history of the company. Websites I navigate are otcmarkets, investor hub, and business news sites. \n6. FOMO is huge in the market. I made so many mistakes my first month jumping into a stock by letting people pumping make me believe if I didn't buy it right that minute I would be left behind. This is absolutely wrong. I notate a stock I am interested in, and I watch its patterns. I look at the spread of buy ins too, to make sure I am not buying in at the top. I promise you, if you read social media and are scared of missing out- buying too quickly will lead you to buy too high. Stocks don't rocket as fast as they lead you to believe.\n7. Every stock is not about \"to rocket\" or go to the moon that day. \n8. Read the actual contracts. If you see a stock you are interested in- and theres lots of talk of its \"going to rocket\" due to a contract. Read and understand the contract. Contracts don't always mean immediate rise in stock. Sometimes the contract is contigent on certain things occuring. If I am interested in a stock with a known contract, and its not something immediate-- I write it in my stock bible to follow, that way I can follow the path the company is taking- and then put my money into it when its solid. I have found by waiting, the stock price is relatively the same if not lower, and I then use my money to invest in other things until that point occurs. \n9. Learn a little piece at a time. I see the stock market as an easy way to get overwhelmed and I acknowledge how little I know. So I learn a little bit at a time.  \n10. Understand that no one truly can predict exactly when, or how much because the market has a lot of unpredictable factors... and honestly-- People with the most indepth knowledge of best choices are not going to tell you. I do not ask questions in forums regarding expectations-- I know its my job as an investor to do the legwork, and not for someone to hand me their hard work. It's my hard work. \n\nThese are just a few of the lessons I have learned and thought I would share- I have many more of course. And I know I will have many more lessons and look forward to enjoying the ride. \n\nCheers!",

        "selftext": "This will probably be downvoted because it goes against the grain of popular thought here.\n\nThe big problem with this subreddit and why you really shouldn't listen to anything here if you are new and na\u00efve to investing is the constant jumping on bandwagons.\n\nThe reason why 90% of investors simply do not beat the market indexes is due to jumping on popular stocks and funds after they have been hyped up to stupid price levels.\n\nHere are some examples:  \n\\- Tesla  \n\\- Nio  \n\\- Ark funds\n\nThe reason I put Ark in their is because retail investors keep pumping ark up on every single subreddit every day. Here's the fact: It's performed very well *recently* in a 10 year bull market. It has yet to prove itself long term and investing is all about long term.\n\nTesla and nio are simply in EV bubbles, the EV space is similar to where the dot com was in 2000. It doesn't matter how good a company is if you are buying it for way over it's intrinsic value.\n\nPeter lynch mentioned this in his book. Retail investors constantly switch to the best performing funds in recent years. **These funds then lagg behind the market index. Probably due to their holdings becoming overvalued compared to fundamentals.**\n\nA lot of you guys here need to understand that. Also, just because I am a bear on these stocks/funds doesn't mean I am going to short them because that's timing the market.",

        "selftext": "# The Synopsis - Nothing new, just wrapping it in a bow\n\nAlright Handi-Capables, buckle up - I am going to tell you about a little WSB speculation that may be either the biggest fraud of all time or the most epic DD ever to have occurred in WSB history. A lot of this information comes from a real dick head named Yolo Capital Management on Twitter who is also known as [u/infamousbreadfruit99](https://www.reddit.com/u/infamousbreadfruit99/) within this Gamblers subreddit. This guy is a real piece of work, but I've come to have a real good working relationship with him as we've discussed theories behind Pershing Square as well as the most hyped target being discussed, STRIPE. This thread is really meant to just outline all the history, the theories, the risks and the potential moves that you can do to minimize risk. **I don't want this to turn into the great NRPLing of 2020, where PURPLE had the best quarter of all time but you Degenerates all sold off because they didn't announce an electric vehicle or an Ipad powered exercise bike. Warning to all: This is purely speculation, this SPAC is trading at 30% above NAV which is pretty damn unprecedented without any news. So be cautious as the downside might be 5-6 dollars per share should Bill announce a terrible DUD of a target. This post is not advice, really just general information that I am trying to present in an un-biased way. PSA: I am biased as hell though, hence my 3M investment, although I don't buy all the theories presented by some people on the forums. Also, there is a very good possibility that this SPAC doesn't acquire STRIPE.**\n\nFirst of all, for those of you not aware, PSTH is a SPAC led by Bill Ackman **(A very successful billionaire Jew, hence the title - Not an anti-Semitic post, genuinely aligns with the theory of an announcement soon)**. A SPAC is a special acquisition company that aspired to bring a company public through a reverse merger. The new entity receives a cash infusion and the SPAC holders shares become stock units in the company that trade on the open Market. SPACS are essentially just a giant cash reserve used to purchase a company. This particular SPAC IPO'd with Units being traded for 20.00 and 20.00 NAV in the trust. The units have since split into Warrants and Shares. As of last week, warrants were trading in the high single digits and shares were trading just below 26.00. Regardless of what the stock trades at, the NAV will remain fairly constant at 20.00 per share. For discussions sake, I am going to consider 20.00 as the theoretical floor as it would be very unusual for a Pre-Merger SPAC to drop drastically below NAV. Once a SPAC merges, the 20.00 floor is removed and market demand and market conditions determine the share price going forward. There have been many theoretical questions thrown around about how much this will jump on an announcement and the answer is **that no one knows until the terms of the deal are announced.**\n\nThe SPAC Structure and Anchor Investors\n\nNow that we have this out of the way, let's talk about Bill Ackman's SPAC. This SPAC launched on July 22nd, 2020, the SPAC sold 200,000,000 units for a total trust size of 4 Billion USD. There were additional clauses in this filing that allow for even more units to be issued to increase the buying power of the SPAC to somewhere in the 7B range. The SPAC was subscribed by some very Reputable investors. Investors Included :\n\n[Large institutions](https://preview.redd.it/4hl94rpxhm361.png?width=1317&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb7bfe45088a3c7d2b1b35800cd519b86b31f879)\n\n# Largest Institutional Investors\n\nAs you can see, you have some whale investors that include Wells Fargo, Baopost hedge fund, Soroban capital and Guggenheim. Well over 2B dollars is held by these 12 investors. According to the filing, institutions own about 65% of the public float. On Bill Ackmans last hedge fund call he indicated that because there was so much interest in this SPAC, he was able to hand pick his investors. Many of these investors are likely sovereign wealth funds or family offices that do not file and therefore we have no insight into whom they are, but Bill does.\n\nEach one of these investors owns common stock that was likely issued after the units split. For those of you that aren't aware, this SPAC has 3/9 of a common warrant per share. 1/9 was issued during the split from the units and the other 2/9 are issued to common share holders that hold through a merger. These warrants have a 23.00 strike price and they can be redeemed after the stock trades above 36.00 for a defined time period. If you don't know what a warrant is just ignore this paragraph.\n\nThis SPAC was designed with very favorable terms that ensure the sponsor's goals align with the company goals and don't create a conflict of interest. Many Many Many Many SPACs have very favorable terms that leave the sponsor's rich and the investors holding bags.\n\nThis is a very very good article that defines conflicts of interest within SPACS. PSTH has eliminated many of these issues and Bill Ackman's interest align with ours, in fact Bill can't make money until the investors reach a certain threshold of gains.\n\n[https://www.sewkis.com/publications/spacs-are-back-back-again-what-you-should-know/](https://www.sewkis.com/publications/spacs-are-back-back-again-what-you-should-know/)\n\nThis SPAC hard garnered many anchor investors and its structure is very very favorable as compared to its peers. Bill is setting a new precedent in the SPAC world and it will be interesting to see if other sponsors do the same. This is a key differentiating factor as to why this SPAC is very premium.\n\nTargets and Timing\n\nWhen this SPAC first launched, Bill Ackman indicated that he would likely find a target within 6 months and merge shortly thereafter. Bill also indicated that he was looking for a minority interest in a unicorn that met certain criteria. Here is the criteria as pulled directly from Pershing Square's website. On the last Pershing earnings call, it was indicated that Bill so no reason that he wouldn't meet his original timeline of having a target announced by Q1 and a merger by Q2. January 22nd is the official 6 month milestone from when the SPAC first began trading. **EDIT: The theory is Bill will announce before Hanukah which starts on Dec 10th or 11th.**\n\n* **Simple, predictable, and free-cash-flow-generative.**\u00a0We will generally seek companies with a proven track record of growth and free cash flow generation, and predictable future financial performance that we expect will generate strong, sustainable growth in cash flows over the long term\u2014however, we are open to considering a company that may, at the time of the initial business combination, be cash-flow negative, if we believe that the business\u2019s cash flow will become positive within a reasonable amount of time;\n* **Formidable barriers to entry.**\u00a0We will seek companies that have long-term sustainable competitive advantages, significant barriers to entry, or \u201cwide moats\u201d around their business, and low risks of disruption due to competition, innovation or new entrants;\n* **Limited exposure to extrinsic factors that we cannot control**. We will seek companies that are not materially affected by macroeconomic factors, commodity prices, regulatory risks, interest rate volatility and/or cyclical risk;\n* **Strong balance sheet**. We will seek companies that are conservatively financed relative to their free-cash-flow generation, after taking into consideration the\u00a0de-leveraging\u00a0effects of the initial business combination;\n* **Minimal capital markets dependency**. We will seek companies that can benefit from being a public company with broader access to the capital markets and greater governance, but will prefer companies that are not highly reliant on the capital markets to operate and grow their businesses;\n* **Large capitalization**. We will seek companies with large enterprise values and significant long-term growth potential that will be likely candidates for inclusion in the S&amp;P 500 index;\n* **Attractive valuation**. We will seek companies at an attractive valuation relative to their long-term intrinsic value; and\n* **Exceptional management and governance**. We will seek companies that have trustworthy, talented, experienced, and highly competent management teams. These companies may be led by entrepreneurs who are looking for a partner with our expertise to execute on the next stage of their growth. For target companies that require new management, we will leverage PSCM\u2019s experience in identifying and recruiting new management.\n\nAfter providing this criteria, Bill indicated there were likely 150 companies that were considered mature unicorns and \\~50 of them would meet all of Bill's criteria. Also, Bill indicated there may be other potential targets that are subsidiaries of other companies.\n\nAccording to the World Wide Web, here are the list of some potential unicorns.\n\n[https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies)\n\nSome of the most well known being:\n\n* SPACEX\n* COINBASE\n* BYTEDANCE\n* STRIPE\n* AIRBNB,\n* INSTACART\n* EPIC GAMES\n* Door Dash\n* DJI\n* SHEIN\n* CHIME\n* JUUL\n* ROBINHOOD\n* WISH\n* ARGO\n* TOKOPEDIA\n* SOFI\n\n# The Stripe Conjecture - Initialize Tin Foil Hats\n\nIf you don't want to hear the theories, then stop reading now as this is just going to really summarize many interesting snippets of information that don't necessarily mean anything but are certainly interesting.\n\n* Jackie Reses Stepping down from Square and maintaining a board seat on PSTH\n   * Jackie was the head of capital for square\n   * Stripe just launched Capital\n   * Jackie is a baller and has more big Dick energy than any man, woman or child alive when it comes to finance.\n   * Jackie has liked several PSTH related tweets, but she has also like other tweets about other financial institutions. This might just be purely coincidence.\n   * Why would Jackie step down from Square but retain all her other board seats, including those on Chamanth's SPACS. Is there a conflict of interest?\n* Bill Ackman following Collison Brothers on Twitter, he doesn't even follow the CEO's of all his biggest investments.\n   * Bill only follows 182 people\n   * Bill Doesn't follow the CEO of Lowes\n   * Bill Doesn't follow the CEO of Chipotle, as far as I can tell - CEO's twitter appears to be private\n   * Bill Doesn't follow Hilton's account, CEO doesn't have twitter as far as I can tell\n   * Bill DOES follow Starbucks CEO\n   * Bill Doesn't follow Agilent CEO\n   * Bill Doesn't follow Howard Hughes companies or leadership as far as I can tell\n* John Collison Following Breadfruit on Twitter (Yolocapitalmgmt)\n   * This dude is a billionaire that is following a WSB degenerate posting conspiracy theories.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/spvepib4im361.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=767c5a23b4f64208d9c11d2d27f1e69f040ccf5f\n\n* This dude is one of the original Irish stripe employees.... he has since unfollowed but he was. His name is Brian Delahunty\n* Wells FARGO invested in a PRE LOI SPAC - What the hell?\n* This is the one that I can't figure out. Why in the hell would wells FARGO invest in a shell company if they didn't have any inclination as to the target. HAS THIS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE? We know that wells fargo and stripe do have a relationship\n* SETH KLARMAN INVESTED IN A PRE LOI SPAC\n   * This is another ODD one. This is basically Seth Klarman saying hey Bill, your Hedge fund can invest my 400 million better than me?????????????? These are two different hedge fund manager and one of them is investing in the other. This is absolutely weird.\n* The size of the SPAC limits targets: why so big Bill???????\n   * Why in the world would Bill limit his options to such a small amount of companies, companies that are typically already backed by big money...... This is another point I can't wrap my head around, why in the world would bill launch a SPAC of this size without having preliminary top level talks. The sheer size of the SPAC is telling, he knew he wanted a whale and if he didn't think he could get one he would've maybe gone with a 2B dollar SPAC with the option to increase to 4B, INSTEAD he went with a 4B SPAC with option to go all the way to 7B!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n* Why would the Collison brothers have talks at all with Bill if they didn't intend to go public? The brothers are some smart ass Ginger Snaps and they knew Bill had a giant ass blank check. Many people are saying the Collison brothers will IPO and they don't need Bill... Why waste your time meeting with Bill if SPACing wasn't a possibility and going public wasn't a near term event?\n* Why hasn't Bill or the Collison's denied it\n   * Bloomberg denied rumors within an hour\n   * Airbnb Denied rumors within days\n   * Not a single Denial statement from Collisons or Big Dick Bill.\n* So far only known talks have been between Bloomberg, Airbnb and Stripe. These are all tech plays so we can hopefully expect the final deal is a tech play.\n* Collison Brothers are going for funding at a much higher valuation\n   * Why would they be going for funding, they just got funding in April. Also, it's rumored that Stripe is potentially already profitable.\n* Bill Ackman indicated his biggest regret was missing the boat on Mastercard\n* Bill Ackman is taking a minority stake so the terms are more appealing to unicorns as they can maintain control, raise funding and have large anchor investors that aren't worried about short term gains.\n\n# The ANTITHESIS to the conjecture\n\n* John Collison is trolling - If there was a deal why would John troll.\n* The Collisons just indicated they were not preparing a flotation.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4kxncd8him361.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c8a4b2a3124c3c781cb634a29bbcf7582275e66\n\n* The Collisons are a freaking darling that can raise private equity whenever they want, they really don't need Bill\n* Jackie Reses has trolled Breadfuit AKA Yolo on twitter\n* STRIPE doesn't need funding\n* Bill Ackman's historical investments are not fintech, why would he start\n* Big Unicorns don't want bill because he is an activist.\n\n# The Risk to Reward\n\n* You need to be aware that this is trading at a 30% premium to asset value. This means that for every share you buy at 26.00, there is only 20.00 of money in the trust being used to acquire the company. This means that we need to land a good company with good terms to justify the premium.\n* This SPAC is huge, it's not likely to quadruple like some of the other spacs.\n   * If a great deal is reached with a real hype company then we might see 35-40 pre merger and 40+ post merger. Otherwise, we will probably see 30-35, depending on the terms.\n* The SPAC has 2 years to make a deal and we are only \\~5 months into this duration. Your money could sit idle for another 18 months.\n* Warrants expire worthless should a deal fail to materialize. This is why I am not specifically buying warrants, although I do expect a deal will materialize.\n\n# Why I invested\n\n* I like Bill Ackman, he gets it done, he is smart, pragmatic and he learns from his mistakes.\n* This is really an investment in Bill, similar to investing in TSLA, it's really an investment in leadership, not so much the product.\n* Bill does have a relationship with some big players and he will land a good deal no matter what. Even if this is not Stripe, I will likely hold everything long term.\n* Tontine structure is appealing and it rewards holders. Google Tontine if you don't know what it is.\n* If they do get Stripe, you are getting Young visionary leadership and frankly I think the Collison's are probably stand up guys. In the back of my mind, I believe that they might SPAC to give the average joe an opportunity to invest; they seem more motivated in building an empire of amazing financial infrastructure products than getting egregious valuations\n* If they Don't get Stripe you are still getting Bill Ackman and Jackie Reses hunting for a company - they are both legends.\n* Anchor investors presented above indicate they are bullish on Bill, not to mention they limit the available float and if it is a epic deal, anchor investors holding will help push price of stock upwards.\n\n# The Plays\n\n* I am only buying commons.\n* For those that want options, I wouldn't buy any options earlier than a march '21 expiration and a 20.00 strike.\n* If I were buying options I would buy June expiration 15.00 strikes.\n* My previous posts outline why I believe just buying common stock is the way to go. Ticker is PSTH.\n\n# MY POSITIONS\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[My Common Stock](https://preview.redd.it/7ywotz3kim361.png?width=1512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e66fa3bffd4b93319883bdd3196c7f954479237a)\n\n# TL:DR\n\n* Bill will probably buy Subway and we're all FK'd.\n* Don't buy because it might be stripe, buy because it's Bill and Jackie.\n* Don't buy lotto's as I don't believe this SPAC will react like others.\n* This isn't investing advice. This is my thought process spewed about on a forum.\n\nMODS- Not sure if this qualifies as DD or not, but if it doesn't PM me and I will change it to story time or shitpost.",

        "selftext": "&gt; \"Quant trading is based on technical analysis\".\n\nI've seen this stated a lot on Reddit. I understand why somebody might think this, but it is wrong. So I'm here to explain what most quant funds actually do. I hope you find it as interesting as I do.\n\n---\n\n### Multifactor models\n\nThis is the bread-and-butter for quant funds. AQR has pioneered this space the most.\n\nMultifactor models are models designed to extract cross-sectional risk premia in markets. Put simply you look at all the stocks in a market. Rank them based on some metric(s). Long the top decile. Short the bottom decile. It that market-neutral portfolio outperforms on a consistent basis then well done! You have found a risk premium. \n\nClassical and well known risk premia include: \n\n* Momentum - stocks that moon continue to moon.\n* Size - small caps tend to outperform large caps.\n* Value - high-value stocks tend to outperform low-value stocks.\n* Mean Reversion - some securities are stationary e.g. volatility.\n* Quality - quality stocks tend to outperform low quality stocks. \n* Low Volatility - low vol stocks tend to outperform on a risk-adjusted basis.\n* Aggressiveness - conservative companies tend to outperform aggressive companies.\n\nSome of these factors used to work but no longer do because the mere fact that so many quant funds discovered them caused the alpha in them to decay. Most quants I know are looking into more alternative factors using machine learning based on sentiment, web-traffic, social media mentions, etc. I'll elaborate further down.\n\nBook Recommendation: [Quantitative Equity Portfolio Management by Ludwig B Chincarini](https://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Equity-Portfolio-Management-Construction/dp/0071459391)\n\n### Writing and Pricing Derivatives\n\nThis is another bread-and-butter for quant funds. It used to be a lot bigger before 2008 when the street had more appetite for exotics. But it's still good business. It was pioneered by quants like Ed Thorpe. You should definitely read his book the man was friends with Claude Shannon ffs - [A Man For All Markets by Edward O. Thorp](https://www.amazon.com/Man-All-Markets-Street-Dealer/dp/1400067960).\n\nWriting and pricing derivatives involves six easy steps. \n\n1. Create a model that can output synthetic prices and has parameters you can tune.\n2. Fit the model to a stock or portfolio such that it produces synthetic prices that have the same statistical characteristics of the underlying stock or portfolio.\n3. Sample tens of thousands of possible future market scenarios in a Monte Carlo simulation.\n4. Compute the payoff of the derivative in each scenario.\n5. Discount the future values to determine the expected value of the option.\n6. Pad the price to take into account counterparty, model, and specification risks.\n\nNow for vanilla options you can do this on a calculator using analytical methods. But for portfolios of assets or complex derivatives with nonlinear payoff structures you often need to build a pricing model yourself. This is what I used to get paid to do for big corporates looking to hedge things like generators for power plants.\n\nWhat kinds of models are used here? Stochastic processes or (maybe) generative machine learning models.\n\nBook Recommendation #1: [Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives by John C. Hull](https://www.amazon.com/Options-Futures-Other-Derivatives-9th/dp/0133456315)\n\nBook Recommendation #2: [Monte Carlo Methods in Financial Engineering by Paul Glasserman](https://www.amazon.com/Financial-Engineering-Stochastic-Modelling-Probability/dp/0387004513/)\n\n### Market Making and Latency Arbitrage\n\nThis is what the big funds like Citadel, Jane Street, Two Sigma, etc. are doing. Full disclaimer I've never worked on the HFT side of things but I'll explain it the way I understand it. Comment if you want to add or correct.\n\nHigh Frequency Trading firms like Citadel, Jane Street, and Two Sigma get paid by exchanges by provide market liquidity. They are market makers always ready to buy or sell whatever share you or a large institutional fund needs to trade. They make money by placing a limit order to sell or a buy limit order in order to earn the bid-ask spread.\n\nLatency arbitrage is when HFT firms buy and sell the same security at the same time in different markets because two or more exchanges are displaying a different price for that security. For example, if a whale pushes the price of a security high on the New York Stock Exchange then an HFT firm might sell the security on the NYSE at the same time as they buy it on the Chicago Stock Exchange and profit the spread between the two exchanges.\n\nBook Recommendation #1: [Trading and Exchanges by Larry Harris](https://www.amazon.com/Trading-Exchanges-Market-Microstructure-Practitioners/dp/0195144708)\n\nBook Recommendation #2: [High Frequency Trading by Irene Aldridge](https://www.amazon.com/High-Frequency-Trading-Practical-Algorithmic-Strategies/dp/1118343506/)\n\nBook Recommendation #3: [Flash Boys by Michael Lewis](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Boys-Wall-Street-Revolt/dp/0393351599/) - this one has pretty mixed reviews amongst the quants I know (some of whom do this stuff for a living). Ken Griffin even called it a \"work of fiction\". But it is a great story and regardless of the plot the technology and infrastructure used for HFT is accurately portrayed.\n\n### Statistical Arbitrage\n\nThis has gone pretty mainstream. I'm sure most of you have heard of pairs trading but it is certainly another staple for quant funds. And if you read [The Man Who Solved The Market](https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Solved-Market-Revolution/dp/073521798X) about RenTech (the most famous quant fund in the world) they allude to doing something similar with basket options. Nobody knows how true that is.\n\nStatistical arbitrage involves identifying securities that should behave similarly and going long the one which is relatively undervalued and short the one which is relatively overvalued. In the simplest case you might say that Coca-Cola and Pepsi are a pair and go long/short them when depending on how they are priced relative to one another. \n\nIn a more complex trade you might go long off-the-run treasuries and short on-the-run treasuries because older identical treasuries sell at a discount to those hot off of the money printer. This is the trade that caused the famous LTCM crash. What happened is Russia defaulted on its debt and the demand for on-the-run treasuries skyrocketed. LTCM was short on-the-run treasuries and got squeezed. Their models told them to double down multiple times (martingale) but the distortion continued beyond the point where they could borrow money to finance the trade. So they went insolvent and the Federal Reserve stepped in to do a bail out. This all happened in 1998!\n\nThe LTCM example might not qualify as \"statistical\" arbitrage since the securities are identical so it is literally arbitrage ... but the risk models are statistical and use the same techniques as we use when writing and pricing derivatives.\n\nBook Recommendation #1: [Algorithmic Trading: Winning Strategies and Their Rationale by Ernie Chan](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithmic-Trading-Winning-Strategies-Rationale/dp/1118460146)\n\nBook Recommendation #2: [When Genius Failed by Roger Lowenstein](https://www.amazon.com/When-Genius-Failed-Long-Term-Management/dp/0375758259)\n\n### Information Arbitrage\n\nThe most modern reincarnation of quantitative finance involves identifying information arbitrage opportunities with alternative data. Alternative data is any data that is not price data or fundamental data. Large audio, text, document, video, click stream, etc. datasets are all examples of alternative datasets that could power information arbitrage.\n\nHere are some strategies I have seen or heard of being used,\n\n* Using natural language processing algorithms to read tens of thousands of news articles a day to track sentiment, named entities mentioned, events, etc. This is pretty well known.\n* Using high resolution satellite data to (1) track ships coming in and out of ports, (2) count cars in Walmart / Target parking lots to estimate revenues, (3) estimating the amount of oil in middle eastern oil reserves based on the shadow cast on the structure. This is the kind of analysis built by [Orbital Insights](https://orbitalinsight.com/).\n* Using meteorological models to predict when the monsoon season will hit and how extreme it will be and what the impact will be on certain crops like sugar which are very sensitive to it.\n* Using temperature monitors in European rivers to predict demand for natural gas and heating oil. I heard from a quant that at a certain \u00b0F nuclear power plants can't use river water for cooling so they slow down causing a spike in demand for gas ... not sure how true that is but it's an example of information arbitrage.\n* Using buying flight path information to predict mergers and acquisitions between major companies.\n* Using click stream data from Robinhood to predict what meme stock is going to be the next pump and dump on r/wallstreetbets. You all know that this is a thing right haha ;-).\n\nNot a lot of good books on this topic yet but I've heard that [The Book of Alternative Data by Alexander Denev](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Alternative-Data-Investors-Managers-ebook/dp/B08C4NSBWF) does a half decent job. You'll probably find more ideas browsing parts of Reddit though like /r/datasets.\n\n---\n\nSo that's what quant funds do. We build multifactor models based on (mostly) fundamental data. Write and price derivatives. Make markets at high frequencies. Buy and sell securities and portfolio that are stationary relative to one another. And beg, borrow, buy, or steal your data in order to predict what you or funds are going to do. \n\nQuant funds look more like the NSA today than any Wolf of Wall Street type boiler room. It's just racks of computers and 1000's of nerds geeking out over maths, stats, and code. And very very few of us use technical analysis. \n\nTechnical analysis involves _prediction_ based on price and volume data. Most quants strongly believe that predicting the market based on price and volume data is impossible. None of the business models I mentioned above involve any prediction of the future prices. The only claims we make about the future are about probability distributions.\n\nI don't hate technical analysis. I personally don't think it works, but I could be wrong. But the claim that quant funds are based on technical analysis hasn't been even close to true since around the 1970's.\n\nP.S. About me - I'm a quant. I've been doing this shit for 10+ years. 4+ in the back-office pricing exotic options for big corporates and helping them hedge complex transactions. 6+ in the front-office mostly building strategies based on multifactor models and information arbitrage principles. It's a tough industry these days but I do it because I love the markets just like the rest of you.",

And I mean all IN - got no money to invest on any other plays anymore.\n\nI originally got into GME a couple of days before their Q2 earnings. I bought 30c's for 1/15/21 after reading one of the first DDs about the squeeze. Q2 earnings happened, and they got killed, and I panic sold my calls at a loss. And decided not to fuck with GME again. \n\nMade some money on other plays over the months, until the squeeze hype train ran into me, and I decided to YOLO everything into GME, at an average of 18.03, and the ride has just been downhill ever since.\n\nQ3 earnings of course did not lead us anywhere. And today morning, a week later, GME is down to a sad 12.38. Don't I feel like quite the bag holder. \n\nIt seems like every one has a better position than I do (tons of comments from people who got in when it was in single digits, or at around 12-13). But there have to be others like me, who're stuck at an average that seems unsurmountable right now. \n\nIs the plan to just wait till Q4 earnings ? Is there any hope of Daddy Cohen intervening ? Seems like the board has started cutting costs by shutting stores, something that Cohen wanted them to do. My fear is that Sherman might half arse this enough to avoid being taken over, and we're left with this stock that just won't move. Although honestly I don't fully understand the technicals of the squeeze, so I'm sure there are factors beyond these.\n\nEvery time I try asking about these doubts I have on /r/wsb, the answer I've received is that I should hold. And hold I will, as I watch all you autists make money on other plays like PLTR and god knows what.  Look momma didn't raise no paper handed bitch, I've got diamond hands. What I don't got, are diamond balls, and so I'm looking for some support, perhaps some confirmation bias, some guidance ? Anyway, thought I'd create a post where we GME autists can support each other.\n\nAnyone else feel like they're on the same boat ? \n\nMay the squeeze be with us.",

        "selftext": "Been awhile since I made a post educating your retards, throwing pearls before swine. I've been disheartened by some of the comments I've read recently and just wanted to provide some tips for the genuine noobies/retards among us. If you already know this shit, congrats, move along sir.\n\nTake a look at my previous, more advanced guide to some theta gang theory for those looking for something a bit more in depth: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how\\_to\\_consistently\\_outperform\\_the\\_sp500\\_using/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how_to_consistently_outperform_the_sp500_using/)\n\nWithout further ado... TOP 5 TIPS Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.\n\n# 1) You MUST understand Implied Volatility.\n\nI made this the first point because it is the gigantic mistake I see noobies here making again and again. I'm talking to you, people who bought calls on PLTR at $30.  **If you learn anything from this post, you MUST learn this.**\n\nYou see a stock make a massive move either up or down. Your immediate response is \"this is a great opportunity to buy calls/puts on a volatile stock!\" Right? WRONG!\n\nIn fact, when a stock has just made a massive move in either direction, that is perhaps the WORST time to purchase options in EITHER direction. Options are not stupid. Options are designed to price in the fact that a stock is moving wildly. This is called \"implied volatility.\" They become more expensive as a stock makes more dramatic moves, to price in the volatility you and everyone else is expecting.\n\nIt's quite possible and even likely that you buy an option on a high IV stock, and the stock moves in your direction, and yet you LOSE money, because it didn't move as dramatically as was expected by the implied volatility. **This is called \"IV crush.\"** It only takes one or two experiences with IV crush for most traders to learn this lesson for life. If you understand this concept before you lose a ton of money, all the better.\n\n**So, what should you do if a stock is highly volatile and options are expensive due to IV?**\n\nThere are two choices: Trade actual shares, or SELL the options rather than buy them.\n\nIf you are bullish on a high IV stock, you can take a bullish position by SELLING a put rather than buying the call. If you are bearish on a high IV stock, you can take a bearish position by SELLING a call rather than buying a put (although this entails greater risk and will typically require higher options trading level by your broker).\n\n# 2) You MUST have patience.\n\nIt's a tale as old as time. A noobie investor does some research, reads some DD, and is convinced a stock is going to rise over the next couple years. So he buys in. A bad day or two hits and the stock tanks. He panics, and sells. The next couple days the stock rises and appears to stabilize. So he buys back in again, because he still believes in his thesis. The stock drops again, and he panic sells again.\n\nIn reality the stock is just trading sideways, but this idiot keeps buying on green days and selling on red days. This is perhaps the most idiotic, suicidal strategy anyone could ever employ. Buying on green and selling on red is a surefire strategy to lose money consistently over time.\n\nThis is why you MUST remove your emotions from your trades, because your emotions will usually tell you to buy on green and sell on red, literally buy high and sell low. As the boomer Warren Buffett once stated: **\"The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.\"**\n\nHere is a better approach. Set up your entire trade BEFORE you make the trade. Have a set price you will sell at if things go south. Have a target price you will sell at if things go well. Once the dust settles you can learn from any mistakes. Were you too aggressive, or too conservative in your targets? What emotions directed you to make those mistakes? Too much greed, too much risk aversion, too LITTLE risk aversion? Make every trade a learning opportunity.\n\n# 3) You MUST understand \"Reversion to the Mean.\"\n\nIn general, stocks will tend to revert to their trendlines.\n\nThis thesis is fairly simple. If a stock moons 10% in a day, the most likely event is a drop the next day. If a stock tanks 10% in a day, the most likely event is a rise the next day. This is because humans are emotional creatures. First, they overreact to big news. Next, one of two things happen: When the stock is way up, people see it as a profit taking opportunity, so they sell. When the stock is way down, people see it as a buying opportunity, so they buy.\n\nI don't have any hard data to back up this thesis, but I'm sure there's a bunch of nerds out there with hard data that proves exactly this, as well as trading algorithms specifically designed for a \"reversion to the mean\" strategy that are consistently profitable.\n\nObviously there will be exceptions, as well as times when a big move signals a shift in the trendline. All I am saying is in the MAJORITY of cases, reversion to the mean will occur. Don't go chasing stocks that have made massive short-term swings in a single direction unless you have strong reasons (not just hopes) to believe the trend has changed.\n\n# 4) You MUST not YOLO you account more than once (or twice).\n\nThis is going to be controversial for some of you. But it's just straight math. If you keep betting your entire account, or close to it, on single trades, **it's only a matter of time before you go broke. That is a mathematical guarantee.**\n\nLet's say you are one of the most skilled, intelligent, informed investors on the planet (doubtful). So skilled your plays are 90% correct. If you bet your entire portfolio on each trade, you are still expected to go completely broke after around 10 trades.\n\nLet's say you aren't a brilliant stonk gambler. Let's say you are just average and your trades are a coin flip (which is generous for a lot of you retards). **If you bet your entire bankroll on each bet, on average you will go completely broke in just 2 trades.**\n\nAgain, there is a lot of complicated math we can go through to predict account explosion times and optimal bet sizing and so on, but that isn't necessary here. Professional gamblers such as poker players have refined bankroll management theory, which usually means at the least they aren't putting more than 10% of their cash on the table in one sitting, usually closer to 5%.\n\nI know a lot of you are broke with no life prospects and hoping to get rich quick. I don't fault you for that, I get it. The problem arises when you see the people who got insanely lucky with guessing 10 coin flips in a row who turned $1000 into $1,000,000, and hope to do the same... **but for every one retard with a record like that you've got hundreds more who lose it all and have nothing to show for it.**\n\nI won't fault anyone for making a gigantic, life-changing bet a single time. That is your choice to make, and it just might pay off. But if you think you are going to do that again and again and survive, you are delusional.\n\n# 5) You MUST be Skeptical... of EVERYTHING.\n\nFools and their money are soon parted. Don't be a fool.\n\nYour first instincts when hearing ANYTHING should be skepticism. Your friend has a hot stock tip? Start with skepticism. Some online DD on a meme or penny stock online sounds convincing? Start with skepticism. A highly respected financial or government agency gives future guidance on whatever... again, start with skepticism.\n\nThere are a million people out there trying to take advantage of you, to pump and dump you, to scam to, to trick you into spending more money on whatever.\n\nThere are times when being a conformist pays off, like when markets rally for months straight. There are times when being a contrarian pays off, like when markets tank and sectors collapse. Don't be a consistent conformist nor a consistent contrarian. Be skeptical of every thesis and every hypothesis you hear, or even the ones you invent yourself.\n\nWhen you take this approach honestly and still become convinced of a thesis, you have a higher probability than most of being correct.\n\n**Seek out opinions that contradict your biases, not opinions that confirm your biases.** This is incredibly difficult and goes against human nature, but if you can achieve this ideal, you will out-trade 90% of the public.",

        "selftext": "*#Clown Market DD:*# Buckle up buckaroos I'm gonna show you how to wine and dine on tendies at Wendys this very Wednesday. Neither Bull, nor Bear, I am full-on Clown and this is my native market. Given the recent Clownish trends, which unequivocally guarantee future results (*cf.* \"New Paradigm\" inflection point of [Figure A](https://transportgeography.org/?page_id=9035), the contents of Airbnb's S-1 disclosure statement (available [here](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-306257/)) and other SEC filings (available [here](https://sec.report/CIK/0001559720)) are completely irrelevant, like seatbelts on a seadoo. \n\n**TLDR;** Imagine an amount of money you are willing to lose and then double it. Buy ABNB at Fidelity on IPO day, shares on Wednesday afternoon, and calls the following week.\n\nNow before you parade down the street blasting your kazoo, let's go over WHY to buy. UBER IPO'd last year at $41. This was a typical case of insider investors realizing their shares of a shitty, unprofitable company were better off in the hands of retail mothershmuckers. UBER has become even less profitable in the interim, so naturally the stock price has risen to $54. Now some of you bigbrains might be furrowing your fiveheads--ABNB has a clear path to profitability and has indeed [turned a profit](https://www.cnet.com/news/airbnb-first-profit-home-rental-travel-startups/) on multiple occasions. My elf ears hear you ask:\n\n&gt;\"Under Clownmarket rules doesn't this mean ABNB will trade flat like a boomer bond?\" \n\n\"Nein!\" is my reply. Fear not, for ABNB posted a [$322m loss](https://www.vox.com/2020/2/12/21134477/airbnb-loss-profit-ipo-safety-tech-marketing) last year. Although it's not as sexy as [TSLA's $862m loss](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272130/net-loss-of-tesla/) in the same year, we can hope ABNB's costs of expanding into China will swell like an ass-eater's lymph nodes. The analysts certainly think so. Cordwell has a price target of [$75 a share](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ABNB/price-target/) following the likely $45-$50 IPO target.\n\nAlthough Airbnb is clearly just Uber for your mattress, some skeptics demand more metrics. Compare Booking.com (BKNG) which IPO'd at $483.99 in 1999 and dropped to $7.88 by 2001. Could this happen to ABNB? Absolutely not. Why? Because I got bedbugs once at a booking.com dive with fake pics, and I didn't even call their customer service to get my eleven dollars back. Contrast that with when I got kicked out of an Airbnb in Bali six years ago, I got on the phone with a **specialist** who **investigated** my **case** and gave me a bunch of store credit for shit I didn't even ask for. Add in the fact that BKNG now trades at $2125 and you've got yourself a real *fuck it why not* scenario.  \n\nAnd finally, *Google Trends* [shows \"airbnb\" is half as hype as \"tesla\"](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=airbnb,tesla) which logically puts ABNB at 50% of TSLA's $558b valuation, =$279b, which would put ABNB's share price at $465.\n\nPut the kazoos away boys, this 10-bagger calls for a fanfaronade of vuvuzelas!",

        "selftext": "Trading/investing is not a get rich quick scheme. Buying on solely what you hear without doing any research into sales, future growth, PE ratio, etc is bound to get you losses. You won't have gains every day. If you fold at the drop of a hat, then the stock market isn't for you. There will be bad days, but it's up to you as an investor to understand that timing the market is dang near impossible. You need to start thinking long-term if you haven't been doing so already. If you're expecting +50% gains, you're lost dude. \n\nThis isn't r/wallstreetbets so stop saying \"yolo\" and throwing all your money into companies that you're only buying because other people are talking about it. After all, \"most news is noise; not news.\" Remember why you're here. Throwing your money into meme stocks is a good way to end up broke. Don't forget that we're still in the midst of a pandemic in a country whose people turned mask-wearing into a political issue. The possibility that we undergo another lockdown isn't outlandish. \n\nDo research. Read, for crying out loud. Look at earnings reports. Take everything you hear with a grain of salt. Slow and steady money is much better than losses, so act like it. I'm honestly disappointed in how some of you guys have been acting. It's those kinds of people that keep working 24/7 and hoarding everything in their bank accounts while their money loses value due to inflation. Be responsible.

        "selftext": "When I first started stock trading at the ripe age of 15 years old, it was because I had lost over $3,000 of my roughly $5,000 in life savings from mowing lawns in the dot-com crash. The technology focused mutual funds my parents had invested me in had plummeted in value.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a result of this traumatic experience, I wanted to take charge of my financial future and not leave it in the hands of an actively managed mutual fund.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith no concept of day trading costs, order execution quality, let alone a fear for losing, I sold the mutual funds, opened a custodian account at TD Ameritrade, and quickly started crushing the market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Over the course of three years I took my portfolio of several thousand and ran it up to nearly $100,000.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was the man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I reached my peak portfolio value at age 18, I was a freshman in college with three monitors on my dorm room desk, skipping class and day trading for friends live. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I then lost $72,000 in one trade and realized there was a lot more to stock trading than meets the eye.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow at the ripe old age of 33, 18 years of market \u201cexperience\u201d has helped me realize that I was a statistic in a game that never ends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust like rolling heads ten times in a row, my luck streak ran out and I gave most of what I had earned back to the market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking back, here are ten hard facts I wish I had understood about day trading professionally when I got started.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 10. The \u201clifestyle\u201d of a successful day trader is a big fat lie\n\nYachts, women (men for those ladies pursuing the dream),  private jets and business class, presidential suites, fancy cars, 10k stacks, mansions, etc all encompass what is presented as the \u201cdream day trader lifestyle\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe dream advertised by stock picking subscription services, Twitter and Instagram accounts, etc. are all built on a foundation of sand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSadly, it\u2019s all clever marketing and not a reality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FACT: 99.9% of stock picking service providers make more money from their subscriptions and product sales than they do their own trading.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey are able to live the, \u201clifestyle\u201d because of you and your desire to day trade part-time or make some money on the side or get rich investing. Without you, those stock picking services wouldn\u2019t exist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next time you see a trading service trying to sell you on a monthly chat room subscription, day trading education course, DVD, or live trading lessons, look around the site and see if they have audited tax records of their returns listed anywhere. They won\u2019t.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The only difference between you and them is that they figured out #9 and #8 below before you and decided to pursue a career in education and, \u201cgiving back\u201d to help you out. This includes sharing their daily stock picks and lessons for a monthly fee.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lesson:** Professional trading is not for the faint of heart and rarely includes the, \u201clifestyle\u201d portrayed on the web and social media.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 9. You really need at least a $1,000,000 portfolio to trade full-time\n\nTo trade for a living, you need a large bankroll. Why? Because you can\u2019t just assume you will have profitable years forever. You also have to consider trading expenses (commissions), drawing a salary to pay bills, alongside paying taxes on all those short term capital gains.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you\u2019re young and single, you can keep costs down. Heck, I was living on less than a $100 per month food budget at one point to pursue the dream. According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average American under 25 spends $2,531 per month or $30,372 per year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you age, your expenses naturally go up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you may thinking, \u201cBlain, there is thing called leverage.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, there are ways to leverage your portfolio. With a $25,000 margin account and pattern day trader status, you can trade up to $100,000 (4x) in securities per day and hold up to $50,000 (2x) overnight. It\u2019s a gift and a curse. The stakes are much higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at some basic math, let\u2019s say your single and under 25. Your cost of living should be on average $30,372 per year and your tax rate is effectively zero.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**To break even on a $1 million portfolio, you would need to return 3.1% a year. With a $100,000 portfolio, you are talking about a 31% return.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, just to break even.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMind you, this doesn\u2019t include trading costs, research, trading subscriptions, etc. which can easily total thousands of dollars a year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven if you had an unbelievable year and returned 50% on a $100,000 portfolio, you are only building your bankroll +$14,769 for next year ($50,000 \u2013 $4,859 taxes \u2013 $30,372 avg cost of living). Again, not including trading costs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t daunting enough, the above assumes you never have a down month, let alone a down year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo live, you need to take draws every month (another piece of wisdom I realized after the fact), which means you need to win\u2026 constantly. Shrinking your portfolio base even 10% is a serious hurdle to overcome.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lesson:** You can get started with as little as a few thousand dollars, but don\u2019t get suckered into attempting to trade for a living unless you have at least a $1,000,000 portfolio. When you factor in the swings of trading, taxes, cost of living, and time, its seriously david vs goliath math.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 8. The odds are stacked against you\n\nThere are many very smart people out there. With a global stock market cap of $69 trillion, there is a lot of money at stake and endless resources put into research.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**YOU:** Go to the mall on the weekend, walk into a Lululemon store, see a lot of people paying full price for yoga pants. The \u201caha\u201d moment, this place is packed. You use your mobile trading app to scan a tag, discover \u201cLULU\u201d as the ticker symbol, talk to the sales clerk about how sales have been, then quickly buy some shares on your phone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**INSTITUTIONAL FUND:** Knows the founders and has regular calls with the CFO. Their research staff calls Lululemon stores across the country, as well as suppliers, and pulls data nationwide to determine how the numbers are really lining up. They then analyze to determine that margins are being contracted despite strong sales growth and sell the stock heading into its next earnings call.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo take this full circle, guess what happened to Lululemon after it\u2019s most recent earnings DESPITE positive chatter from traders and analysts? **-16.41% the next day.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere\u2019s what one research group, FBR Capital, had to say post Lululemon earnings:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cFirm notes the key 2Q issue was the GM miss relative to guidance/expectations, which reflected incremental port-delay-related/material liability costs and potentially a greater-than-expected mix shift to lower-margin categories (men\u2019s, women\u2019s fashion). Of foremost go-forward concern is a +55% increase in inventories, which, in addition to sales higher-cost units, is likely a factor in its lower 3Q guide relative to the Street. While there is some in-transit/early delivery noise, LULU has to move through a significant amount of product in 2H15 to normalize sales/inventories.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs that what your research pulled up too? Doubt it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lesson:** Don\u2019t ever think for a second that you can outsmart the market. There is always someone out there that knows more than you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 7. The 5% rule\n\nAllocate no more than 5% of your portfolio to personal trading and invest the rest in low cost index funds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn oldie but a goody, the Wall Street Journal had a weekend feature back in 2013 titled, Investing for the Fun of It. Here\u2019s an excerpt:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Win or lose, the key to using play money safely is to make sure it involves a sum the investor can live without.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cEnjoy the fun of gambling and the thrill of the chase, but not with your rent money and certainly not with college education funds for your children, nor with your retirement nest egg,\u201d John Bogle, Vanguard\u2019s founder, wrote in \u201cThe Little Book of Common Sense Investing,\u201d published in 2007.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMr. Bogle wrote that what he called \u201cfunny money\u201d should amount to no more than 5% of a person\u2019s investments. Some experts put the limit lower. Mr. Malkiel says it depends upon the investor\u2019s individual circumstances.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGetting the proportion wrong is one risk. Another is that an investor will lose, for example, 5% of his or her money and think, \u201cI was so, so close. Let me take another 5%,\u201d Mr. Statman says. The temptation to keep on trying to win is common, he says, and some people find it hard to resist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lesson:** Your long term future is more important than your short term desire to get rich overnight. Trade with no more than 5% of your portfolio and invest the rest in low cost index funds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 6. The power of compounded returns\n\nCompounded returns really make a difference. You may think that 5% \u2013 10% returns are boring, but over the course of decades it stacks up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet\u2019s run some hypothetical examples.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Example A: $10,000 starting portfolio, $2,000 added per year with a 5% return per year.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter 35 years, total contributions equal $80,000. End portfolio value, $235,800.77. Gross return, +$155,000 (+195%).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Example B: $10,000 starting portfolio, $2,000 added per year with a 9.6% return per year (S&amp;P 500 historical return).**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter 35 years, total contributions equal $80,000. End portfolio value, $741,930.11. Gross return, +$661,930.11 (+827%).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at scenario B with a 4.6% higher annual return, the difference is a staggering $506,129.34.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFun fact: over any 20 year period since 1926, the S&amp;P 500 has never returned a loss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lesson:** The earlier you can start investing (ideally in low cost index funds), the better. The power of compounded returns over the course of several decades cannot be underestimated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 5. Taking tips from people \u201csmarter\u201d than you is a terrible idea\n\nHot stock tips are everywhere, and unfortunately no matter how experienced you are, it can be really hard to pass up a great buy tip, especially if the person has apparent access to some \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d information no one else knows about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FEATURED STORY: Top 5 Penny Stocks to Watch This Week with Gains as Much as 97%**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately, ads like the one above for penny stocks are designed to sucker you in to buy a product or service. These tips are utter junk and will leave your wallet and portfolio bleeding red in the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Reality:** If someone even had a strategy that could consistently return even 11% per year, they\u2019d be rich beyond their wildest dreams and would not need to sell picks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 historical return is 9.6%. Endowments, pension funds, and the like would poor money hand over fist into any fund manager that could consistently generate 1.4% of alpha decade after decade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, this rule includes Wall Street analysts. Ignore analyst buy/sell recommendations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo one knows what the market is going to do tomorrow, next week, or next year. At best, it\u2019s just an \u201ceducated guess\u201d from someone really \u201csmart\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWarren Buffett sums it up best, \"With enough insider information and a million dollars, you can go broke in a year.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lesson:** No matter how smart they are, the odds are always stacked against you. Pursue stock tips with extreme skepticism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 4. One trade can easily make or break your year (or career)\n\nUntil you live this first hand, unfortunately it won\u2019t fully hit home. You can spend your whole year seeing small wins and losses. Have an off day, break your rules, and hold a large position into earnings and \u201cwham!\u201d, you might wake up poor the next morning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe opposite is also true. Make a great call, follow your rules, and sell a monster winner that represents over 90% of your gains for the year. Despite dozens or hundreds of uneventful trades over months prior, you\u2019ll be very happy you showed up ready to trade that day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lesson:** Never underestimate the impact a single trade decision can have on your portfolio.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 3. Taxes and the costs of trading are a serious hurdle\n\nThis comes back to #9, but it\u2019s worth breaking down the basics. Here are the key terms to understand:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Short term capital gains tax \u2013** \u201cShort term capital gains do not benefit from any special tax rate \u2013 they are taxed at the same rate as your ordinary income. For 2015, ordinary tax rates range from 10 percent to 39.6 percent, depending on your total taxable income.\u201d \u2013 TurboTax\n\n**Long term capital gains tax \u2013** \u201cIf you can manage to hold your assets for longer than a year, you can benefit from a reduced tax rate on your profits. For 2014, the long-term capital gains tax rates are 0, 15, and 20 percent for most taxpayers. If your ordinary tax rate is already less than 15 percent, you could qualify for the zero percent long-term capital gains rate. For high-income taxpayers, the capital gains rate could save as much as 19.6 percent off the ordinary income rate.\u201d \u2013 TurboTax\n\n**Trade Commission \u2013** Charge to buy or sell stock.\n\n**Order Execution Quality \u2013** Many brokers sell high frequency trading firms the right to \u201cpeek\u201d at your order and more or less screw you on your fill. This is called payment for order flow. Despite being $.01 or $.02 per share, poor fill costs can add up real quick when you trade frequently.\n\nOut performing the S&amp;P 500 in any given year is a feat in itself, but when you then take into consideration taxes, commission costs, and research (those hot stock pick services, chat rooms, and market newsletters don\u2019t come for free), the game becomes that much more difficult.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lesson:** When taxes, commissions, and other costs of trading such as research are taking into consideration, the challenge of outperforming the market year after year as a career are compounded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 2. Confirmation bias and your emotions are your worst enemy\n\nTrading is a mental game. The mind is a beautiful thing, and given a runway of endless inspiration data, it can wreak some serious havoc.\n\n\"Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, prefer, and recall information in a way that confirms one\u2019s beliefs or hypotheses while giving disproportionately less attention to information that contradicts it.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the trading world, this means you see a setup or price action and quickly convince yourself to buy or sell. Unfortunately, 99% of the time you should be doing the direct opposite.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTechnical analysis is one of the worst in provoking this natural human behavior. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve seen this pattern before, it\u2019s a buy\u201d. There is a reason why online brokers offer dozens and in some cases hundreds of technical indicators. Indicators encourage you to see more \u201cpatterns\u201d and trade more frequently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn poker, a player can go on \u201ctilt\u201d and make poor decisions, ultimately losing their stack in a hurry. The same mental dilemma applies to trading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeveral quotes from market masters on trading psychology:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"The truth is that trading, both successful and unsuccessful, is more about psychology than tactics.\" \u2013 Jack Schwager\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I\u2019m always thinking about losing money as opposed to making money. Don\u2019t focus on making money, focus on protecting what you have.\" \u2013 Paul Tudor Jones\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Everyone has the brainpower to make money in stocks. Not everyone has the stomach.\" \u2013 Peter Lynch\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lesson:** Trading is 90% mental and 10% skill. Those who succeed learn to manage risk and trade unemotionally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 1. Passive indexing is the best path forward for 99.9% of Americans\n\nWidely regarded as the greatest investor of all time, Warren Buffet understands the market and his advice for the average American is priceless: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"It is not necessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results. \u2026 By periodically investing in an index fund, the know-nothing investor can actually outperform most investment professionals.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHistorically speaking, since 1928 the S&amp;P 500 has returned 9.6% per year. By simply buying an ETF like SPY or VOO, you can replicate the performance of the S&amp;P 500 for .095% ($9.50 per $10,000 invested) or .03% ($3 per $10,000 invested), respectively, in expense ratios per year. The same applies for mutual funds like Vanguard\u2019s VFIAX.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs far as allocation goes, Warren also keeps it simple, \"My advice to the trustee could not be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&amp;P 500 index fund. I suggest Vanguard\u2019s. (VFINX)\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe numbers don\u2019t lie. Despite staffs of analysts, access to CEOs, CFOs, unlimited capital for research, etc. on average, the majority of hedge funds underperform the market each year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lesson:** Warren Buffett is the greatest investor of all-time. He recommends low cost indexing, instead of market timing, as the best path to long term success.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Closing Thoughts\n\nFor new investors getting started, trading should be a quest for knowledge, not about getting rich.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I have no regrets of investing thousands of hours into the markets over the past 18 years, I\u2019ve had to accept the reality that my retirement portfolio would be further ahead had I understood these truths from the beginning:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The \u201clifestyle\u201d of a successful day trader is a big fat lie\n2. You really need at least a $1,000,000 portfolio to trade full-time\n3. The odds are dramatically stacked against you\n4. Allocate 5% or less of your portfolio to trading (speculating) and invest the rest in low cost index funds\n5. The effect of compounded returns over the course of several decades is amazing\n6. Taking tips from people \u201csmarter\u201d than you is a terrible idea\n7. One trade can easily make or break your year (or career)\n8. Taxes and the costs of trading are a serious hurdle\n9. Confirmation bias and your emotions are your worst enemy\n10. Passive indexing is the best path forward for 99.9% of Americans\n\nIf your mentality is to use the market as a vehicle to supplement income or get rich, stop yourself, you\u2019re already primed for failure.

        "selftext": " Just saw a great DD article on Seeking Alpha on PLTR. https://seeking$$alpha.com/article/4392215-palantir-technologies-in-depth-look-whether-sustainable-competitive-advantage\n\nIt's paywalled so here's the text to share. I know most of you autists can't read for shit, BUT GODDAMN READ THIS SHIT SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SPENDING YOUR MONEY ON. or just read the summary, or scroll to the very bottom for TL;DR \n\n**Summary**\n\n* As speculators circle around Palantir from both the long and short sides, trading volatility has obscured the fundamental picture as to whether the company commands a sustainable competitive advantage.\n* In this article, I intend to have an under-the-hood look at Palantir as a 'digital resources' play to answer that all-important question.\n* I believe its Gotham, bundled with forward-deployed field service representatives, has surmounted the barriers to entry and now enjoys switching cost advantage and emerging network effect.\n* As it diversifies into adjacent commercial verticals through Foundry, Palantir will benefit from economies of scope and scale. Profits will ensue.\n* Shareholders are betting on Palantir's success in completing the digging of a wide moat. The less anticipatory investors may want to wait until such a moat becomes reality.\n\n**Palantir Technologies: Does It Have A Sustainable Competitive Advantage?**\n\nThere are probably as many investors who are averse to Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR), a recent public listing, as those who root for it. The stock has gone parabolic since the start of November 2020. Then, short-seller Andrew Left of Citron Research entered the scene with his tweet. All of the trading volatility has obscured one important fundamental question: does Palantir have a sustainable competitive advantage?\n\nBelow, I attempt to answer that question with an in-depth look at this interesting company.\n\n**What does Palantir do?**\n\nAs of 2020, Palantir's mission is to help its users, the people doing the hard work on complex, real-world problems by writing software that enables effective analysis against complicated, data-driven problems.\n\nPalantir offers two principal data fusion platforms for integrating, managing, and securing any kind of data at a massive scale, i.e., Gotham for government agencies and Foundry for the commercial market. With forwarded-deployed Field Service Representatives, Palantir transforms massive amounts of disparate information into an integrated data asset that reflects their operations, and layer applications on top of the Gotham or Foundry platform to make the integrated data asset accessible and actionable and for fully interactive, human-driven, machine-assisted analysis (Fig. 1).\n\nOn the backend, Palantir runs a system called Apollo as a continuous, automated means to deliver updates to the Foundry and Gotham platforms everywhere they are deployed - cloud, on-premises, and classified networks - without disrupting customer operations. Apollo reduces the demand for field engineering teams to manage software deployments and gives Palantir SaaS operating efficiency in a very heterogeneous environment.\n\nLooking ahead, Palantir is poised to become the default central operating system for data across the U.S. government and its allies. The company also aspires not only to be the central operating system for data at large businesses and even entire industries. To appreciate Palantir's ambition with regard to B2B big data, it may be helpful to recall how much economic benefit has been captured by Microsoft (MSFT) after Windows OS took the lead over MacOS of Apple (AAPL) in the PC era, and by Google and Apple in the consumer mobile phone age with their respective Android and iOS operating systems.\n\nThere is a range of potential competitors that offer similar services in some capacity, including (1) traditional IT consultancies, e.g., Booz Allen (BAH) and Accenture (ACN), which lack the technical prowess as well as niche focus; (2) blue-chip data companies, e.g., IBM/i2 (IBM), which cannot scale down efficiently enough to compete on price; and (3) defense contractors such as Booz Allen (BAH), Raytheon Technologies (RTX), Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), and BAE Systems plc (OTCPK:BAESF), which cannot compete on costs and end-user responsiveness with Palantir. These juggernauts are not nimble enough to pivot away from their legacies and wide-ranging service offerings to effectively match the focus and end-user friendliness of Palantir, although they may occasionally chip away some revenue.\n\nSilicon Valley heavyweights, such as Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), are unwilling to work for the Pentagon citing unethically even though it thought it was okay to collaborate with the Chinese government in project Dragonfly (see here).\n\nThere are some smaller start-ups that work in the same general field as Palantir, but they lack the resources (capital and talent) to climb the steep learning curve and compete against Palantir head-to-head. These may include Digital Reasoning, which entered the intelligence field even before Palantir and also received funding from In-Q-Tel, the venture capital firm of the CIA, which seems not to be particularly well run which is why its founder recently returned to the CEO helms; (2) Ayasdi, acquired by the SymphonyAI Group in 2019, which has a core topological analysis platform on top of which custom applications for customers mostly in healthcare and finance are built; and Beijing-based MiningLamp, self-styling as \"the Palantir of China\" and with US$300 million just raised in a funding round co-led by Temasek and Tencent, which may pose some threat in the commercial arena given it reportedly got business from western firms (see here).\n\nWith regard to the OS platform for data especially on the government front, Palantir more or less owns the niche. On the commercial front, Palantir is industry agnostic but is focused on forging ties with approximately 6,000 companies in the world with more than $500 million in annual revenue. Palantir has been saying the real competition is the in-house development projects of its potential customers.\n\n**The digital resources space**\n\nI believe some of the key characteristics of Palantir can be better understood in the context of what I call the \"digital resources\" investment space at The Natural Resources Hub (Table 1). This is a group of businesses from various industries, which in a nutshell share the following features:\n\nA unique value proposition. By accumulating and processing big data, or enabling data-intensive operations, these B2B companies generate recurring, subscription-based revenue from business or government customers.\n\nWide moat. They command a monopolistic or oligarchic position in their niche, protected by enormous barriers to entry, some network effects, and switching costs, which gives them a sustainable competitive advantage over the fellow industry participants they serve. They tend to show resilience during industry crises.\n\nDominance in native industry. They are deeply entrenched in their respective native industries. Some of them were even bankrolled at their birth by home industry advocacy groups. They then expand into adjacent industries in pursuit of economies of scope.\n\nAggressive acquisitions. In an expansion of their service into adjacent verticals, they usually face a fragmented competitive landscape, fertile for M&amp;A, which further fuels rapid growth.\n\nCapital and operational efficiency. They develop scalable solutions that are built once and installable or sellable countless times. So, they are capital-light and can operate very efficiently. They typically generate superior profitability and deliver a high rate of returns on invested capital.\n\nAs I shall demonstrate below, Palantir shares most, if not all, of the characteristics of the verified members of the 'digital resources\" space. Prima facie, it is a wide moat prospect and worth a deeper examination.\n\n**Does Palantir have a sustainable competitive advantage?**\n\nIn the consumer-oriented internet arena, winners are known to take all thanks to a number of traits, including the economies of scale and scope, network effects, the advantage of big data and machine learning, brand power, switching costs, the attraction of talents, the charisma of hard-driving founders, and benefits of geographical clustering, as has been summarized here.\n\nThe same may not be said about the B2B platform race, where peers compete mainly on products, services, and customer experience (see here). The outcome of the competition may not be binary (the winner takes all, and the losers die) due to the lack of viral growth.\n\n**The technological edge**\n\nAs I stated above, B2B platform rivals compete primarily on products, services, and customer experience. Palantir follows the approach of bundling superior technology with top-notch forward-deployed field service representatives.\n\nIn its home industry - intelligence and defense, Gotham was created with native attention to security rules, access privilege, and user action logging. No other systems allow users to draw associations between disparate data sets and to visualize the connections as easily and quickly. Palantir has maintained a laser-sharp focus on developing the world's best platform for data, while its primary competitors such as Booz Allen or Raytheon are widely diversified. From competition outcome to reputation among end-users, Palantir not only has a clear technological edge but also is more cost-effective than competitors (see here and here). That's why Palantir is confident it only needs to be placed in front of the right people to prove its worth.\n\nBut then, what makes Gotham shine are the forward-deployed field service representatives. Palantir field service representatives proved to be not only some of the brightest engineers known to government agencies but also extremely responsive to the needs of end-users. These forwarded-deployed engineers examine customer needs, resolve all data source and complexity issues, and build out applications on top of Gotham. Once the applications are built, they train users on site until the customers are ready to use the product on their own. The forwarded-deployed engineers also bring their experience acquired in the reality of deployment back to Palantir development centers as they rotate assignments.\n\nAlthough its technology and approach are by no means cannot be replicated, Palantir makes the smart decision of focusing on a narrow scope in the sprawling B2B data landscape and, in that niche, it excels at helping customers solving complex data problems at relatively low costs, which actually takes a lot to accomplish, from well-written software, via responsive backend support, to knowledgeable forward-deployed field service representatives. It is no wonder Palantir has earned a sterling reputation for effectiveness and ease of use in the intelligence and defense circle, which I believe it can parlay into the commercial market (Fig. 2).\n\n**Palantir brand and talent attraction**\n\nGiven the forwarded-deployed engineers play such an important role in the technological advantage of Palantir (as do the backend developers), it follows that it is critical for it to attract the smartest engineers in the market if that edge is to be maintained and expanded. To that end, the founders have successfully created an aura of mystery around Palantir:\n\nIn-Q-Tel, the venture capital firm of the CIA, being its very first investor; catcher of Osama bin Laden and the would-be preventer of 9/11; buster of the hacker of Dalai Lama's personal computer and Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff;\n\nsoftware vendor to a slew of U.S. intelligence and military agencies (including the CIA, FBI, DHS, NSA, Special Operations, the Marine Corps, the U.S. Army and West Point, the U.S. Navy, the USAF, and the U.S. Space Force), police departments like NYPD, the governments of U.S. allies, and commercial businesses Ferrari (RACE), Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF), BP (BP), Merck (MRK), and JP Morgan (JPM);\n\nhelper of the NIH, CDC, and NHS to track the COVID-19 virus, the World Food Program to stop famine, and the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children to fight child exploitation;\n\nhigh-profile politicians such as former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and CIA Director George Tenet advising, while luminaries Mike Kelly, David MacNaughton, Louis Mosley (grandson of Oswald Mosley), and Fabrice Br\u00e9gier (former No. 2 at Airbus) joining to lead its Australian, Canadian, British, and French subsidiaries, respectively;\n\na dissent in Silicon Valley that takes side with the U.S.A.; let alone the persona of the hard-driving founders, including Peter Thiel who is said to be the smartest guy in the Silicon Valley besides being a co-founder of PayPal (EBAY) and the first outside investor in Facebook (FB), the lawyer-philosopher-hedge fund manager CEO Alex Karp, and the genius engineers Stephen Cohen, Joe Lonsdale, and Nathan Gettings; even Shyam Shankar, the COO, has also been getting a lot of attention...\n\nThe mystique proves to be a powerful recruiting advantage; it helps line up a self-replenishing stream of the best applicants from some of the top-ranked colleges and graduate schools, who are confident they are the smartest computer geeks, who join to work long hours with a cultish band of fellow geniuses to solve the world's hardest problems in spite of lower salaries than Silicon Valley juggernauts like Google, Facebook, and Apple (AAPL).\n\nBecoming a publicly-traded company only strengthens the staffing edge, thus posing a serious challenge for the big IT consultancies, traditional defense contractors, and smaller start-ups. Hiring the best talents will undoubtedly help sustain Palantir's technological advantage.\n\n**High barriers to entry**\n\nThere exist extremely high barriers to entry in the intelligence and defense sector. Even the best end-user experience and reputation alone are not enough to get deals closed. Below, I highlight two hurdles.\n\nJust to open doors. To open doors and lubricate negotiations, some major defense contractors spend as much as $14 million per year on lobbying.\n\nPalantir had been quick in learning the rope of getting things done in Washington D.C. It consulted Washington insiders early on and went ahead hiring former senators John Braux and Trent Lott for formal lobbying (see here). Its lobbying spending has been on a steady rise and, in the last few years, reached well over $1 million per year by hiring &gt;25 lobbyists (Fig. 3).\n\nPalantir also retained former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and CIA Director George Tenet as advisers (see here).\n\nTo overcome buyer inertia gently and forcefully. Another major challenge faced by Palantir was the department of defense saw it as an outsider that tries to sell software not even in response to any specific requests in its conventional acquisition system, oblivious to the capabilities and cost-effectiveness of Palantir Gotham.\n\nIn response, Palantir allowed free trials of Gotham and provided free services before potential military clients made any purchases; it offered free or reduced-price training to military units that purchased its software. Forward-deployed field service representatives listened to the needs of its end-users and were capable of implementing requested changes quickly.\n\nPalantir's entrepreneurial approach led to a number of successes with, e.g., some Army military intelligence units and the Marine Corps. Some intelligence officials in the Marine Corps even went so far as to say they would not be surprised to see Palantir remain the de facto standard (see here).\n\nEven though Palantir has demonstrated the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of Gotham, the U.S. Army stuck to the plan of developing its internal intelligence software suite, i.e., the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Increment 2, and released a procurement solicitation in December 2015 for its development, thus effectively excluding the ready-to-deploy commercial alternative - Gotham - from being considered. The Army decision was a major blow to Palantir because Gotham does exactly what DCGS-A is trying to do yet at a much lower cost; in other words, the Army is reinventing the wheel, unnecessarily and wastefully.\n\nAfter a pre-award bid protest filed with the Government Accountability Office had been denied, Palantir sued the Army in the Court of Federal Claims in June 2016, arguing the Army violated the 1994 Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act by not conducting the market research necessary to determine if commercially available items could meet its needs, with or without modification. The lawsuit is an extremely bold move because defense contractors typically dared not to sue its largest customer, even when their interest as protected by the 1994 law had been infringed. The judge ruled in favor of Palantir in October 2016 and upheld Palantir\u2019s argument the Army violated the 1994 law (see here), which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on September 7, 2018.\n\nEven while the appeal was ongoing, the Army rethought its acquisition plan and, in March 2018, picked Raytheon and Palantir to provide new intelligence analysis platform offerings that could be used effectively at the tactical level in place of DGCS-A. In March 2019, the Army announced Gotham beat out Raytheon's FoXTEN system and won the $20 million first delivery order, as part of an $876 million contract over 10 years. Significantly, the Army's loss in court forced it to transform its procurement process. The Army now follows a \u201ctry, buy, decide approach\u201d when it comes to commercially available products (see here). The win in the court is expected to create a lot of opportunities for Palantir down the road.\n\nThe distance Palantir has gone to gain access to the intelligence and military market proves one thing: the presence of enormous barriers to entry. In the face of such formidable hurdles, few aspirants have the determination, investment time horizon, and resources to pull off the feat of entering and establishing itself as the de facto standard in that market. Over a time span of 15+ years, Palantir sunk quite a few billions of VC dollars on software development, offering products and services for free or on lean fees, and lobbying and suing to get a level playing field, yet without a single major botch-up over all those years. Those who sneer at Palantir for still losing money after 17 years of investment fail to appreciate how impossible a strategic goal the company has come to set for itself: to become a wide-moat software supplier to the governments of the U.S. and its allies.\n\n**Switching cost, economies of scale, and network effect**\n\nHaving earned contracts from the intelligence and defense sector, Palantir became an insider so to speak, and the barriers to entry work to its advantage. Gotham has been deployed as the platform for data integration at various intelligence and military units displacing the existing system including DGCS-A, a myriad of applications has been developed for the agents, and thousands of end-users have been trained to use those applications on a tactical level in critical missions and battlefields. A switching cost has arisen in favor of Palantir and it will only get higher.\n\nAs more contracts are signed with the U.S. government and its allies, Palantir will begin to enjoy economies of scale, thanks to the large fixed costs incurred for building the software once and the relatively low costs associated with deploying it countless times.\n\nJust playing out according to Palantir's plan, Gotham is increasingly being used for sharing disparate data sets across different government agencies. Once those siloed data sets are all integrated on Gotham, there will emerge a huge network effect, further heightening the existing barriers to entry. Under such a network effect, a new entrant may land an isolated deal sporadically, but it is beyond me how this hypothetical incursor can dislodge Palantir by convincing dozens of stodgy government agencies to simultaneously give up perfectly-functional, mission-critical Gotham and install an unproven piece of software instead. That's why I believe Palantir's competitive advantage in the government sector will prove to be sustainable.\n\n**The commercial market**\n\nAs I discussed above, 'digital resources' companies tend to expand into adjacent verticals for the benefit of economies of scope. Palantir's expansion into various industries in the commercial sector is precisely for that end. The same technological know-how sharpened in defense deployments can be parlayed into serving the commercial sector. The utilization of Apollo, the backend system for continuous, automated software update deployment, doubles as it supports Foundry in addition to Gotham. The corporate resources are shared by operations in both sectors, resulting in lower overhead per dollar of revenue. The direct sales force will be able to cross-sell Gotham to some commercial customers. Diversification into additional industries reduces the risk associated with the slowdown of individual industries. As opposed to the high barriers to entry in its home industry of intelligence and defense, the commercial world tends to have more competitors. However, economies of scope will likely offset the narrower moat.\n\n**Network effect in the commercial sector**\n\nOver the long term, Palantir (PLTR) estimates the total addressable commercial market contains \\~6,000 companies with more than $500 million in annual revenue (see here). Palantir began to develop Foundry for the commercial sector in 2012 and launched it in 2016. Foundry is poised to become a central operating system not only for individual institutions but also for entire industries. In 2017, e.g., the five-year, $300 million partnership with Airbus allowed Foundry to expand into a platform for the aviation industry, which today connects data from &gt;100 airlines and 9,000 aircraft around the world.\n\nIf successful, an industry-wide central operating system for data will effectuate an extensive network effect. However, to get there, Palantir needs to rapidly grow the commercial top-line. Foundry pulled in $340 million in 2018 and $397 million in 2019. Commercial revenue grew 35% from the 3Q2019 to the same period one year ago (see here). How will Palantir further accelerate commercial sales momentum?\n\n**Commercial sales strategies to accelerate the network effect**\n\nIn the near term, Palantir plans to focus on building partnerships with institutions that have the leadership necessary to effect structural change within their organizations - to reconstitute their operations around data. Buy-in from the top brass is imperative. Hopefully, Palantir can leverage its reputation and relationships gained in the government sector, as in an early case in which NYPD, then a customer, introduced Palantir to its first commercial client JP Morgan (JPM).\n\nPalantir used to have a policy of not hiring direct salespeople, given how intelligence and military contracts are acquired and serviced and perhaps due to a post-dotcom bubble belief \"technology is primarily about product development, not distribution\". However, there is absolutely no viral growth in B2B as there occasionally is in B2C. The common practice in the 'digital resources' space is to maintain a large force of salespeople each managing a few customer accounts, with responsibilities such as opening new sales territory, scouting for client needs, scaling within existing customer accounts, coordinating technical presentations by engineers, securing technical support for clients, and managing customer relationships. Palantir began to recruit direct salespeople in end-2018. The commercial sales growth in 2019 seems to prove the concept of direct sales works, so Palantir is poised to triple the headcount of the sales force.\n\nHistorically, data-inundated organizations either build in-house or buy dozens of off-the-shelf products and sew them together, both approaches having been proven inefficacious in a rapidly changing and increasingly uncertain world. Foundry offers the third, and better, option for those organizations. However, Palantir comes to realize that, in the near-term, institutions do have an imperative to stick to their internally-built software. So, Palantir makes its own solutions fully modular such that customers can \"take what they need, build on what they have\" (see here). Such a flexible approach should help overcome corporate inertia to reach out for external assistance and accelerate customer onboarding, and create a new way of going to market with channel partners.\n\nPalantir plans to partner with cloud-hosting channel partners, such as Amazon (AMZN), to drive commercial revenue growth. It was Amazon that helped facilitate the partnership between Palantir and the Colombian government. Palantir developed Visor COVID-19, a digital instrument built on top of Foundry hosted in the AWS infrastructure and offering a unified, near real-time view of the state of the pandemic using the largest integration of open data and depersonalized epidemiological data in Colombia.\n\nInternational sales already account for fo 46% of the total revenue as of the 3Q2020. As part of its international growth plan, Palantir has set up subsidiaries in Canada, Australia, the U.K., France, and other countries in the last few years. In Japan, it took a different approach and chose to form a joint venture in partnership with Sompo Holdings, Inc., which subsequently invested $500 million in Palantir. The JV launched in June 2020 \u201cthe real data platform for security, health, and wellbeing\u201d, powered by Foundry, to accelerate the digital transformation of Japanese governmental institutions and industries ranging from healthcare to automotive to manufacturing. The JV is also working on onboarding the Japanese government.\n\n**Risk abounds**\n\nPublic relation disasters can damage its image in the eyes of the next generation of software engineers; this is an area that Palantir, now a public company, should allocate additional resources to. A Snowden-like incident can set Palantir back appreciably, impacting client relationships and employee morale alike.\n\nPalantir must penetrate its chosen market swiftly to enlarge the switching cost, expand the network effect, and heighten barriers to entry, lest a resourceful competitor launches a dogged challenge in the government sector or its smaller imitators strike it lucky in the commercial market and steal potential customers. A well-intended acquisition can turn sour, contaminating the entire operation.\n\nAs far as I can see, the management team at Palantir is paranoid enough to allow any blind spots unaddressed in its business execution. However, Black swans do happen.\n\n**Investor takeaways**\n\nI believe Palantir has an inchoate durable competitive advantage, which acts as an economic moat to protect its business from invaders, which seems to be widening judging from new developments since the IPO.\n\nIn the self-created niche of supplying the operating systems for data for government agencies, Palantir clearly delivers a peerless customer experience with superior technology bundled with top-notch forward-deployed field service representatives.\n\nGotham has become the default operating system for data at some U.S. government agencies, where Palantir enjoys switching costs.\n\nPalantir seems to have also built a brand that helps attract top-notch talents, which sustains its technological edge.\n\nNow that it has kicked open the door of the U.S. government agencies by winning a critical lawsuit against the Army, Palantir is expected to achieve rapid penetration of that market. Gotham is increasingly being used for integrating siloed data sets across different government agencies, which in time will result in an enormous network effect, further heightening the barriers to entry for aspirant entrants.\n\nThe company is aggressively diversifying into adjacent commercial verticals and international markets for economies of scope. Revenue growth, both from the government and commercial sectors, will lead to economies of scale. Down the road, Palantir will have the pricing power at its disposal to drive profitability.\n\nAt this time, the share price of Palantir may seem to have gotten ahead of itself - a point to be further explored elsewhere. The shareholders are taking risks to bet that the company will succeed in digging the wide moat and that years of profitable growth will follow.\n\nLess anticipatory investors may want to wait until Palantir has completed building such a wide moat. For these investors, the entry opportunity may come in the form of a major sell-off during a general market recession or in an idiosyncratic crisis down the road.\n\n**TL;DR - PLTR has great prospects, short-term casino, long term (8-12 months) to the moon**\n\nPositions: some shares of PLTR, some 12/4 $30 puts (hedge) at 50% gainz.",

        "selftext": "We\u2019ve all seen it parroted on every investing related thread in the history of Reddit- \u201ctime in the market beats timing the market\u201d. But I feel like this phrase gets misused quite a lot, and I would like to take this boring workday of a Saturday to just show the power of what \u201ctime in the market\u201d actually has. \n\n1. What \u201ctime in the market\u201d means and what it doesn\u2019t mean \n\nTime in the market means, basically, maintaining ownership of assets that either 1, typically appreciate in value over time (stocks, real estate, commodities, etc) or 2, that produce a steady, ideally increasing, stream of income (dividend paying stocks, a business, rental properties, debt, etc). By \u201ctime in the market\u201d it means that ownership of these assets over long periods of time, as in years and decades, is the key to wealth accumulation. If you look at most wealthy person alive today and in history, they gained their wealth through assets. They accumulate assets and own them. \n\n\u201cTime in the market\u201d does NOT mean buying clearly overvalued hype stocks because \u201cI\u2019m in for the long term\u201d. I\u2019m not gonna say any because I don\u2019t want the comments to just be arguing about whether or not tesla is overvalued, but I hope you get the idea. However this doesn\u2019t mean to just let your cash sit on the sidelines \u201cwaiting for a crash\u201d. Typically there is no reason to have all your net worth tied up in cash, as it is the only asset class guaranteed to lose value over time. Rather, you should be in the middle: continuing to own assets you already own and being on the lookout for more, fairly valued ones. I promise you that you can find value out there if you look for it. Even then you don\u2019t necessarily always have to be buying. Sometimes doing nothing is the best choice. \n\n2. You\u2019re probably wasting your time (and money) \n\nIf you\u2019re anticipating a crash, good luck. There have been 8 major crashes since the 1920\u2019s: an average of one every 12 years. There have been flash crashes and small recession but these shouldn\u2019t concern you at all. On the large scale, the market has trended up for most of its existence. What makes this time different, exactly? Bulls have a tendency to believe that this time is different, but bears can have the same mindset, especially  considering that the US has been in a bull market for most of its history. So what makes this time different? Sure, we will enter a bear market eventually but the US market has never failed retest its highs. If you\u2019re selling because you anticipate a \u201ccorrection\u201d, you\u2019re just wasting your time and money. Corrections are a blip on the radar over time. They are normal, healthy and should be seen as a good thing, just the market breathing, per se; nobody actually thinks \u201cstocks only go up and never go down\u201d. \n\nOnce you gain real money, in the high six figures and up, taxes will really start to eat into you. Selling positions with the intent to buy back in after a correction is probably an unprofitable endeavor. Why pay a good chunk of your earnings in taxes just to buy back 10% cheaper, especially when the 10% drop may or may not happen when you expect it to? This ties in to the last paragraph of point one, sometimes it\u2019s best to do nothing and just continue to hold, letting your money work for you. \n\n3. Generational wealth\n\nThis is my main point. The Rothschilds, for example, have been building an empire for almost 300 years. That is 300 years of compounding interest. One thing they have done is accumulate assets, not sell them. The wealthy families of the Netherlands have been passing down assets for almost 400 years. Even on a less grandiose scale, just look to this subreddit. You\u2019ll notice a lot of the users with higher portfolio balances probably received a nice inheritance somewhere along the way. This isn\u2019t a bad thing and shouldn\u2019t be shamed. After all, isn\u2019t that everyone\u2019s goal, to pass their wealth into their children? Unfortunately, with inheritances, a huge majority of inherited wealth is lost by the third generation. When the younger generation doesn\u2019t know how to properly manage wealth, they end up wasting it all instead of further building it up. \n\n4. Compound interest \n\nSome call it the eighth wonder of the world, and rightfully so. There is no reason to interrupt compound interest unnecessarily. I would hope that most people here are investing with the goal of attaining compound interest, and selling your compounding assets is a solid way to halt it. \n\n5. Dividends \n\nWhether or not you chase dividends, I think we can all agree that we get some form of dividends or income from our investments. Dividends really show their power after several years of ownership. Buffett, for example, gets a 40% annual return from dividends on his initial Coca Cola investment. Fourty percent! And he doesn\u2019t even DRIP them. Why on earth would people get rid of their assets that have potential to give those kind of returns after some years of ownership is beyond me. If you do a dividend return calculator going back multiple decades, you\u2019ll find that most dividend paying securities will have similar returns once you have mature ownership of them. \n\n6. On \u201ctiming the market\u201d\n\nThis is probably a controversial one but I definitely don\u2019t believe in just buying whatever tickers you want because \u201ctime in the market beats timing the market\u201d. Like I said above, time in &gt; timing because of generational wealth, compound interest and ownership. It doesn\u2019t mean buying the hottest Reddit ticker because you\u2019re in for the long term. Taking well assessed risks with positive and realistic upside is ideal. Spending time to make sure the investment you\u2019re about to make is a good investment is smart. If spending a week or two assessing your decision is a way to \u201cmiss out on sick gains bro, it\u2019ll go up another 50% before you buy\u201d, it\u2019s probably a FOMO stock and you shouldn\u2019t be in in the first place. If patience is key, that means patience with buying is just as important as patience with holding. \n\nAt the end of the day I\u2019m a believer in ownership. Looking through most of wealthy individuals of today and in history, they all had one thing in common: they maintained possession of assets. They don\u2019t sell their portfolios because they\u2019re scared of a crash, they don\u2019t have their net worth in a savings account. They assume a little bit of managed risk and let their money work for them. \n\nI made this post because I have to work on a Saturday and have nothing going on, I hope you at least enjoyed it or disagree with it so we can have some discussion going.",

        "selftext": "So I did an update 4 days ago telling you why PLTR at 22 was the short term bottom, \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k63z6b/pltr\\_technical\\_analysis\\_from\\_a\\_professional/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k63z6b/pltr_technical_analysis_from_a_professional/)\n\nnow I will go over how to trade the stock in the next couple of weeks. \n\nAs you can see in the chart below, we are replicating the movements made by Nio in the first phase of its run-up. We had the initial run up from about $5/share to $16 and then a fall and consolidation to about $10. It then subsequently moved up to about $15 giving the illusion of a double top and trapping all the bears when it then fell to $12 before rocketing up to $20.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f2q9pv3310461.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4617e401f9dbbfc32d1e925972834c40306f529\n\nIn a similar way, expect consolidation for a couple of days and a near term bottom of around 23-26 before the next leg moves up. If we go by Nio, expect a target of $41-45 over the next two weeks. So get out of your 12/11 weekly calls now, those won't pay out and will likely just eat theta. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wemw3ofszz361.png?width=667&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e3d6ba992b74ea6260ff956ba5c2dc300a5f8cf\n\nOption convexity is also sort of at a mid point between the lows achieved on 12/2 and the extremes exhibited on 11/25, which tells you we are sort of in a mid point, nowhere near a short term bottom or a short term top.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xlpdfz1hzz361.png?width=877&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2d7e5841e6d5517b4c93d3e2d5182a26e392b12\n\nI did not bother playing this expected short term volatility as I bought 1/15 calls at the $22 low. But you'll probably get another chance at it if we see PLTR at the 24-26 range. \n\n**TLDR: roll out your 12/11 options, bet on 12/25 options at the earliest, best strikes are 25-35. Cashout at least 2/3 if PLTR hits $41-44.**",

        "selftext": "From your own experience, how realistic is it for a retail investor with above-average intelligence who's emotionally stable enough not to make rash decisions and an eagerness to keep learning about the stock market to make at least 10% profits from their investments consistently on a yearly basis? \n\nI'm wondering because I keep reading that it's highly unlikely to outperform the market (as far as I'm not mistaken, a yearly ROI of 10% would signify an outperformance of the market, ), at least on a consistent basis. Though the more I think about it and the more time passes since I've started investing (admittedly, I've started only a short time ago, but I feel like I already know a lot more compared to when I started out), the more I think it's very well possible and not that unrealistic at all to consistently achieve yearly returns of 10%. If you're knowledgeable about the company you're intending on buying stocks from respectively if you've done your homework, before buying a company's shares (e.g. studying balance sheets, making sure you understand the business model, the industry, competitors, long-term demand in the future of the goods a company produces etc.), you should be able to significantly improve your odds of picking \"winners\" and avoiding \"losers\"? \n\nFor example, the DAX index (Germany) composes of the thirty biggest German companies based on market cap listed on the German stock exchange. Let's assume half of them have a yearly growth rate of 0-7,5% while the other half has a yearly growth rate of 7,5-15%. Let's call the first half \"losers\" (they're not really losers since they're still profitable, yet still less profitable than the other half I'm comparing them to) and the second half \"winners\". If you invested into a DAX index fund, you'd be basically buying stocks from all those thirty companies, among them 15 companies that perform \"badly\". \n\nNow let's assume an investor, who does his homework, decides to buy ten stocks from DAX-listed companies. If he does his research well, 8 of his stocks will turn out \"winners\" per definition from above while 2 of them will turn out \"losers\". In other words: he'd have picked 8 companies with ROI within the range from 7,5-15% and two companies who's ROI are within the 0-7,5% range. If he'd invested in the DAX index fund, he'd have picked 5 \"winning\" companies and 5 \"losing\" companies, if we take my second paragraph into consideration, which is just a fictional example and thus to be taken with a grain of salt. Now, in this scenario the retail investor with 8 winners/2 losers can expect better yearly results than the one who invests in the whole DAX index fund, since he was able to \"weed out\" the \"losers\" more efficiently while increasing the amount of losers in his portfolio, right? If yes, the retail investor who picks his stocks himself could consequently could expect to outperform the market. Granted he knows how to research a company of course. But let's assume this one is a given in this hypothetical example...",

Not shares, dollar amount. So if short squeeze brings this stock to 77.2$ (5B market cap) 2% dilution.\n\n3.\tNo mention of Cohen or Microsoft Deal.\n\nJust want to let people know that that 100m dollars (**NOT SHARES**) in dilution is just an option. Management put it out there either to make some $ when this short squeeze and/or to fend off Cohen for a bit. If you listen on the conference call. [Here\u2019s the link but I'll just cut to the chase.](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/12/09/gamestop-gme-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)\n\n\\*William Reuter -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\*\n\n\\*OK.

Would you consider issuing stocks to repay debt under that program?\\*\n\n\\*George Sherman -- Chief Executive Officer\\*\n\n\\*No, that's absolutely not the intent. The intent here is to simply optimize flexibility and optionality. Period. There is a lot of unknowns going on in the marketplace with respect to this pandemic, ongoing flex of cases across the world, the impacts on our own businesses.\n\nAnd we're not immune to that, right? And, in that regard, look, we're going to continue to execute our strategies that have bolstered and strengthen our balance sheet. And you see all the work that we've done, including, if we go back to even the long-term debt levels in early 2019 until today, it's -- you know, as of this coming Friday will have reduced our long-term debt over $530 million, by March of '21, they'll be over $600 million. In that same timeframe, that same roughly 24-month timeframe, plus or minus, we also returned over $200 million to shareholders. So, I think -- look, the goal is to continue to focus on running the business and optimizing we run the business, but also be very pragmatic and make sure that we have capital flexibility with no intention to do anything other than maintain our flexibility.\n\nHopefully that helps you.\\*\n\n\\*Jim Bell -- Chief Financial Officer\\*\n\n\\*\\*And as far as \\[Inaudible\\] is concerned, we don't need it.

I wanted to do a bit of DD on BFT but also wanted to highlight something that was brought to my attention by a degenerate gambler. Lastly, I wanted to compile some good little snippets that have been put together by some other members as well as from the investor presentation.\n\n**Before reading further please understand the major Risks.**\n\n* This is SPAC with \\~10.00 NAV, if the deal falls through it could drop to 10.00 USD\n* The warrants could be very lucrative but they can be called and if a deal fails to materialize, these can become worthless.\n* If you're ok with the above risks, continue reading.\n\nKeep in mind that this merger is not complete, but the terms of the deal have been provided to investors and we will be able to either vote yes for the deal or vote no and redeem our shares in BFT for 10.00 cash. So there is downside to this play should the vote not go through or should the two entities terminate the agreement. Right now the downside is \\~3 dollars per share according to the close price from today.\n\n# MY POSITIONS - Mostly PRPL, PSTH and BFT/BFT.W\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ygrfo9vp0b461.jpg?width=1065&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccd5cd4846d0cdcd6f1ed0e7a37548399a5cf461\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fd3o99vp0b461.jpg?width=1072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96faf02b077fc060c6025bbf7976b54edc6db493\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Customers and MOAT\n\n* Deep Customer Base with deep ties to gambling/betting industry with Deep penetration in Europe and growing customer bases around the world. Gambling is a tricky business and regulated differently than other industries. Many big players have avoided the industry and Paysafe has a great reputation and has become one of the early movers in the industry. The following are some notable customers.\n* &amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0bhbpnvr0b461.jpg?width=473&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57ec71dfedd8c6eb1d604282021340fbd8d39025\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cno03rvr0b461.jpg?width=285&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4281b8e0db4783b7b4b6cce74f62f0694bdbb008\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* A gentleman u/dancinadventures posted this comment on my last post:\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *I actually know Paysafe and the usage quite well.*\n\n*PayPal has many restrictions in Europe regarding iGaming , so does Square.*\n\n*This is a big play on iGaming for those that aren\u2019t aware.*\n\n*I was a mid- high stakes online poker player through the 2010-2018. Played a variety of sites. : iPoker; PokerStars, Paddy, MicroGaming, 888, Party. Why so many sites? Because I was always on lookout for where the action was, if a big whale sat down at one online casino; you bet your sweet ass I\u2019m there.*\n\n*So let me give you my take as a consumer that\u2019s probably spent over $100,000 in transaction fees personally on Paysafe.*\n\n*This was one of the cheapest and fastest ways to move money around online.*\n\n*Unlike Stripe this which is against risky business such as CBD and gambling, paysafe is actually one of the leading payment providers in both UK/AUS / Ireland for iGaming.*\n\n*Big example is William Hill, Bet365, Bwin.*\n\n*Now why would you want to move money online around as a gambler ?*\n\n*Well, Visa/MC charge close to 50%-&gt;75% more, online casinos = the merchant. They don\u2019t wanna pay that, and in fact put limits on this type of payment processor. (Your visa\u2019s credit cards etc). If a punter deposits / withdraws frequently, the online casino could literally be on the hook for like 20-30% of the turnover throughout the gambler\u2019s period. (This assumes the gambler doesn\u2019t lose all his money per deposit.*\n\n*Imagine you\u2019re a professional sportsbettor, you\u2019re not loyal to one site. Different spreads / odds are offered on every site, you want to be able to move your money from one to another quickly and cheaply. Arbitrage opportunities do exist in sports betting as bookmakers hedge their books to minimize risk, diff frequencies of bets occur on each sports book; you get the idea.*\n\n*For recreational punters, it\u2019s simple: some sporting events that are smaller simply don\u2019t exist on one site that exist on another. Eg. Perhaps you using Pinnacle / 10dimes for low spreads on high volume events, but perhaps you want to gamble on live events on bet365 on another day, and bet ponies on Hill.*\n\n*What if you only have $5000 ? Giant pain in ass to deposit money to each site, paysafe lets you move it around easily.*\n\n*Should you use visa, you may get blocked from depositing on various sites; Bodog, WHill, Bet365 just to name a few. Withdrawals and clearing deposits with bank transfers or checks takes days-&gt; weeks and gamblers ain\u2019t gonna wait for that shit.*\n\n*You can also buy prepaid paysafe cards from stores if you don\u2019t wish to use your real credit card; and load that shit up.*\n\n*One of the biggest markets this is prominent in is South east Asia, they are some of the biggest punters and fucking loving gambling. Looking at you pinoys, Indonesians, Malays. Not everyone wants to fly to Macau to get their rocks off.*\n\n*As much as this is a play on FinTech, please understand this company has more or less the best Payment service on online gambling globally.*\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# The Comparable VALUATIONS\n\nFrom this chart you can see that there looks to be some favorable multiples that could improve once a deal closes. Also, I'm very bullish on the great Margins as well as the conservative growth. I think Foley along with the growing Igaming undervalues the potential of this company. Just the Draft Kings relationship make me tingle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aozxwuft0b461.jpg?width=722&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e40cbc4538ff3bef87a31050dca316ecae996a9b\n\n# Management and Growth\n\n* Bill Effing Foley - I have a thing for guys name Bill and this guy get my nips hard.\n   * This guy has turned shit into gold. See his previous ventures before and after....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dp6oe2ew0b461.jpg?width=386&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e6f137c95fec971568dfa5bc07d0290997c753d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mhl9b7ew0b461.jpg?width=326&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f57ec2eb7c7c318323373af10c8bb12b03e9082e\n\n* Bill has connections and a strategy to dominate Igaming.\n* Igaming addressable Market is expected to grow immensely from a few billion to tens of billions.\n* &amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qfacblzz0b461.jpg?width=241&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbcdace95286ffccf613daa79b93554ca3e5728b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is an end to end payment processor with big big big name relationships for very disruptive companies that have huge addressable markets. The reason I am excited is because IGAMING is just really starting to take off and Paysafe is a first mover with brand new experienced management and very very fair valuations that could pop after a merger.\n\nTL;DR- BUY BFT stock and BFT.W because BFT stands for big freaking tenies.",

Now, if you're an unwoke retard, which you probably are, the first thing you think of is \"They're still alive?\" / \"they still sell phones?\" / \"hurr durr what is this 2010?\" Don't worry, you're not alone, as this assumption doesn't elude even the best boomer trader of them all, Jim Cramer, who just 2 days ago told people to \"sell Blackberry and buy Apple\" after the Amzon announcement (to be covered in a bit). Newsflash -- they don't even compete in the same market anymore, boomer!! They haven't been competing in the same market since 2013, as they quietly pivot from hardware to software. \n\nIn short, Blackberry is now a software company, who has a powerful operating system, QNX, which is used in Audi, BMW, Jaguar, Land Rover, and Toyota cars. BlackBerry just partnered with Amazon to develop BlackBerry IVY, which collects a multitude of vehicle data from all these manufacturers. Yes, it is true that Tesla has a HUGE advantage over any other single (keyword: single) automobile manufacturer when it comes to driving and road data, but what happens when you consolidate EVERYONE ELSE who is frothing to beat Tesla for vehicle and road data? BB's data (scaling with AWS) will absolutely catch up and crush TSLA's.\n\nHold on it gets better. BB ALSO does cybersecurity with US FedRAMP certifications, which allows the US government to use their end to end solution for secure communications. They also own AtHoc, which has been crushing it for COVID crisis communications for universities, hospitals, and Fortune 500 companies, including a partnership with ServiceNow for incident management tracking, and in Microsoft Teams for enterprise communications. For a cybersecurity comparison, Crowdstrike (CRWD) trades at a price-to-sales ratio of roughly 40x, Palo Alto Networks at about \\~8x. BB \"only\" make 800-1b annually and growing, (about what Palantir makes), and is **only** trading at 3.3x sales. If someone can give me DD on why CRWD will eat BB's lunch, I will eat my socks if BB doesn't eventually float up closer to these valuations.\n\n If this company were rebranded RaspBerry and fresh IPOing today you bet your ass it would instantly be a 30 to 50bill market cap company. Factor in \"car data\", \"government security contracts\" hype add another 10billion. I almost don't want to post this DD as I'm not done accumulating shares yet, but will definitely be buying on any pullback. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: BlackBerry 1/15 9c, eyeing the 3/19 10c. AMD flashbacks to when they were only worth 4billion.  \nLastly, SpaceX (Falcon) uses QNX OS. Where do these \ud83d\ude80 go? SPACE.

Yesterday, the madness began and believe me, it's just starting. This company is still EXTREMELY undervalued and $SLS will hit $20 MINIMAL at the end of the year and that's even way too conservative. It's just to show you that anything under $20 a share for $SLS is a BARGAIN.\n\n$GLSI is a sister company of $SLS, because they are specified in the same field: Breast Cancer Medicine. But here is the trick: the medicine of $SLS is WAY more effective than $GLSI's medicine. The Market Cap of $SLS is still 60 Million and that's NOWHERE near their deal with China that's worth 200 MILLION.

        "selftext": "So I accidently did a DD today, inspired by the sources of this [Washington Post Story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/07/unemployed-debt-rent-utilities/). The numbers behind on mortgage/rent come from [This Census Survey](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/demo/hhp/hhp19.html#tables). The unpaid rent/mortgage number comes from [a Philly Fed Study](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/community-development/reports/household-rental-debt-during-covid-19.pdf) estimate that the average household behind will owe ~$5,800 and multiplying it by the census numbers for behind on rent/mortgage. The real numbers may be as low 1/3 that of my estimate, but $100 billion makes for a good title. The census numbers lag a few weeks (Nov 11-23) so there also the possibility that I have slightly underestimated. \n\nLooking at the numbers a different way, in terms of the numbers of people eligible for eviction/foreclosure come Jan 1 when the national moratorium is lifted, the Nov 11-23 numbers represent a 45+ day delinquency. We get close to 70 million people using the raw household numbers from the census data, multiplied by the household size. One mitigating factor here is that some lenders are choosing to tack on owed mortgage payments to end the of the loan instead of seeking immediate repayment. Assuming half of the 30 million delinquent mortgages are given the option to defer payments to the end of the loan the total numbers fall to ~55 million or roughly 1/6 of the US population. The other mitigating factor is the patchwork of local and state eviction moratoriums in many of the large cities and populous costal states, which account for roughly 2/3rds of the population. This result is better but still grim, between 15-20 million up for eviction, concentrated in areas without eviction moratoriums where the eviction rate will be roughly 1 in 6. Many forced from their homes will never make a significant contribution ever again, those that do it will be years before they get back on their feet.\n\nAnother metric to look at is the value of the housing that the tens of billions in missed rent/mortgage payments represent. Doing quick and dirty math of 300k median housing price times 17 million households gives the astonishing $5.1 trillion in toxic residential assets. Using 2/3rds to account for the lower per unit cost of apartments and condos that's still $3.5 trillion and who knows what multiple of that number is tied up in MBSs and derivatives dependent on those loans. This also doesn't account for the lost value as millions of vacant houses and apartments start flooding every market without an eviction moratorium. \n\nnote: I'm not expecting a new Stimulus bill before the 116th congress adjourns, so I'm not considering its effects. Both sides keep drawing lines in the sand the other wont cross, and have been for 7 months. Or put another way, we ain't getting shit with DOW@30k. Even if the eviction moratorium gets extended all we're doing is driving further up the mountain before driving off the cliff. \n\nTL;DR: Tens of Billions of missed payments, trillions in toxic assets, millions becoming homeless starting Jan 1, millions of evections starting Jan 1, a flood of vacant units destroying rental and property prices, cats and dogs living together, it's September 1929, only all the speakeasies are closed. \n\nOh yeah, I haven't even considered commercial properties.\n\nPositions: \n\nShares: SPY, QQQ, EFA, GLD, SIL, DWCPF, BA, GE.\n\nBets: GPS, CPRI, PLNT PUTS\n\nHedges: VIX rolling 4-6 week $20C.",

        "selftext": "**CRSR -** Corsair Gaming should be looked at again for WSB's next big play. WSB was high on CRSR after earnings and hit a ATH high of $51.37 earlier last month and is currently trading 35% below its ATH. With the success WSB has had on bringing in retail investors and media recognition, CRSR could easily double from current levels. Let me break out why\n\n**IPO and history:** CRSR ipo'ed back in August 21, 2020. Selling 14 million shares to investors/retail (This float will be important later on) at a price of $17. The stock traded mostly sideways until its first earning report where it blew out estimates on November 10th and rallied from $27 to $51 in a 14 day span.\n\n**Revenue Growth:** CRSR has been growing revenues rapidly year over year, with 17% growth from 2018 (937M) to 2019 (1.1B). CRSR is on track for its best year yet with revenues YTD 9 months of 1.1B and Q4 earnings coming up expecting revenues in the $450m+ (low on guidance, I expected $600m+) range due to the Christmas sales bump/blackfriday/cyber moday. Representing 55% revenue growth from prior year and drastically exceeding its computer accessory peers. (LOGI 11% 2019 growth and 6.3% 2020 revenue growth) This factor alone should pay dues in its upcoming earnings  come February 2021.\n\n**Valuation to competitors:** \n\nLOGI: 15B market cap - 3B annual sales (6.3% annual growth) Price to sales: 5.06\n\nCRSR: 3B market cap - 1.66B+ annual sales (51% annual growth) Price to sales 1.91\n\n**Inventory:** CRSR has expanded its production facilities over the past year and began to stock pile inventory for the upcoming increase in demand during holiday season (christmas, black friday, cyber monday). Inventory levels of 210m Sept 2020 vs 144M June 2020. All old inventory on the books went on fire sale and were on the top deals pages for slick deals/walmart/amazon. With prices slashed up to 50% off these items were quick to sell out and these sales will be reflected in the upcoming earnings call. Guidance was forecasted at 450M for upcoming quarter, which is on the safe side and inline with their Q3 earnings but I expect it to blow these estimates out of the water and coming in at the 600M+ range which would be inline with their quarterly sales growth excluding holiday sales bump (generally a 15% increase in sales from Q3.\n\n**Margin Growth and turning a profit**: CRSR has been implementing economies of scale and recent revenue growth to begin to turn a profit. CRSR has gone net income in Dec 2019 of 6m to 36m as of September 2020. \n\n**Balance sheet:** CRSR has a strong balance sheet with no red flags. Consistent increasing cash positions, Strong working capital, Increased inventory levels for the holiday season rush and minimal debt. The IPO raised238 million dollars from the proceeds and was directly applied toward their debt. Reducing it from 500m to 370m. Which should be paid off by the end of 2022. They are cashflow positive and will no longer need any cash injections/share offerings in the future.\n\n**Recent Sell off:**  \n\nTaking profits: People who rode the stock up from earnings from $27 bucks to $51 taking profits and investing in other hot sectors EV/SPAC/IPOs. The dry up on volume has resulted in this stock heavily following the SPY.\n\nAnalyst Downgrade: Cowen &amp; Co downgraded the stock with a price target of $37 causing it to drop 15% early last week, stating the risk is to high with its recent run up and is overvalued compared to LOGI. (see analysis above, on a price to sales where CRSR is currently trading at below 2 P/S compared to LOGI at above 5 P/S\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FLOAT!!!!!!!:** The main reason this should be WSB's next play is its tiny float. Of the total 91.92m shares outstanding only 17.79M represent the public float which was offered during their IPO. The remainder of the float is still locked up until February 22,2021. \n\nOf this 17.79m Float institutions own 14.47m (all purchased between October 19th to November 27th)\n\nSome key holders include -\n\nBlackRock: 2.16m shares\n\nJP Morgan : 1.96m shares\n\nMassachusetts financial : 1.55m shares\n\nCitadel advisors : 1.9m shares\n\nJPM small growth : 1.27m shares\n\nFMR: 1.06m shares\n\nThe remaining public float is sitting at **3.32 million shares for a 3 billion dollar company**.  This stock can be manipulated and pumped by our autistic forces easily. Which is one of the reasons why this stock ran to $50 bucks on minimal volume. (this was before institutions loaded up, will be even easier to pump a second time around)\n\n**Short interest:** 1.6 million shares are currently shorted (50% of the active float), these shorts will have to call at the first sign of another run up, sending this to the moon.\n\n**Bid/Ask spreads:** the daily spread on this stock is alone is anywhere from .7% to 1.2% which further proves how tight of a float we have here. Once we get our autists to slap the ask we will see this thing pump 15-20% days.\n\n**TLDR: CRSR is generating record revenue growth and undervalued to its peers (LOGI), has a strong balance sheet and to kick it off has a public traded float of 3.3m which will send this stock flying the moment we get behind it. Calls are relatively cheap due to recent sell off and volume drying up. Best case we send this back to ATH's where it should be, worst case you have money invested in a undervalued company that will crush earnings come early February.**",

I am cutting down the number of words I am writing because it has come to my attention from comments in my previous posts that a lot of you guys can't read. So I am going to keep it even more basic. \n\nWe are now approaching where TSLA and NIO were after their first initial rally, correction, and then symmetrical triangle. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m13h2asxbe561.png?width=594&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d2bcd56633228d87d1cc2fa58ee4635e723820c\n\nAgain, this was the same chart for Tesla for the first phase of the run-up and transition to the second run-up. The slight skew of the triangle doesn't matter, what matters is you see a narrowing of the band before the upward movement. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r4440zkece561.png?width=630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd0b765f39485954c2295f2bc3a5439c23a8488c\n\nNow we look at option pricing. Option deltas  are the most attractive that I have seen on PLTR for almost 1+ month now. These tell me that there are very few buyers of call options at this point and we are in a lull before periods of significant more option buying. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kwezz3f2de561.png?width=701&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aacec7699dec74b1cbfc14f6575b04beb7e5a08e\n\nWe are about to start the explosive second run phase of Palantir and my target still mid to low 40s by end of the year/early next year.  This is of course assuming we don't get a massive stock market crash for which I have small amounts of hedges on VIX calls that are rolling on a monthly basis. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rqn2evvide561.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1404b16d4a6e1641722905bfb9d33a13a5f0136a\n\nTLR: go long PLTR now. You are already seeing doubters on PLTR on WSB. This means from a psychological stand-point, most would be sellers are already gone. The market is now open widely to incremental buyers. I bought some 12/24 calls at the 30 strike and added more to my 5/21 50 strike.",

        "selftext": "Good Morning! Who is ready for another wild day?\n\nLet's dive right into it!\n\nToday, I'll be discussing different tactics you could play SLS today and how I will play it: you can trade it short term or long term and what if it has a small dip, because expectations aren't met, or it shoots right to the stratosphere.\n\nAt 2:15 PM CT, Sellas will give their presentation of their NPS vaccine. (Don't misunderstand NPS with GPS, where SLS already got a license deal over with China.) If you already did DD on NPS, you know these results are incredible and extremely effective. (I'll be giving a link to Presentations of SLS in history at the end of my post, where you can check the results yourself) \n\nFirst, we're going over the situation where the presentation isn't as quite as amazing as we all think. It will probably dip, you'll buy more cheap shares and you'll wait till next week. Buy the dip and hold. We both know this is worth over 20+ (Market Cap now is 167 Million, their deal with China is over 200 Million. Market Cap is at least 200 Million worth. Small Calculation: 17.66\\* (200/167) = $21.15) And here I am just talking about the Deal with China with licensing their GPS. I haven't even talked about the value of the NPS vaccine, the royalties of GPS and all their other amazing medicines in their pipeline. \n\nSecondly, the situation where it rockets to Mars (I specifically like this scenario).  Profits are profits, but don't sell too soon. This has still fuel in the tank and is still extremely undervalued. 3 days ago, we were at 448k volume, 2 days ago at 16 Million Volume and yesterday at an incredible 147 Million. Sell when you're gut feeling is telling you and don't look back at how much more profit you could have made, don't FOMO into the spike.\n\nOther guys buy the rumor and sell the news, which is also an excellent tactic, where they already sold yesterday or going to sell before the presentation. I, however, am extremely bullish on the whole company and call me crazy, but I do believe they have a chance to break GLSI's ATH. My reasoning behind it and here we go a little scientific: GLSI has incredible results for their vaccine (0% recurrence rate), however this is only for women who are HER2 3+. SLS has a vaccine for patients who are hormone receptor-negative AND HER2 1+/2+. GLSI also has no license deal yet, while SLS has one with China worth 202 Million. \n\nSo I will hold when it dips and I strongly recommend buying extra shares if it does. If it goes to Mars today and is going to halt multiple times today, I will consider selling the hype, but I will CERTAINLY get back in at a lower price again.\n\nGood luck and let's make some money today :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Seriously recommended to read the whole stuff. For the people with no time or who read this just at Market Open: Dipping, hold and buy more shares. Wait till it hit at least 20+ (which won't be long at all). Ripping, don't sell too soon and don't fomo. The only thing we have to do now is time the top :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProof of still holding positions: \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/w1DP8Q0](https://imgur.com/a/w1DP8Q0)\n\nTo easily find DD: Click this link, which will get to you different pdf's about Shareholders letters and previous presentations about results of their vaccines: [https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sellas+site%3As22.q4cdn.com&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sellas+site%3As22.q4cdn.com&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web)",

We are all banking on an evolution or  chewie-fication of Game Stop rather than boomers doubling down on a dying  business and praying a new console cycle will save them. In light of the  new revelation that they are \"Creating\" 100m shares out of thin are to  either fight off cohens hostile take over, or to fuck us when the  squeeze takes off so they can profit off of us i was trying to figure  out how we as share holders can fuck over sherman and the fucks with him  and i found this gem...\n\n\"The  board of directors has the power to call general meetings and the   majority of general meetings will be called by the directors (S302 of   the Companies Act 2006).\n\nThe  members also have the ability to demand a general meeting.  Section 303  of the Companies Act 2006 requires the directors to call a  general  meeting once the company has received requests from members   representing 5% of the paid up share capital those entitled to vote at   general meetings of the company.\n\nUnder  S304, the directors must call a general meeting within 21 days  of  receiving such a valid request and provide for the general meeting to   be held on a date not more than 28 days after the date of the notice of   the meeting.\n\nIf the directors do  not call a meeting as required to do so, under  S304, the members who  requested the meeting, or any of them representing  more than one half  of the total voting rights of all of them, may  themselves call a  general meeting.\n\nThe Companies Act  2006 also gives the court the ability to order a  meeting and where a  resigning auditor has given a statement of the  circumstances connected  with his resignation, that auditor is also  entitled to call on the  directors of the company to convene a general  meeting for the purposes  of receiving and considering an explanation of  those circumstances. \"\n\nFor  those of you too retarded to see where this is going - all of us  holding shares should write a letter and demand a share holder  meeting....

        "selftext": "So today I was strolling around the internet and saw [this article](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/palantir-stock-strategy-savvy-political-headwinds/) that got me worked up when the author goes \" Sure, Palantir is a right-wing oriented company\". First off, CEO and meme-god Alex Karp holds the opposite views of Thiel (which google easily confirms). More importantly, it only confirms that the general public has no idea what PLTR truly does or how powerful the software is. **So today, I am going to take you all on an adventure and get you as close to the super scary stuff PLTR does so you can get a taste of their work. TL;DR at the bottom just make sure you look at the pictures.**\n\nThe images you are about to see come from a private think tank type business in DC that uses PLTR for their analysis of questionable activities around the globe. I linked the full reports and pulled out the best images. This data is all Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) from a variety of sources that PLTR turned from disparate data to powerful graphic with a story. The data itself comes from different countries databases including shipping registries, business registrations, transaction data, and many other country level sources. On its own, the data is useless, however, with PLTR you get complex network analysis that gives you answers to questions you didn't ask yet.\n\n[Risky Business](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/566ef8b4d8af107232d5358a/t/59413c8bebbd1ac3194eafb1/1497447588968/Risky+Business-C4ADS.pdf) \\- An Analysis of North Korean Proliferation Finance System\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/99l2dpj6qd561.png?width=830&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81aaf7f83842ba9f673abfd0712bc6e4050184dd\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t1u2suaaqd561.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be8b681ac85c7698a7265c1ebf4d214aad8c3f9c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Sandcastles](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/566ef8b4d8af107232d5358a/t/5b1fd21d2b6a28e94745ee34/1528812070952/Sandcastles.pdf) \\- Tracing Sanctions Evasion Through Dubai's Real Estate Market\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ggv578ucqd561.png?width=728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fcc08a320c15d77d042c26c57b5431bd8434c06\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2xkwumj1qd561.png?width=683&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f212bee224893f8f4888c1819c0f4c416bea5dcd\n\n[Above Us Only Stars](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/566ef8b4d8af107232d5358a/t/5c99488beb39314c45e782da/1553549492554/Above+Us+Only+Stars.pdf) \\- Exposing GPS Spoofing in Russia and Syria\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/11mmh17fqd561.png?width=733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58d7a80107b597dbe0996dc5d851d5cbbddf68b4\n\n[Strings Attached](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/566ef8b4d8af107232d5358a/t/5d7022301845f300016ee532/1567629912450/Strings+Attached.pdf) \\- Exploring the Onshore Networks Behind Illegal Fishing\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ho0xae3iqd561.png?width=726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=804246cb47c32a5cdfb9c1a98944bdff9b840425\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5m45i00kqd561.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9263f6404a8db798e7676404d24eca9156b2db1e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8gfb2aqmqd561.png?width=587&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7298c07312dea89ec49420cc77c8e448f5f37525\n\nOne separate thought, PLTR has been actively making the shift to a SaaS company for years. PLTR has been outsourcing the low margin government contract work (help desks, IT support, FSRs, and other functions). They have [preferred partners](https://www.palantir.com/partnerships/preferred-partners/) who do all the difficult inside of government work so PLTR can focus on being a SaaS company not a consulting company.\n\n**Conclusion:** All of the information in those reports came from OSINT, imagine what the real version the USG uses can do. Adapt that power to the private sector and how PLTR could be used to harness data and make companies more efficient and profitable. This is basically the SkyNet prototype\n\n**TL;DR: Former PLTR user believes PLTR's tech is still massively misunderstood and will go to the Moon. At least go back and look at the pictures if you don't like words. As WSB turns bearish on PLTR, you know its time to buy more.**\n\nPOS: 1,840 shares\n\nDISCLAIMER: I have never worked at PLTR, only received constant rejection emails because I am retarded.

        "selftext": "I worked for Doordash for nearly two years. I didn't get fired, and this post will be solid DD about how their business operations are dogshit, not me whining because I was underpaid or let go(tho I was underpaid).\n\n**1) The fucking network goes down constantly, their tech is trash**\n\nGo read /r/doordash_drivers or any other employee sub. AT LEAST once per month, on a Friday or Saturday night, the ENTIRE network goes down for at least 1 hour. What happens when the entire network goes down? All restaurants still have to be paid for the food they made, and all orders have to be refunded to customers, who also demand refunds because their tendies were late. Yes, sometimes companies shit is fucked, Facebook has an outage sometimes too. But it happens to Doordash constantly, BEFORE COVID doubled their order volume.\n\nRegarding their tech - here's how the process is supposed to work.\n\n1)You punch in an order for tendies.\n\n2) The restaurant gets a little ping on their tablet saying \"Order? Ya takin this brah?\" (or, LMFAO, the Doordash CALL CENTER CALLS THE ORDER INTO THE RESTAURANT, YES, THEY REALLY DO THIS)\n\n3) The restaurant clicks accept and starts making the food.\n\n4) The Doordash Network does the travelling salesman optimization poorly and offers the order to drivers.\n\n5) A driver accepts\n\n6) The restaurant hits a \"confirmed rdy\" button and the driver, notified via text message comes in an picks it up.\n\nAt EVERY single point in this process, with regularity, I would see evidence that the Doordash system sent the process forward without confirmations. If a restaurant didn't turn their tablet on that morning? Doesn't matter, I'm at the restaurant now asking about an order that they never knew they had, but SOMEHOW confirmed it was ready - despite having a tablet with a dead battery. I'd have my phone in one hand with the \"Order Ready For Pickup at Tendie Shop\" text message in one hand, and be holding the restaurant's dead tablet in my other hand.\n\nCustomers would call me, two seconds after I left the store having hit \"Picked Up\", asking me where I was, because the app told them I was outside.\n\nWhat happens when their network delivers confirmation notifications that are lies? Lost money.\n\nUber has algorithms that automatically price rides and orders. The price changes with demand. What does Doordash do? Charge the same for every order, and pay drivers \"boosts\" in minimum increments of a half hour. So what happens is every Friday or Saturday night, there will be a \"2$ boost\" on all orders from 5pm-9pm. But let's say the system is still saturated at 6pm - then they add a boost from 6pm-9pm for another dollar. But if it dies at 7pm, they can't take the boost off. And if it's overloaded on a Sunday, they basically never add one no matter what. I suspect this is because they don't have an algorithm, they have people they pay to look at network data live and make decisions (poorly).\n\n**2) They don't know how to run a fucking business**\n\nRepeatedly, I would be placed in situations where the simple and proper customer service thing to do was A, but because it saved half a dollar in the short run, I did B and fucked the customer over, because Doordash wouldn't pay me to do A.\n\nHere's an example. New Year's Eve, 230am. I get a double order from a Chinese restaurant. One going way North, one going way South. I live North past the North order, gonna go home after.\n\nThe way double orders work is that drivers get paid a little less, because it's only one pick up. No problem, that's fair!\n\nI get to the Chinese place. They have North order ready, but not South order. They say it will be 30 minutes for South order.\n\nI call Doordash support (more on them in a moment). I explain that the next customer's order will be delayed.\n\nHere are the possible outcomes :\n\nA) Out of the kindness of my heart, I waste my gas (and miss out on pay!) to make North Customer happy, I deliver his order right now, and then come back and get South Customer's order.\n\nB) I sit there for 30 minutes and let North Customer's order get (c)old because they won't pay me extra to deliver it separately, even though it's now two orders.\n\nWhat do you think happened? They wouldn't pay me. I'm an \"independent contractor\", I don't run a fucking Doordash customer charity. North Customer's order got cold. I'm sure he bitched and complained rightfully, and Doordash had to refund his food. Doordash saved 6$ by not paying me, only to probably lose this customer and lose the order's revenue anyways.\n\nLet's talk about support now. Every single restaurant I ever talked to regarding support would make me call about any issue, because the Restaurant Support line ALWAYS had a minimum 30 minute hold wait. They just didn't give a shit.\n\nI've dealt with Uber, DD, Instacart, lots of different support callcenters for this shit. DD hires the Phillipinos that don't speak english well enough to work at the Uber call centre. I would have to hang up 1/5 times I called and call again, because the person I got could not fucking understand what I was saying. I don't have some kind of weird speech impediment either I s2g.\n\nTheir support are total idiots too. Here's a good one.\n\nI try to deliver Chinese to some people. I hear loud music in their apartment. I knock ten times over 5 minutes. I text them twice. I call them three times in the same period. They won't come to the door.\n\nI leave and go do the next order. Support calls me back, says hey, can you go deliver that order? They said they're sorry. I said sure, i'm only a few blocks away anyways.\n\nI go back, same shit happens again, they don't come to the door. I leave again. Support calls me again 20 minutes later, I say this time I'm not going back unless they pay me extra, I've been back once for free already. Support says sure, we'll give you 5$.\n\nI go back, and deliver the food. This time, they come to the door to get it, and the most obviously fucking spun up meth-head i've ever seen comes to the fucking door. I tell support \"Yo, you should ban these ppl from the app, they're high as fuck and wasting my time\". Support says \"That's a good idea, it says here they say their order didn't get delivered like half the time, probably scamming\".\n\nNext week? I get an order from the same Chinese place to the same address, apartment number and all pop up in my app. Declined, so no problem for me. But DD? You can't ban cracked out scam artists who cost you money?\n\nI could go on and on. Essentially in most instances, Doordash support fails to protect the long term interests of the company, which screws over good customers and lets scam artistry run rampant.\n\nMy friends are all hipster foodie millennials and Doortrash has the reputation among ALL OF THEM as the least reliable app, where the app doesn't work, their food goes missing or ends up 3hrs late for no reason. Nobody likes it.\n\n**Doordash is what happens when someone starts a competitor, hoping to get bought out, and then they never get bought. Corona happens and they decide \"oh, maybe we can IPO then and that's how we get rich and get out of this mess?\"**\n\nTL;DR SHORT DOORTRASH\n\nPositions, all stock, will be shorting DD with my GME profits soon enough.\n\nGME, REDACTED SHROOM RELATED PENNYSTOCKS, BPY.UN, VDY",

        "selftext": "Hello Reddit,\n\nGME is not a question of a business model in the future, it is a question of right now. I understand the need for numbers and figures, I do. Technical and fundamental research is viable and necessary, but one very over looked method of analysis is philosophical. We have seen DD after DD talking about the numbers and the business model. But I want to share some thoughts with you of my logical thinking and would love to see counter points.\n\n**First Let's Recap**\n\n**Pre-Earnings (Aug-Dec)**\n\nAlready was running up and then r/wallstreetbets massive hype of a short squeeze and Cohen letters leads to a run-up followed by a sell-off due to overbuying. \n\n**During Earnings (12/7):**\n\n[Earnings Call Transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/12/09/gamestop-gme-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)\n\nThe conversation and presentation actually had good content. Their balance sheet looks fantastic; eliminated debt, reduced costs, making changes towards the digital transformation, e-commerce way up, console sales upcoming, new inventory and other positives they didn't even mention like the [Microsoft deal](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/). But the stock plummets...why?\n\nThere were two pieces of \"bad news\": \"missed revenue\" and \"shelf offering\" which PR blasted in a very negative light taking it completely out of context. Revenue missed was expected, not just because it's GME but because of COVID-19 effects on a retail business. \n\nRevenue: Loss was expected, not just because it's GME but because of COVID-19 effects on a retail business. \n\nShelf offering: $100M and has two years to be used. \n\nFirst comment was by Jim Bell: \"\"However, as a pragmatic matter initiating this program provides us with the maximum flexibility and optionality to further bolster our balance sheet and liquidity position and increase flexibility gives us the ability to leverage opportunities to accelerate our transformational strategies, such as increasing the speed at which we elevate expand our omni-channel strategy while further ensuring minimal disruption from any potential further pandemic impacts around the world.\"\n\nWhen asked by William Reuter from BoA. \"OK. And then, in terms of the new shelf, you know, I saw that you mentioned general corporate purposes. Would you consider issuing stocks to repay debt under that program?\"\n\nGeorge Sherman responded: \"No, that's absolutely not the intent. The intent here is to simply optimize flexibility and optionality. Period. There is a lot of unknowns going on in the marketplace with respect to this pandemic, ongoing flex of cases across the world, the impacts on our own businesses.\"\n\nMy thought: It's a defense mechanism to attempt to do one of three things:\n\n1. Help combat against a Cohen takeover\n2. Collect profits on their way out because they know a short squeeze is imminent\n3. They truly want to use it as they said \n\nMy issue with 3 and what they said when asked by William Reuter, is that they have significantly improved the balance sheet and COVID-19 vaccinations have begun, not to mention they are intending on shifting focus on e-commerce, so it just struck me as a very odd reasons for a shelf offer. \n\nNonetheless, during this call the share price absolutely plummets, but why? We received a lot of good news and two pieces of \"bad news\". One was expected (revenue loss) and one was addressed during the call (shelf offering). There was no intent on share dilution at least not anytime soon.\n\nMy thoughts: Only thing I can think is PR putting a negative spin, but more-so it was the bears using the negative PR to their advantage to drive the price down. $14 was the floor by the end of AH.\n\n**Post Earnings (12/9):** \n\nA war rages over $14 keeping it nearly level the entire day.\n\nMy thoughts: Bears expected much lower yet the bulls fought hard. On a bleeding red day where bulls clearly had the disadvantaged portfolios, they were able to support and actually start a small uptrend.\n\n\\#WeWantCohen starts trending and Ryan Cohen puts out a [cryptic Tweet](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1336775515101949963).\n\nMy thoughts: He is completely dissatisfied with management and their ability to address his concerns outline in the letter. After ER the PR that went out and thoughts on the future of the company could have been beautiful if addressed and pitched correctly. Management did not provide comfort in the eyes of anyone and the stock price reflects that as does the PR.\n\n**What's Next?**\n\nThe moment you've all been waiting for. Let's gather some facts.\n\n1. Individuals own 9.87% \n2. Cohen (RC) owns 9.98% \n3. Michael Burry ( Scion) owns 4.3%\n4. GameStop Market Cap $890.11 Million\n5. Cohen net worth $14.6 Billon\n\nCohen could either purchase enough shares to have majority vote or he can outright make an offer to buy the company. So why hasn't he?\n\nThere are two current possibilities:\n\n1. He conducts a hostile takeover.\n2. He has no plans to conduct a hostile takeover.\n\nReason 1 probable timing and outcome: If you were about to make a large purchase, wouldn't you want to get it at the best price possible? He's waiting until he feels like we are actually at the floor before making a move. Truthfully, all he has to do is speak. If he even mentions an intent of acquisition the shorts will run and the bulls will pile in triggering the squeeze. **Bulls win**\n\nReason 2 is interesting because why would he own 10% of a company where he clearly doesn't believe in current management? So, if a hostile takeover isn't the reason, then what is?\n\nI can think of two possibilities:\n\n1. There is already something happening behind the scenes to peacefully put Cohen into a position of power. **Bulls win**\n2. He thought being 10% owner would give him a large enough voice to be convincing, when he realized the board does not share his vision, he pulls out. **Bears win**\n\nNow, this is interesting.\n\nReason 1 seems highly unlikely to me simply due to his tweet today. If there were plans for a peaceful transition of power, I don't think he would add fuel to the fire of bad PR clearly doubting managements skills.\n\nReason 2 is juicy. Between RC, Scion and Individual investors who all want to see Cohen at the helm, that accounts for 24.15% of the company. If RC pulls out, the rest follow, no bulls left to fight the bears, the institutions pull out and GME becomes a penny stock. \n\nMy overall prediction is the **bulls win.** The reason being, I can chart one path to victory for the bears but many paths to victory for the bulls. Also, I do not think we will need to wait until Q4ER to see the squeeze. From each scenario I could think of, Cohen would act sooner rather than later if he intends on purchasing or accumulating enough shares for proxy in order to get the best price possible.\n\nNotice how nothing I said has to do with the future of the business or the business model as a whole? That's because that doesn't matter. Q4 earnings will boost the price high enough for bulls to profit a little and then get out if they don't believe in the company. The overall longevity of the company is a complete different debate. \n\nFeel free to counter-point in the comments.\n\n**TLDR:** You should read.",

        "selftext": "**Basics**\n\nSalesforce is a San Fransisco company that offers **C**ustomer **R**elation **M**anagement software (and hence the symbol CRM). It's not a  joke company like many other shilled on WSB. Salesforce has a market cap of $200 billion and is one of the 30 companies listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).\n\n**What Happened**\n\nThis is the price chart for Salesforce (CRM) last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9sqm4nur2a361.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e71b4aee8595c1e3a5a2f1220fedc017c21153f2\n\nThe sharp drop happened right after the earning call. Was the earnings number disappointing? No, in fact, it was stellar. While the average expected EPS was $0.75 per share, the actual number turned out to be $1.74.\n\nBut Salesforce also announced that it's in the process of acquiring Slack (WORK) for 27.7 billion dollars. Some experts said Salesforce is overpaying for Slack and a huge sell-off followed, resulting in a 40 billion drop in Salesforce market cap.\n\nSo, think about it. Salesforce acquires a company for 27.7 billion and its market cap goes down by 40 billion. In other words, 2+2=3, while usually with a merger you expect 2+2=5.\n\n**What Happened Next**\n\nAfter the initial shock, analysts and the public started to reassess the situation, and many actually praised the acquisition.\n\nJim Cramer (the guy who is the WSB for boomers) [said \"Salesforce Has 100% Upside After Buying Slack\"](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-salesforce-100-upside-173302345.html). He's been shilling the stock on his show every day as well.\n\nMultiple analysts upgraded their Salesforce recommendation to Strong Buy and raised their price target.\n\nSince then, the initial price gap has been filled a little. The price is currently about $226. But a full recovery to pre-EC prices ($240s) and higher seems imminent.\n\nTraders have a \"3-Day Rule\" according to which they don't touch a stock that has fallen sharply and suddenly for 3 days to let it sink to its lowest and see where it goes from there. Those 3 days for CRM are passed and it seems to be rising.\n\n**What's Coming**\n\n[Salesforce Investor day](https://investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2020/Investor-Day-2020/default.aspx) is on Tuesday (Dec 8) in the morning. They will probably clarify the necessity of the slack acquisition and their plans to profitably integrate it into their core business.\n\nAlso, a lot of institutions see this drop as a good opportunity to get in, so the demand is high.\n\n**What Positions**\n\nDo NOT buy weekly or far OTM options. Consider the following (ranked from riskiest to safest):\n\n\\- 230C 12/18/2020\n\n\\- 250C End of year-February\n\n\\- 270C March-May 2021\n\n\\- 300C June-July 2021\n\n\\- The stock (CRM) if you want to hold for 6 months or more.\n\n**When to Buy**\n\nDo not FOMO. I don't want you to buy in pre-market or when it starts high on Monday and then curse my name when it goes down some in 2 hours.\n\nI think this will certainly go up, both short term and long term,  but there will be dips along the way. Wait for the dips to buy in.",

        "selftext": "**Summary**: I know you don\u2019t want to read. So in short, $SNOW has risen rampantly recently and become a bubble. People only see the headline revenue growth without noticing its declining growth rate, declining NVRR, significantly worse-than-estimate EPS, below-average guidance, and intensifying industry competition. Among all the companies with 50+B market cap in the US stock market history, none of them has come even remotely close to $SNOW\u2019s insane valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Position**: 12/18 350P, 1/15 300P, 5/19 250P. \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2020 is coming to an end. This year we have witnessed the almighty power of retail investors -- buying blindly after reading just headlines; following 18yo investing \u201cgurus\u201d on Twitter, TikTok, or StockTwits;  and riding pump-and-dump schemes trying to take advantage of greater fools. Against this backdrop, we managed to create a bubble as big as $SNOW. Now trading at $113B, $SNOW\u2019s current valuation dwarfs other tech firms at the height of the dotcom bubble in 2000.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why Are People Buying $SNOW?\n\n$SNOW reported earnings for the first time last week. Its result was slightly upbeat, although I would rather call it **mixed**. However, retail investors do not care about the actual state of the company. **The only thing that matters is how the news headlines are reporting it.** Since headlines read \u201c$SNOW Q3 revenue growth over 100% yoy\u201d, people have now started buying fearlessly, without realizing how much of a bubble $SNOW has already become. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What the Headlines Do Not Tell: the Ugly Facts behind $SNOW\u2019s Valuation\n\n**1. $SNOW\u2019s revenue beats estimate, but not by much, and it\u2019s far from a surprise**\n\nQ3 revenue is 159.6M, which beats estimate 147.1M by only **8.5%.** Yet, stock price has risen **40**\\+**%**, from 290$ to 400+$. Something does not add up here. $ZM rose about that much after its Q2 earnings. but $ZM\u2019s revenue beat estimate **more than 30%?** Moreover, $ZM gave up most of that gain just a couple of days later. And now after 3 months, it is still trading lower than back then. **Don't you see that $SNOW\u2019s jump is a lot more overdone?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. $SNOW\u2019s revenue growth rate and net revenue retention rate is already DECLINING.**\n\nSource: [S-1 Form](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001640147/1c70b06a-4d3b-4a37-9c42-76ec47742398.pdf) [10-Q Form](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001640147/afd24d78-1425-49ca-9cd9-6ae57c5712c0.pdf)\n\nIt\u2019s true that $SNOW\u2019s revenue grew more than 100+% yoy this quarter. But if you expect its revenue to keep doubling forever, **you would be completely delusional**.\n\n$SNOW\u2019s revenue of fiscal year ending Jan 2019 and Jan 2020, was $96.7M and $264.7 million \u2192 **174% yoy growth.** \n\n$SNOW\u2019s revenue of six months ending Jul 2019 and Jul 2020, was $104.0M and $242.0M \u2192 **133% yoy growth.**\n\nAnd now $SNOW reports Q3 yoy revenue growth **115%**. Do you recognize a trend here? \n\n**174% &gt; 133% &gt; 115%**\n\n**Its growth rate is DECLINING**, people! **It cannot keep growing 100+% over the next few years**. $SNOW grows fast right now because its current revenue is **too small**, **smaller than 1/200 of its market cap**. As the company matures, it's almost certain that growth will slow down.\n\n**Same story with the net revenue retention rate** (NVRR), which the SaaS industry uses as a valuation matric. Retail investors read the headline and see a 162% NVRR, thinking \u201cthis must be a buy\u201d. But back in Jan 2020, NVRR was 180%. As of Jul 2020, it was 169%. And now, it is 162%. **180% &gt; 169% &gt; 162% right?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. Positive revenue growth does NOT mean $SNOW is making more money. In fact, $SNOW\u2019s EPS is 3 times WORSE than estimate. $SNOW is not expected to make money even in 2023.**\n\nQ3 **EPS is -1.01$** vs estimate **-0.26$. $SNOW is LOSING 3 times more money than expected** to realize that revenue growth, which beat estimate by only 8.5%. \n\n**3 TIMES** EPS miss \u2192 just **8.5%** revenue growth beat? Does that really sound positive to you?\n\nAs I quote the company\u2019s SEC filing again, \u201c*We have incurred substantial losses during our history,* ***do not expect to become profitable in the near future, and may never achieve profitability***.\u201d I really wonder all this extreme hype surrounding $SNOW is based on what? Are retail investors really seeing something that even the company itself does not see into the future? Or **is everybody just dreaming**?\n\nGoldman Sachs estimates $SNOW will still be bleeding money even in 2023.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. Q4 revenue guidance is BELOW AVERAGE estimate**\n\nFor Q4, $SNOW projects $162-$167M in revenue, which is below the average estimate $166M. This is largely the reason why **$SNOW\u2019s price was falling at first after earnings.** As the more rational $SNOW investors are selling their shares, bagholders on Twitter, TikTok or whatever, start to pump the stock using **cherry-picked positive numbers**.\n\nSome analyst says the guidance \u201ccould be\u201d conservative. Conservative based on what? Based on the fact that you are long so you want to pump the stock? With the declining growth rate as we have seen, the guidance makes perfect sense. \n\nAnother cloud company, $SPLK also reported Q3 revenue this week. It missed estimate by 9% and its stock dropped 23%? Was its estimate also \u201cconservative\u201d, Mr. analyst?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5. $SNOW\u2019s market cap is even higher than its Total Addressable Market (TAM) of 2023.**\n\nAccording to IDC, the markets for Analytics Data Management and Integration Platforms and Business Intelligence and Analytics Tools, which $SNOW addresses, will have a combined value of $56 billion by the end of 2020 and **$84 billion by the end of 2023**. Let\u2019s not talk about how **$SNOW\u2019s market cap is even larger than the its entire market in 2023**. But how much of market share can $SNOW realistically achieve?\n\nIts FY2021 revenue estimate 578M is **only about 1% of the total market**. For SNOW\u2019s market cap to make sense, people are expecting it to own at least half of market share of the entire market in the long run. Is that possible? Cloud is an industry with ever tougher competition. You **expect $SNOW to grow its industry presence by 50 times, while other competitors: Amazon, Google, Microsoft do nothing, sit idly and watch**? There will be more discussion on this later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6. $SNOW\u2019s CEO\u2019s compensation is worth MORE than the company\u2019s revenue!**\n\n[Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-04/snowflake-ceo-collects-a-95-million-payout-every-month#:~:text=Snowflake%20CEO%20Collects%20a%20%24108%20Million%20Payout%20%E2%80%94%20Every%20Month,-By&amp;text=A%20compensation%20package%20he%20received,or%20about%20%241.3%20billion%20annually)\n\nCEO Frank Slootman now collects **$108M** worth of compensation **every month**. That\u2019s **324M per quarter**, but the **company\u2019s quarterly revenue is only 160M**? I know the compensation is not all cash, but linked to RSUs and options. Yet still, doesn\u2019t it ring an alarm bell? At what other company can **a CEO be paid twice the entire company\u2019s revenue**? And it\u2019s REVENUE, not profit! The company has no profit yet. Doesn\u2019t this illustrate how insane the company\u2019s valuation has become?\n\n# \n\n# How Does $SNOW Compare to $ZM, $TSLA, and the Dot-com Bubble\n\n**1. vs Analysts\u2019 price targets**\n\nI personally do not trust analysts\u2019 targets. This year, analysts are handing out positive ratings like candies. We have seen **crazy sh\\*t targets like a 79$ for $NKLA**. Lol. And moreover, **$SNOW\u2019s IPO have pretty much everybody on the street as its underwriter**. This make the banks **more biased** to give a buy rating.\n\nEven so, $SNOW\u2019s current price is still **much higher than even the most bullish analyst**. Analysts want retail people to buy blindly. They just did not expect people could go **THIS blind**. \n\nJP Morgan target: 250$ (36% down potential)\n\nMorgan Stanley: 265$ (32% down potential)\n\nCredit Suisse: 265$ (32% down potential)\n\nGoldman Sachs: 308$ (20% down potential)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. $ZM**\n\nIf you are that impressed with SNOW\u2019s 100% revenue growth, you probably forgot about **$ZM\u2019s 367% yoy growth this quarter?** Not only did that beat estimate by 12%, its EPS also beat by over 30%. Even so, **$ZM's price fell after earnings because it didn't live up to people's expectation**. So  what are people expecting for $SNOW's next quarter? $SNOW\u2019s market cap is now almost as big as $ZM\u2019s, although with **only 1/5 revenue, 1/3 growth rate, and a negative EPS.**\n\nIf you think $ZM is trading cheap because vaccine is coming and WFH is ending, but $SNOW is trading expensive because WFH does not have an impact on $SNOW\u2019s business. **Think twice**. **WFH has accelerated cloud adoption**. As people cannot go to office to maintain on-premise data storage solutions, companies were forced to embrace the benefit of cloud. **Same with video conferencing, after WFH ends, growth in cloud business will decelerate**.\n\nWhen the vaccine news came out on Dec 9 and Dec 10, **both $ZM and $SNOW fell significantly**. This proves **$SNOW also belong to the WFH stock category**. With vaccine FDA approval on near horizon, $SNOW is destined to fall again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. $TSLA**\n\nI don\u2019t have a view on $TSLA, I just want to compare. There are some people who think $TSLA is overvalued. I guess they never heard about $SNOW. **$TSLA\u2019s valuation is nothing when compared to $SNOW.**\n\n* $TSLA\u2019s P/S ratio is smaller than 20. While $SNOW\u2019s is close to 200. **10x as big.**\n* $TSLA\u2019s P/E ratio is positive, with forward 12M P/E at 162. Whereas $SNOW will be bleeding money even in 2023.\n* $TSLA has a chance to become the leader in EV industry, like an iPhone among all mobile phones. Can $SNOW become the leader in the cloud space? Highly unlikely. \n* EV market annual growth rate is expected to be 21% [Source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/15/2034346/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-EV-Market-to-Rise-at-21-1-CAGR-till-2026-Product-Innovations-are-Leading-to-Wider-Adoption-says-Fortune-Business-Insights.html), while IDC forecasts SNOW\u2019s industry to grow only 15% annually.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. The dot-com bubble**\n\nThrough the stock market history, **no company at $SNOW\u2019s size has been trading at such high valuation multiples**. Among all the companies with a 100+B market cap\u2026 You know what, let\u2019s make our comparison even broader, let\u2019s look at **all the companies larger than $50B**. Amid the 2000 tech bubble, $CSCO was trading at the highest P/S ratio. **On Mar 22, 2000, $CSCO\u2019s P/S reached all time high of 57**. It\u2019s been 20 years now. After the bubble popped, CSCO\u2019s **price today is** **still more than 40% lower than 20 years ago**. \n\nNow you would argue, $CSCO and $MSFT etc. are big mature companies, how can you compare a growth company like $SNOW with them? Well, **20 years ago, $CSCO and $MSFT were growth companies too**. A lot of the \u201cgrowth\u201d companies back then, do not even EXIST anymore. Do you really want to compare $SNOW with those bankrupted companies?\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s highest P/S ever: only **29,** reached during dot-com bubble. \n\nGoogle\u2019s highest P/S: **22 in 2005**. \n\nFacebook\u2019s highest P/S: **22.2 in 2014**. \n\nApple\u2019s highest P/S: only **8, reached in August this year**. (Yes Apple\u2019s P/S was even lower when first iPhone was launched) \n\n**NO BIG TECH HAS REACHED A BUBBLE OF THIS SCALE EVER. Like, ever.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Myths People Are Spreading about $SNOW\n\n**MYTH 1: Warren Buffet invested in $SNOW, which means you should buy too.**\n\n**BUSTED**! Warren Buffet is a value investor known for his reluctance to invest in technology. Of course **he did NOT participate in $SNOW IPO**. Oh dear god, please wake up, people! Buffett's deputies, namely Ted Weschler and Todd Comms, invested in $SNOW, **not Warren Buffet himself**! \n\n[Source](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/mergers-and-acquisitions/buffetts-deputies-bring-in-bets-from-snowflake-to-scripps-1#:~:text=Warren%20Buffett%20may%20have%20his,thank%20for%20a%20busy%20September.&amp;text=financing%20deal%20announced%20Thursday%20and,Ted%20Weschler%20and%20Todd%20Combs%20)\n\nAnd now people are **using this as a propaganda to pump $SNOW**. \u201cWarren Buffett bought, you should buy too!\u201d\n\nYet I still do not understand the logic here. **Berkshire bought $SNOW when it was 120$ per share**, probably expected to make like 30%, 50% from their investments. And now, **you crazy retail people are buying $SNOW at 400$ per share, more than 3x IPO price**? What? So your investment logic is: **Anything Buffett buys, you would buy it at 3x price?** Oh in that case, if I am Warren Buffett, I would just buy everything in sight, then there will be some retards willing to pay me 3x price I paid. Lol, I just discovered an infinite money making machine.\n\n**If you believe in Berkshire, you should YOLO your money in $BRK/B, not $SNOW!** Or alternatively, you can read Berkshire's 13F filing which lists most of its investment. You should **start buying every single stock in that list until it goes to 3x current price**. Why don't you do that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MYTH 2: $SNOW has technology that nobody else has and will achieve monopoly in the cloud space.**\n\nI fully expect there will be $SNOW cultists arguing in the comment section \u201cnobody competes with $SNOW because they are the best. You don\u2019t understand its business.\u201d blahblah. So, I hereby quote the company\u2019s own words.\n\n$SNOW competes with \u201c*1. large, well-established, public cloud providers that generally compete in all of our markets, including* ***AWS, Azure, and GCP****; 2. less-established public and private cloud companies...; 3. other established vendors of legacy database solutions or big data offerings; and 4. new or emerging entrants seeking to develop competing technologies*.\u201d The company recognizes \u201c*The markets in which we operate are highly competitive.* ***Many of our competitors have substantially greater brand recognition, customer relationships, and financial, technical, and other resources than we do*****.**\u201d\n\nThe biggest difference between Snowflake and others that I see, is that $SNOW bills customer per usage, while others often adopt fixed contracts. Other than this, there may be a couple more of data types supported, or a bit more optimization here and there. I **don\u2019t see anything game changing** with Snowflake that other competitors are unable to offer. Plus, the competition is getting real intense. Just days ago **Microsoft announced the launch of Azure Synapse to compete with Snowflake and alike**. [Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/microsoft-takes-on-amazon-snowflake-in-cloud-data-services)\n\nAnd moreover,\n\n*\u201c****We currently only offer our platform on the public clouds provided by AWS, Azure, and GCP, which are also some of our primary competitors****. There is risk that one or more of these public cloud providers could use their respective control of their public clouds to embed innovations or privileged interoperating capabilities in competing products, bundle competing products,* ***provide us unfavorable pricing****, leverage its public cloud customer relationships to exclude us from opportunities, and treat us and our customers differently\u2026\u201d*\n\n**This is the RISKIEST part of $SNOW\u2019s business**. **$SNOW is running its cloud on the infrastructure provided by its COMPETITORS**. Huh? Isn't it the same as **exposing your biggest weakness to your rivals**? Even if $SNOW manage to grab a much larger market share and become No.1 in the cloud space, if Amazon or Microsoft find $SNOW a threat and want to hamper its growth, **they can simply stop offering their infrastructure or raise the price**? If that happens, how is $SNOW going to survive then? **$SNOW's lifeline is literally in the hands of its biggest competitors!**\n\nIf you are buying $SNOW at current valuation amid the ever-intensifying competition in cloud space, fantasizing how $SNOW will beat everybody else, then **I think you are kidding yourself**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Some Final Words\n\nI am not trying to convince you to go short, you are more than welcome to pump the price higher, then I can add some more puts. I just hope people can reflect on their rationale of buying $SNOW at 400$ per share. Do you really have a logical point, or are you just blindly following some random headlines? It\u2019s your own money. Make your own decision. But if you do want to go short, **it's better to buy puts than short selling stocks on this.**\n\nFYI, yes some others have mentioned on this sub that **$SNOW\u2019s lockup will start to expire in a week\u2019s time**. That is correct.\n\nFinally, this will be my last DD on wsb. Thank you all for reading my past posts and I hope you liked them. I even got some followers lol which I didn't notice until recently.

        "selftext": "[From the article](https://www.reuters.com/article/cryptocurrencies-sp/sp-dow-jones-indices-to-launch-cryptocurrency-indexes-in-2021-idUSL1N2IJ0TG):\n\n&gt; LONDON (Reuters) - S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, a division of financial data provider S&amp;P Global Inc, said on Thursday that it will launch cryptocurrency indices in 2021, making it the latest major finance company to enter the nascent asset class.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P DJI-branded products will use data from New York-based virtual currency company Lukka on more than 550 of the top traded coins, the companies said.  S&amp;P\u2019s clients will be able to work with the index provider to create customized indices and other benchmarking tools on cryptocurrencies, S&amp;P and Lukka said in a joint statement.  S&amp;P and Lukka hope more reliable pricing data will make it easier for investors to access the new asset class, and reduce some of the risks of the very volatile and speculative market, they said.\n\n&gt; \u201cWith digital assets such as cryptocurrencies becoming a rapidly emerging asset class, the time is right for independent, reliable and user-friendly benchmarks,\u201d said Peter Roffman, global head of innovation and strategy at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. The move by one of the world\u2019s most well-known index providers could help cryptocurrencies become more mainstream investments. It comes as bitcoin continues to soar to record highs against the dollar, boosted by increased demand from investors who say the virtual currency is a hedge against inflation and a safe-haven asset.\n\n&gt; Bitcoin was trading at $19,300 in latest trading on Thursday, having soared around 170% this year. Cryptocurrencies have been around for more than a decade, but have started attracting more interest from large financial companies over the last few years.\n\n&gt; Large firms including Fidelity Investments and Japan\u2019s Nomura Holdings Inc have starting safeguarding bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies for institutional investors, while major exchanges have started offering bitcoin derivatives. The emergence of more mainstream market infrastructure has made the asset class more accessible for institutional investors, with hedge fund managers such as Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller saying they include bitcoin in their broad investment strategies.",

The market cap of the new company is usually larger than the exiting one.

        "selftext": "\nMany of you know that the next big move in EV's is who can take the biggest share of the transportation industry. I'm not talking about your mom taking you to the nearest autism center, I'm talking about the transportation of moving your favorite fidget spinner into your Gay Bear hands.\n\n**bold** Why HYLN when Tesla providing trucks soon you fuck???\n\nVery simple answer, Tesla trucks are nice and all but they have two major limiting factors. \n1. The truck range is only 500 miles (Hyliion's ERX is 1300 miles)\n 2. CHARGING A SEMI IS NOT THE SAME AS CHARGING YOUR MODEL S E X OR Y. \n\nMany reports have come out that state that to charge a tesla truck, it would require revamping entire grids to support those key charging areas. Now imagine when you have to deliver something to bumfuck nowhere, aint gonna be no efficient chargers. The technology just isn't there yet. \n\nhttps://www.greenbiz.com/article/electric-truck-fleets-will-need-lot-power-utilities-arent-planning-it\n\nOk, what does Hyliion do to \"solve\" this problem. Simple. They use natural gas. NATURAL GAS??? WHAT? Yes natural gas. There is already 700+ natural gas stations around the United States, that means that it can easily travel anywhere it needs to, and it is much easier to establish new natural gas stations than it is to revamp electrical grids for tesla chargers, (think of how long its taking to fix flint's water) \n\nAdditionally, it uses an onboard generator under the hood so that when you are driving, IT IS ALSO CHARGING THE BATTERY, this means that the range of a hyliion ERX truck is 1300 miles with an increased payload than Tesla's semi truck. You probably don't know this but many truck companies send out truck drivers in pairs, because of regulations, one drives while the other rests. With tesla trucks you can't do that since it only goes for 500 miles, they would need to stop and charge, while hyliion ERX truck will keep on going.\n\nAlso Hyliion's products are actually net negative carbon emissions. HOW? When cows fart, they give off methane (a pollutant), which is used to create natural gas. As our population grows, more meat eaters, more cows, more methane. Natural gas takes methane out the air and powers shit. Hyliion uses natural gas, that means using hyliion products not only produce clean efficient energy, you are also rapidly removing methane out of the air, a net negative carbon emission.\n\nNow their current amazing product that Hyliion produces is that they  convert the rear axle of EXISITING TRUCKS to electric. Many companies do not want to do the jump in EV because they have already spent millions on their existing trucks. Well that whole market is up for grabs for hyliion because their product will give those existing trucks a 10-30% fuel cost reduction and will give them more torque and power so that when they go up hill, they have a much easier time than now. Additionally they use algorithms to help the driver get the most efficient drive possible and gives them points, think of a mini game for those truckers. \n\n\n**bold** Yo autismo, I just saw their stock and it dipped massively recently, what happened???\n\nHyliion on November 30th announced that they will redeem their public warrants. Now some people can say that's bad, others say that they are using that extra ~~144 million that they will receive to finish up their infrastructure etc. Either way, do you want to buy on a day its up 50% or do you wanna buy when the stock is red???\n\nNOW IS AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO BUY THE STOCK FOR LOW PRICES.\n\nThe stock had a 20-40% short ratio against it in the past week, and it refused to break the $18 support level. It is itching to go up from here once the news of the warrants are settled. \n\nI am in at 100 shares and buying 600 more in the upcoming days.\n\nTLDR: YOUR NEXT STOCK PURCHASE BETTER BE HYLIION DO NOT MESS UP ON THE NEXT TESLA TRAIN. BUYBUYBUY\n\nhttps://www.hyliion.com/\n\n(I LOVE TESLA AS MUCH AS THE NEXT BULL BUT HYLIION TAKES THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY)\n\n*italics* P.S. I AM NOT AN EXPERT, BUT I BELIEVE IN THIS STOCK",
