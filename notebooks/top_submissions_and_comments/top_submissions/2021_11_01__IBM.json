        "selftext": "Alright, my research has been done and now I'm going to spell it out for all of you apes. Why Lumen Technology **LUMN**, will run soon as investors realize what the **intrinsic value** is in this company. There is a **hidden catalyst** that will be occurring in the near future, which makes this an excellent **value stock** to hold.   Not only that but, they are a recipient of the 60M broadband package from the infrastructure bill, so they'll benefit!  If you don't care about the backstory of Lumen, then skip to the TLDR or read the why invest in Lumen portion and the Catalyst.\n\n# What is LUMN?\n\nIn the early 2000s or late \u201990s two companies were laying a bunch of sub C fiber from New York to Spain and across the Atlantic and across the Pacific. It was Level 3 and Global Crossing because of the idea that there\u2019s going to be this huge internet they would need all this connectivity that\u2019s connecting continents.\n\nUnfortunately, Global Crossings overbuilt and went bankrupt at the time. There was just a lot of mess, but lo and behold years and years later, guess what? The internet is bigger than anyone ever thought. And so Level 3 was a roll-up that included Level 3\u2019s assets, Global Crossing, and Time Wire Telecom. Level 3 now owns what we would call domestic US fiber underground connecting end points across the world.\n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2002/01/29/global-crossing-files-for-bankruptcy/fffcad1b-f522-479a-a9d4-659e74165b05/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2002/01/29/global-crossing-files-for-bankruptcy/fffcad1b-f522-479a-a9d4-659e74165b05/)\n\nLumen is the name for a merged entity between Level 3 and CenturyLink. Level 3 is the company that holds the hidden value in LUMN. Currently Level 3 is 1/3 of the new entity and CenturyLink's dying business model is what's hurting the market value.\n\n# Cove Street Investors\n\nThe investors fell in love with Jeff Storey the CEO of Level 3. If you look into Jeff Storey it appears that he was set to replace the CEO Glen Post of CenturyLink whom was retiring shortly. The investors from Cove Street were **weary of the management team at CenturyLink** and told Jeff, this is not a group of people they felt confident with and don't necessarily think they understood what they're buying. However, the old CEO Glen Post of CenturyLink stayed on as a board member directing the company until January 2020 [https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/former-ceo-post-steps-down-from-centurylink-s-board-directors](https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/former-ceo-post-steps-down-from-centurylink-s-board-directors). **The investor worry has proven to be the case.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ba1ok28uzx71.jpg?width=847&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28d7490944ee57d1bac16f63e2b505217ed033eb\n\n# What was the impetus for the merger and why is CenturyLink such a big portion of the new business?\n\nLevel 3 was offered a lot of money. The Level 3 shareholders were happy to take the premium that was offered. The investors **sold out**, as soon as they realized that the surviving entity would be controlled by Glen Post. The reason why the combined company is predominantly CenturyLink is because it was at the time a **$17 billion revenue company.** This was not a tiny entity by any means.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/40bzsssruzx71.png?width=711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93eccc85adac2444cc16ddb0e087b8daf64f750f\n\nIt was larger only in the end profit sense than Level 3. However, the **actual valuation was skewed towards Level 3**\u2026 This is basically a company that was trading at, let\u2019s say, five times buying a company that was trading at 12 times. The people who get screwed are the shareholders of the company that\u2019s trading at five times. Shareholders of Level 3 didn\u2019t care because everyone was getting a fantastic value for their investment and the CenturyLink shareholders, well, they took it in the pants.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what the pitch was to the CenturyLink board when they discussed the acquisition. Currently, it is also still a truism to say that while it is a **melting ice cube**, the ice cube is melting at, let\u2019s say, three to 5% a year on a cash flow basis. And the good side, the **Level 3 side is growing**.\n\nSo you have a **global growing asset heavy, almost irreplaceable asset business in Level 3** and you have a slowly shrinking, **melting ice cube in CenturyLink**, jam them together and what could go wrong? Well, a lot can go wrong.\n\nFrom day one, it was very contentious and it\u2019s taken Jeff Storey 3 years to **reconfigure** the entity to be **effectively Level 3 again**, from a management perspective, obviously not from a revenue mix perspective, but certainly from people who make decisions on a day-to-day basis. However, it was **prevented by Glen Post, whom stayed on the board**.\n\n# What is LUMN now?\n\nYou have Level 3 with a legacy CenturyLink business. CenturyLink is just basically a rural telecom. Think of rural Louisiana, they\u2019re the telecom there. So, if you needed phone service or a really slow internet connection, which is probably DSL, because there is hardly no fiber in these areas and if you need a TV, that\u2019s where you\u2019re buying it from. And without any question, that\u2019s a shrinking business.\n\nJeff Storey is now the CEO of LUMN, the old **CenturyLink management team unsurprisingly is gone**. Investors love management. Management is always a big part of any investment premise and research. So you now have **management in place that investors love.**\n\nCheck out their website does this look like a melting ice cube such as CenturyLink?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.lumen.com\\/en-us\\/home.html](https://preview.redd.it/zfffexw4uzx71.jpg?width=1592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5b3bb878ac1c6f5050d8783c6f4b71566c2fb0d)\n\nIn March 2021, Lumen partners with IBM to use their satellites to provide cloud services in any environment.\n\n[https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-03-01-IBM-Cloud-Satellite-Enables-Clients-to-Deliver-Cloud-Securely-in-Any-Environment-Including-at-the-Edge](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-03-01-IBM-Cloud-Satellite-Enables-Clients-to-Deliver-Cloud-Securely-in-Any-Environment-Including-at-the-Edge)\n\n# What is LUMN now?\n\nLevel 3 at its core was IP services. IP services is a fancy way of saying **connectivity**. If you were across the United States, it would go through a fiber line that runs from LA to New York and get into someone\u2019s building. They own metro loops of fiber within most of the large cities in not only in the United States, but in the world. And they had what\u2019s called on net buildings, which is a fancy way of saying their own fiber assets and copper. Sometimes wiring was inside the commercial building that we\u2019re in. Now LUMN provides Internet Services, but also **owns the underlying fiber across the world**. In fact another part of their business model is to **whole sale their fiber network** to other IP providers. They also provide **content deliver networks**, for our upvotes, streaming videos, etc..\n\nThey have a lot of data center assets, three to 400 data centers that they basically run for their customers. They partner with AWS in some cases to offload some forms of traffic and data aggregation. Provide what\u2019s called the **edge connectivity solutions to businesses** that don\u2019t necessarily want to be a 100% on AWS or 100% on Azure or 100% on their own internal data warehouse has been mainly because of costs. **They compete on a smaller scale for cloud services**, more of an add on service to their core IP connectivity service if you can think of it that way.\n\nThey also provide wholesale connectivity to people who use their underlying network as a highway of sorts. And it\u2019s like a toll road and every single year that the tolls pay to get onto that toll road go down in price while they may not be laying any new transatlantic fibers, what\u2019s happened over the course of 20 years is that the actual hardware systems on each side of the fiber line continued to get upgraded every single let\u2019s say 12 to 18 months to a new generation. Just think of it as like a string cheese. Like if they\u2019ve figured out a way to pull the string cheese ever so more thinly and to create more strands effectively of that string cheese from the same block of cheese they had from the last 10 years.\n\nTop line growth of Lumen is spotty. It has been averaging say 5% over the past five years, top line was down 4.5% in 2019 at the point in time where the economy was still hot and before COVID-19 hit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e8xffajtuzx71.jpg?width=1483&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7aa1ca0a9d58c8bc8c826d63adc5d1d0fc085f0d\n\nI believe we're exiting the last bear phase and entering into a new bull phase. After the earnings on 11-03-2021 many investors agree.\n\n# Century Link Problems\n\n1.9B Voice business. Effectively zero over time, because many of us don\u2019t have home phones anymore. The only reason anyone would get one now a days would be if the cable company bundled it into a package.\n\nThe **decline rate** there is pretty intense. We\u2019re talking **15 to 20% year over year**. The reason why that matters is you would think that, well, that seems like a silly business to be in, but remember it\u2019s a 100% profit?\n\nLines laid over a course of 50 to 80 years, don\u2019t have to invest in them as just people pay every single month for this phone service that most people now with cell phones don\u2019t really need.\n\nSmall and mid-size businesses hard to sustain their top line while every single year they have to bring down prices on connectivity side as well as the Telcos telephone service.\n\n# Who are LUMN's competitors?\n\nIn the USA 18T and Verizon, the other legacy Telcos\n\nOutside the US if you\u2019re thinking about like who else has the ability to connect people from the US to EU, for example, ORAJ, Eugene and British Telecom.\n\nThere\u2019s competition, but there are certain barriers to entry... When you\u2019ve already laid the fiber, there is a cost base that it makes it very, very difficult for someone to come in and build another whole strand of fiber to compete with you because they\u2019ve got to spend the capital and associate the manpower to it, then compete with you on pricing and your assets are already in the ground. So, LUMN can always price lower to knock competitors out of the market.\n\nIn fact LUMN surpassed AT&amp;T as a market leader in Ethernet\n\n[https://news.lumen.com/2018-02-22-CenturyLink-Vaults-to-Top-of-U-S-Ethernet-LEADERBOARD](https://news.lumen.com/2018-02-22-CenturyLink-Vaults-to-Top-of-U-S-Ethernet-LEADERBOARD)\n\n# Why Invest in LUMN?\n\nThe **connectivity business will continue to grow** as people demand faster speeds, more bandwidth, more capacity, and then more security and other new kind of endpoint and edge services that CenturyLink offers. Level 3 side isn\u2019t growing as fast as detecting whatever that trades at 20 times revenue. But there is **core growth at Level 3**, which I think is what the **market doesn\u2019t understand and you have shrink to grow at CenturyLink**, which is shrink the parts that are shrinking eventually start to be a smaller part of the total. There are parts within CenturyLink that are growing, which is the broadband side start to grow.\n\nDecline are abating and there are almost no more decline at all. Cost to the degree that their margins are higher and their **cash flows are growing**. Even if their **top line is shrinking the revenue line**, and cash flows are growing. And that\u2019s the **inflection point**. The inflection point will be where no growth parts of the company no longer overwhelm the growing parts. Wall Street will then see a growing business that **generates an enormous amount of free cash flow that has a great ability to deliver and trades at a multiple and nothing trades that in terms of how low it is**.\n\nJeff Storey's performance, his free cash flow number. So the weird thing about this company is that given that Level 3 has publicly traded debt, **Level 3 also still puts out its own independent financials**. So while you can have a consolidated illumine 10K, you could also look at the annual results for the underlying Level 3 business, which allows you to **break apart Level 3 from legacy CenturyLink.**\n\nWhen Storey came in to be the CEO of the combined entity, the Legacy CenturyLink had a free cash flow number of roughly $1.6b to $7b, that was in 2016. He came in at the end of 17. So we\u2019ll just use 18 as a starting point. From 18 and 19, he\u2019s effectively stabilized and slightly even **grown free cash flow while at the very same time CenturyLink has lost call it 10 to 12% of its top line**. Within that melting ice cube, he\u2019s managed to **cut enough costs to effectively stabilize free cash flow in the face of a shrinking top-line number**, which is an impressive thing.\n\nJeff Storey\u2019s incentives are three-fold. His comp comes in the form of things tied to EBITDA and free cash flow growth. 90% of a short-term comp is based on that. He also has a **restricted stock issuances** that are also based on the **EBITDA profile of the company**. He currently owns three million shares? So a stock that used to be $25 to him is a whole heck of a lot of money.\n\nThe board of $LUMN also added in a **TSR total stock return long-term compensation metric**, which means that while you can argue that he\u2019s done a fantastic job on the operating side and he\u2019s done all the cost cuts and stabilized cash flows and all these things yet, **if the shareholders aren\u2019t getting the benefit of all of that, he\u2019s not going to get paid at all**.\n\nIf the stock does nothing for a year and at least you get a **10.3% dividend (next one on Nov 18th)**, that\u2019s a nice thing to have, but as we\u2019ll get into the valuation, the real upside here is based on some of the parts analysis, a discounted cash flow analysis that is **suggestive of much, much higher value**. And the dividend in the meantime is just a nice thing to have assuming it\u2019s sustainable.\n\nThere was an **earnings call on 11/3/2021** and here are the results from it:\n\n[https://s24.q4cdn.com/287068338/files/doc\\_financials/2021/q3/Lumen-3Q21-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://s24.q4cdn.com/287068338/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Lumen-3Q21-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\n**LUMEN TECHNOLOGIES REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2021 RESULTS**\n\n\u2981 Q3 EARNINGS PER SHARE $0.49 EXCLUDING ITEMS\n\n\u2981 Q3 EARNINGS PER SHARE $0.51\n\n\u2981 Q3 REVENUE $4.887 BILLION\n\n\u2981 Q3 EARNINGS PER SHARE VIEW $0.38, REVENUE VIEW $4.90 BILLION -- REFINITIV IBES DATA\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/11/04/why-lumen-technologies-was-up-by-mid-teens-today/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/11/04/why-lumen-technologies-was-up-by-mid-teens-today/)\n\nWe're now starting to get analysts from CNBC stating this should be **trading in the mid-to-high 20's**. This company should also **benefit from the infrastructure bill.**\n\nNow Citigroup also posted a PT of $13, which I don't believe they understand how to price this company properly.\n\n**Inv H&amp;S validated with a $28 upside target**. It's obviously clear that the investors **dont' know how to price this company properly**. Hopefully this DD will bring some light into that.\n\n# Why the debt isn't a problem\n\nUsually while looking into debt you focus on the interest coverage ratio. And this is the ratio that determines how easily a company can pay interest expenses on outstanding debt. It\u2019s calculated by dividing a company\u2019s operating income by its interest expense. $LUMN's interest coverage ratio is at a 2. Obviously the higher the ratio, the better. And we would typically like to see at least five, if not 10. Yes, this looks horrible to investors, but what if you look at debt with a different metric.\n\nEBITDA, which is a kind of a proxy for cash flow minus capital expenditures divided by interest expense. And that number is more like 3.5 and a half, which is\u2026 Again these numbers, are they stellar? Absolutely not. Is that certainly a concern of the market? 100%. $LUMN's perception is that there\u2019s an inflection point in terms of growth that is upcoming. The capital that they are spending now will continue to generate even better returns because they\u2019re much more targeting their capital expenditures and the cash flows they generate can more than offset. Well, they **can pay down debt**, they can **pay a dividend**, they can **pay their interest**, and they just **annouced a 1B $ buy back** on shares.\n\nThere\u2019s a virtuous cycle of **debt paid down** and **lower debt costs**. The **EBDITA has been growing year over year** and the new management is focused on **paying down debt**. Right now on a net debt EBITDA basis, EBITDA being their proxy for cash flow, **they\u2019re at 3.7 times**, which is certainly not that high.\n\nWhen CenturyLink bought Level 3 it was almost 4 years ago? They **paid $34B for the acquisition**. Let\u2019s just assume that no value was added for three years, which I would disagree with, because I think this is one of those companies that gets more valuable over time. Going back to Warren Buffet, he believes in **no compounds right value every single year**. They have about 30 billion in debt. So that takes out the entire debt stack just from the Level 3 assets. Meaning that if you subtract out that EBITDA number 2.8 billion, which comes directly from public filings not adjusted and no magic nonsense of core whatever billion different adjustments that people make, you get at the legacy CenturyLink of 5.8 billion **EBITDA almost for free**.\n\nMy premise is that as long as people wake up to the fact that the c**ore assets of Level 3 are worth** what they are worth in the private market for, let\u2019s say, **around $30 billion**. Let's apply even some modicum of multiple to the remaining CenturyLink assets, you have a **completely insane risk reward from 950 or whatever it\u2019s trading at today**. For margin of safety is that if someone offered me $1.7 billion in cash flow today, and I only have to pay 10 billion to get it, I would take that bet. That\u2019s it in a nutshell.\n\n# The Catalyst!\n\nI\u2019ll point out that Jeff Storey was going to **retire**, he was basically **forced** to come back into this role. He\u2019s 59 years old. He doesn't want to do this forever. Although, it's not public information they haven\u2019t said it, but supposition based on the **name change, the branding change** is that the company is in the middle of a long process of actually **undoing this merger**.\n\nCenturyLink should trade at a lower EBDITA multiple, a business like Level 3 should **trade at a higher EBDITA multiple** and to adjust some comparable transactions a much higher multiple. These two businesses don\u2019t work together in Wall Street\u2019s mind. But if you **separate them**, basically undoing what was an ill-fated marriage from the very beginning, that\u2019s how you create a lot of **value for shareholders**.\n\nIn fact since Lumen is such an **asset heavy company** they're looking at how they should split the assets. There are a number of different ways that they could do this. The question is, are they going to do it? And what\u2019s holding them back? In the middle of COVID, you\u2019re not going to sell physical assets. People couldn\u2019t even visit the assets until very recently. This also includes the naming rights to the Seattle Seahawks stadium.\n\n**The rebranding is just the first sign**, getting rid of the CenturyLink name, calling this company Lumen, saying that you\u2019re more of a **tech company, the writing\u2019s on the wall**, this is going to happen. And then the question is, **what is it worth**? What is someone willing to pay for it? And that\u2019s kind of as we\u2019re sitting here **clipping a 10.3% coupon**, it's obvious the numbers are a lot higher than has been anticipated.\n\nAlthough it's not public knowledge yet, but I do you think that you\u2019ve seen signs that they\u2019ve been very thoughtful about that. $LUMN has expressed an openness to do anything that **adds value for shareholders**, including **transactions, spinoffs**, things that would be more of a **catalyst for value creation.**\n\nI was just looking at their proxy statement, which by the way is just the annual data sent to shareholders about who\u2019s on the board, who\u2019s up for reelection on the board, corporate governance and then compensation, but also in the proxy statement, there is a change in control clause, which is like, if this company gets sold, how much does the CEO make? Well, there\u2019s $16 million in severance for Jeff Storey if the company gets sold and based on the stock price, I think at probably December 31st, he was $44 million if the company was sold. So getting back to incentives, does he have an incentive to maybe **transact this company**? I think the **44 million reasons** why there could be a value creating transaction of some kind in our near future.\n\n**TLDR;**\n\nLumen Technologies is two businesses combined CenturyLink and Level3. CenturyLink is a dying telecom business and the melting icecube of the two businesses. Level 3 is a connectivity business, which also compete with smaller cloud services. The merger occured and the investors didn't like Glen Post the CEO of CenturyLink who sat on the board of Lumen, he's gone as of Jan 2020 and Jeff Storey is now the CEO of Lumen and driving the business in the right direction, the financials show it. Lumen owns the majority of the fiber network that connects the united states and transalantic, when acquisition occured it was valued at 34b. A lot has been done since the acquisition, so I believe it is valued a lot higher than 34b. Lumen currently is 30b in debt (which is equal to their assets), but the debt is being paid down, they do a share repurchase program (recently filed a 13D/A on Nov 1st for it for 1B)and a 10.3% dividend (coming up on Nov 18th). The catalyst is in the proxy statement where the current CEO would get a 44 million payout if the company is sold and split. CenturyLink &amp; Level 3 were and illfated marriage from the beginning which is why the investors in the spac sold out to burn CenturyLink in the beginning. The new CEO has been paying down debt increasing the free cashflow &amp; ebdita quarter after quarter. There was an earnings call 11-03-2021 and quarter after quarter the company continues to improve. There is nothing but greatness in the future for Lumen. Level 3 will be valued a lot more without CenturyLink as burden and it's starting to become more obvious to investors. It's also very obvious that investors are confused on how to price this asset heavy company properly with CenturyLink dragging down $LUMN. I truely believe this is a hidden gem to hold for the long term, you're starting to see analysts price their targets from $13, $25, $28, the buy back program also shows how they believe how undervalued the shares are. It's only going to get better for Lumen once they get rid of the melting ice cube known as CenturyLink.",

        "selftext": "\nQuantum computing in the near future will usher in huge advances in technology and perhaps transform how we go about our daily lives for the better. The unfortunate part of our quantum future is that when quantum computing arrives, current encryption methods keeping all of our information safe, will fail. This is not a question of if, it is of when. The Global Risk Institute released a report titled \"Quantum Threat Timeline\" in 2019 which polled 22 leading data scientists on the forecasted timetable for a quantum computer to break current encryption standards. The consensus at the time was around 15 years, or 2034. Since that report was released, the quantum computing market has experienced a massive surge of investment with incredibly fast progress reported from companies around the globe, several, such as Google (GOOGL) (GOOG), IBM (IBM), Rigetti Computing and Honeywell (HON) already have broken past 100 qubits, with a rapid doubling of capability shown.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor reference, a recent article from Cornell University shows that PKI encryption (the current industry standard) may require as little as 2,000 logical qubits to break, making the timeline for current encryptions' obsolescence disturbingly close, likely in the 2025-2030 time frame, with governments such as the USA, UK, China and Russia likely well ahead of that date. A troubling trend noted recently by nation-state actors is to \"harvest now, decrypt later\" which is the term for stealing encrypted data from hardened sources today and then store the data to decrypt when the technology is available.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt has even been theorized that the entire chain that digital assets depend on may be at risk of total hijack or collapse once quantum computers reach maturity. This trend makes it critically important for nations to migrate away from PKI encryption as soon as possible to symmetric encryption keys. The biggest problem currently with symmetric key encryption is that you need to have a way to get the key to the other party with whom you are sharing the data. Arqit believes that it has a solution for this critical problem that is completely computationally secure, which means it cannot be broken by any current or future machine, along with a delivery system that cannot be intercepted via the quantum cloud. The key to this entire technology's eventual adoption is that the algorithm used is already the global standard (AES), meaning that it is operable with current systems, giving users no logical reason to not adopt the technology.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe technology Arqit invented is covered by over 1,400 patent claims making this company and its technology potentially protected from copycats looking to set up similar business models for some time to come. The commercial strategy also appears to be very well thought out, with the software downloaded by customers and used automatically. Billing events are created by usage via commercial customers with key creation events being metered. The brilliance of this strategy is the incredibly low capex Arqit has to expend once the core infrastructure is in place, as the software needed is basically zero touch.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith current systems operating on a compatible format, ultimately every connected device is a potential customer of Arqit without the need of the company building any further infrastructure as the 2 planned and paid for satellites used are able to generate two quadrillion unique keys per year. To get an idea of the explosive potential of this company, please keep in mind that the below pipeline and business development was accomplished all in 2021, with only 2 dedicated salespeople, one being the CEO himself.To land executed, recurring and framework contracts with the likes of the British Government, British Telecom (OTCPK:BTGOF), Sumitomo Corporation (OTCPK:SSUMF) ESA and Dentons in addition to an \"unnamed\" major payment network, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Iridium (IRDM), Verizon (VZ) and BP (BP) accomplished pre hard rollout is unbelievably impressive and gives credibility to the massive potential ahead for the company.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDuring recent analyst conferences before the de-SPAC event, the CEO has reported massively increased interest in the product well before any ramp up in sales and marketing efforts by the company. Generally I do not like to discuss financial projections generated from the SPAC process as many companies simply throw hopes and dreams into a blender to come up with these. However, given the solid and proven pipeline of customers Arqit has signed already and the fact that the service is already live give me enough confidence to share the company's 2025 projections.With Arqit, I really have to control my enthusiasm a bit, not only does the company appear to have a scalable solution to a massive problem affecting nearly every sector around the globe, but the company also has a way of doing it that is low capex and very high margin.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn addition, the company having expended basically zero sales effort to date, has secured $130 million in guaranteed revenues from A list customers with a high probability of closing a $1.1 billion backlog pipeline already. The CEO indicated in the recent investor day that in his 30 years of sales experience, he has never had any product like Arqit's and that his closing percentage is nearly 100%. If Arqit even comes close to the financial projections they have presented, which the CEO notes is a very conservative projection, then the company could be worth many multiples of the current $2.1\n\n\u00a0\n\nbillion market cap. It also would appear, counter to many of the recent SPAC IPOs, that dilution should not be an issue going forward. In the SPAC transaction, the company has received $376 million in cash to the balance sheet, to which the CEO recently commented that the deal brought it \"twice the money that we need to fully fund our business\" and that \"We don't need to raise any more money, ever,\" he told CNBC. In late August I purchased a moderately sized speculative position in the SPAC. My only hesitancy in purchasing more is that generally, when a company seems to have a no-brainer, hugely profitable solution to a massive problem, red flags tend to appear.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo far, I have not found any true red flags with Arqit, but as I am not a cybersecurity expert, I will be keeping my position moderately sized until at least a few quarters have run off and I gain a greater comfortability with the progress of the technology and management. I am very excited to see how this company develops as it would appear they may have solved a truly massive problem that nearly all NATO countries have been losing sleep over for years, before it actually existed.

I am not intelligent, but I am probably the  finest copy-paster out there, and Im proud of it, now let me begin:\n\nEver  heard of Quantum computing? Everybody is saying its the future of  computers, detractors saying its full of crap. Well, whichever side are  you on, or whether you do not understand what quantum computing is, hear  me out. [Rigetti](https://www.rigetti.com/)  is one of the few companies who dabble on quantum computing. I am  honestly saying right now I do not understand what quantum computing is,  but as Ive said earlier, upon looking at their [investor presentation](https://www.rigetti.com/uploads/Rigetti-Investor-Presentation.pdf) , I am certain that I will be making QUANTUM TENDIES on this one.\n\nThis  company also has the BALLS to say that they are better than Google or  IBM in the \"qubits\" area (whatever that is). Either they are flat out  lying or simply DUMB or they are just too awesome and confident about  their company:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[See that?

Better than IBM and Google wtf](https://preview.redd.it/5yctah9wxzz71.png?width=1503&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39fac41449ba881df444c4ee7b257c477f91b71f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[and what about this? Holy s\\*\\*\\*](https://preview.redd.it/3ditz7r2yzz71.png?width=1503&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d89a2c80a8bcd15592fe0019e9f9691f77f8bcc)\n\nAnd come to think of it, the company has employed all these Nerds, Brainiacs and multi-talented individuals from different schools that I can only dream of going into:\n\n[MIT baby!](https://preview.redd.it/fo8bvou9yzz71.png?width=1502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2008c9252cb8f7461654cc5ed725fed3e4b12d17)\n\nThere is also one fascinating WORD that I saw from their presentation, CHIPS, they are making quantum CHIPS. Doesnt that ring a bell?! Fancy words MODULAR, SCALABLE, it does sound like TENDIES to me! Effin modular tendies, scalable tendies, QUANTUMIFY my tendies please!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CHIPS anyone?](https://preview.redd.it/phjstu8wzzz71.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=230388a6797bd9e23e4737fec62d9c77ad2f5173)\n\nAnd ever heard of patents? This company has HUNDREDS of it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/se1qfsxl00081.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9647f4d2f69385a0da701f701ef1c7b7311349b9\n\nAs I am writing this copy-pasted-from-the-ivestor-presentation dd, IONQ is mooning towards ALL TIME HIGHS. Can this ticker moon too? Well, it says on this PICTURE that Rigetti is better than IONQ so we have to at least moon too:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[all you IONQ maximalists look at this](https://preview.redd.it/3ow26xs910081.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=444f8ab79b49a1af9372802aa732a782cc7803ea)\n\n**TLDR:** this is a sympathy play to IONQ, who knows we could moon too! I have 7.7k shares and will add if it breaks 11.6. Goodluck!",

        "selftext": "Quantum computing in the near future will usher in huge advances in technology and perhaps transform how we go about our daily lives for the better. The unfortunate part of our quantum future is that when quantum computing arrives, current encryption methods keeping all of our information safe, will fail. This is not a question of if, it is of when.  The Global Risk Institute released a report titled \"Quantum Threat Timeline\" in 2019 which polled 22 leading data scientists on the forecasted timetable for a quantum computer to break current encryption standards. The consensus at the time was around 15 years, or 2034.  Since that report was released, the quantum computing market has experienced a massive surge of investment with incredibly fast progress reported from companies around the globe, several, such as Google (GOOGL) (GOOG), IBM (IBM), Rigetti Computing and Honeywell (HON) already have broken past 100 qubits, with a rapid doubling of capability shown.  For reference, a recent article from Cornell University shows that PKI encryption (the current industry standard) may require as little as 2,000 logical qubits to break, making the timeline for current encryptions' obsolescence disturbingly close, likely in the 2025-2030 time frame, with governments such as the USA, UK, China and Russia likely well ahead of that date.  A troubling trend noted recently by nation-state actors is to \"harvest now, decrypt later\" which is the term for stealing encrypted data from hardened sources today and then store the data to decrypt when the technology is available. It has even been theorized that the entire blockchain that cryptocurrencies depend on may be at risk of total hijack or collapse once quantum computers reach maturity.  This trend makes it critically important for nations to migrate away from PKI encryption as soon as possible to symmetric encryption keys. The biggest problem currently with symmetric key encryption is that you need to have a way to get the key to the other party with whom you are sharing the data.  Arqit believes that it has a solution for this critical problem that is completely computationally secure, which means it cannot be broken by any current or future machine, along with a delivery system that cannot be intercepted via the quantum cloud. The key to this entire technology's eventual adoption is that the algorithm used is already the global standard (AES), meaning that it is operable with current systems, giving users no logical reason to not adopt the technology.  The technology Arqit invented is covered by over 1,400 patent claims making this company and its technology potentially protected from copycats looking to set up similar business models for some time to come.  The commercial strategy also appears to be very well thought out, with the software downloaded by customers and used automatically. Billing events are created by usage via commercial customers with key creation events being metered. The brilliance of this strategy is the incredibly low capex Arqit has to expend once the core infrastructure is in place, as the software needed is basically zero touch. With current systems operating on a compatible format, ultimately every connected device is a potential customer of Arqit without the need of the company building any further infrastructure as the 2 planned and paid for satellites used are able to generate two quadrillion unique keys per year.  To get an idea of the explosive potential of this company, please keep in mind that the below pipeline and business development was accomplished all in 2021, with only 2 dedicated salespeople, one being the CEO [himself.To](https://himself.To) land executed, recurring and framework contracts with the likes of the British Government, British Telecom (OTCPK:BTGOF), Sumitomo Corporation (OTCPK:SSUMF) ESA and Dentons in addition to an \"unnamed\" major payment network, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Iridium (IRDM), Verizon (VZ) and BP (BP) accomplished pre hard rollout is unbelievably impressive and gives credibility to the massive potential ahead for the company.  During recent analyst conferences before the de-SPAC event, the CEO has reported massively increased interest in the product well before any ramp up in sales and marketing efforts by the company.  Generally I do not like to discuss financial projections generated from the SPAC process as many companies simply throw hopes and dreams into a blender to come up with these. However, given the solid and proven pipeline of customers Arqit has signed already and the fact that the service is already live give me enough confidence to share the company's 2025 projections.With Arqit, I really have to control my enthusiasm a bit, not only does the company appear to have a scalable solution to a massive problem affecting nearly every sector around the globe, but the company also has a way of doing it that is low capex and very high margin.  In addition, the company having expended basically zero sales effort to date, has secured $130 million in guaranteed revenues from A list customers with a high probability of closing a $1.1 billion backlog pipeline already.  The CEO indicated in the recent investor day that in his 30 years of sales experience, he has never had any product like Arqit's and that his closing percentage is nearly 100%.  If Arqit even comes close to the financial projections they have presented, which the CEO notes is a very conservative projection, then the company could be worth many multiples of the current $2.1 billion market cap.  It also would appear, counter to many of the recent SPAC IPOs, that dilution should not be an issue going forward. In the SPAC transaction, the company has received $376 million in cash to the balance sheet, to which the CEO recently commented that the deal brought it \"twice the money that we need to fully fund our business\" and that \"We don't need to raise any more money, ever,\" he told CNBC.  In late August I purchased a moderately sized speculative position in the SPAC. My only hesitancy in purchasing more is that generally, when a company seems to have a no-brainer, hugely profitable solution to a massive problem, red flags tend to appear.  So far, I have not found any true red flags with Arqit, but as I am not a cybersecurity expert, I will be keeping my position moderately sized until at least a few quarters have run off and I gain a greater comfortability with the progress of the technology and management.  I am very excited to see how this company develops as it would appear they may have solved a truly massive problem that nearly all NATO countries have been losing sleep over for years, before it actually existed. If they are successful in the product roll out, shareholders are likely to be rewarded handsomely.  I look forward to your comments and views of the company, thank you for reading and good luck!",

        "selftext": "ARQQ: Massive Return Potential By Future Proofing Cybersecurity\n\nQuantum computing in the near future will usher in huge advances in technology and perhaps transform how we go about our daily lives for the better. The unfortunate part of our quantum future is that when quantum computing arrives, current encryption methods keeping all of our information safe, will fail. This is not a question of if, it is of when. The Global Risk Institute released a report titled \"Quantum Threat Timeline\" in 2019 which polled 22 leading data scientists on the forecasted timetable for a quantum computer to break current encryption standards. The consensus at the time was around 15 years, or 2034. Since that report was released, the quantum computing market has experienced a massive surge of investment with incredibly fast progress reported from companies around the globe, several, such as Google (GOOGL) (GOOG), IBM (IBM), Rigetti Computing and Honeywell (HON) already have broken past 100 qubits, with a rapid doubling of capability shown.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor reference, a recent article from Cornell University shows that PKI encryption (the current industry standard) may require as little as 2,000 logical qubits to break, making the timeline for current encryptions' obsolescence disturbingly close, likely in the 2025-2030 time frame, with governments such as the USA, UK, China and Russia likely well ahead of that date. A troubling trend noted recently by nation-state actors is to \"harvest now, decrypt later\" which is the term for stealing encrypted data from hardened sources today and then store the data to decrypt when the technology is available.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt has even been theorized that the entire blockchain that cryptocurrencies depend on may be at risk of total hijack or collapse once quantum computers reach maturity. This trend makes it critically important for nations to migrate away from PKI encryption as soon as possible to symmetric encryption keys. The biggest problem currently with symmetric key encryption is that you need to have a way to get the key to the other party with whom you are sharing the data. Arqit believes that it has a solution for this critical problem that is completely computationally secure, which means it cannot be broken by any current or future machine, along with a delivery system that cannot be intercepted via the quantum cloud. The key to this entire technology's eventual adoption is that the algorithm used is already the global standard (AES), meaning that it is operable with current systems, giving users no logical reason to not adopt the technology.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe technology Arqit invented is covered by over 1,400 patent claims making this company and its technology potentially protected from copycats looking to set up similar business models for some time to come. The commercial strategy also appears to be very well thought out, with the software downloaded by customers and used automatically. Billing events are created by usage via commercial customers with key creation events being metered. The brilliance of this strategy is the incredibly low capex Arqit has to expend once the core infrastructure is in place, as the software needed is basically zero touch.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith current systems operating on a compatible format, ultimately every connected device is a potential customer of Arqit without the need of the company building any further infrastructure as the 2 planned and paid for satellites used are able to generate two quadrillion unique keys per year. To get an idea of the explosive potential of this company, please keep in mind that the below pipeline and business development was accomplished all in 2021, with only 2 dedicated salespeople, one being the CEO himself.To land executed, recurring and framework contracts with the likes of the British Government, British Telecom (OTCPK:BTGOF), Sumitomo Corporation (OTCPK:SSUMF) ESA and Dentons in addition to an \"unnamed\" major payment network, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Iridium (IRDM), Verizon (VZ) and BP (BP) accomplished pre hard rollout is unbelievably impressive and gives credibility to the massive potential ahead for the company.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDuring recent analyst conferences before the de-SPAC event, the CEO has reported massively increased interest in the product well before any ramp up in sales and marketing efforts by the company. Generally I do not like to discuss financial projections generated from the SPAC process as many companies simply throw hopes and dreams into a blender to come up with these. However, given the solid and proven pipeline of customers Arqit has signed already and the fact that the service is already live give me enough confidence to share the company's 2025 projections.With Arqit, I really have to control my enthusiasm a bit, not only does the company appear to have a scalable solution to a massive problem affecting nearly every sector around the globe, but the company also has a way of doing it that is low capex and very high margin.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn addition, the company having expended basically zero sales effort to date, has secured $130 million in guaranteed revenues from A list customers with a high probability of closing a $1.1 billion backlog pipeline already. The CEO indicated in the recent investor day that in his 30 years of sales experience, he has never had any product like Arqit's and that his closing percentage is nearly 100%. If Arqit even comes close to the financial projections they have presented, which the CEO notes is a very conservative projection, then the company could be worth many multiples of the current $2.1\n\n\u00a0\n\nbillion market cap. It also would appear, counter to many of the recent SPAC IPOs, that dilution should not be an issue going forward. In the SPAC transaction, the company has received $376 million in cash to the balance sheet, to which the CEO recently commented that the deal brought it \"twice the money that we need to fully fund our business\" and that \"We don't need to raise any more money, ever,\" he told CNBC. In late August I purchased a moderately sized speculative position in the SPAC. My only hesitancy in purchasing more is that generally, when a company seems to have a no-brainer, hugely profitable solution to a massive problem, red flags tend to appear.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo far, I have not found any true red flags with Arqit, but as I am not a cybersecurity expert, I will be keeping my position moderately sized until at least a few quarters have run off and I gain a greater comfortability with the progress of the technology and management. I am very excited to see how this company develops as it would appear they may have solved a truly massive problem that nearly all NATO countries have been losing sleep over for years, before it actually existed. If they are successful in the product roll out, shareholders are likely to be rewarded handsomely. I look forward to your comments and views of the company, thank you for reading and good luck!\n\n\u00a0",

I am a semi and semi-cap equipment bull and foresee\u00a0another 10+ years of extremely strong growth for both.\u00a0 As this relates to AMD in\u00a0particular, the most important\u00a0point is that while\u00a0AMD (and NVDA) have been growing strong both due to organic market growth and eating into INTC position. Both of these trends will also be continuing for many years thanks to increases in EVs, \"metaverse\"/web 2.0 &amp; 3.0/omniverse, IoT, digital coins/tokens, always on wearable medical devices, AR/VR.\u00a0 Yes, I know the Intel fanboys are screaming over all the great things Pat is doing, I too hold a little Intel however, it will take many years to turn the ship and he is then wanting to turn that ship to fight on all three fronts with TSM, AMD, and NVDA - good luck.\n\nSimply looking at the pie of existing market share we see that there is a big ol' piece\u00a0of pie there that Intel still has but is being eaten away by AMD more quickly every year.\u00a0\n\nRevenue (TTM)\nAMD $14.9B as of 09/30/2021\nNVDA $21.9B\u00a0as of\u00a007/31/2021\nINTC $78.5B\u00a0as of\u00a009/30/2021\n\nForward EPS Long Term Growth (3-5 Yrs) \nAMD 35.32% 09/30/2021\nNVDA 32.60% 07/31/2021\nINTC 3.16% 09/30/2021\n\nWith both AMD and NVDA\u00a0projecting great forward EPS, the main reason\u00a0I am more bullish on AMD is that the majority of Intel's revenue comes from CPUs in PCs and data centers -&gt; AMD is the predator\u00a0here and continues to eat away at this huge cash pie.\n\nLast note, AMD just entered a Wave 5-Bullish Elliott Wave on 11/9/21.\n\nUpgrades/Downgrades from the last week:\n-- BofA Securities Raises Price Target for Buy-Rated Advanced Micro Devices to $175 From $150 on Meta's Adoption of EPYC CPUs\n-- Susquehanna Adjusts AMD's Price Target to $175 From $145, Keeps Positive Rating\n--\u00a0Wedbush Lifts AMD's Price Target to $165 From $140; Outperform Rating Kept\n--\u00a0AMD price target raised to $180 from $145 at Wells Fargo, overweight\n--\u00a0Zacks Investment Research, Inc. upgrades ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES ORD SHS from NEUTRAL to OUTPERFORM.\n\nRecent Headlines:\n-- Tencent Adopts Semi-Custom AMD GPUs, Designs Own Drivers\n--\u00a0Facebook Meta AMD EPYC North Dome CPU and Platform Details\n--\u00a0IBM Cloud Selects 3rd Gen AMD EPYC\u2122 Processors for New Bare Metal Offering for Compute-Intensive Workloads\n-- Samsung set to announce Exynos 2200 with AMD GPU on November 19\n--\u00a0\u00a0THE AMD \u201cALDEBARAN\u201d GPU THAT WON EXASCALE\n--\u00a0\u00a0AMD deal with Mega is a \u2018significant win,\u2019 says Jefferies\u2019 Jared Weisfeld\n--\u00a0\u00a0TESLA PLAID ECU tear down (AMD INSIDE!!)",
