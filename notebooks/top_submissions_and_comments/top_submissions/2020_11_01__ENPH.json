Go find something new and interesting to invest in you unoriginal bastards. \n\nI have a long list of stocks that are parabolic af, that I rarely ever see posted here. I would love to see a post about a wsb'er making $50k off Party City or Rite Aid calls for instance, that would be some nice original content. But all we get everyday is some retard who has been trading options for 2 weeks posting about his PLTR yolo. STFU. You literally bought that because you looked at the chart and you were like \"Rrrrg... green line go up. Green line keep go up!\" \n\nTo be honest, I really could care less about whatever shit ass company you guys are pushing on any given week. I would care, but there never seems to be any good dd attached to any of these companies. It's just \"dude this stock goes up. DON'T ASK QUESTIONS JUST BUY! STOCKS ONLY GO UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThis type of shit was a funny joke to make fun of retarded \"traders\" at first, but many of you have actually become the embodiment of this exaggerated retard persona. I know there are plenty of non retards on this sub but you all enable these idiots by going along with this shit. It stops now. \n\nWe should be making fun of people for being retarded. We shouldn't become a collective of retards. We are retarded in the sense that we trade high risk options. That aspect of this lifestyle should be embraced. This whole not doing research, and just blindly throwing $ at the top trending ticker part is actually fucking retarded. Literally, an actual retard could make these trades. \n\nI am calling for a great enlightenment of this sub. I want to see a diverse variety of different tickers. I want the standard of \"retard\" to be raised. I want you all to do your part and make this sub 10% less retarded. \n\nAlso check out some of these tickers for a change: ENPH PRTY RAD KSS JWN AMSC If you know any other interesting tickers that are underappreaciated here, drop a comment.",

They IPO'd again in 2020.[2](https://www.bing.com/search?q=rackspace+ipo&amp;qs=n&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=rackspace+ipo&amp;sc=8-13&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=9E4E05EBDEE34DB096AEA4447519BDBA&amp;first=7&amp;FORM=PORE)\n   * Changed their business model from competing with AWS, GOOG, and MSFT to working with and enabling them [3](https://www.thestreet.com/video/rackspace-amazon-what-company-does)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Why The Fuck Should I Buy Shares or Calls?***\n\n* Rackspace is one of the few companies in the cloud space that haven't mooned since covid began\n   * Compare charts to SNOW, DDOG, NET, etc.\n* Currently trades less than 70% it's actual value when compared to stocks in the same sector (see Seeking Alpha: Rackspace Technologies: 70% Upside Is Just The Start)\n* AWS, GOOG, MSFT have performed remarkedly since the pandemic has began - a direct beneficiary - you guessed it, RXT.\n   * Bookings take 2-3 quarters to have profit realized (now and beyond)   (see Seeking Alpha: Rackspace Technologies: 70% Upside Is Just The Start)\n* Insititutions have been quitely purchased millions in stock[5](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/RXT/institutional-ownership/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Why shouldn't I buy rackspace?***\n\nDebt.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 16, 2020**\n\nThe stock market rallied today, with the Dow Jones reaching record highs, after Moderna (MRNA) announced promising data for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, adding to hopes that an effective vaccine may soon be available. Remember Pfizer (PFE) also announced positive vaccine data last week.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished the day 1.19% up, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.78% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing the day 1.67% up.\n\nEarly Monday, Moderna (MRNA) announced that preliminary data from its late-stage clinical trial showed its vaccine candidate was 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19 in participants. This study, known as the COVE study, enrolled more than 30,000 participants in the U.S. Based on the data, the company said it \u201c intends to submit for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the coming weeks.\u201d The company reported they expect to have prepared 20 million doses of the vaccine by the end of the year and between 500 million to 1 billion doses globally in 2021. The company is working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Operation Warp Speed, McKesson (MCK), and governments across the globe to plan for distribution. Moderna\u2019s vaccine candidate is a lot easier to ship than Pfizer\u2019s candidate, which requires super cold temperatures. The company said, \u201cvaccine candidate now expected to remain stable at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) for 30 days, up from the previous estimate of 7 days. Shipping and long-term storage conditions at standard freezer temperatures of -20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F) for 6 months. mRNA-1273 is to be distributed using widely available vaccine delivery and storage infrastructure. However, it is important to note that setting up a global distribution network for the vaccine is likely to take months. Here is the link to the Company\u2019s press release: [https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy))\n\nOver the weekend, the United States topped 11 million coronavirus cases, with 250,000 people tragically dead, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US is nearly averaging 150,000 new infections per day, the most since the pandemic started by a wide margin, with the number still growing. Around four weeks ago, the US first crossed the 100,000 cases per day mark for the first time. In recent days, more cities and states have added curfews and tightened their restrictions on daily activities as case counts soar. New Jersey\u2019s new daily COVID-19 cases hit a record high on Saturday, and Illinois and Ohio both saw record numbers of new cases on Friday. Chicago posted a stay-at-home advisory late last week, and New York state had a new 10 p.m. curfew on bars, restaurants and gyms go into effect Friday. Oregon ordered a two-week \u201cfreeze\u201d on non-essential business activity and large social gatherings. The recent surge in case is once again straining hospital capacity, with around 70,000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 across the US. This number is also growing at a record rate. Therefore, during the next weeks we expect a gradual tightening of restrictions nationwide. While it is highly unlikely we return a lockdown like earlier in the year, we expect states to enact restrictions to combat the recent surge in cases. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* President-elect Joe Biden consulted the CEOs of top U.S. companies and labor leaders on Monday before a planned speech on fixing the pandemic-battered economy and welcomed further progress in COVID-19 vaccine development.\n* After the positive vaccine study, reopening stocks like cruise lines, airlines, hotels, and others once again spiked. Stay-at-home stocks like Peleton (PTON), Zoom (ZM) were under pressure.\n* Shares of Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) fell today after Moderna (MRNA) new data showed their vaccine to be more effective and easier to store. \n* Lordstown Motors (RIDE) says it's \"on-track\" to being making electric pickups by September 2021 called the Endurance. \n* Xencor (XNCR) target raised by Cantor Fitzgerald from $40 to $46 at OUTPERFORM. Stock currently around $40.\n* Twilio (TWLO) with extremely bullish target raise by Oppenheimer from $350 to $550 at OUTPERFORM. Stock currently around $280. Stock has been under pressure recently, maybe a good opportunity.\n* Square (SQ) with very bullish target raise by Keycorp from $215 to $250. Stock currently around $180.\n* SunRun[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24RUN&amp;src=cashtag_click)(RUN) target increased by Barckalys from $57 to $68 at OVERWEIGHT. Stock currently around $55.\n* ON Semiconductor (ON) target raised by Needham &amp; Co. from $30 to $33. Stock currently $28. \n* Moderna (MRNA) target raised by Piper Sandler from $136 to $166 after positive vaccine news and to $105 by Bank of America (BAC)\n* Installed Building Products (IBP) target raised by Deutsche Bank (DB) from $110 to $114. Stock currently around $98.\n* Halozyme Therapeutics (HALO) target raised by Wells Fargo (WFC) from $39 to $60 at OVERWEIGHT. Stock around $39, very notable.\n* Enphase Energy (ENPH) target raised by Barclays from $127 to $142 at OUTPERFORM.\n* Footlocker (FL) target raised by Raymond James from $35 to $50 at OUTPERFORM. Stock currently around $38.\n* DraftKings with target raise by Northland Securities from $50 to $55. Stock has been heavily under pressure lately and has pulled back steeply from all-time highs.\n* Applied Materials (AMAT) target raised by Argus from $80 to $90 at BUY. Stock currently around $73.\n* Apple (AAPL) had target set by JP Morgan (JPM) at $150 with BUY rating.\n* EV\u2019s were in the spotlight once again with companies like $RIDE $BLNK and $Li up double digits. $NIO reports tomorrow after the bell.\n* Power generation companies were also up big, notably: $\n\n\"We must all suffer one of two things: The pain of discipline, or the pain of regret.\"  -Jim Rohn",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 9th, 2020.\n\n# **After sharp bounce, market may take a \u2018breather\u2019 on lingering election uncertainty, virus outbreak  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/06/after-sharp-bounce-market-may-take-a-breather-on-lingering-election-uncertainty-virus-outbreak.html)**\n*****\n&gt; After an initially exuberant election reaction, stocks may trade more cautiously in the week ahead, as investors watch election developments unfold and track the course of the coronavirus. \n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up more than 7.3% in the past week, at 3,509, and the Nasdaq rose 9%, the best weekly performance since April. Stocks slid Friday, but technology, communications services, health care and discretionary stocks had the biggest gains for the week, after it appeared Democrat Joe Biden could be the next president but with a split Congress.\n*****\n&gt; The election was still unresolved heading into the weekend, but even if Biden is declared winner, close votes and lawsuits are likely to result in recounts. The Senate appeared to be in Republican hands, but the margin of control is likely to be tight, and runoff elections are required for two Senate seats in Georgia in early January.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the uncertainty is going to catch up the market on a short-term basis,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, BNY Mellon\u2019s Wealth Management chief investment officer. \u201cPerhaps next week could be a drifting lower kind of week.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ahead of the election, the market had been betting on a \u201cblue wave,\u201d where Biden would take the White House and Democrats would get control of the Senate, giving them total control of Congress. But when it appeared the Senate would stay in Republican hands, stocks surged on the idea of gridlock, which would keep Biden from implementing tax increases and lots of new regulations.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, there has been a surge in daily new coronavirus cases to more than 122,000. Economists are concerned that the economic recovery could suffer as some states could restrict activities and consumers may pull back heading into the important holiday season.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed, in its post-meeting statement Thursday, repeated that the course of the virus could help determine the path of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; There are a few economic reports in the week ahead, including consumer price index inflation data Thursday and the producer price index Friday. More than a dozen Fed officials are on the speaking circuit, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who speaks Thursday on central banking at a European Central Bank forum.\n*****\n&gt; The earnings season is beginning to slow down, but there are still dozens of reports, including from McDonald\u2019s on Monday and Walt Disney, Applied Materials and Cisco on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is just setting up to be a breather. There\u2019s still a lot to figure out here,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cThe equity market\u2019s reaction has been I think understandable and probably better than many might have expected.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said there may be uncertainty for awhile. \u201cWhat I\u2019m thinking about is the Senate races. Part of the market reaction has been relying on this divided government.\u201d After the votes are all in or recounted, \u201ca sweep is unlikely but possible.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the longer this stays uncertain and messy, the more the post-election bounce comes into question,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Different than 2000\n&gt; It would not be unusual for the stock market to sell off before rallying into year end, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall does not expect the type of turbulence there was in 2000, when former Vice President Al Gore lost to George W. Bush in a tight race that ultimately went to the Supreme Court.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn 2000, they were not expecting hanging chads. But they do expect a contested election this time. I think in many ways the market anticipated this,\u201d said Stovall.\n*****\n&gt; But the market, after its election week surge, could pull back. \u201cHistorically, the market goes down in the month of November, after a Democratic victory,\u201d said Stovall. Since World War II, Democrats won the White House nine times, and the market fell an average of 0.5% in November in those years, compared to the average gain for all Novembers of 1.4%, he said.\n*****\n&gt; After those Democratic victories, stocks then rose 1.9% in December on average, more than the normal 1.5% gain for all Decembers.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said they currently do not expect the kind of lockdowns that states ordered when the pandemic started to spread in March. But there could still be some impact that could be negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said he sees some signs of optimism for the market. Strong data, like third quarter GDP, October\u2019s drop in unemployment to 6.9%, and the better-than-expected earnings are all positives for the market. Another is that investors are so skeptical.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat does still exist is a great deal of dry powder. There\u2019s $4.3 trillion in money markets alone,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you, being in touch with investors of all shapes and sizes this week, there\u2019s still a lot of skepticism. From a contrarian view, high cash and a lot of skepticism is a contrarian indicator.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/WUlRQfd.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/FWN82Hs.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ZnTzBNz.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/g52vqsv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OiPuXi8.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lA86Kou.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xmtVSEB.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RRxlWej.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/W80POso.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eGUQXgr.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yoHWfIC.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hQyweyw.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Presidential Election Anticipation Is Keeping Us Waiting\n\n&gt; While we all anxiously await the final count and outcome of the U.S. Presidential Election, here are some possible scenarios for 2021. Our analysis here is based on historical market performance during the most likely political alignments for next year. We ran these likely scenarios through the Almanac database software to create this graph.\n\n&gt; We are either going to have the fifth year of a two-term republican president or a first year of a new democratic presidency. It appears the democrats will hold the house and the republicans will hold the senate, but that is not a forgone conclusion either. So we also examined both presidential outcomes with a democratic, republican and split congress.\n\n&gt; Our study uses the S&amp;P 500 from 1949 to 2017. We start in 1949 because it is the first full 4-Year Presidential Stock Market Cycle since the end of WWII. The Twenty-Second Amendment that implemented presidential term limits for a max of two terms or eight years was ratified on February 27, 1951. Truman in 1949 was excluded as there was a no change of party in the White House. We gave Bush 41 the same treatment.\n\n&gt; Admittedly, there are limited data points; four each of fifth year republicans and first year democrats. Here\u2019s what we found. A change in party with a new, first year democratic president came with democratic control of Congress and significantly higher performance for the S&amp;P 500, averaging 10.6% with a median gain of 15.1% versus 7.0% for the average post-election year since 1949.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a89421df75f426e1b1ff90cb2c29cb90/b63e1cf962f89fdb-a3/s400x600/f9bde99a9e4ba83b0df266a8d3cc04cd732cc58f.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Fifth year republican presidents in 1957 (Eisenhower) and 1973 (Nixon) had to work with democratically controlled Congresses and the market suffered significant losses. The market did well in Reagan\u2019s fifth year with a split Congress \u2013 a testament to how \u201cThe Great Communicator\u201d was able to work across the aisle with then Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill. Even with republican control of Congress under Bush 43\u2019s fifth year, the market had a tough year with ongoing issues in Iraq, North Korea declaring it\u2019s a nuclear power and the most active and second costliest hurricane season on record.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Job Growth Continues as COVID-19 Cases Rise\n\n&gt; The US labor market shrugged off election uncertainty and continued to add jobs in October. Despite the waning effects of fiscal stimulus and rising COVID-19 cases, per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added 638,000 jobs, ahead of Bloomberg survey estimates calling for 580,000. The headline number was depressed by a 268,000 drop in government employment, including 147,000 temporary census workers. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell from 7.9% to 6.9% despite a rise in the labor force participation rate, a reversal of the dynamic we saw in September when unemployment fell while the labor force participation also declined.\n\n&gt; However, a troubling trend remains beneath the surface. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the number of long-term unemployed\u2014those out of work for 27 weeks or longer\u2014continues to rise as a share of the total unemployed:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11.6.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWhile the labor market has continued to show improvement, there are still many people out there who are having a hard time getting back to work,\u201d noted LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWith total jobs in the US around 10 million below pre-pandemic levels and rising COVID-19 cases, there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement despite the declining unemployment rate.\u201d\n\n&gt; COVID-19 cases in the United States have reached record highs with a weekly trend growth rate above 20%, according to the COVID Tracking Project. As the weather cools and more activity shifts indoors, additional restrictions to limit the spread of the virus could slow the fragile labor market recovery.\n\n&gt; In particular, much of the private sector gains in this month\u2019s jobs report were in the services sector, where previous jobs reports had shown strength in goods-oriented industries. Many countries in Europe have reinstated restrictions or even gone as far as implementing new lockdowns. While we don\u2019t expect lockdowns in the United States like we saw in March, restrictions on activity could limit future job gains.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One Sentiment Survey Soars While Another Sinks\n\n&gt; In an earlier post, we discussed how bullish sentiment in the AAII survey has been on the rise, but looking at another weekly sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence, the opposite is true. The percentage of respondents reporting as bullish fell sharply this week, 7 percentage points, down to 53.6%. While a majority are still optimistic and that reading is in the middle of its range, that was the largest weekly decline since a 7.4 percentage point decline to 41.7% in the first week of March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, the percentage of newsletter writers that are \"looking for a correction\" rose sharply to 25.8% this week following last week's over 5% decline for the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Correction.png))**\n\n&gt; The Investors Intelligence survey has a long history dating back to 1963, and in all weeks in that time, only 5% (174 weeks) have seen bullish sentiment fall 5 percentage points or more while the percentage of respondents looking for a correction has risen at least 5 percentage points in the same week. In the chart below, we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 following these past occurrences when there has not been another in the prior 3 months. The S&amp;P 500 has frequently been higher over the following weeks and months, but there is a slight underperformance relative to all periods since 1963 when the survey begins.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Performance.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2 Post-Election Charts You Need to See\n\n&gt; The election is over, but the questions are mounting. We don\u2019t know who will be the next president as of Wednesday morning, but we do know that stocks tend to do well the final two months of an election year. \u201cOnce the uncertainty is over, stocks tend to rally in November and December, with November the best month of the year during an election year,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOf course, 2020 isn\u2019t like any other year, and we still could be a ways away from who the winner will be.\u201d\n\n&gt; The LPL Chart of the Day shows that the S&amp;P 500 Index tends to do very well the final two months of the year, especially during election years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The modern design of the S&amp;P 500 stock index was first launched in 1957. Performance back to 1928 incorporates the performance of predecessor index, the S&amp;P 90\n\n&gt; One of the big takeaways so far from Tuesday night is that the Senate likely will stay Republican, meaning we may have a divided Congress. The chances of higher taxes and more regulation likely took a hit under this scenario. This could be a nice tailwind for stocks, as the S&amp;P 500 historically has done quite well under a divided Congress, up more than 17% on average. Additionally, in years with a divided Congress, stocks have been higher the past 10 times, with 2020 potentially being the 11th in a row.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-2-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; This election is far from over, so stay tuned to LPL Research as we continue to monitor things!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Emerging Markets Cheering a Potential Biden Win\n\n&gt; The US equity market has seen a massive rally in reaction to what is looking like a Biden victory over President Trump coupled with the Republican party maintianing its majority in the US Senate. None of these results are official at this point, so they are subject to change, but these are the most likely scenarios as of now. Outside of the US, emerging markets have also rallied. In just the last two days, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF (EEM) has rallied 5% and broken above resistance to new 52-week highs. If for no other reason then Biden's campaign slogan isn't America First, the rationale behind the rally makes some sense.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-Now.png))**\n\n&gt; The reaction of EEM in the aftermath of this election is very much different from what happened in 2016. Heading into the 2016 election, EEM had been trending higher, but pulled back in the days leading up to the election and broke its uptrend that had been in place since earlier in the year. Again, Trump's America First approach was understandably viewed as a headwind to emerging market equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-labels.png))**\n\n&gt; While the initial reaction of EEM to Trump's election was negative, that weakness didn't last long. The chart below shows the performance of EEM in the two months before and one year after the 2016 election. The gray box represents the same period shown in the chart above. Within days after breaking its uptrend after the 2016 election, EEM bounced back, rallied to its 50-DMA, tested its November low, and then in the early days of 2017 it was off to the races as EEM. In fact, even accounting for the post-Election Day declines, one year after the 2016 election, EEM was up 25% which was actually more than the 21% return for the S&amp;P 500! The moral of the story here is that first reactions aren't always the right reactions, and as an investor it's not just imperative to know the environment you are operating in, but also when the tides are turning.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-2017.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Winners and Losers During Trump's Presidency\n\n&gt; With Election Day upon us, below we take a look at the biggest winners and losers across financial markets during the Trump Presidency from Election Day 2016 through today. First off, below is a chart of the market cap of the Russell 3,000 since Election Day 2000 which George W. Bush eventually won. The Russell 3,000 makes up more than 98% of the total US equity market cap, so it's a good gauge to use for measuring the overall change in market cap levels. The current market cap of the Russell 1000 is just north of $35 trillion, which is up $11.5 trillion since Election Day 2016. President Obama oversaw US market cap growth of $12.3 trillion over his two terms, while President Bush actually saw market cap decline by $4.1 trillion after his two terms.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/mktcap.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a look at the total return of various asset classes since Election Day 2016 using key ETFs listed on US exchanges. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is up 70.6% since Trump was elected, while the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) more than doubled that at +144.3%. Of the broad index ETFs in the matrix, the Smallcap Value ETF (IJS) is up the least since Election Day 2016 at just +17.2%.\n\n&gt; Looking at US sector ETFs, the Energy sector (XLE) is a huge outlier with a decline of 48.3% since Trump was elected. Technology (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) are up the most with gains of 154% and 97%, respectively.\n\n&gt; Along with Energy stocks, the oil (USO) and natural gas (UNG) ETFs have been more than cut in half since 11/8/16, while gold (GLD) is up 47% and silver is up 29.5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/assetclass1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Not every country has seen stock market gains since Trump was elected. As shown below, Mexico (EWW) is down 28.5%, Brazil (EWZ) is down 19.4%, Spain (EWP) is down 6.8%, and the UK (EWU) is just slightly in the red.\n\n&gt; The US (SPY) is up more than any other country with a gain of 70.6%, while China (ASHR) is up the second most at +51%. Whatever happened with the trade war certainly didn't hurt the US and China versus the rest of the world on a relative basis.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/countryreturns1103.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/sectors1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Within the Russell 1,000 in its current form, there are nine stocks that are up 1,000% or more since Election Day 2016, with Enphase Energy (ENPH) at the top with a gain of 8,590%. Trade Desk (TTD) is up the second most at +2,448%, followed by Novocure (NVCR), SolarEdge Tech (SEDG), and Quidel (QDEL). Square (SQ) ranks sixth with a gain of 1,203%. Other notables on the list of big winners since Trump was elected include Etsy (ETSY), Teladoc (TDOC), Tesla (TSLA), NVIDIA (NVDA), Atlassian (TEAM), Boston Beer (SAM), and Lululemon (LULU).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-since-2016.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of market cap gains for individual stocks, the numbers below are quite eye-popping. Apple (AAPL) has gained the most in market cap since Trump was elected with an increase of $1.257 trillion! Amazingly, both Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have added more than $1 trillion in market cap as well. Prior to the last few years, no company was even close to having a $1 trillion market cap, but at this point, AAPL, AMZN, and MSFT have gained that much in the last four years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/capuse.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 6th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ5sT7SXYTk))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.8.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/gziesWx.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Yme9cXS.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/a6Kp4iF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XOR4bP6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TfDOPZJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/OsrCLIc.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/N7Ibl9s.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/y4tBaZw.png))\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wVnvQZH.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9PnmIUs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uoiA0Bw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",

        "selftext": "Obviously with Biden winning the election sustainability is on everyone\u2019s mind. Personally, I consider myself a green investor and already built up decent positions in companies like ENPH and RSG..\n\nHowever, the only analysis in terms of green stocks are those in green energy such as solar, wind, solar components, etc. Has anyone done their research on SAF (sustainable aviation fuels)? I work in private aviation and I\u2019ve noticed more and more growth in talk about development and use of SAF over the years. In fact, last year during the WEF there were (I believe) around 30 independent operators who traveled to and from the WEF utilizing SAF. Currently, it\u2019s not widely used due to the premium cost but large-scale manufacturers, like Gulfstream, already have several aircraft which can operate on either traditional Jet A or SAF (such as the G650).  \n\nI was checking out a Market Insider article from April which discussed that the SAF marker is expected to see CAGR of 56% from 2020-2024. This is a pretty consolidated market with only a few players. I was wondering if anyone is checking this out? I think it can be a HUGE investment opportunity given our increasing push for green initiatives and electric doesn\u2019t really work for jets. The article mentions HON, GEVO, NTOIY, and some others as notable companies in this space. I need to conduct further DD but wanted to get other people\u2019s thoughts?",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 9th, 2020.\n\n# **After sharp bounce, market may take a \u2018breather\u2019 on lingering election uncertainty, virus outbreak  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/06/after-sharp-bounce-market-may-take-a-breather-on-lingering-election-uncertainty-virus-outbreak.html)**\n*****\n&gt; After an initially exuberant election reaction, stocks may trade more cautiously in the week ahead, as investors watch election developments unfold and track the course of the coronavirus. \n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up more than 7.3% in the past week, at 3,509, and the Nasdaq rose 9%, the best weekly performance since April. Stocks slid Friday, but technology, communications services, health care and discretionary stocks had the biggest gains for the week, after it appeared Democrat Joe Biden could be the next president but with a split Congress.\n*****\n&gt; The election was still unresolved heading into the weekend, but even if Biden is declared winner, close votes and lawsuits are likely to result in recounts. The Senate appeared to be in Republican hands, but the margin of control is likely to be tight, and runoff elections are required for two Senate seats in Georgia in early January.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the uncertainty is going to catch up the market on a short-term basis,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, BNY Mellon\u2019s Wealth Management chief investment officer. \u201cPerhaps next week could be a drifting lower kind of week.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ahead of the election, the market had been betting on a \u201cblue wave,\u201d where Biden would take the White House and Democrats would get control of the Senate, giving them total control of Congress. But when it appeared the Senate would stay in Republican hands, stocks surged on the idea of gridlock, which would keep Biden from implementing tax increases and lots of new regulations.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, there has been a surge in daily new coronavirus cases to more than 122,000. Economists are concerned that the economic recovery could suffer as some states could restrict activities and consumers may pull back heading into the important holiday season.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed, in its post-meeting statement Thursday, repeated that the course of the virus could help determine the path of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; There are a few economic reports in the week ahead, including consumer price index inflation data Thursday and the producer price index Friday. More than a dozen Fed officials are on the speaking circuit, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who speaks Thursday on central banking at a European Central Bank forum.\n*****\n&gt; The earnings season is beginning to slow down, but there are still dozens of reports, including from McDonald\u2019s on Monday and Walt Disney, Applied Materials and Cisco on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is just setting up to be a breather. There\u2019s still a lot to figure out here,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cThe equity market\u2019s reaction has been I think understandable and probably better than many might have expected.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said there may be uncertainty for awhile. \u201cWhat I\u2019m thinking about is the Senate races. Part of the market reaction has been relying on this divided government.\u201d After the votes are all in or recounted, \u201ca sweep is unlikely but possible.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the longer this stays uncertain and messy, the more the post-election bounce comes into question,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Different than 2000\n&gt; It would not be unusual for the stock market to sell off before rallying into year end, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall does not expect the type of turbulence there was in 2000, when former Vice President Al Gore lost to George W. Bush in a tight race that ultimately went to the Supreme Court.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn 2000, they were not expecting hanging chads. But they do expect a contested election this time. I think in many ways the market anticipated this,\u201d said Stovall.\n*****\n&gt; But the market, after its election week surge, could pull back. \u201cHistorically, the market goes down in the month of November, after a Democratic victory,\u201d said Stovall. Since World War II, Democrats won the White House nine times, and the market fell an average of 0.5% in November in those years, compared to the average gain for all Novembers of 1.4%, he said.\n*****\n&gt; After those Democratic victories, stocks then rose 1.9% in December on average, more than the normal 1.5% gain for all Decembers.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said they currently do not expect the kind of lockdowns that states ordered when the pandemic started to spread in March. But there could still be some impact that could be negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said he sees some signs of optimism for the market. Strong data, like third quarter GDP, October\u2019s drop in unemployment to 6.9%, and the better-than-expected earnings are all positives for the market. Another is that investors are so skeptical.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat does still exist is a great deal of dry powder. There\u2019s $4.3 trillion in money markets alone,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you, being in touch with investors of all shapes and sizes this week, there\u2019s still a lot of skepticism. From a contrarian view, high cash and a lot of skepticism is a contrarian indicator.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/WUlRQfd.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/FWN82Hs.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ZnTzBNz.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/g52vqsv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OiPuXi8.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lA86Kou.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xmtVSEB.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RRxlWej.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Piu5auo.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/W80POso.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eGUQXgr.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yoHWfIC.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hQyweyw.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Presidential Election Anticipation Is Keeping Us Waiting\n\n&gt; While we all anxiously await the final count and outcome of the U.S. Presidential Election, here are some possible scenarios for 2021. Our analysis here is based on historical market performance during the most likely political alignments for next year. We ran these likely scenarios through the Almanac database software to create this graph.\n\n&gt; We are either going to have the fifth year of a two-term republican president or a first year of a new democratic presidency. It appears the democrats will hold the house and the republicans will hold the senate, but that is not a forgone conclusion either. So we also examined both presidential outcomes with a democratic, republican and split congress.\n\n&gt; Our study uses the S&amp;P 500 from 1949 to 2017. We start in 1949 because it is the first full 4-Year Presidential Stock Market Cycle since the end of WWII. The Twenty-Second Amendment that implemented presidential term limits for a max of two terms or eight years was ratified on February 27, 1951. Truman in 1949 was excluded as there was a no change of party in the White House. We gave Bush 41 the same treatment.\n\n&gt; Admittedly, there are limited data points; four each of fifth year republicans and first year democrats. Here\u2019s what we found. A change in party with a new, first year democratic president came with democratic control of Congress and significantly higher performance for the S&amp;P 500, averaging 10.6% with a median gain of 15.1% versus 7.0% for the average post-election year since 1949.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a89421df75f426e1b1ff90cb2c29cb90/b63e1cf962f89fdb-a3/s400x600/f9bde99a9e4ba83b0df266a8d3cc04cd732cc58f.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Fifth year republican presidents in 1957 (Eisenhower) and 1973 (Nixon) had to work with democratically controlled Congresses and the market suffered significant losses. The market did well in Reagan\u2019s fifth year with a split Congress \u2013 a testament to how \u201cThe Great Communicator\u201d was able to work across the aisle with then Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill. Even with republican control of Congress under Bush 43\u2019s fifth year, the market had a tough year with ongoing issues in Iraq, North Korea declaring it\u2019s a nuclear power and the most active and second costliest hurricane season on record.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Job Growth Continues as COVID-19 Cases Rise\n\n&gt; The US labor market shrugged off election uncertainty and continued to add jobs in October. Despite the waning effects of fiscal stimulus and rising COVID-19 cases, per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added 638,000 jobs, ahead of Bloomberg survey estimates calling for 580,000. The headline number was depressed by a 268,000 drop in government employment, including 147,000 temporary census workers. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell from 7.9% to 6.9% despite a rise in the labor force participation rate, a reversal of the dynamic we saw in September when unemployment fell while the labor force participation also declined.\n\n&gt; However, a troubling trend remains beneath the surface. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the number of long-term unemployed\u2014those out of work for 27 weeks or longer\u2014continues to rise as a share of the total unemployed:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11.6.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWhile the labor market has continued to show improvement, there are still many people out there who are having a hard time getting back to work,\u201d noted LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWith total jobs in the US around 10 million below pre-pandemic levels and rising COVID-19 cases, there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement despite the declining unemployment rate.\u201d\n\n&gt; COVID-19 cases in the United States have reached record highs with a weekly trend growth rate above 20%, according to the COVID Tracking Project. As the weather cools and more activity shifts indoors, additional restrictions to limit the spread of the virus could slow the fragile labor market recovery.\n\n&gt; In particular, much of the private sector gains in this month\u2019s jobs report were in the services sector, where previous jobs reports had shown strength in goods-oriented industries. Many countries in Europe have reinstated restrictions or even gone as far as implementing new lockdowns. While we don\u2019t expect lockdowns in the United States like we saw in March, restrictions on activity could limit future job gains.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One Sentiment Survey Soars While Another Sinks\n\n&gt; In an earlier post, we discussed how bullish sentiment in the AAII survey has been on the rise, but looking at another weekly sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence, the opposite is true. The percentage of respondents reporting as bullish fell sharply this week, 7 percentage points, down to 53.6%. While a majority are still optimistic and that reading is in the middle of its range, that was the largest weekly decline since a 7.4 percentage point decline to 41.7% in the first week of March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, the percentage of newsletter writers that are \"looking for a correction\" rose sharply to 25.8% this week following last week's over 5% decline for the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Correction.png))**\n\n&gt; The Investors Intelligence survey has a long history dating back to 1963, and in all weeks in that time, only 5% (174 weeks) have seen bullish sentiment fall 5 percentage points or more while the percentage of respondents looking for a correction has risen at least 5 percentage points in the same week. In the chart below, we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 following these past occurrences when there has not been another in the prior 3 months. The S&amp;P 500 has frequently been higher over the following weeks and months, but there is a slight underperformance relative to all periods since 1963 when the survey begins.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Performance.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2 Post-Election Charts You Need to See\n\n&gt; The election is over, but the questions are mounting. We don\u2019t know who will be the next president as of Wednesday morning, but we do know that stocks tend to do well the final two months of an election year. \u201cOnce the uncertainty is over, stocks tend to rally in November and December, with November the best month of the year during an election year,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOf course, 2020 isn\u2019t like any other year, and we still could be a ways away from who the winner will be.\u201d\n\n&gt; The LPL Chart of the Day shows that the S&amp;P 500 Index tends to do very well the final two months of the year, especially during election years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The modern design of the S&amp;P 500 stock index was first launched in 1957. Performance back to 1928 incorporates the performance of predecessor index, the S&amp;P 90\n\n&gt; One of the big takeaways so far from Tuesday night is that the Senate likely will stay Republican, meaning we may have a divided Congress. The chances of higher taxes and more regulation likely took a hit under this scenario. This could be a nice tailwind for stocks, as the S&amp;P 500 historically has done quite well under a divided Congress, up more than 17% on average. Additionally, in years with a divided Congress, stocks have been higher the past 10 times, with 2020 potentially being the 11th in a row.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-2-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; This election is far from over, so stay tuned to LPL Research as we continue to monitor things!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Emerging Markets Cheering a Potential Biden Win\n\n&gt; The US equity market has seen a massive rally in reaction to what is looking like a Biden victory over President Trump coupled with the Republican party maintianing its majority in the US Senate. None of these results are official at this point, so they are subject to change, but these are the most likely scenarios as of now. Outside of the US, emerging markets have also rallied. In just the last two days, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF (EEM) has rallied 5% and broken above resistance to new 52-week highs. If for no other reason then Biden's campaign slogan isn't America First, the rationale behind the rally makes some sense.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-Now.png))**\n\n&gt; The reaction of EEM in the aftermath of this election is very much different from what happened in 2016. Heading into the 2016 election, EEM had been trending higher, but pulled back in the days leading up to the election and broke its uptrend that had been in place since earlier in the year. Again, Trump's America First approach was understandably viewed as a headwind to emerging market equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-labels.png))**\n\n&gt; While the initial reaction of EEM to Trump's election was negative, that weakness didn't last long. The chart below shows the performance of EEM in the two months before and one year after the 2016 election. The gray box represents the same period shown in the chart above. Within days after breaking its uptrend after the 2016 election, EEM bounced back, rallied to its 50-DMA, tested its November low, and then in the early days of 2017 it was off to the races as EEM. In fact, even accounting for the post-Election Day declines, one year after the 2016 election, EEM was up 25% which was actually more than the 21% return for the S&amp;P 500! The moral of the story here is that first reactions aren't always the right reactions, and as an investor it's not just imperative to know the environment you are operating in, but also when the tides are turning.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-2017.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Winners and Losers During Trump's Presidency\n\n&gt; With Election Day upon us, below we take a look at the biggest winners and losers across financial markets during the Trump Presidency from Election Day 2016 through today. First off, below is a chart of the market cap of the Russell 3,000 since Election Day 2000 which George W. Bush eventually won. The Russell 3,000 makes up more than 98% of the total US equity market cap, so it's a good gauge to use for measuring the overall change in market cap levels. The current market cap of the Russell 1000 is just north of $35 trillion, which is up $11.5 trillion since Election Day 2016. President Obama oversaw US market cap growth of $12.3 trillion over his two terms, while President Bush actually saw market cap decline by $4.1 trillion after his two terms.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/mktcap.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a look at the total return of various asset classes since Election Day 2016 using key ETFs listed on US exchanges. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is up 70.6% since Trump was elected, while the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) more than doubled that at +144.3%. Of the broad index ETFs in the matrix, the Smallcap Value ETF (IJS) is up the least since Election Day 2016 at just +17.2%.\n\n&gt; Looking at US sector ETFs, the Energy sector (XLE) is a huge outlier with a decline of 48.3% since Trump was elected. Technology (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) are up the most with gains of 154% and 97%, respectively.\n\n&gt; Along with Energy stocks, the oil (USO) and natural gas (UNG) ETFs have been more than cut in half since 11/8/16, while gold (GLD) is up 47% and silver is up 29.5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/assetclass1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Not every country has seen stock market gains since Trump was elected. As shown below, Mexico (EWW) is down 28.5%, Brazil (EWZ) is down 19.4%, Spain (EWP) is down 6.8%, and the UK (EWU) is just slightly in the red.\n\n&gt; The US (SPY) is up more than any other country with a gain of 70.6%, while China (ASHR) is up the second most at +51%. Whatever happened with the trade war certainly didn't hurt the US and China versus the rest of the world on a relative basis.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/countryreturns1103.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/sectors1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Within the Russell 1,000 in its current form, there are nine stocks that are up 1,000% or more since Election Day 2016, with Enphase Energy (ENPH) at the top with a gain of 8,590%. Trade Desk (TTD) is up the second most at +2,448%, followed by Novocure (NVCR), SolarEdge Tech (SEDG), and Quidel (QDEL). Square (SQ) ranks sixth with a gain of 1,203%. Other notables on the list of big winners since Trump was elected include Etsy (ETSY), Teladoc (TDOC), Tesla (TSLA), NVIDIA (NVDA), Atlassian (TEAM), Boston Beer (SAM), and Lululemon (LULU).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-since-2016.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of market cap gains for individual stocks, the numbers below are quite eye-popping. Apple (AAPL) has gained the most in market cap since Trump was elected with an increase of $1.257 trillion! Amazingly, both Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have added more than $1 trillion in market cap as well. Prior to the last few years, no company was even close to having a $1 trillion market cap, but at this point, AAPL, AMZN, and MSFT have gained that much in the last four years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/capuse.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 6th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ5sT7SXYTk))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.8.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$PLUG** \n&gt; * **$WKHS** \n&gt; * **$CGC** \n&gt; * **$DKNG** \n&gt; * **$BYND** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$ACB** \n&gt; * **$RKT** \n&gt; * **$SPG** \n&gt; * **$JMIA** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$TLRY** \n&gt; * **$NKLA** \n&gt; * **$DDOG** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$DHI** \n&gt; * **$WIX** \n&gt; * **$CARS** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$DIS** \n&gt; * **$INO** \n&gt; * **$GRWG** \n&gt; * **$NLS** \n&gt; * **$AAP** \n&gt; * **$DOYU** \n&gt; * **$RNG** \n&gt; * **$PRTS** \n&gt; * **$NBEV** \n&gt; * **$LMND** \n&gt; * **$TGNA** \n&gt; * **$WVE** \n&gt; * **$EXPI** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$ICPT** \n&gt; * **$HUYA** \n&gt; * **$GOGO** \n&gt; * **$NCLH** \n&gt; * **$OXY** \n&gt; * **$PEIX** \n&gt; * **$CYBR**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Piu5auo.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MDVAWXO.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Yme9cXS.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/a6Kp4iF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XOR4bP6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TfDOPZJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/OsrCLIc.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/N7Ibl9s.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/y4tBaZw.png))\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wVnvQZH.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9PnmIUs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uoiA0Bw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Plug Power, Inc. $18.86\n**Plug Power, Inc.
