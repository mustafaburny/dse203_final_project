        "selftext": "bla bla apes bla bla stupid idiots bla bla not financial advice bla bla intro meme\n\nReal talk, I'd like to reintroduce you to the deep value gaming market stock the world seems to have forgot about.\n\nI've been bleeding out on FDs in sideways trading hell on this for too many months and its about time everybody opens their eyes to this play...and reap the inevitable rewards.\n\nIn the shadow of the $AMC mega-gains, you might overlook $CRSR's respectable 7% lift this week.  But this movement is actually the sign of a fuse thats just been lit.I shouldn't have to give most of you too much introduction on the company itself. Corsair was founded in 1994, and has since become one of the global leaders in PC gaming hardware and peripherals.  The company IPO'd last September at \\~$15 and made a heroic run up to almost $51 before retreating into a seemingly never-ending sideways cycle. The company has a proven track record in an exploding industry.\n\n# Rockstar Fundamentals\n\nWhether you care about the F-word or not, Corsair has been an incredible buy opportunity. Even before the pandemic their revenues and profits were growing.\n\nCRSR is on track to exceed $2bln revenue this year, more than doubling 2019 sales.  Profitability margins have been increasing every year since IPO\n\nThey have plenty of cash in the tank, and have been paying down debts. Its held 5% by Insiders, and a whopping 77% by institutional investors.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6tc7coxn3371.png?width=836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26e7364054a60f1b492cfcbd2b1fb672c1a77ab6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8wfy4lwyn3371.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b9bbdf6f4a9971648fa7799d8bcf1b2680e1828\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe company isn't a one-trick pony. Aside from dominating some hardware sectors like Memory, Corsair has been making strategic acquisitions in the streaming space (most notably scooping up Elgato.)\n\nBy all accounts, Corsair is making all the right moves and is currently firmly in undervalued territory.\n\n# Months of sideways strangulation by FUD-bears and Shorts.\n\n$CRSR investors have endured many months of maddening sideways trading. For the first few months it seemed like it was trading with the market...and that investors were just waiting to see what happened with some upcoming news.\n\nBut after releasing good news after good news, the stock has continued to stagnate, and bounce around in completely unnatural intraday boom/bust cycles. Almost on queue swinging -2% to +2% to -2%  every day.\n\nThe reason for this is due to a mix of a very **low float and ridiculously low volume.** These two factors have allowed swing traders and institutional short sellers to play this stock like a fiddle.\n\nCRSR has just **92 M** shares outstanding, and  **26.51M** shares in the float\\*\\*.\\*\\* Most of the shares are held by institutions.\n\nShort interest has been hovering around 20%. Which is high on its own...but doesn't tell the full story. Big pocket institutions have been selling tens of thousands of shares short in the AM, then covering intraday.\n\nWith the low volume, it doesn't take much to push the price down substantially without much ammo.\n\nThe big boys have been writing calls / buying puts, and then using shorts and their own holdings to push  the price down before exercise.\n\nMeanwhile, bears have been spreading FUD throughout the investment world about CRSR on 3 primary points. None of which have actually come to fruition.\n\n1. **CRSR is a \"Pandemic Play\", and gaming will magically disappear after things return to normal.**   This is the biggest boomer bs. The pc gaming and esports industries have been absolutely exploding over the last few years. Not to mention the streaming space which has been growing independently of it.  CRSR sales are cyclical like every retail company, but Q1 sales showed no signs of slowing.   Gaming is not going anywhere.\n2. **THE SPOOOOKY Lockup period will cause millions of shares to flood the market.** There was tons of FUD spreading about 14 million IPO shares that would become unrestricted for sale back in March. People were convinced that these shares would flood the market instantly and tank the price.  But the lockup period came and went, almost no shares were actually sold.\n3. **The global supply chain shortages means CRSR will not be able to grow.**  True, the microchip shortage is a threat to CRSR, but its also a threat to every other company in that space. What they've announced in their reports is that they had MORE DEMAND THAN THEY COULD FULFILL. That is not a bearish signal.  Despite the supply chain woes, CRSR sales dramatically beat expectations...showing they adapted and overcame this issue.\n\nYou may also be interested that the latest to join the short party is our good friends at Shita-del, making a short play at the end of May.\n\n# The 59% Earning Beat everybody ignored\n\nWhile some were expecting lackluster Q1 21 results as the pandemic wanes and supply chain issues rage on, in the May 2021 earnings release CRSR subverted all expectations. They beat estimates by an incredible 59%.  If anybody needed proof positive CRSR could weather the FUD, this was it.\n\nBut despite the stellar report, the stock actually DROPPED on the earnings report, and never recovered.\n\nYou might be saying \"of course the stock dropped, every tech stock drops on earnings\". Yes, this is true, IF there is a runup in the share price before the announcement. But in this case, there was no runup...the stock had been stagnant and even declining before the announcement.\n\nThis is when every retail CRSR holder knew this stock was not making natural movements, it was being intentionally held down.\n\nBy every logical account, the stock should have lifted in the weeks following the Q1 results. And because it didn't, the market has been ignoring CRSR due to the very effective FUD campaigns and short seller.\n\nBut this also means that the stock has entered deep into undervalued territory.\n\n# LOW FLOAT VOLUME ROCKET\n\nGiven all the drama, why should you be looking at this stock? Because the same factors that bears have been using to hold this stock down are exactly what will cause it to take off.\n\n**ALL $CRSR NEEDS TO BLOW IS A LITTLE MORE VOLUME**\n\nThe big bears have written calls and puts stacked around the $30-$35 strikes out through the EOY  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t0ujqgdnn3371.png?width=973&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a506a07911ed26f5cbef6624b56a4717068089c\n\nAs soon as there is enough positive momentum on this thing from retail, the bearish trading strategies will become ineffective. They will lose a ton of money.\n\n# Breaking Out\n\nCRSR just hit $35/shr today for the first time since early March. This might not seem like much, but its the spark we needed.\n\nI will reiterate, all this stock needs to pop is slightly more positive volume. This stock is poised to blow up fast and hard.  The float is too small, the short-selling tactics will not work when this thing makes a run.\n\nAt the moment it can be moved with only about 50k shares volume... if the volume increases even by 10% or so, its going to run.\n\nAs CRSR continues its exceptional performance, it's only a matter of time before it breaks free from the cycle, and it looks like it will happen sooner than later. When it does happen....the shorts will crumble.\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR\\*\\* A few thousand more people buy $CRSR the rocket gonna go Pop  \n\n\nPositions:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xse2n6qpn3371.png?width=1586&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79d9b5cbecbaf98a53fec3d4c57b9b247275f77e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0c9jf3qtn3371.png?width=724&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=696b50a0218adbddccd0b86aaf11aa2a79220236",
