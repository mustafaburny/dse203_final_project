        "selftext": "Ok so ive been posting about this since it was at .77 cad (FLT). The potential for this company is endless and let me explain why.\n\nThey plan to seize the drone delivery market before there is a market.\n\n Most companies are trying to deliver to peoples doors. While that is amazing, the problems with doing so are exponential. Luckily this IS NOT the market they are after.\n\nThey want to deliver from businesses and warehouses to other businesses and warehouses. Good for companies like Fedex. Who need to transfer large amounts of packages from hub to hub.\n\nThey also plan on having automated refueling/recharging stations, which once applied, would create the first sort of sky railway.\n\nThink of it like CNR (canadian national railway) but for their drones. Once CNR had their railway setup, who could compete with them? Once Drone Delivery Canada has all their delivery routes setup, recharging/fueling stations setup. Who could compete with them? \n\n Sure you got drones like ALPP that last long in the air supposedly, DDC has drones that recharge themselves. Theres no limit to their distance.",

Meanwhile, startups in the sector are nearly all worth less than $1 billion today (source 7 \u2013 claims $TAKOF has multi-bagger also discusses $TAKOF cash position).\n\n***\n\n**Stock Symbol**\n\n* **TAKOFF** on American Exchanges\n\n* **FLT** on TSX for Canadians\n\n* Current Closing price: **$2.38**\n\n* One Month Low: **$0.98**\n\n[Drone Package Delivery Growth Chart](https://preview.redd.it/at9xb9uf6cf61.jpg?width=945&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebb0a0b32b6dba11ac4e1c7ccfd7060ef2ff95c5)\n\n\n[Share Price vs Stock Value](https://preview.redd.it/7x3wjcli6cf61.jpg?width=889&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cf6c56227c8ff6e06d05049e4048ad3233162cf)\n\n\n\nGiven the market right now, I wouldn't be surprised seeing this stock reach $10 or more. I'm holding until we get the big bag potential. Remember, this is not financial advise and I am literally a retard.",

It focuses on designing, developing and implementing a commercially viable drone delivery system within Canada.\n\n\n***\n\nI've been riding this stock ever since I bought it a few months ago at 60 cents, it's at $2.50 today and only going further up. These guys are the leaders of drone delivery in North America. As we progress more in the future, drone delivery is going to be more of a viable thing. As of right now it's mainly delivering goods to first nations, cargo ships and other places that are hard to reach. But in the futre, **as soon** as Amazon even glances at the company it will rocket.\n\nI'm almost certain a big company like Amazon will pick them up and once that happens, it's going to explode.\n\n\n***\n\n**Market Cap\t526.66M**\n\n**Volume\t3,807,997**\n\n[Quote Data](https://www.baystreet.ca/quotedata/FLT-CA/detailedquotetabchartnews/)\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: The US ticker for this stock is TAKOF",

Accordingly to ArkInvest and many others the drone industry is going to boom in the next few years.\n\nThe chart looks really promissing. You guys might like the fact that the short interest is really high right now.

I am not going to make this post a long one, rather I will just list things good about this company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* As I mentioned earlier drone industry is hot atm, look at UAVS, ALPP or BANT\n* As part of the Company's technology roadmap, it plans to integrate various aspects of AI into its solution, including the use of AI in leveraging.\n* Relaxed regulations for drone parcel delivery to take effect in March!\n* The Company has created one of the healthiest balance sheets I've seen in a long time\n* Included in 'OTC Markets Group Announces the 2021 OTCQX Best 50' awards.\n* Currently trading around $1.1\n* Todays volume has been a record.\n* $0 DEBT!\n* $20 million dollars in the bank.\n* WSS has a price target of $6.5\n* Undervalued 77%!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe list really goes on and on I will list all the refs for relevant info for you to look at, but one of the major news recently is that:\n\n* **The Company is in discussions with various Federal and Provincial Government agencies and Canadian logistics providers and is hopeful to commercially participate with its advanced, patented drone delivery as the vaccine distribution plans start to roll out across Canada, and potentially internationally.**\n\nI personally think this is HUGE!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCONS:\n\n* Earnings have declined by 39.6% per year over past 5 years.\n* Makes less than USD$1m in revenue (CA$63K).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'Whilst it's great to see that Drone Delivery Canada has already begun generating revenue from operations, last year it only produced CA$63k, so we don't think it is generating significant revenue, at this point. Therefore, for the purposes of this analysis we'll focus on how the cash burn is tracking. While it hardly paints a picture of imminent growth, the fact that it has reduced its cash burn by 40% over the last year suggests some degree of prudence. Clearly, however, the crucial factor is whether the company will grow its business going forward.  As you can probably tell by now, we're not too worried about Drone Delivery Canada's cash burn. In particular, we think its cash burn relative to its market cap stands out as evidence that the company is well on top of its spending'\n\nFURTHER READING:\n\n[`https://dronedeliverycanada.com/resources/drone-delivery-canada-announces-update-on-healthcare-projects/`](https://dronedeliverycanada.com/resources/drone-delivery-canada-announces-update-on-healthcare-projects/)\n\n[`https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/drone-delivery-canada-announces-plans-to-integrate-ai-into-its-disruptive-drone-solution-827603518.html`](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/drone-delivery-canada-announces-plans-to-integrate-ai-into-its-disruptive-drone-solution-827603518.html)\n\n[`https://www.dcvelocity.com/articles/49423-relaxed-regulations-for-drone-parcel-delivery-to-take-effect-in-march?fbclid=IwAR0aEJOKWk-odTpPnP4AoaJFPI30JO2PIlA52-0QBJMoueqf7i5oERq4L7E`](https://www.dcvelocity.com/articles/49423-relaxed-regulations-for-drone-parcel-delivery-to-take-effect-in-march?fbclid=IwAR0aEJOKWk-odTpPnP4AoaJFPI30JO2PIlA52-0QBJMoueqf7i5oERq4L7E)\n\n[`https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/otc-markets-group-announces-the-2021-otcqx-best-50-301216697.html`](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/otc-markets-group-announces-the-2021-otcqx-best-50-301216697.html)\n\n[`https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/capital-goods/tsxv-flt/drone-delivery-canada-shares/news/companies-like-drone-delivery-canada-cveflt-are-in-a-positio`](https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/capital-goods/tsxv-flt/drone-delivery-canada-shares/news/companies-like-drone-delivery-canada-cveflt-are-in-a-positio)\n\n[`https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/TAKOF/news?id=288476`](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/TAKOF/news?id=288476)\n\n[`https://www.wsj.com/articles/update-emerging-markets-report-flying-south-for-more-revenue-01612282776?tesla=y`](https://www.wsj.com/articles/update-emerging-markets-report-flying-south-for-more-revenue-01612282776?tesla=y)",

        "selftext": "$FLT is finally in the middle of a nice break out! This stock could easily crack 3$ by the end of 2021 (almost broke 2CAD$ today). This is a very risky industry with a couple different players in it, but Drone Delivery Canada has already received government approval in Canada, is debt free and has drones with payloads up to 1000lbs with buyers waiting for testing to end. The potential on this over the next 10 years could be massive. Could this be the next industry to take off like Tesla and electric cars did?\n\nFull disclosure I own 10k shares in this company (bought this summer for 0.50)",

        "selftext": "(TSXV: FLT) (OTC: TAKOF) (Frankfurt: A2AMGZ or ABB.F), a publicly traded, disruptive, pioneering, technology company focused on designing, developing and implementing commercially viable, drone-based logistics systems for government, commercial, industrial &amp; retail customers globally.\n\nThe Company has created one of the healthiest balance sheets we\u2019ve seen in a long time, through innovation and execution, building a compelling drone business in Canada with a model that could really fly most anywhere.\n\nWhich makes a January 26, 2021 press release by Drone Delivery a very interesting piece of information. The Company was praising recent changes by the United States\u2019 Federal Aviation Authority, which ushered in sweeping new permissions for commercial drone activity.\n\nDrone Delivery\u2019s CEO, Steve Bogie, views the changes as most favorable, stating in part that \u201cIn January 2021, the FAA added new rules to 14 CFR Part 107 to permit the expansion of routine flights and created four categories of UAS for flights over suburban/urban areas assuming certain, specific criteria are met. These new rules greatly improve the regulatory certainty for UAS delivery operations in the United States and represent a significant step forward toward UAS integration into the US airspace.  This FAA report further enables DDC on its path to US operations and the requirements needed. As a global leader in the drone delivery industry, DDC has been anticipating these new regulations and we are well positioned to fully capitalize on them.\"\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack there.\n\nFirst, it appears the FAA has significantly expanded the capabilities for drone operators to deliver in vast areas that had been previously prohibited. This would seem requisite to eventual widespread drone delivery routes. This also appears to be the trend with regulators globally, as the drone industry gains momentum, incrementally fueled by new pandemic applications.\n\nSecondly, in July 2020, the company announced that they had started the process to enter the vast US market, ripe for industrial, commercial and residential drone deliveries. And it doesn\u2019t take an analyst to recognize the much larger market opportunity in the massive United States.\n\nIf the Company finds itself able to enter the United States and set up operations here, the Drone Delivery story could soon find itself flying south for revenue, in addition to their current domestic sources.  The company also announced Letters of Intent in 2020 for the Africa and India markets \u2013 both very large markets rapidly starting to embrace drone technology.",

        "selftext": "TOday I did research to calm myself down after pounding a redbull and getting triggered by all the misinformation and greedy nitwits that have flooded this site looking for a quick flip.\n\nImagine you\u2019re John Chen. Sauntering down the hallway, with your 50 pound dick grazing the velveteen carpet with each step. You hear the guttural screams coming out of sales. You walk by the engineers, and gaze upon the latest widget as they kowtow before your bespecled grandeur. You hear about the customers who sing your praises, and the (much fewer) ones who tell you your product sucks donkey balls... But we (the retards @ WSB or frankly the dubmasses @ seeking alpha and even JP Morgan equity coverage) don\u2019t know the details any of this, only dry ass reports that come out every quarter.\n\nSo, other than hacking into John\u2019s brain (not recommended), what can we do? We can suckle at the teat of Twitter announcements, and sometimes that\u2019s fun but usually it\u2019s PR driven (unless it comes from Papa Chen\u2019s account in which case suckle away).\n\nBut boy oh boy wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could know the things P. Chiddy does. What new things are in development. Big new sales in the pipeline. Whether the company is hiring (or shrinking), and in what areas\u2026.Wait. For the last thing we actually can!\n\nthanks to the grotesquely fat (and very rich, no offense Gabe) founder of a soul-crushing professional network called LinkedIn. Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So let\u2019s see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?\n\nTo start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If you\u2019re a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If you\u2019re growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they don\u2019t think they need, and last time I checked $BB\u2019s CFO wasn\u2019t completely retarded. Now, it\u2019s important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c they\u2019re growing, duh) and vice versa.\n\nFANG isn\u2019t a perfect comp (I\u2019ll get to the others in a sec), but **serves as a good proxy of a \u201cbaseline growthy\u201d tech.** No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking. See below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1g1ubpfxize61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58d58b12644e9688e15e35e907386b910b9d938d\n\n# IMPLICATION NUMBER #1 - $$BB COMPARES FAVORABLY TO FANG IN TERMS OF HEADCOUNT-IMPLIED GROWTH. IF YOU SAID \u201c$BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG\u201d, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOU\u2019D BE RIGHT!!\n\n\u201cBut wait,\u201d you say. \u201cgrowthinvestor123 you fucking idiot, [didn\u2019t you just compare $BB to CRWD, ZS, SAIL, and PANW](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/) to justify a **$60 / share** price target for $BB? I want to see the ratios for those.\u201d Ok you, got me. See below, headcount-implied growth is higher for endpoint security comparables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eaz3begzize61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d01221903b3c50a6838710f32daa173035eb9e92\n\n\u201cHah,\u201d you say smugly. \u201cThose other endpoint security businesses blow $BB out of the water, $BB sucks\u201d.\n\nNo, you fucking idiot. If a simple headcount ratio without context was all it took I\u2019d be rich instead of handsome like mommy tells me.\n\n$BB went through [**round**](https://channeldailynews.com/news/layoffs-hit-blackberry-in-waterloo/28015) after [**round**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=blackberry+layoffs&amp;atb=v224-1&amp;ia=web&amp;iai=r1-3&amp;page=1&amp;sexp=%7B%22cdrexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22artexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prodexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prdsdexp%22%3A%22c%22%2C%22biaexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22msvrtexp%22%3A%22b%22%7D) of painful layoffs as it shifted from being a handset business to what it is today. Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a **history**, and that is a blessing and a curse.\n\n**Remember**, Daddy chen\u2019s primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other??? And these smart monkes who were retained \u2013 Well, no need to make a job posting for that role anymore, right?\n\n# IMPLICATION #2 \u2013 BLACKBERRY HAD &gt; 20K EMPLOYEES. UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS. HAVING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES QUICKLY LIKE CERTAIN COMPETITORS\n\nThis brings me to the final part of our headcount analysis. Let\u2019s look at those endpoint security comparables again. Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Let\u2019s look at two two non-retard quotes \u2013\n\n***\"I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company.\" Steve Jobs***\n\n***\u201cIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it\u2019s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.\u201d Peter Thiel***\n\nI was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BB\u2019s Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales. See below\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6nog6m62jze61.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb26266cbef428abb3152f1b9077c1a0daee07b0\n\nEven as a $BB bull, I didn\u2019t expect the discrepancy to be so large.\n\n# IMPLICATION #3 \u2013 BLACKBERRY ACTUALLY IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING / IT FOCUSED COMPANY RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS. IN MANY WAYS IT IS MORE OF A \u201cSTART-UP\u201d. EVEN WITH FINANCIAL PRESSURE, JOHNNY CHEN RETAINED TECHNICAL TALENT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE, AND VALUATION ???\n\n**TLDR: BB IS NOT A ROCKET SHIP. IT IS A LONG RANGE SHUTTLE, CAPABLE OF BURSTS OF SPEED, PACKED TO THE GILLS WITH RETARDS AND TERRAFORMING EQUIPMENT AND HEADING TO MARS.**\n\n Add'l edit for those who can't read good - \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 ",

        "selftext": "This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or \"counterfeit\" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.\n\nMuch of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.\n\nOne thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**Methodology**\n\nI'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that\n\n1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.\n2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.\n3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date\n\nHowever, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.\n\n**The Code**\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    import time\n    import requests\n    POLYGON_API_KEY = '&lt;ADD YOUR API KEY HERE&gt;'\n    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&amp;apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY\n    \n    data\n    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))\n    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n    for line in f:\n        parts = line.split('|');\n        date = parts[0]\n        ticker = parts[2]\n        try:\n            fails = int(parts[3])\n            price = float(parts[5])\n            value_of_fails = price * fails\n            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)\n        except ValueError:\n            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')\n            pass\n    \n    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():\n        day = int(date[-2:])\n        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))\n        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])\n        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] &gt; 10000000, sorted_stocks)\n        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:\n            val_of_fails = data[0]\n            num_fails = data[1]\n            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))\n            res = req.json()\n            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':\n                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))\n                continue\n            else:\n                try:\n                    volume = res['volume']\n                except KeyError:\n                    print(res)\n            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)\n            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100\n            print('{: &lt;6} ${: &lt;5} {: &lt;9} / {: &lt; 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))\n\nHere's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you

        "selftext": "Bullish on FEYE over next few quarters. To me it\u2019s unclear how the recent SolarWinds hack will impact Q4 earnings due to the timing of the hack. On a recent conf call Mandia mentioned that Incident Response hours aren\u2019t billed until after the incident response engagement is over. The SolarWinds news broke on Sunday Dec 13th.  Response engagements of this scale typically take weeks if not months. So we might be looking at meeting Q4 estimates but raising Q1 guidance.  Even without a beat, I\u2019ll take this as a bullish sign. \n\nI\u2019ve been watching job openings at FireEye for the last month.  They\u2019ve been recruiting non-stop and a large portion of these at Incident Response or other services consultants. There are currently 192 open roles.  \n\nBack of the napkin calculations are... many of the senior roles will be sent immediately into the field at a billing rate between $250-$450. At a 80% utilization that is between $400k-$720k per head per year. If they have hired between 50-100 people into these roles since the Solarwinds hack that is could lead to $20M-$36M revenue increase on the low end to $40M-$72M on the high end. With current annual revenues at $928M we could see an annual revenue increase of 7% on these services alone which is above their current 6.9% revenue growth rate. If we see acceleration in any of their newish businesses like Managed Defense and Mandiant Advantage Cyber Threat Intelligence services we could have a great growth story on our hands. Incident Response services are (hopefully) a one time thing for breached companies but Managed Defense and Intel services are a recurring revenue stream, so growth in these areas would be a very good thing indeed. \n\nAny upticks in the hardware business would be positive news, but I believe they are facing upgrade cycle challenges and I\u2019m not expecting much on this front. \n\nFinally, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we saw FEYE acquired by a larger player in the next few months. There have been multiple rounds of rumors over the last few years that indicate FEYE has hired an investment bank to assist with the process. While Mandia hasn\u2019t confirmed these rumors, he hasn\u2019t denied them either. Cisco allegedly passed. I think good candidates are Microsoft, IBM or even someone like CrowdStrike using their astronomically high share price to swing a deal and create a cyber powerhouse to rival Pali Alto.  \n\nI\u2019m long with shares, considering NTM/OTM LEAPS, might by some June calls.  FD weeklies might payout but are risky IMO.",

They expect for Q4 an increase of app. 33,5% to 40,5% compared to the same quarter in 2019.\n\n**Shareholders**\n\nThe main shareholder is Hui Zuo with 46,8% of the shares. He is the founder and the Chairman of the Board. Second greatest shareholder is Tencent Holdings Limited. Tencent provides services to KE in connection to various aspects of the operations. We all know that Tencent is doing great. The CEO Peng Yongdong also has 3,6% of the shares.\n\nIn August 2020 KE went public on the NYSE. Current market price is approx. $63.\n\n**Market opportunities**\n\nAccording to the CIC Report, China has the largest housing market in the world in terms of GTV and number of transactions of existing and new home sales and home rentals in 2019. After a period of significant growth, the market is expected to enter an era of steady growth. It is expected that the existing home transactions market will gain more importance and grow with a CAGR of 12.4%.\n\n**Risk factors (highlights)**\n\n\u00b7  The business is susceptible to fluctuations in China's residential real estate market and is subject to government regulations.\n\n\u00b7  If they fail to maintain relationships with real estate developers or attract them to engage them, or otherwise fail to procure new real estate property listings at favorable terms, the business and growth prospects may suffer.\n\n\u00b7  If they fail to obtain or keep licenses, permits or approvals applicable to the various services provided by them, they may incur significant financial penalties and other government sanctions.\n\n\u00b7  Competition from other industry players. They may lose market share and customers if they fail to compete effectively. Their greatest competitor is E-House. Alibaba has a large stake (&gt;10%) in E-House.\n\nSEC Filing F-1: [https://investors.ke.com/financials/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=14285443](https://investors.ke.com/financials/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=14285443)\n\n**Own opinion**\n\nKE is a long-term investment for me. They have a great growth potential. I really like the real estate sector, especially in such a large company like China, Also,  I started this DD some days ago. Today I read that ARK Invest also has invested in KE. And let\u2019s be honest; everything Cathie touches turns into gold.",

        "selftext": "*Disclaimer - I am just a retard w/ a keyboard and you should do your own $DD. Also the karma whores @ WSB keep deleting my shit so one of you go post over there if you like $BB and what you read*\n\nTOday I did research to calm myself down after pounding a redbull and getting triggered by all the misinformation and greedy nitwits that have flooded this site looking for a quick flip.\n\nImagine you\u2019re John Chen. Sauntering down the hallway, with your 50 pound dick grazing the velveteen carpet with each step. You hear the guttural screams coming out of sales. You walk by the engineers, and gaze upon the latest widget as they kowtow before your bespecled grandeur. You hear about the customers who sing your praises, and the (much fewer) ones who tell you your product sucks donkey balls... But we (the retards @ WSB or frankly the dubmasses @ seeking alpha and even JP Morgan equity coverage) don\u2019t know the details any of this, only dry ass reports that come out every quarter.\n\nSo, other than hacking into John\u2019s brain (not recommended), what can we do? We can suckle at the teat of Twitter announcements, and sometimes that\u2019s fun but usually it\u2019s PR driven (unless it comes from Papa Chen\u2019s account in which case suckle away).\n\nBut boy oh boy wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could know the things P. Chiddy does. What new things are in development. Big new sales in the pipeline. Whether the company is hiring (or shrinking), and in what areas\u2026.Wait. For the last thing we actually can!\n\nthanks to the grotesquely fat (and very rich, no offense Gabe) founder of a soul-crushing professional network called LinkedIn. Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So let\u2019s see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?\n\nTo start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If you\u2019re a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If you\u2019re growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they don\u2019t think they need, and last time I checked $BB\u2019s CFO wasn\u2019t completely retarded. Now, it\u2019s important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c they\u2019re growing, duh) and vice versa.\n\nFANG isn\u2019t a perfect comp (I\u2019ll get to the others in a sec), but **serves as a good proxy of a \u201cbaseline growthy\u201d tech.** No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking. See below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8x0sjsj4wxe61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc0b996f191f3f47d37bb6b2888f537c6789ae0e\n\n# IMPLICATION NUMBER #1 - $$BB COMPARES FAVORABLY TO FANG IN TERMS OF HEADCOUNT-IMPLIED GROWTH. IF YOU SAID \u201c$BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG\u201d, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOU\u2019D BE RIGHT!!\n\n\u201cBut wait,\u201d you say. \u201cgrowthinvestor123 you fucking idiot, didn\u2019t you just compare $BB to CRWD, ZS, SAIL, and PANW yesterday to justify a **$60 / share** price target for $BB? I want to see the ratios for those.\u201d Ok you, got me. See below, headcount-implied growth is higher for endpoint security comparables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q7cepei5wxe61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7308c115e3d45a072dac92b20ac029eb132b348\n\n\u201cHah,\u201d you say smugly. \u201cThose other endpoint security businesses blow $BB out of the water, $BB sucks\u201d.\n\nNo, you fucking idiot. If a simple headcount ratio without context was all it took I\u2019d be rich instead of handsome like mommy tells me.\n\n$BB went through [**round**](https://channeldailynews.com/news/layoffs-hit-blackberry-in-waterloo/28015) after [**round**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=blackberry+layoffs&amp;atb=v224-1&amp;ia=web&amp;iai=r1-3&amp;page=1&amp;sexp=%7B%22cdrexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22artexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prodexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prdsdexp%22%3A%22c%22%2C%22biaexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22msvrtexp%22%3A%22b%22%7D) of painful layoffs as it shifted from being a handset business to what it is today. Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a **history**, and that is a blessing and a curse.\n\n**Remember**, Daddy chen\u2019s primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other??? And these smart monkes who were retained \u2013 Well, no need to make a job posting for that role anymore, right?\n\n# IMPLICATION #2 \u2013 BLACKBERRY HAD &gt; 20K EMPLOYEES. UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS. HAVING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES QUICKLY LIKE CERTAIN COMPETITORS\n\nThis brings me to the final part of our headcount analysis. Let\u2019s look at those endpoint security comparables again. Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Let\u2019s look at two two non-retard quotes \u2013\n\n***\"I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company.\" Steve Jobs***\n\n***\u201cIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it\u2019s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.\u201d Peter Thiel***\n\nI was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BB\u2019s Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales. See below\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9s89num7wxe61.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5361754f68b831f3ad044aba2fed88c6f93c7849\n\nEven as a $BB bull, I didn\u2019t expect the discrepancy to be so large.\n\n# IMPLICATION #3 \u2013 BLACKBERRY ACTUALLY IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING / IT FOCUSED COMPANY RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS. IN MANY WAYS IT IS MORE OF A \u201cSTART-UP\u201d. EVEN WITH FINANCIAL PRESSURE, JOHNNY CHEN RETAINED TECHNICAL TALENT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE, AND VALUATION ???\n\n**TLDR: BB IS NOT A ROCKET SHIP. IT IS A LONG RANGE SHUTTLE, CAPABLE OF BURSTS OF SPEED, PACKED TO THE GILLS WITH RETARDS AND TERRAFORMING EQUIPMENT AND HEADING TO MARS.**",

        "selftext": "# Remember hedge funds have the weak hand\n\nThey had to realise gains from other investments just to cover losses from GME. Thursday and Friday were the days with the biggest deleveraging sisnce March 2020. Each day they have to pay high interest just to mantain the short positions, and you know what? Every time they realise gains to cover losses their performance gets worse, and this makes them look like idiots in front of their clients, putting their business in danger.\n\n# Expect some crazy volatility\n\nRemember you are playing against hedge funds, they are not going to give you free money. There is no free money in the stock market. GME investors hit them hardly, and for them is not just about losses but they have to proof to their clients that they cannot be beaten by a bunch of redditors. They may suppress the price or manipulate it. There are some excellent posts on this sub about how they manipulate the stock price (ladder attacks, MSM misinformation, etc).\n\n# Manage your risk\n\nI hold GME since $20s. For me right now there is no risk in holding the stock because it will never go back to that level. If you just bought at $300 have in mind they may be able to supress the price for days or weeks to $100-$200 level, so you must be able to stomach this volatility. I would recommend only investing money you can afford to lose to not panic sell if you see this wild volatily.\n\nThe important thing as an investor is to hold, more than to buy like crazy.\n\n# Be a critical thinker, do your DD\n\nThere is nothing that the MSM wishes more than to see loss porn from retail investors to say \"see, they didn't know what they were doing\". Please, don't give them the opportunity to say that.\n\nDo your DD, check user history whenever you read something to make sure users are no hedge fund trolls. Hedge funds are now trying to focus you attention on everything except GME. The Silver play is a trap. Citadel is long silver. \n\n# BEWARE THAT IF YOU BUY SILVER, you are helping Citadel to cover losses with their gains and give them the chance to fight on GME.\n\nMaybe mods should ban silver posts as lots of people could potentially lose money on that play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nDO YOUR OWN DD. BE CRITICAL.\n\nHOLD. THEY HAVE THE WEAK HAND, NOT YOU.\n\nBEWARE OF SILVER.\n\nFor SEC minions reading this: this is not investment advice.\n\nEdit 1: many thanks for the awards guys.\n\nEdit 2: WSJ and Bloomberg are pushing the silver narrative and creating the impression that somehow people here are coordinated which is complete false. Also Citadel is long silver and it seems posts are being created mainly by bots. I definitely think mods should take action.\n\nEdit 3: about silver, it is not my call, I am just sharing my point of view, I totally get the people who says nothing should be banned. Just have in mind MSM are depicting WSB as a group of organized investors that are colluding to target different assets, which is completely false. Should their message gets acceptance because of SLV they could try to ban this sub. So I think mods should at least check if those posts are legit, and if they comply with the rules. Nothing else.",

        "selftext": "**Full disclosure: I am not a financial advisor and this is based purely on my observations and speculation. I'm a pants-on-head wearing retard and have possibly missed key points that would contradict my statements. Invest at your own risk.**\n\n**And yes, I own GME.**\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs we've been seeing this weekend, multiple bots have been hard pushing silver. At almost exactly the same time as this happened (EOD Friday) it was announced that SLV and futures were rising rapidly due to the 'Reddit mob' even though the vast majority of retail has no way to trade on weekends or touch futures.\n\nThis is obviously because no one has jumped on silver. Or at least not retail. The banks sure do love silver, and so do the boys at Shitadel. Shitadel is the fifth largest holder, along with several large banks.\n\n**Their strategy is probably something like this:**\n\nThey are running out of ammunition and their investors are scared. They love to hedge with commodities, and because they and their investors are scared now is the time to stock up. They've bought out most major suppliers and at the same time pushed the narrative that it was done by Reddit. Why?\n\nBecause they don't want people to know they're scared. They don't want people to know they are losing and buying commodities. This is their hedge, this is their attempt to cover their losses. They want to stock up on silver, but when they do that in large numbers the tickers and futures will spike. How do they explain that without giving away their position? \"Reddit did it.\"\n\nAfter they cause silver to spike in a meaningful way, they need someone to sell it off to. They've artificially created demand for silver and prevented suppliers from being able to sell to retail, and now it's trending on social media and boomer media. So what's the next step? How will they sell? Later on, they will push the silver narrative once more even harder, blaming Reddit for trying to collapse the dollar (because let's be real we fucking love clout) and all of the suppliers will suddenly have large amounts of silver available again for Reddit to get their hands on.\n\nThey want to egg you on, show you the proof by raising silver prices, and then sell it to you and line their pockets with your cash. Artificially raising the price and then selling it off the moment they can. There's a phrase for this but I think it keeps getting my posts removed.\n\nAnyone you see pushing SLV, AG, and physical silver is either heavily misinformed, a(u)(r)tistic beyond all belief, or paid off by a bank.\n\nYes, silver is heavily shorted. No, Reddit will not win a commodity war. Banks control actual physical supply lines, not just paper shares. There is no beating them at this game. People have tried and all but disappeared for it, multiple times.\n\nIf you want to ride their rise of silver then by all means go for it, but be aware that it is not retail investors causing this to rise. It is likely the people that need more ammo for this next week: Banks and HFs.\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\ude80 G\ud83d\ude80M \ud83d\ude80E\ud83d\ude80\n\nTL;DR\n\nBanks are blaming a spike in silver futures on Reddit to hide their own hedging, and are shilling silver here so that when it becomes available for purchase retail will pay a premium to 'get in' on a short that doesn't exist. Retail lines their pockets with money, and they get to empty their mansions of all the silver they hoarded.",

        "selftext": "So there's a lot of controversy going on regarding the idea of a silver squeeze. After what happened with gamestop, I'm convinced that this shit really might work out. On the other hand there are a lot of people thinking that this is just something to draw attention away from GME and withdraw fund from the stock. Let me assure you this is not my attention. And if you're all about GME I suggest reading here because it's a waste of time.\n\nI personally think that slv really might be the next big thing that could work out. Therefore I'd suggest to not go against the idea generally. Keep your hands at gamestop as long as you want, but once work is done, get together into this next big thing.\n\n\\*\\*Here's what happens or might happen:\\*\\*About the theory of the silversqueeze. Can't really be compared to the GME squeeze as it is not about squeezing out hedgefunds shortsellers in particular. The idea is that the silver price is priced way too low for the amount of silver that physically exists. The silvermarket volume on paper (exchanges/Futures..) is 250 times bigger than the supply of physical silver (just read this and didn't do my own DD if numbers are correct). The Idea is that a physical shortage will be caused and this would really let slv skyrocket with all that derivatives that are not backed. Now imagine some 7 million apes and the following retail investors that come after suddenly plunger the physical silver market...\n\nExample: Let's assume there is a shortage and Person A wants physical delivery of the future he bought. Person B as the seller needs to deliver 5000 ounces of silver. If supply is short, the person buys another future from Person C in order to be able to deliver the slv needed. You understand the reaction this causes.\n\nAlso the silver market is said to be manipulated and kept low for a long time. I have no opinion on this.\n\n\\*\\*What happened on the weekend?\\*\\*Silver already surged 20% since friday morning which was most likely a result of the news of \"Wallstreetbets taking over silver\" and \"Shortage in silver supply\".example: [https://twitter.com/bitpanda/status/1356023060814585859](https://twitter.com/bitpanda/status/1356023060814585859)Also I noticed several locals stores and online stores being sold out completely on silver and it looks like this is not only regarding a few small dealers.[https://www.theepochtimes.com/reddit-forum-sparks-physical-silver-shortage-on-major-dealers-websites\\_3679079.html](https://www.theepochtimes.com/reddit-forum-sparks-physical-silver-shortage-on-major-dealers-websites_3679079.html)Also social media generates a lot of heat.\n\nSo it look's like it's happening - if we're heading to a global shortage, prices could absolutely go to the moon and this is a big time chance to be with it at the beginning right now. Additionally there is a good chance that shortsellers have learnt from what was happening with GME and they might get out of their short positions earlier which will generate further momentum.\n\n**What you can do** in order to participate and make this work:It does not help the cause if you buy mining companys (even though it might generate good income). But still, in order moon the prices, you'll need to invest physically. The options are:\\* Buying silver futures and let it physically deliver. Only possible if you can easily invest some 150k.\\* Buying slv or pslv if you live at the hamburgers, and for instance \"Xtrackers physical silber\" if you're from Europe. It's really important that you check if the fund needs to fully physically cover it's assets (=buy silver). Because not all do so.\\* The next option is to physically buy silver at your local store or webshop.\\* At last, you can buy options. Your counterpart might want to hedge the positions and therefore will potentially be covered. This is also obviously the part where you can win big time (or lose everything). My weapon of choice is:  34.00C expiring in April\n\nI prefer a mix of above.\n\nBut as we all know, I'm just another ape sharing brainfarts, hence I'm definitely not in the position to give financial advice. Also I'm long on slv, silver options and bought the silver of some local shops.\n\nTL;DR:This post is **NOT about GME**. No selly selly - I get the hype! But silver might be one of the best chances for the upcoming weeks I believe. And today it's still a chance to get in early at low prices.\n\ne/okay, guess we have to wait until GME is through. Looks like most in here aren't open for a new relationsship. Anything that's not GME/AMC gets downvoted to hell. ITT: People with weak hands scared of any funds going from gme to slv - this is ridiculous.  \n\ne2/ Thx for gold, even though silver would have done it!",

        "selftext": "**TLDR: \"CoNtrARiaN\" but actually just a\ndick-eating bear thesis that the SQUEEZE has in fact, been ALREADY SQUOZE.**\n\n_Let me preface that for all the 5M newbies to this sub, I\nam saddened that my favorite sub since 2017 has been invaded by normies. But at\nthe same time, I am excited for all the new amount of fodder (yeah, you) for\nmemes. So WELCOME TO THE GANG, GANG &amp;lt;3_\n\n**\n\nTHESIS: The big short squeeze has already happened.**\n\n**\n\nWhen?**\n\nApproximately from the when our lord and savior Burry probably cashed out\n(sometime before his settlement date for 13-F filing coming out in 2 weeks\ntime) to when the news broke and Cramer shat his pants on CNBC last Monday.\n\n**\n\nWhy do you think this?**\n\nFirst, MELVIN was NOT the ONLY ones SHORT, they were just\nthe slowest ones to cover (and hence probably will continue to be the poster-child for\nbukkake gang-rape by millennials and zoomers with stimmy checks).\n\nSecond, GME literally went from $5 per share to $37 per\nshare by January 15, 2021, the settlement date for the latest short float\nupdate (I\u2019ll come back to your fucking daily updates from S3 Partners and Ortex\nlater on, and why I don\u2019t trust them).\n\nTo put it into perspective for these unscrupulous, criminal,\nBIG money positions on the short-side that have been here a LOOOONG time,\nthat\u2019s already a 750% loss.\n\nIf someone had put in **JUST** $1M in August 2020 (by the\nway, the short float % was around 99% at this time, so I KNOW more got in short\nafter this) hoping for a Gamestop bankruptcy, by Jan 15, 2021 these fuckers\nwould have lost $8M in total (initiating position would have been about 200K\nshares short, by the time it gets to 1/15/2021, $37 x 200K shares =\u00a0 $7.4M.\n\nSo, by wagering $1M on the short side, you now have to buy\nback and return your shares. You now have a $6.4M loss.\n\n**WELL THAT FUCKING SUCKS? Right? Well then what does a 400-IQ,\nuncircumcized-dick hedgie with a wedgie want to do about this situation? They\nGOTTA make that loss back SOMEWAY SOMEHOW.**\n\nYou could suck trucker dick or deal drugs, but these\nwhite-collar yuppies have enough power to NOT have to stoop down to that level.\n\n**\n\nHere is how they CAN, and probably ARE, doing it right\nnow:**\n\nMelvin wasn\u2019t the only short position. Just the most\nretarded one that didn\u2019t cover in time, so they had to go through a whole\nfucking liquidity crisis, class action lawsuit, and dick-eating meme-fest while\nliterally asking for sugar-daddy money. What about the less retarded short\npositions? Well, they probably have some losses too, because I mean, they did\nget squeezed in the earlier portion of the play, but now they have sights on\nsomething else.\n\n**First, your hedgies (excluding Melvin &amp; Citron)\ncontinue to push the narrative: \u201cThrow Melvin &amp; Citron to the masses and\nkeep the retail investors coming in with their diamond hands and high school\ndiplomas.\u201d**\n\nSecond, **hedgies go LONG on GME shares now**. WTF HOW?\nWell remember that for short positions, there are LENDERS of these shares.\nThese lenders would happily let go of their positions at the \u201ctop\u201d of a\nsqueeze. (It\u2019s ez fucking profit, and they want none of this mess).\n\nThird, you now have a long position with underlying shares.\nWhat\u2019s the best play here? You fucking write call options because the vol\npremiums are literally mooning at the moment. And I\u2019ve been on WSB long enough\nto know that WSB\u2019s risk management is literally just selling one-paired organ\nto afford the option premium on FDs.\n\nLastly, you push the narrative of a \u201cGAMMA SQUEEZE\u201d which is\nJUST a little bit too hard for your average joe from Mississippi to understand\nwith his Algebra 2 from high school \u2013 Essentially telling him, \u201cHEY THERES\nSTILL MORE TO SQUEEEEEZE.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\n\nREAL Gs MOVE IN SILENCE:**\n\nLook at the volumes, the float rotation in the past week for\nGME is already enough to have fucked virgins 20 times and sacrificed them to\ncapitalist gods. \n\nWhich means for hedgies with wedgies, it\u2019s no longer a\ntail-risk, blind-side event, it\u2019s time to REAP the souls of every stimmy check\nfool, by \u201cMaRkET MAkInG\u201d.\n\nIf I am that Hedgie, I write call options, while maintaining\na fa\u00e7ade that I will \u201crationally\u201d hedge those positions by buying more of the\nunderlying shares. FUN FACT: I already have them.\n\nYou stimmy check tards will keep buying into GME, because\nyou heard about it in the news over the weekend and want to get in on this\naction to \u201cSTICK IT TO THE MAN\u201d because 2020 has been an absolute suicidal\ndescent into madness because of COVID. You will probably go on for a couple\nmore days this upcoming week, now that liquidity restrictions are slowly being\nlifted on trading platforms.\n\nSO, while you fools supply buying volume, all I have to do\nis collect my premiums on option sales, while slowly unwinding my underlying\nshare positions, and thereby also managing risk of option assignment since I\u2019ll\nsell shares into every spike and swerve the price away from the strike price of\nYOUR options.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll also have an expectation as to where GME could\npotentially rise to. You just look at the WSB subscriber count, multiply that\nby the avg retail trader account liquidity.\n\nYou guys will think you have stuck it to the man, but the\nman is sticking your wife ALREADY, ever since the moment you got angry and\nemotional about an opportunity to unleash your pent up hatred towards the Wall\nStreet system. All I am saying is, for every tard like Melvin, there\u2019s 20 other\nhedgies out there to fuck you up without you even realizing it. After all it\u2019s\ndone, they\u2019ll even make you feel bad, saying you were \u201cGreedy\u201d and \u201cReckless\u201d,\nfurther perpetuating emotional volatility in markets that they will keep\nprofiting off of.\n\nSo while the retail GME HODLER thinks there\u2019s still enough\ngold raining from the top of midtown Manhattan, all they\u2019re getting is piss and\npre-cum.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\n\nAPPENDIX \u2013 Ortex &amp; S3 Partners**\n\nIf you got all the way through until now, I apologize for my\nlack of presentation in this thesis, it\u2019s literally 3AM in the East Coast US\nbecause I\u2019m up for 4AM pre-market (don\u2019t fucking judge me, I\u2019m a retard too).\n\nSo I\u2019ll explain that point from WAY up there about short\ninterest estimates.\n\nI don\u2019t give a flying fuck what Ortex and S3 Partners says.\nI do NOT believe that short float is STILL above %100 after the official data\ncame out on 1/27 with a lag of two fucking weeks from its settlement date on\n1/15. The stock price moved so egregiously that every autist in Manhattan would\nhave literally gone bankrupt if they\u2019re still short, NOT just Melvin.\n\nSee, here\u2019s the thing. If the system is ALREADY built with\nthis **two weeks lag** on short data for individual stocks, what fucking\ndata analytics company in their right mind would NOT try to take advantage of\nthis time &amp; information arbitrage? The system is FUCKED, but it gets\nperpetuated because the ones perpetuating this have the MOST to gain.\n\nOrtex and S3 Partners is purely a marketing ploy, they\nhopped on this gravy train to get your subcriptions and some more clicky-clicks\non their website traffic so they can use those metrics to raise some more funds\nlater on.\n\nAnd even if they believed in your cause, no smart data\nanalytics firm would willingly give up that information arbitrage to the\npublic, if they want to ever think about doing business with ANY hedge-fund in\ntown.\n\nTherefore, I am sticking to my autistic thought that the\nsystem is stacked (which most of you agree) against us. BUT, I urge you to be a\nlittle bit more careful, because short float data can be misleading at best and\na total fraudulent bull-trap at worst. \n\nAgain, If you are new here, welcome to the gang. This sub\nwill always be about losing money and becoming best friends with your wife\u2019s\nboyfriend. But over time, it will be about the friends and knowledge you gained\nalong the way.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\n\nThank you for listening to my ted-talk. I expect a PHD\ntag for my 8-inch dick.**",

        "selftext": "Hello stocks,\n\nI'm a relatively newer investor and have been picking up new information and gaining skills as I go along. With all this craziness happening in the stock market I had a really sobering experience that I've been having trouble with. This is maybe more of a mental and emotional self-care question than it is a stock question, but I figure some people here have had a similar experience and can help me out or share some advice or stories or something.\n\nI started accumulating some GME at the end of November based on all the DD that was floating around. I bought slowly and ended up with 255 shares at 55 cost bases and 7(!) april 29 $25 calls. I really didn't expect something like this to actually happen. I had a loss on this all through December so when the price shot up the first time in January I sold 4 calls for a $3000 profit. Thats the first big ouch. Those would be worth more than 100,000 right now.\n\nThe remaining securities I kept until the commotion last week. I had never expected to have so much money in my whole life. My account blew up to 250,000 at the peak on Friday (I started with 20,000). I had already taken some profits at 320, 100 shares. Then when the huge spike to 490 and dip to 115 happened on Friday I freaked out and sol 100 shares and 2 calls when GME was around $140.  was trading emotionally and scared and not logically. I had even laid out an exit strategy and I ignored it. This was obviously an incredibly stupid play and I feel heavy regret about it. I know I shouldn't. I made 1000x my initial investment already. Yet I still feel depressed. I don't feel like I gained 100,000. I feel like I lost 400,000.\n\nI know it's stupid and I'm incredibly lucky to have found myself in this incredible trade as such a new investor. But I still feel heavy regret and it's really getting me down at a moment in my life when I should be celebrating. How do you all deal with regret?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR\n\nI panic sold GME and made a 1000x profit but I traded emotionally and left so much money on the table. How do I get over the regret and be happy about my profit and remaining position?\n\nStill in for a call and 55 shares!",

        "selftext": "  Just wanted to say you are my favorite broker and it's been tough sending you business once you turned off fractionals for GameStop and possibly other shares. I think it's pretty weak if that was your decision to do so.\n\nThere's a lot of people flooding to your business and your mobile app now because of this subreddit. Even though the UI for your mobile app is pretty bad compared to ROBEMGOOD.\n\nAs a suggestion could you possibly open fractional investing up for people with the minimum deposit required to open an account with you? $100. Or maybe allocate a little of your large amount of shares for these retail investors?\n\nThere's a lot of people who would like to buy fractional shares in these companies you turned off and they have the right to do so. You were offering this option before. When everything went down and people couldn't buy shares you turned that option off.\n\nIf there's a reason these retail investors can't buy fractional shares, can you at least release an announcement as to why that is? And don't bullshit us?\n\nIf you have already turned the option back on, please disregard. With your Quick Ticket system that you have to use in order to buy fractional shares, you can't place an order until market opens.  So I haven't been able to check since Friday and it was still off. \n\nHere's an article from Reuters you posted that says ROBEMGOOD still isn't offering fractional shares.\n\nNeither was Fidelity last I checked even though I tested it prior to the whole fiasco and it worked. \n\n[https://www.fidelity.com/news/article/top-news/202101281910RTRSNEWSCOMBINED\\_KBN29X12T-OUSBS\\_1](https://www.fidelity.com/news/article/top-news/202101281910RTRSNEWSCOMBINED_KBN29X12T-OUSBS_1)\n\nDisclaimer: Not an advisor just think it's kind of shitty to turn off an option for investors with smaller amounts of capitol, unless you were forced by regulators to do so.  Then it's the regulators who are shitty. Unless there is no more actual shares to buy and that doesn't seem to be the case. What's going on with that?",

        "selftext": "First of all, major credit to u/johnnydaggers for the [original DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/) If you haven't read that yet, go take a look.\n\nInspired by his analysis, I wanted to investigate the SEC's publicly available Failed to Deliver data and see how it compared to other companies over time.\n\nI wrote some code to process the the raw SEC data and normalize the shares that failed to deliver by the total number of outstanding shares of the company. This gives us a view that where each company's FTD shares are expressed as a percentage of the outstanding, so we can fairly compare companies to one another.\n\n(Before you ask, yes I account for fluctuating values of outstanding shares.)\n\nI went back to the beginning of 2019, looking at a few of the recent meme stocks with short squeezes as well as the top 10 (by weight) in the S&amp;P 500 as well as GE (as an example of a stock with very low short interest). Here's what I found.\n\n[This is not normal.](https://preview.redd.it/9us7kdme1ue61.png?width=2554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddf843285adac642c3d15360c71e14ed04566a38)\n\nShares can fail to deliver for many reasons, but when large numbers of shares fail to deliver a likely explanation is naked short selling. For a thorough explanation of this, see [this article](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html).\n\nBack in early 2019, both GME and AMC look like the others. All had sub-1% of their outstanding shares end up as FTD. But starting in mid 2019, both GME and AMC experienced three waves of progressively larger naked short selling attacks. This is known as [scaling in](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scale-in.asp).\n\nI wanted to see if I could find corroborating evidence of news and price data which aligned in time with these waves of naked shorting. What I found were two stories, both similar, explaining how GME and AMC got to where they are today.\n\n# GameStop\n\nThe first wave (small bet) of naked shorts occurred in June and July of 2019. GME reported Q1 '19 earnings on June 4th after hours, with a [bleak future outlook](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/06/05/gamestop-stock-plunges-nearly-percent-gamers-brace-new-era-consoles/). Overall sales was down $1.5B, net income plunged by 78%. This story is what formed the core of the bear thesis. The stock dropped 36% on the news.\n\n[GME Q1 '19 Earnings. Oof.](https://preview.redd.it/vbrosels1ue61.png?width=2804&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b04f103567aa52b8af929191f14fbae86a41f0e4)\n\nBut things changed when Q2 '19 earnings came around. Yes, sales were down again and the numbers didn't look good, but the company announced it was going to [reboot with a major strategic update](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/09/10/1913815/0/en/GameStop-Reports-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2019-Results.html). They were going to make their retail stores more efficient by closing some locations, focus on becoming a social hub for gaming, and build a digital platform around the relaunched GameStop website.\n\nInvestors liked the news and the stock tries to move upwards, but is repeatedly beaten down. This lines up with the second wave of naked shorting. The original short sellers couldn't let the price float up, so they resorted to more than doubling down on their original naked short bet to keep the stock trending downward.\n\n[Naked Shorts double down, gotta drive it to zero faster than they can rebuild!](https://preview.redd.it/p6x5x8zw1ue61.png?width=2772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=382b78b87a737dc480f85bccea573096ca681706)\n\nFinally COVID hits the US in March and April. Lockdowns happen and it becomes clear that nobody is going to malls anytime soon. This is where the third and final massive wave of naked short selling happens, attempting to push GME into bankruptcy. Remember, that's always the goal with naked short selling. If the company goes bankrupt, especially with a convenient parallel story (\"It was a failing company anyway and COVID was the nail in the coffin!\"), then nobody bothers to look into how many counterfeit shares might be floating around out there. They aren't worth anything, so who cares!\n\nAt its peak, **over 20% of the company's entire outstanding shares were failing to deliver every month**. This is confirmed by a tweet from Michael Burry (since deleted, he scrubs his tweets) that says when he tried to recall his lent-out shares, it took his broker **many weeks** to locate them. Remember, companies normally have well below 1% of their outstanding shares fail to deliver every month.\n\n# AMC Entertainment\n\nTo understand how we got here with AMC, you need to look back further, to 2017. AMC has been struggling to be profitable for a while. They had a history of posting very small net profits along with many net losses. Their cash on hand was hovering around $300M and their corporate borrowing had been going up.\n\n[Trying to hard to not lose money.](https://preview.redd.it/g7zugy792ue61.png?width=1876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f580cf12bad13197ed1426466d8b183a4191933e)\n\n[Surely borrowing will make this problem go away!](https://preview.redd.it/jtgjqlu92ue61.png?width=1876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93a8ac04fd426390354024ce016a2a08df36c79f)\n\nWhat coincided with the first small naked short bet on AMC in June/July of 2019? Their cash on hand just dipped below $200M (from being stable around $300m). The last time that happened, AMC more than doubled its corporate loans. The short hedge funds smelled blood in the water.\n\nThe second bet, where the naked shorts doubled down occurred in November of 2019. What happened then? AMC Q3 earnings, which showed that cash on hand had dropped to a precipitous $100M. Bankruptcy was in sight for the hedge funds...\n\nAnd then COVID hit. Their massive third wave bet was similar to GameStop, though slightly more delayed. Why? May 2020 was the peak of naked short selling, around the time when some businesses were able to reopen with restrictions, but it was clear that **movie theaters**, among a few other things, would be staying closed until the pandemic was completely over.\n\nAlso like GameStop, at its peak **over 20% of the company's outstanding shares were failing to deliver**. This is not normal.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI think the evidence shows there is a strong reason to believe that one or more hedge funds, probably in collusion with broker dealers or the DTCC, have been deliberately naked short selling both GME and AMC since mid-2019. They made small bets to start with in the first wave, doubled down a few months later, but stupidly went all-in for the kill when COVID hit the US. It presented a unique scapegoat that nobody would question for pushing a failing mall retailer and a dwindling movie chain out of business.\n\nWhere does this leave us? I don't know. Unless this results in some kind of economic crisis (and I'm beginning to think it will), I don't see anything getting seriously investigated or changing. This is the same crap that happened with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008, but nobody was went to jail for it. Of course they were going to keep doing it.\n\n**This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and paste.**\n\nPositions: 100 GME @ $36, 500 AMC @ $2.75 (but I wrote $3 calls before it mooned... GUH)\n\nIf anyone wants to play around with the code or data I used to generate the first plot (monthly normalized failure to deliver data), [I put it on GitHub](https://github.com/bobsomers/evidence_of_naked_short_fraud_in_gme_and_amc).",

        "selftext": "So I'm still new to investing and had extra money saved and wanted to be apart of this stock market history so I bought a GME share - ON LIKE 4AM MONDAY - at $312 as a Market Order, but I was wondering if I should cancel it and instead use a limit order, because I don't know how Market orders work exactly. My question is, even though I was under the assumption I bought my share at/around an exact price of $312, if the markets open and it's at - for example - gets to $400, does that mean I would have bought the share at $400 when the stock market actually opens, or would it still be around the $312 of when I bought it during before/aftermarket hours?",

        "selftext": "\\[Update\\] Posting here  \\[WSBN\\] as WSB did not allow me to.\n\n\\[Update 2\\] Do not listen to news that talk about Silver or any other catalyst. It is part of their distraction plan. Expect DIPS, BIG DIPs. Understand that they will try to scare the hell out of us and bring it as low as possible.\n\nLink to [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/l7po3s/situation_from_europe_plan_for_next_days_and/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFellow retards,\n\nAllow me to keep sharing my thoughts with you as it clears my mind and it gives me a path forward.\n\nAlso, I see that a lot of people lost here, missing basic knowledge on the stock market. I hope this adds a new perspective that helps you grow as a trader.\n\nNow, first, understand that I am in no way giving you any financial advise. You must do your own DD, understand your financial situation and take decisions based on your own research. I am just an autist that is most likely wrong so you should just read this for fun.\n\n## What to take into account on the current bet\n\nThere are three pillars in the current trade\n\n* Owners of stocks holding\n   * This caps how many shares are available, causing lack of liquidity (necessary for a short squeeze)\n* High Short interest remaining  (30-50+M)\n   * Main requirement for a short squeeze\n* Buys strength (retailer or institutional)\n   * To keep removing liquidity and pushing the price up (which triggers a gamma and short squeeze)\n\n# Short interest (SI) situation\n\nThis section is going to be complex, there is a lot of ground to cover, but hopefully you will get my point.\n\n## What we DO know\n\nSI is published every 15 days. The last time NYSE released GME SI data was on Jan 15th. All the information in between is based on different algorithms that companies such as ORTEX and S3Partners. These results might be wrong.\n\nAs of 15th of January the data was: 61.78m Shorts - 131.76%\n\n[FYI, DTC is totally misleading for GME. Ignore that number](https://preview.redd.it/2xrzp52g3ue61.png?width=349&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa27ab67688a290b0984144a3105e6902a9b76a8)\n\nNext time we will hear about SI will be on the **9th of February** [according to the NYSE calendar](https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/data/NYSE_Group_Short_Interest_Calendar.pdf). Remember this date for later.\n\n# Jan 22-29th RECAP - Understand where do we stand before setting expectations for next week\n\n**JAN 22-26th** AFAIK, a fair amount of -old- Shorts were covered on the squeeze that happened on Jan 25th and 26th (Tuesday) which helped rocket GME price from $50 to $250.\n\n[The first 350M volume was followed by an avg. of 145M+ the next two day. It is likely that many Short positions closed](https://preview.redd.it/f1ip3z2l3ue61.png?width=882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f30113682c228e83904fc28a9877314f1b214ff3)\n\nNow, those Shorts, according to Ortex and S3Partners were replaced with new ones too. Something that -according to me- it is quite reasonable, as we will see below.\n\n**JAN 27-29th** On Jan 27th (Wed) after our friend Elon tweeted GameStonks!, New opened Shorts positions trembled. The MarketMaker(MM) forced to cover Call options as the price skyrocket (gamma squeeze) and Shorts covering pushed the price from $220 to $380.\n\nJan 26th aside, I believe the 27th was the biggest retail day with massive internet coverage and stock purchases.\n\n[Week event - Melvin Capital could say whatever, I do not believe it, and even if I would, well, as sure as hell they reopened new shorts \\(them or others\\)](https://preview.redd.it/i6b61z6w3ue61.png?width=753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=418599684c1ca7179a990ada9ef7565e4bccdbcd)\n\nWe cannot be certain of how many Shorts remained after the market closed on Jan 27th (Wed). Regardless, with such home-run, **the HUGE squeeze was imminent.** Do not be fooled, there was no other legit reason to close retail traffic on Jan 28th when the price hit $500 (check what my best friend ever [IBKR Thomas P.](https://streamable.com/ycdec9)  said about it).\n\nThis makes me believe that at least 40+M shorts were still hanging in there.\n\n## WowowW, but wait, What happened with the volume?\n\nThe volume has massively gone down **and I take that as a real dam good sign**. From the initial 350M we have gone down to the 25M as of Friday 29th.\n\nOn Thursday, the short ladders had barely 2-4M in volume. Day volume was 34M.\n\nThis -to me- means that Retail might own a bigger chunk of the pie than we expected. **Easy 20M shares that Retail Holds and no way is going to fucking sell.**\n\n# So now what? What is the Short Interest situation?\n\nIf there is something that I have learn from the last days research is this: **SHORT INTEREST DATA is** \\- for GME most likely - **MANIPULATED.**\n\nIn the past week, we have seen nasty plays. Short ladders, retailers blocked from buying, and fake news and now... -in my opinion- short positions estimation manipulation.\n\nLong story short, I have seen a sudden HUGE change on the short interest estimates out of the blue on both ORTEX and S3Partners. Luckily, S3Partners had been very vocal and very public about the news related to short positions which has helped me consolidate the idea that currrent estimates are bullshit.\n\nIn less than 12h, S3Partners has gone from  their ***Hey mates! we still see 58+M shorts!\"*** to ***\"Well, markets are fluid and I am not gonna give you any data but be scared because a lot of Shorts are closed\"***. This [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356017621649383426) is pretty pathetic/fun to read.\n\n# Play for the next 2 weeks\n\nDuring the past week, you thought you sweated and shitted your pants like a master and, over everything else, you consider yourself a \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32. Well, you are not, at least, not yet.\n\n## Shorts play - How I think they will manipulate Retai\n\nHere is the thing. If I were them, what would I do? I would have covered as many shorts as possible as low as possible by Friday 29th and would have made special deals so I can keep my game on.\n\nThe first week of February I would open a shit ton of new Shorts because I know that people, as much as they call themselves retards, on the deep inside they are paper hands and they will sell as the time passes.\n\nThen on the 9th with the next Short Interest NYSE report showing 20-30M shorts and all reddit full of bots giving the news of the Armageddon, all of Retail will run to hit the sell to market button as the explosive diarrea ruins their ergonomic gamer chairs and few of them make 3 or 4 bucks.\n\nAnd Retail fools will be left holding the bags while I would recover all the money I have lost in the previous weeks/squeezes as the price sinks to $2\n\n**THINK!!!** If you were them, would you not open shorts like a fucking demon at top prices? 420, 500, 470, 350, 320. We have seen many resistance points with plenty of volume and we have not really broken it.\n\nThey have 2 top opportunities to win. Sink the price next week so everyone sells or control the price raise until the new NYSE report comes out and gives bad news.\n\nIf I had to bet, I would say they will do both.\n\nLook at this: MUST VIEW: [`https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFfjX8dW-QQ`](https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFfjX8dW-QQ)\n\n## But mate, Is Retail big enough to keep this going?\n\nA big chunk of GameStop is owned by Blackrock and other huge wales. They are going to be rich as fuck and yes, they can do deals under the table. So what.\n\nBy no short of imagination -according to my estimates- they can prevent the squeeze from happening. Retail owns at least 20+M shares. I have seen numbers that say that retail only owns 13%. NO WAY. Last week, 500k-1M+  people jumped into GME. Some buying fractions, some buying few stocks and some buying tens or hundreds.\n\n**Even at a low average of 20 Retail easily owns 15M-20M+ shares .**  Taking into account the shares owned by funds that GME just as part of the portfolio and the insider ownership, my estimate is that **there are around 20-30M shares available to trade.**  Do not be fooled by the volume. The same stock could be traded 10 times, still one stock cannot close 10 shorts.\n\n## What will I do\n\nThis is war. Personally, I am financially strong. I doubled my account in the past 6 months so I keep having money to through at this.\n\nI'll continue to Buy DIPs and HOLD and I will be very careful to believe the information that is published that it is not official and based on estimates. \"Information\" is the wales game. They play it however they want, so better use some logic -like the one above- to understand how to play my cards.\n\nAll the people around me, tell me I am fucking crazy. That I should get the gains or put a stop loss. But being a trader is going against what other think or do. Is about having your dam plan clear, based on your believes an executing it.\n\n## Exit strategy\n\nI am more and more inclined to just do some \ud83c\udf7fseat-back and watch how it keeps climbing. Now, there will be dips as the rocket refuels, but there ain't stopping it. Maybe sell some at 15k? This is so big, that I have no idea.\n\nIf it SINKs, I'll just never sell, I'll pass them to my sons when I die with the promise that they will never sell.\n\n## Interactive brokers Update\n\nTaking into account how much they have fucked me already, I trust them shit. Should I have had paper hands I will be out of the game long ago (I could not buy again until Friday, where I bought in the last minutes).\n\nFor Europe, I fear there is no real alternative. So, braze yourselves.\n\n## Final disclaimer\n\nDo not follow what I said here, just because you liked it. Do you DD, understand you financial situation and do not fuck yourself over a bet. As probable as it might seem there is always a chance for all to go to shit. Do not allow yourself to be in a bankrupt risk.\n\nI am not a financial advisor, I do not have the knowledge nor do I want to be one. I am simply sharing my thoughts, but I can be completely wrong and it would not be the first time. Be safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know in the comments if you have any correction or additional information and I will keep this post up to date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/) In the name of those who will YOLO, we salut you.\n\nREF: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l78uct/gme\\_yolo\\_update\\_jan\\_28\\_2021/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l78uct/gme_yolo_update_jan_28_2021/)\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32 and fucking GME \ud83d\ude80 to Alpha centaury.",

        "selftext": "Turquiose hill resources a already profitable leveraged copper miner is one of the most valuable copper miners on the planet plagued with uncertainty, government, corporate, and media interference.\n\nThe stock currently trades around .2 book value.  The most recent Q3 2020 earnings was GAAP EPS of $0.64 and the stock is trading around $11. Meanwhile FCX one of the largest copper miners posted a Q4 2020 GAAP EPS of $0.48 and trades around $28. This means TRQ is trading at a 300% discount relative to earnings and Q3 copper prices were much lower than Q4.\n\nA quick look at TRQ stock price has indicated it has been on a 10 year downtrend.  The company is a single asset copper miner located in Mongolia which has a decent production on its open pit mine and is developing Oyu Tolgoi, an expansive very deep underground mine the size of Manhattan that will start sustainable production on October 2022 and eventually make it the 3rd/4th largest lowest cost producer copper mine on the planet when ramped up over the following years.\n\nSo why has the performance of the stock been in the dumps even when copper and gold are near all time highs? There are a couple of factors making the stock trade at just 20% of book value. \n\n1. Government of Mongolia (GoM) and its constant trashing of the the Oyu Tolgoi.  GoM made a deal to have 33.3% equity stake in the mine but didn\u2019t have money so they borrowed it. The mine is one of largest inflow of foreign direct investment ever negotiated and in the last decade loss out on the bet as copper and gold were in a bear market.  The expansion of the underground mine also significantly expensive and over budgeted have given ammo to the fire of trashing all the international agreements that they want to negotiate.  Every other year there are presidential or parliamentary elections and they trash the investment putting constant pressure on the TRQ stock. Currently a presidential election is taking place in June 2021 and the debate on Mongolians getting ripped off has heated up with politicians and citizens feel like they are being cheated. They compare their asset to the great riches of Saudi princes, which is not a fair comparison as oil has been in decades long Bull market\n\n2. Sometime in the early decade Rio Tinto was able to purchase the majority of TRQ shares to get a controlling interest in the company but decided not to pay a premium on the rest of the company.  RIO became the project manager for the Oyu Tolgoi mine. Meanwhile TRQ was systematically turned into a shell company of RIO by removing all former employees and replacing the board with hand picked Ex-RIO executives. RIO had no interest in defending the stock when GoM tensions flared up as this decreased  the value of TRQ and had no interest in negotiating with GoM as this benefitted their end goal of getting TRQ for free. Analyst several years ago thought that TRQ would be bought out by RIO to increase their copper and diversify away from Iron Ore revenues.  In July 2019 it was announce that there was a funding shortfall of 1.9 B and a 30 month delay.  This caused the stock to trash amazingly which has not yet recovered.  As momentum started building in September 2020 RIO revealed their end goal of acquiring TRQ, by attempting to limit the amount of debt TRQ could issue as well as request for the funding gap to be covered by a share offering which RIO would backstop. TRQ already had an ability under the agreements issue up to an additional 1.6 B debt but RIO was seeking to limit it to 500 M. \n\n3. Due to the delay in the launch of the mine by 22 months and the funding gap the stock faces liquidity risk uncertainty. RIO manufactured a crisis by trying to limit debt that TRQ could raise. This caused TRQ to see RIO as an existential threat and they have since launched financing arbitration in Canada which is friendly to minority shareholders. TRQ had announce today that RIO was trying to pre empt the financing arbitration decision by trying to pursue financing options that would limit TRQ\u2019s ability to finance their preferred options. TRQ had filed an injunction to stop RIO.\n\n4. Financial Times has taken the side of the TRQ short seller Odey and has multiple times crashed the stock through unethical journalism.  Odey even in 2020 was able to feed a nonsense open letter article that triggered a 10% crash.\n\nGoM a democracy due to their free speech and Oyu Tolgoi bashing has created downward pressure on the stock.  Most of the speech is rubbish but money is scared especially when dealing with an untested emerging market.  This has caused Oyu Tolgoi to be the only major investment in Mongolia and it already accounts for 1/3rd of their economy.  They seek to change the international iron clad agreements, which due to RIOs new management might receive some concessions.\n\nRIO a hostile controlling shareholder has successfully through years of TRQ pain caused investors to discount the stock at just .2 of book value despite gold and copper near all time highs. They had Temasak Singapore sovereign wealth fund liquidate and take considerable losses over a billion dollars. \nThey had Sailingstone which went all in TRQ turn a 5B hedge fund to a 250 M hedge fund. In my opinion RIO has done just as much damage as GoM.\n\nThe history of TRQ is important as to the context of why the stock is trading at such a depressed value.   Going forward as the underground mine nears completion the facts are:\n\n1. TRQ is extremely profitable at these commodity prices.  The amounts are projected to be able to fund the remaining capital investments and still be cash flow positive.\n\n2. TRQ date of which cash will be depleted keeps getting pushed back as commodity prices remain strong currently their estimate is Q2 2022. RIOs plan to get TRQ shares for free are almost certain to fail. Financing Arbitration should de-risk liquidity. Once this happens the price will increase multiple folds and the RIO buyout may become an option. \n\n3. TRQ has broken pact with RIO and has taken GoM side and voted for an independent investigation on the cost overrun and disagreed with RIO criteria to be met by GoM in order to continue key milestones of underground mining development.\n\n4. TRQ will soon benefit from a decade long continued copper growth production at the lowest cost curve quartile. At current commodity prices the mines NPV discounted at 8% is 15B as quoted from last years OTTR report which is available on their website.\n\nDespite the massive upcoming copper growth of TRQ and the huge discount the stock is trading at investors are trigger happy and sell when any type of news hits the stock.  The stock may be a roller coaster for the next few months but the trend is clear, the underground mine is almost complete, copper and gold continue to be near all time highs and TRQ is extremely profitable and well run mine with lowest injury rate and a 90% plus Mongolian workforce. To get to book value the stock will rise 4x and most stocks of this size trade at multiples of book value.\n\nDisclosure: I am long TRQ",

I cannot offer you nothing in exchange for making this meme, unfortunately, but I think it would be really funny and help the cause.\n\n**Characters:**\n\n\\- William Wallace (DFV)\n\n\\- Robert the Bruce (reddit user)\n\n**Plot:**\n\nIt starts with Robert purchasing some GME stock, and claiming he will hold. (William and Robert handshake scene).\n\nThen, instead of holding, he betrays the cause and sells his GME stock (scene where Robert and the leperman agree to betray Scotland).\n\nRobert's selling move is later noticed by William (dramatic disappointment scene).\n\nRobert feels bad about it, and then eventually goes YOLO, putting all his money on GME and decides to fight the hedge funds (final scene in the movie).",

To give some context, Sumo Logic is machine data analytics company and operates in a similar tech space to Splunk for the collecting of server log data and processing that information. Splunk for YEARS has been the king of the market but lately (last 5 years or so) the SaaS market for B2B has been taking a turn into more newer niche markets with better entry/subscription pricing models and diversified integration software. And *cough* *cough* away from java / old programming language based platforms...\n\nSO - looking at Sumo Logic's business portfolio, they hit all these niche markers, have a good product portfolio, and have been performing better than Splunk since early December 2020. When combined with other trend indicators like RSI, and EMA(9,30,200) - it is feeling like the start of a buyers market for long-term investment at a moderately low price to entry.\n\n---\n\nBut - I want to probe the people here and ask, what do you think? Is this a sound analysis? Whats the cons?",

        "selftext": "This is what I think happens. The brokers and the clearing houses are the ones providing the financial instruments for the shorters (they're the ones who let the stock be more then 100% shorted btw...) They are the ones receiving the vast majority of interests and fees for these options. Unless I am mistaken, the APY interests on the shorts are mostly paid to them. This is also the reason why they themselves are on the hook for delivery of the contract.\n\nSo given this situation, the clearing houses know the shorters do not have enough collateral to pay for the current shorted shares. They decided to not margin call, since these are their most important customers and it would bankrupt them.\n\nHowever, since they haven't done this they know they are liable to have to pay for it themselves and they're on the line now too.\n\nSo they decided two things (I'm guessing here) :\n\n* first: current shorts can be held indefinitely until the price goes down, they decided that the shorters don't need to pay the APY or they keep it very reduced (only the fees that go directly to the shareholders who have borrowed their shares, if any is paid).\n* second: they decided to limit the buying power of the retail investor. By doing this, they prevent the price from rising even more (the shorts are currently held and not covered, so no buying pressure from their side). They intend to keep this situation until the price has dropped enough (by us getting bored and trying to get people to sell) and they can safely cover their positions (with big losses, but nothing bankrupting)\n\nIf this doesn't work, they can still try to make new shorts in order to deliver on the previous shorts and just put the shorts higher and higher. As long as they do not need to disclose truthfully their shorts and positions or they are proven 100% by the retail investor, they can keep this situation going and then gain back their money once the price finally collapses (which it eventually will).\n\nSo how are we sure the brokers and shorters don't simply change the conditions of the shorts between themselves? Why would a broker bankrupt the shorter by margin calling or demanding huge fees and interests when they know they'll have to pay themselves if the Hedge funds go down? Especially since the total lack of transparency concerning these shorts gives them a lot of leeway to change things however they please.\n\nCould anyone inform me where I might be wrong or if this is plausible? I haven't found any answers to these questions on WSB so far.",

        "selftext": "Let's say...\n\n* I already own 100 share of &lt;whatever&gt; (or I'm buying 100 share of &lt;whatever&gt;). \n* Bullish but nervous about a market crash that might happen soon. \n* Don't care about dividend (or pretend I'm using a stock without dividend)\n\nA protective put let me sleep better at night, however it is expensive. Then natural evolution is to then sell a call to pay for it we turn this into a near zero cost collar. \n\nFor me this is a win win. Maybe you disagree but let's just say this is what I want to do. I can still participate in some gains and get protection against major crash. I'm pretty happy with this strategy.\n\nHowever now I'm wondering what's the point of the long stock when I can construct a bull put spread? \n\nExample using ARKW...\n\nhttp://opcalc.com/n7p stock + collar\n\nEntry cost is zero In this example I have 15.8k worth of stock sitting there... alternative perspective is if I don't own it yet I'm spending 15.8k to buy it. \n\nhttp://opcalc.com/n7s spread\n\nDollar wise extremely similar profit and loss. If I had the 100 share already I would sell it and get 15.8k back in cash. Margin requirement is only difference between the two strikes and I can apply credit received, so (178.11-135-19.65)*100 = 2346. \n\nLooks to me I can make very similar profits/loss with 2 choices... 1) have 15.8k capital tied up in 100 shares + collar or 2) don't own stock and tie up 2.3k in margin requirement with put spread. With the spread and freeing up capital, I'm not saying to go to buy more of these spreads and leverage up. I can find other safe plays or even just let it sit as cash and have dry powder on hand.\n\nMy conclusion is... if I'm not concerned about collecting dividends the spread seems always better.\n\nAm I missing something here? Is there any advantage with collar I'm over looking or is it a no-brainer to sell the stock (or skip buying it) and enter a spread?",
