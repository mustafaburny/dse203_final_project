        "selftext": "I've read countless books on fundamental analysis, including the Intelligent Investor. Dozens of swing trading books, technical analysis books, and day trading strategies. I've taken online courses through my local University in finance (working on an MBA). I do hours upon hours of research before investing in anything, yet everything I touch just gets destroyed. I bought Novagold this year. Next day, short report. Stock plummets. Luckin Coffee? Scandal, fraud, delisted twice, worthless stock. I bought BEN thinking it was a wise long call for dividend growth. Just keeps plummeting. When I bought Tesla and Netflix, they both sank. I've bought endless stocks when they've hit below the lower bollinger bands, and everytime I do, they just go lower (with no news mind you). I bought AAPL yesterday, thinking $386 was a good discount value purchase. PLUMMETING AGAIN. I just don't get it. When a company comes out with a great earnings report and I buy, the stock tanks. When a company comes out with bad earnings, it goes straight up after I short it. I could literally pull letters out of a hat and have better success.\n\nEdit:  I should point out that I do day trade, and I wasn't actually referring to day trading, which I feel like is just a different game than investing.  Thanks to the PDT rule, I can only trade 3x per week, and every week all my profits are offset by my investments.\n\nFINAL EDIT:  I'd just like to point out to save my sanity and refresh my outlook on life.  When the pandemic was at the bottom and I was getting into investing hardcore, I changed my and my wife's retirement allocations into index fund investments, so there's that.  Retirement funds are up 20% since April, which is crazy.  Thank god I'm not allowed to invest in individual stocks with my 403b.\n\nEdit:  Wow, this sub is great!  I am already feeling a lot better.  Never seen support in any other sub like this and was honestly just not checking my inbox because I assumed I was going to just get trolled all day.  Thanks for the wise words and support friends!  Time to move on to index funds for sure!  (Maybe if I can get back into the green on BEN and AAPL ever).",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow investors\n\nI recently put together the following portfolio, with the intention of not touching it for at least 10 years. Discuss your opinions in the comments, I'd be glad to hear your feedback!\n\n1) Amazon: 25%\n\nI feel like Amazon can't be stopped in the 2020s, it will completely obliberate every company who can't innovate and put their customers first. I've recently read the book \"bezonomics\" and I suggest everyone who doesn't fully understand this company to read it aswell. Amazon is number 1 by far in e-commerce and cloud computing, industries that are still very young and have a lot of potential. However, the thing I like most about Amazon is its ability to innovate and how they are able to \"spread their wings\" in every segment where there is money to be made.\n\n2) Microsoft: 15%\n\nThis one is pretty obvious and boring. Microsoft has always been a solid company, they have been through many freefalls of the tech market so that is a factor to keep in mind. Their new cloud computing platform \"Azure\" looks very promising, being the second biggest in the world (behind Amazon.) Microsoft has a very diversed business model and a good management team so they are not going anywhere.\n\n3) Apple: 10%\n\nApple is a very high quality company, with a fairly low PE ratio compared to other tech. I also feel like the rise of 5G is only going to make Apple stronger. \n\n4) Alibaba: 10%\n\nI can't forget about this Chinese tech giant! The growth in chinese consumer spending makes this stock really attractive to me. Alibaba pretty much has a monopoly in China concerning e-commerce and cloud computing services ( comparable to Amazon in the US.)\n\n5) Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: 10%\n\nThis company has many rather defensive stocks that will help the firm through recessions and economic downfalls, but this company will also keep riding the upward market trends. Berkshire is a great stabilizer that will round out your portfolio beautifully. One of the best long-term stocks in my opinion.\n\n5) Disney: 5%\n\nThis entertainment giant is still trading at a discount price and is set for a comeback rally any time soon, with the parks reopening etc. The company also pays a respectable amount of dividend, currently yielding at 1.62%.\n\n6) Walmart: 5%\n\nWalmart is often overlooked by investors, because of Amazon, but I strongly believe Walmart isn't going anywhere and is one of the few companies that won't get eaten by Amazon. Walmart also recently launched an e-commerce platform, trying to compete with Amazon. The company also pays a good dividend of 1.64%.\n\n7) Coca-Cola: 5%\n\nA personal favorite of mine, Coca-Cola! One of the strongest and most reliable brands in the world and my favorite dividend king. I love the current discount on this one, trading at 75% of its ATH. The dividend yield 3,5% is beautiful.\n\n8)  PepsiCo: 5%\n\nI feel like if I'm going to be adding Coca-Cola to my portfolio, I can't forget about PepsiCo. These 2 beverage giants are not going anywhere. The dividend yield of 3% is nice aswell.\n\n9)  Johnson &amp; Johnson: 5%\n\nEven though I don't know much about pharmaceutical stocks, I still love JNJ, mostly because of their growing dividend payout (for over 50+ years!)\n\n10)  McDonald's: 5%\n\nMy favorite fast food chain can't lack this portfolio.  When it comes to fast-casual dining, McDonald's is still the kingpin, and it's likely going to stay that way for a long time to come. The growing dividend payout (for 43 consecutive years) also looks really appealing to me.\n\nThanks and stay safe folks",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR:** A bit of DD for those wondering about what's going on with TSLA's recent sharp rise: a dramatic contraction of the \"free float\", which could trigger episodes of delta-hedging and short covering fueled positive feedback loops, also known as an \"Infinity Squeeze\".\n\n----\n\nThe most amazing infinity squeeze in history was VW's in 2008, when VW shares went from below \u20ac200 to over \u20ac1,000 within a single trading week, because there were more short positions than shares available (\"free float contraction\"):\n\n&gt; [**\"Hedge funds lose $30 billion on VW infinity squeeze\"**](https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/)\n\nThink about that, hedge funds shorted an **automaker** in fucking ***2008***, straight during the Lehman episode &amp; meltdown, when demand for new cars cratered, i.e. this was the best possible cannot-go-tits-up Big Short leveraged trade a fellow autist can dream up during a financial crisis, and they were *still* forced out of their positions in a massive short squeeze...\n\n----\nFast forward to 2020, during a raging bull market backstopped by Powell's brrrrrrrr machine, with over a million Robinhood retail traders armed with ~~financial weapons of mass destruction~~ leveraged options, and cue in Tesla's potential S&amp;P 500 addition, which would add TSLA with a bang at a nearly 1% weight: at today's $1,650+ price over $100b worth of TSLA shares (over 63m shares) will be held by passive and active funds benchmarked to the S&amp;P 500, in perhaps the most massive anti-dilutive share buyback program in history.\n\nFor those who want to watch this on video, here's a high quality analysis of the S&amp;P 500 inclusion from Tesla Daily:\n\n&gt; [\"Will Tesla Stock Keep Going Up? Exploring the Mechanics of S&amp;P 500 Inclusion (TSLA)\"](https://twitter.com/TeslaPodcast/status/1282932750543093760)\n\nOr another look at the float contraction caused by Tesla's S&amp;P 500 inclusion:\n\n&gt; [\"Tesla's S&amp;P 500 Inclusion: Predicting TSLA's post-inclusion stock price\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/hsvqus/teslas_sp_500_inclusion_predicting_tslas/)\n\nWhat neither the video nor the post detailed sufficiently are the non-dilutive &amp; float contraction effects of **options**, the delta hedging inventory in particular, which is somewhere around ~40m TSLA shares today, or 27% of the float - and which **goes up non-linearly as the TSLA price appreciates**.\n\nToday there's a near record amount of TSLA options open interest: 800,000 call contracts and 1,200,000 put contracts, representing a huge delta hedging range of +80m and -120m TSLA shares - but with a current bias for upward skewed TSLA price moves. A +$200 move in TSLA generates about 5,500,000 shares worth of TSLA buying by market makers. (-4% float contraction)\n\nAnd today a record value of TSLA shares are shorted (over $20b short interest VAR), with a short squeeze \"ongoing\" according to short squeeze experts S3 Partners, who called the early 2020 TSLA short squeeze:\n\n&gt; [\"With the market rising there will be more short squeezes, such as $TSLA, as short sellers buy-to-cover as losses mount\"](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1285251199889965057)\n\nIf we add up the various TSLA shareholder categories who **must** or are strongly incentivized to hold TSLA, we get:\n\nShareholders | float taken out of circulation\n---|---\nPassive index funds |  26,000,000 shares\nActive funds benchmarked to the S&amp;P 500 | 37,000,000 shares\nDelta-hedging at $1,500 | ~40,000,000 shares or more\nNon-S&amp;P-500 indices already holding TSLA | ~20,000,000 shares\nShorts covering | up to ~5,000,000 shares (14m shares short today)\n | =\nSUM | = ~128,000,000 shares\ntotal free float | = ~147,000,000 shares\n\nMost of these entities **will be forced to buy TSLA at any price** and will take those shares out of circulation for a long time.\n\nThe next time the index funds will even consider selling some of their TSLA will be after the December reindexing, and because historically Tesla's Q3 and Q4 are the strongest quarters, there's a fair chance that the TSLA weight will further increase in December, triggering *more* accumulation.\n\nYeah, **over 85% of the float will be locked up by long-term holders** - or short covering which destroys virtual long shares anti-dilutively, which is recipe for a short squeeze + delta hedging positive feedback loop to drive an \"Infinity Squeeze\" to infinity and beyond. (In reality I think a trillion dollars valuation at $5,400 will probably be a limit to any spike.)\n\nFor the \"it's already priced in!\" crew: **it cannot be priced in** due to a design flaw in the S&amp;P 500 methodology (which flaw modern indices do not have), despite everyone knowing about S&amp;P 500 inclusion, the \"Index Effect\" is real and substantial, because $4.6t of passive S&amp;P 500 index funds **cannot buy before inclusion**, and because the Tesla event is so fucking huge &amp;  unprecedented.\n\nFor those who like to combine fundamental analysis with technical indicators and quant arguments, TSLA trading volume is already showing signs of 'float contraction':\n\n- Yesterday 17.7m TSLA shares were traded, which is **over 12% of the TSLA free float**, in a single trading day.\n- Last week over 105m TSLA shares were traded, which is **over 70% of the TSLA free float**, in a single trading week\n- Last month over 300m TSLA shares were traded, which is **over 200% of the TSLA free float**\n\nAs a comparison: last week, when AAPL has hit new all-time highs, the turnover was just 4% of the float (!)...\n\nA TSLA infinity squeeze will be slower than the VW squeeze IMO, but with a more permanent price increase, and during what appears to be a bull market so far.\n\nTomorrow Tesla will report Q2 earnings, which Wall Street expectations are an EPS loss and a GAAP loss.\n\nIf Tesla beats expectations and posts a profit, no matter how small, it will become eligible for the S&amp;P 500.\n\nTimeline of the addition: while the next S&amp;P 500 index rebalancing occurs on September 18, **there's no such timetable to additions**, which can be announced as quickly as 1 week after the company reports results - or as late as 7 weeks after the ER. This is one of the reason why many funds cannot buy TSLA in advance.\n\nIf Tesla is added then big index funds will get a couple of days advance notice from the S&amp;P 500 committee - but for that Tesla has to post profits first, which is uncertain.\n\nDisclaimer: this is not advice, I might be wrong &amp; degenerate, trade on your own risk and gamble responsibly!\n\n----\n\n**TL;DR:** If this indeed happens (which it might not), then pretty much any TSLA call options post the S&amp;P 500 announcement will go up in value.\n\nEven super deep out of the money $3,000 calls expiring this Friday quadrupled in value yesterday already...",

        "selftext": "Hello retards, it's me, your dad.\n\nI'm sorry I left, boys, that yoga teacher wasn't going to bang herself and your mom had gotten to be a nag about my whisky habit.\n\nIn lieu of raising you, I'm going to give you this. It will make you marginally better at trading.  You might actually end up making money, which is WAY better than having the sort of life long self worth having a loving and present father would have given you.\n\n\nThis post is going to be so fucking basic for you newfucks that we've got about T-minus 5 fucking seconds until some dude named Eggbert jumps on my dick about Laffer curves and tries to steal your fucking money by confusing you all his brain wrinkles.  Don't let him.\n\nThis shit isn't hard newfucks.  You don't need to be taken by surprise every time.  You don't need to get fucked on days like today. You don't need an degree.  You need three basic things.\n\n1. A CHART OF THE MOTHERFUCKING STONK IN QUESTION\n\n2. A WAY TO DRAW A LINE ON THAT CHART IN SOME MOTHERFUCKING WAY.  You can smear it with your shit, you can use a ruler. I don't care.  If you can draw a line, you can do this and not get fucked. I use TOS, which is way, way too hard for most of you to use at this point in your \"career\".  But have at it if you want to.\n\n3. THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THAT ONCE YOU HAVE PURCHASED AN OPTION, YOU CAN STOP THE PAIN OR PLEASURE AT ANY TIME BY CONVERTING IT INTO A SPREAD.  More on this in a minute.\n\nAlright, my smoothbrained beauties.  You're still here. There is hope for you yet.\n\nTHIS, MOTHERFUCKERS, IS A CHART OF APPLE THIS MORNING.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/IHIykMX.png\n\nLook at it, it goes up and down.  Like your mom. Does she still have those cute dimples on her ass?  Maybe you're in a call on this stonk, like me, from the day before and you wake up feeling pretty fucking alright about your profits.  BUT STONKS SOMETIMES GO DOWN.  So here is what you need to do to know if that's going to happen.\n\nTake a line, and draw it between the low points on the chart, like this. (Jesus Christ I'm already tired of typing, why am I doing this.)\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/X9RazHI.png\n\nLOOK AT THAT YOU SUPERCHROMOSOMAL DICKFUCKS!  It is a trend.  The lows are less low every time.  And the stock seems to bounce away from the trend line every time.  It will keep doing this, forever, because of thermodynamics or some shit until something external changes.\n\nThen, at the end of the line.  Something changes.  The low at the very end of the line is LOWER than the trend. \n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/dVY6YDu.png\n\n Now it's time to really pay attention Your tendies are might be close to done cooking.\n\nAnd what do you know, we IMMEDIATELY we get a new trend. (Holy fuck, I need a drink, how am I still typing)\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/EDoly8O.png\n\nNow, if you're like me, and want to take profits wherever you can, this break from GOING UP to DOING SOMETHING THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN GOING UP is where you sell.  I watched the candles go downsies, waited for them to turn around and go upsies one more time, and sold at 398.75.\n\n\nLOOK AT THIS, WE ARE NOW FLAT FOR A WHILE.\n\nTwo things that could happen here.  \n\n1. We could start to go higher.\n\n2. We could also not start to go higher.\n\nIn this case, we went with number two.  Stonk did not always go up.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/08bOBeX.png\n\nAs you can see, a downtrend started at 9:41am my time.\n\nAt which point I posted this.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/a9OlP5y.png\n\nAnd a pure fucking genius posted immediately after.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/rttrKUU.png\n\nWho was right?  The chad 'tard, or the dude with the POWER OF CRAYONS?\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/9AI5ksD.png\n\nOk, so now you have a very, very dim view of when a stock has changed from doing one thing, to doing something different.  It gets far more complicated, but this is a good start.\n\n\"BUT DAD!\" I hear your voice say.  I'm up and I did the thing and now I think it might go down, but I'm OUT OF DAY TRADES.\n\nCome here, you little shit.\n\nCloser.\n\ncloser.\n\n##SELL A MOTHERFUCKING CALL, DIPSHIT!\n\nGo to robinhood. Find your fucking option. and\n\n##SELL THE STRIKE RIGHT ABOVE IT ON THE SAME DATE\n\nWhat if you're one of my gay sons?\n\n##SELL THE PUT RIGHT BELOW IT ON THE SAME DATE\n\nI went to the fucking trouble, I don't know why I bother, of actually doing this today to illustrate it for you tards.  Here is what it looks like.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/K3fVuhB.png\n\nNow, MY GAINS ARE LOCKED IN. AND I DIDN'T DO A DAY TRADE.\n\nThere you go, my boys.  That's what I've got.\n\nIf you're up more than 80% in a month, come find me.  I'll teach you how to work on a muscle car, we can get into a fist fight and patch things up.

        "selftext": "Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?p=AAPL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) reported its Q3 2020 earnings on Thursday, providing investors and analysts with a more fuller look at how deeply the coronavirus pandemic has impacted the company\u2019s sales over the past several months.\n\nThese are the most important numbers from the report compared to analysts\u2019 expectations as compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n* **Revenue:** $59.69 billion versus $52.3 billion expected\n* **Earnings per share:** $2.58 versus $2.07 expected\n* **iPhone revenue:** $26.42 billion versus $30.9 billion expected.\n* **Services revenue:** $13.2 billion versus $13.1 billion expected\n* **Accessories:** $6.5 billion versus $6.1 billion expected\n\nApple\u2019s earnings come just a day after CEO Tim Cook sat before the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law to answer accusations that the company abuses its market power to [stifle competition in the Apple App Store](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-hit-with-questions-on-app-store-dominance-during-antitrust-hearing-224150894.html).\n\nThe company\u2019s Q3 report, however, hasn\u2019t been much of a focus for analysts, as much of the conversation about Apple has revolved around the tech giant\u2019s upcoming launch of its iPhone 12. The next-generation iPhone is expected to be Apple\u2019s first 5G-capable device and could lead to a so-called \u201csuper cycle,\u201d during which the company would see a larger than normal uptick in iPhone sales.\n\nThe idea is that consumers who have held on to their devices for several years will jump at the chance to get a new iPhone with a new form of cellular connectivity that promises dramatically increased data.\n\nBut with consumer personal consumption spending in Q2 [falling a whopping 34.6%](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q2-gdp-us-economy-coronavirus-pandemic-consumer-171558880.html) due to COVID-19 shutdowns, and more than [50 million Americans out of the workforce](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobless-claims-week-ending-july-25-123150219.html), investor hopes of a massive uptick in year-over-year iPhone sales in the coming quarters may not be in the cards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-q3-earnings-2020-203224360.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-q3-earnings-2020-203224360.html)",

        "selftext": "These past few days/weeks, we've seen some truly absurd moves in tech. Today alone, Tesla was up 10 percent, Netflix was up 8 percent, and Amazon is up about 20% the past few weeks on basically no news. Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Nvidia, etc. are all at or above their mid-February valuations. What spooks me is not that these equities are moving upward, but it's that they are moving upward quickly and impulsively, with few pullbacks, and leaving the rest of the market in the dust. These are not the signs of a healthy new bull market; they are the signs of rampant speculation, euphoria, and greed. These mega-cap corporations are propping up the indices and are almost acting as safe havens for investors pulling out of travel, financials, consumer staples, energy, etc. We saw this rotation in full force yesterday when the Dow ended over -1% while the Nasdaq was around +0.5%. This is not to say that I think we are on the brink of collapse--bubbles can last a lot longer than any of us think they might.\n\nFor those of you who have exposure to big tech, how are you managing it?

        "selftext": "So I'm drinking while thinking about historical precedent for how long it will take Tesla to hit 1 trillion dollars market cap by comparison of other companies that hit that milestone, starting from where tesla is today, roughly 200 billion. If I strap on my helmet for some mental math, this is how many years a few others took\n\nMicrosoft 10 \n\nApple 7 \n\nAmazon 3\n\nSo I would be extremely surprised if Elon doesn't do this at least in as short of a time as Apple or Amazon.

        "selftext": "I bought my first TSLA shares on IPO day amid everyone from Jim Cramer to auto industry friends making compelling counterarguments:\n\n* \u201cThey can\u2019t make a profit/They\u2019re hemorrhaging money.\u201d\n* \u201cOther car companies are going to make electric cars and eat their lunch.\u201d\n* \u201cWhat are you, fucking stupid?\u201d\n\nI still have those shares, and many more I bought along the way. I think it is more than a $1200/share company, and this is my optimistic justification.\n\n1. Tesla has more or less consistently maintained a decent gross margin, usually higher than most other automotive companies. They\u2019ve mostly been in the position where they could be consistently profitable if they only focused on existing products. They\u2019ve seen a huge expansion in the last few years, outfitting and growing the Fremont factory, Nevada\u2019s factory, Buffalo, and Shanghai, as well as dozens of other small operations around those areas. Germany is coming up, Austin soon, ramping up design, manufacturing, and business employees for new products in automotive, solar, stationary storage\u2026 all that and a consistently increasing revenue, and still people say \u201cThEy LoSt $0.20 PeR ShArE ThEy\u2019Re HeMoRrHaGiNg MoNeY\u201d\n2. Electric cars are better. More power, way fewer moving parts, lower total cost of ownership, and there are also mandates by many countries to go all EV. You say that GM and Toyota will start making electric cars and take their share? Car companies are bureaucratic design-by-committee dinosaurs afraid of anything but incremental change. They will forever be one step behind with a worse car that nobody is excited about. People who own Tesla cars love them, and people who don\u2019t own them want one. Ain\u2019t nobody excited about the next Corolla. Ain\u2019t nobody give a fuck what loaf Fiat is pinching off next year. Fifteen years from now Tesla will absolutely be worth what Toyota is worth, and probably also a couple other auto companies that won\u2019t make it. $285B\n3. Self driving is coming. Probably not tomorrow, but within the timeframe of investment consideration. Self driving is a data problem, and Tesla has fuckloads more data than anyone else. More than they know what to do with. If a car can safely drive itself, the car manufacturer isn\u2019t going to sell those cars to Uber. They\u2019re going to start their own app and slide the entire market cap of ride sharing companies into their own. $100B\n4. In a few months, it\u2019s speculated that Tesla will announce its million-mile battery. This is important for a couple of reasons. It will help them take over the trucking industry with a far cheaper per-mile product ($40B). It also allows the cars to be used for stationary storage. You don\u2019t need a 400 mile range every day. You almost never need it. Plug in your car at night and charge it up with cheap electricity. Drive to work and plug it in and set your car to sell back some energy at peak hours. This is what some people are speculating battery day will be about. You need what, 15 miles of range to get home? Sell the rest, make some money. Tesla will take something like 30% just like Apple does when you sell an app. Their $40,000 car now has a total cost of ownership less than a $20,000 gas car. You gonna buy a Tesla or a Kia Forte? If this happens, Tesla sells fuckloads more cars, and makes fuckloads more money as an energy selling middle man. 100B\n5. Short shorts. 0.005B\n6. Stationary storage and solar. Nobody making batteries like Tesla making batteries, and their solar is getting cheaper and growing rapidly. I\u2019m tired of typing, you're tired of reading. $75B\n\n$600 Billion dollar market cap. $3250 share price.\n\nBut what about Ghislaine Maxwell? And what happens when NIO steals all their secrets? What about Elon\u2019s obviously deteriorating health and the fact that his brother is 2/3rds lizard person? If those things are worrying you, literally reevaluate your entire life.\n\n\u201cYou make a compelling argument BonerballsDickfart, but they haven\u2019t actually done any of that yet.\u201d Yeah, no fucking shit, investing isn\u2019t about what\u2019s done, it\u2019s about what\u2019s going to be done. For years, the question was whether or not Tesla could survive and deliver. They just made it through a global pandemic better than any other car company. Investors are realizing all this shit is coming, and that\u2019s why the stock is shooting up. Am I wrong? Possibly. I did just write 800 words to a subreddit that can\u2019t be bothered to read the bottom of a Snapple bottle cap. I also probably overdid the addy this morning and I haven\u2019t taken a shit in two days. It\u2019s also possible that Elon goes full Howard Hughes, starts pissing in milk jars, names his kid something nonsensical and endorses Kanye West for president.\n\nBut what are the odds of that?\n\nTL;DR Eat several bags of dicks.\n\nTSLA Oct20 Calls, scroll through the strike prices until you find a dollar amount you can afford to lose.",

        "selftext": "Its the way the whole Tesla empire and the way Musk is going about building Tesla. Depending on where you live, you may not even know anyone who owns a Tesla or even seen one before in person, but Tesla is a household name. It's like an early Apple style, not everyone had their products but everyone knew what Apple was doing. Everyone says they keep losing money but they are expanding like crazy, following an early (and still today) Amazon strategy.\n\nTaking the two strategies both companies used to make them how successful they are today, and combining. Im not going to go into each strategy in detail because. Both of these are insanely large companies together valued at over $3 Trillion combined. Someone will tell me \"not everyone can afford a Tesla\" and I say doesnt matter, and lets now move into speculation. After all, we have learned recently the market is nothing more than retarded speculation.\n\nLets look into how far technology can go. Say solar technology becomes  so advanced Musk can give them to you for free, because he just keeps the electricity and it pays for the profit. If he can give that to everyone for free, everyone who needs a new roof will have saved $20k on what a normal roof would cost. That $20k is basically $20k off a new car if you are shopping for one, and if you buy a Tesla you can charge it at home and eliminate your fuel bill completely. Tesla is going to make financial sense, and every home owner in America is going to own a Tesla simply. This will open the doors to more people buying Tesla and effectively if you are well off enough to buy a home, you will almost certainly own a Tesla\n\n**Tl;dr: Tesla $3,250 share price issue most reasonably accurate in present day using the points I have read from others from the way Musk is taking Tesla**\n\nNow when this happens and actually becomes common, this is when Tesla is going to be sued for being a monopoly since they control two huge aspects of your life, part of your home and your transportation. Musk also has the Boring company, any city with traffic issues will want one and he can convince them to buy it. He will be making money from not only selling us the cars that take us around, but he will be building the tunnels that become our roads. You can quote me on this when I say that Tesla is going to be the first company since 1982 to be broken up by a government, and the best time to cash out will be right before this happens because even though Tesla is not technically the same company as solar panels and tunnels, there will still be some special ruling on it to break it up and no doubt cause a stock dip\n\nNow lets move on to r/WallStreetBet levels of retarded speculation. Musk knows this and he wont allow it to happen to Tesla. With his endorsement of Kanye West recently, showing the world he is willing to play around with politics, as any wannabe monopoly should to prevent being broken up. Now not saying Kanye is going to be winning this one (although apparently the world is fucking crazy so who even knows) but Musk has shown he can become friendly with the politicians and get them in bed, so Tesla will not be broken up. Tesla has the product to back this business model up, a benefit to citizens to not complain about what Tesla is doing, and politicians in his pocket because he is making so much fucking money\n\n**Tl;dr: \\~$17,000 share price**\n\nSo of course I know this subreddit, and shit never gets too retarded with speculation, so lets keep going and see what the FAR far future can hold for Tesla\n\nLets do a fucking retarded speculation that solar panels get so good, they can pay you a steady income and all you gotta do is have a solar roof. Musk just gave every homeowner a \"UBI\" before the government did. The better the panel technology gets, the more he can pay you. With the government in bed and UBI in place musk can have lawmakers make it law that do drive a car on the road, it has to be a self driving Tesla because Tesla is the only one to be doing this on this scale, and Musk knows you can afford it because Musk knows how much sunlight his panels profit you. Just like how today it is required for all cars to have a seatbelt for safety, self driving will be a requirement for all cars on public roads. Every driver in the country will be buying a Tesla, because Musk will be in bed with the politicians and the public will be non the wiser of what is happening because it is a benefit to everyone. Musk at this point is  worth so much he can knock out anyone who dares try and challenge him because he the Jeff Bezos of Jeff Bezos.\n\nNow lets move on to tinfoil hat level speculation, Elon is going after a ton of industries that are huge or will be huge soon, but Tesla is the biggest and will be the \"main\" brand. People said that Jeff Bezos is going to be the worlds first trillionaire, but I say it will be Elon Musk. He is going to take over or continue taking over so many large aspects of all the things people spend the most on (Transportation, Housing and Energy). Tesla will be huge but his solar roof will be his most successful product of all time once the technology gets there. With the insane amount of money this generates for him, he can now afford to buy literally every other company out from any industry and start his takeover of the world, and the enslavement of all of humanity because at this point it is too late to stop him and if people try and rise up against him he can cut all power to the world and prevent transportation by disabling vehicles, sitting up in his space fortress laughing at us. He will allow us electricity and transport and life as long as we continue to be ruled by him. He will have infinite wealth as he owns and controls everything, under the Tesla name. The only thing we will be left truly \"owning\" is our Tesla shares, because everything is now Tesla. He has expressed his interest in experimental weapons like his flamethrower and will use force if necessary to control humans and will do it all from space.\n\n**Tl;dr: Buy TSLA shares because Tesla shares are literally going to be the currency of the future as Papa Musk reigns over humanity**",

        "selftext": "Hey fucktards. Listen up, because I probably don't have much time left on this planet. I am legit looking behind me every 5 seconds as I type this, cause shit is about to get pretty feisty for me.\n\nSome of you may have already seen my comment on the daily thread, and everything I said was true. So get some popcorn, get snug with your wife's boyfriend, and enjoy the story.\n\nFor some context, I'm pretty well off. Yes, we exist. Sorry my parents aren't strippers like yours. Tell me....what happens when you have 2 well-educated (Masters degrees) computer engineers in Director positions at well-renowned companies who have been working for around 30 years now, and these people live a pretty humble life??\n\nDing ding ding, correct. They have a hell of a nest egg. So yes, I received a \"small loan\" of $100,000. My parents' intention was for me to invest this money in solid blue-chip stocks, and possibly use the money to pay for a future graduate degree or use it as a down-payment for a house. \n\nWhat did I do instead? I found this fucking sub, the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy first stupid play: Put $10,000 into GNUS cause I read some dumbass article about how its going to be the \"next Netflix for kids\". What do you think happened the minute I bought the STOCK (not even options)......yup, correct!!!!111!!!!!1! It dropped down from 11 to fucking 3 bucks. Haven't checked that shit in a while but its probably like 1 dollar at this point. Stupid ass company\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy second stupid play: OK so I thought, why not just go for the ACTUAL Netflix?? Literally can't fo tits up, right? Right?? Wrong. I played NFLX earnings. Put $10,000 into it, had +$10,000 gain, wanted even more money. What do you think happened in the next 2 days as I bagheld?? Lost every single penny of it. Well not every single penny, I was able to take back a respectable 40 bucks from my initial $10,000 investment. So -10,000 there.\n\nMy third and final stupid play: Put $17,000 into MSFT calls. OK I thought. Now this one DEFINITELY cant make me go Guh, its literaly fucking Microsoft. Solid company, they beat earnings, Satya Nadella is a chad, etc etc. Wrong once again. The MINUTE I buy these stupid retarded calls, the stock price shoots down to 199 from 211. I sit and watch The value of my 17k call go down to a mere 2k.\n\nToday I wake up and my dad randomly asks if he can \"check my account\", just to see how things are going. He says \"you probably have like a decent ten percent gain, right?\" and as I mutter something under my breath. My palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy, as he begins to type my password in. When the number flashes on the screen...\\*71k\\*, he spits out his water. \n\nGot around a 3 hour lecture, thats all I want to comment about that. So I hear I am sitting, typing up this bullshit for you autists, wondering whether I'm going to be able to eat dinner tonight. \n\nIf I could do it all over again, either I would actually stick to blue chip-stocks, and only play with \"house money\" if I was gonna do options, or just not play this stupid fucking rigged game at all, and check my account again in ten years when Apple is like $10,000 and Tesla is $100,000. Set it and forget it. Oh well, its to late now.\n\nSo buy up some cheap puts on my life, hope you guys enjoyed this story.",

        "selftext": "Every now and then, a pennystock comes around that makes you think: How the hell is this a pennystock? How is this valued so low?\n\nWell my coworkers and I have been trading for a long time, and this is very likely one of them. *(Computer geeks are going to love this especially).*\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n$OSS, One Stop Systems, since its IPO in 2018, has been silently building a tech empire behind our backs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(*You're gonna lose your literal mind when you read the next part:*)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**They are officially partnered with:** Apple, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Boeing, IBM, Lenovo, HP, Lyft, Puma, Toshiba, Thunderbolt, Universal Audio, Focusrite, and Cisco etc... These are only 15 of their 50+ major international partnerships.\n\n*(yes, this is a pennystock.)*\n\n**U.S. Military:** On top of this, OSS also has multiple million-dollar contracts with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Military, as they provide the pre-constructed systems and power required for AI intelligence, DLSS, and large scale data transfer.\n\n*(This sub goes batshit crazy when a pennystock lands even ONE of the above partnerships. They have more than 50 already in motion.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What do they do? What makes them so special?**\n\nOSS in layman\u2019s terms is a company that takes top-end processors and GPUs, and uses their PCIe gen 4.0 expansion technology to merge them into a military-grade/data center supercomputer.\n\nBut aren\u2019t there many companies that can do this? No. They are the only company in the world with a PCIe 4.0 expansion system that can support NVIDIA\u2019s top end GPU\u2019s. (*Nvidia A-100*)\n\nThis means that they own nearly 100% of the market share in Nvidia's latest PCIe GPU technology.\n\n*(PCIe gen 3.0 is the only other option, but is 50% slower than PCIe 4.0.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What else makes them so special?** Their Financials.\n\nCompare their financials to the pennystocks we always talk about on this subreddit. It\u2019s absurd. They ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY.\n\nOSS's latest 10-K showed a record $ 60 MILLION in revenue, a 57% increase YoY.\n\nSome of the biggest companies in the world like Amazon, took over 10 years to make their first dollar. \n\nOSS is only on YEAR 2 and they are only $1 MILLION away from becoming a profitable operation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How is this possible?** Three reasons:\n\n1. They completely dominate the high-end PCIe sector of the tech industry. I challenge you to find a single other PCIe 4.0 expansion system on the market.\n2. Their CEO David Raun has led two companies to record revenues in the PCIe and NVMe industry, and one was bought out by Broadcom.\n3. They are at the forefront of far too many industries that require this level of technology. (see below for a few examples)\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThey are the preferred OEM for Nvidia:\n\n[OSS Introduces the World's First and only PCIe 4.0 Expansion System for Nvidia.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oss-introduces-world-first-pcie-150010777.html)\n\n[OSS and Nvidia](https://www.onestopsystems.com/nvidia-gpus)\n\n[Official PR from NVIDIA](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/worlds-top-system-makers-unveil-nvidia-a100-powered-servers-to-accelerate-ai-data-science-and-scientific-computing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nU.S. Military Defense:\n\n[OSS Military Defense, Navy, Air, and Ground forces.](https://www.onestopsystems.com/defense)\n\n[Latest Order from U.S. Navy](https://ir.onestopsystems.com/press-releases/detail/163/oss-orders-for-new-u-s-navy-ai-threat-detection-system-top)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAI Learning, DLSS, and Self-driving vehicles:\n\n[OSS Reveals World's First Solution for AI Learning that incorporates NVIDIA GPUs and ARM-based servers.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/19/1949447/0/en/OSS-Introduces-Industry-s-First-Solution-Incorporating-NVIDIA-GPUs-with-NVLink-and-Marvell-ThunderX2-Arm-based-Servers.html)\n\n[OSS AI on the Fly](https://www.onestopsystems.com/ai-on-the-fly)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMachine Learning:[ OSS Machine Learning Systems](https://www.onestopsystems.com/machine-learning)\n\nMedical:[ OSS Medical Pre-built Systems](https://www.onestopsystems.com/medical)\n\nOil Industry:[ OSS Oil and Gas Industry Systems](https://www.onestopsystems.com/oil-and-gas)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are about a hundred more links, presentations, and conference calls that could be added to this post, but it would simply make it too long. *(We will be releasing follow up posts throughout the week to break up the information.)*\n\n$2 for a pennystock generating $60 million of revenue in its second year?\n\n$2 for a company that literally dominates an entire section of its industry?\n\n$2 for a company that is partnered with over 50+ major companies?\n\n$2 for a company that literally makes DOUBLE its ENTIRE MARKET CAP?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Vanguard increases their holdings by 103%, something's up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*(Further in-depth analysis will be posted tomorrow and throughout the week.)*\n\nA few of the topics to be covered are: product and competitor assessment, corporate presentations/conference calls, and financial breakdown.

        "selftext": "Hello, european oor here, just looking for some tips and strategies in case the market decides to shit itself again.  \nI have a couple of questions to start the discussion:  \n1. Is the march dip a good example to look at? I entered gambling right after the rally (yeah, i know, lucky me) but i feel like biotech is way bigger now than it was before it. Would that mean there is more to lose in that sector?  \n2. If and when the market crashes, what companies are you looking to short? In the same vein, when the rally afterwards comes, which companies are you looking to buy into?  More specifically, which companies do you think will suffer the hardest during the crash, and which will gain the most during the rally? For example wouldnt it be smarter to short a smaller company compared to AAPL? Even if their share value goes from 360 to 260, sure, they lose 100 dollars per share, but, say a company whose shares go from 50 to 1 is a way bigger win in terms of percentages.  \n3. Is there a way to play both sides in a wave strategy, say if theres some companies/ a sector thats gonna dip/rally faster than others, so that one could play on those first, and, after maximizing profits on it, move onto another play. In march for example i think microsoft took a day or two longer to start dipping compared to the majority.  \nAny ideas and tips are welcome, if not for me, then for other americans in here that might read the thread.  \nI currently reside in the UK, so my options are limited (ha, get it?), since we dont have RH here yet. I use the trading212 platform and i intend to use CFD for my plays if and when the time comes. Winnings might not be as big as on options, but they still beat plain old shares.",

        "selftext": "Big Tech just beat earnings massively. Apple, Facebook, Amazon pumped NASDAQ almost +2% after hours, and SPY +1%. This is going to lead us to new all-time highs, mark my words. Big Tech is literally dragging SPY higher and higher despite them making such an overwhelming market share. I am impressed with how these companies have handled the pandemic. I'm even more impressed they managed to turn record profits. \n\nThose who were expecting another leg down are now preparing for their funeral pyres. I was bearish before but the massive earnings beat today just seals the deal: it's time to be bullish now. Pandemic just hasn't hit the economy as hard, with the exception of travel/airlines.

        "selftext": "Obviously not much going on today other than the regular Fed-induced algo ramp.\n\nTomorrow the real tech earnings start, and things crescendo into AAPL GOOG AND FB - ALL. IN. THE. SAME. DAY.\n\nI think this day will be a nuclear down day, but strangely enough I have some 7/31 calls to catch the run up before Thurs. Because I do really think it will run up, and the hammer won't really come down on everything until Thurs. Maybe Wed.\n\nBut think about this.... FB moved from Wed to Thurs. Why? WHY? I'll tell you what I think... They know the numbers are so bad that they want to be floating in the same pool as the other big boys when the hammer drops. They want to drag the others to hell with them. The last thing they want is to be singled out for a 15% one-day drop, and have the next day be a huge green wave they don't participate in. \n\nThey know their earnings are a shit sammich - and they're gonna make everybody take at least one bite.\n\nOf all big tech, FB wil be hit the hardest I think. They're getting priced like corona is helping them because of stay at home, but if you stop and think about it, think about how wrong this is:\n\n1. They make all their money from advertising. No one is advertising. Their revenue has been butchered. You can try to make yourself feel better thinking about how they're diversified, but they just aren't Same for Google - 95% of their money comes from online advertising. That money is gone.\n2. Twitter demonstrated how bad online advertising is hurting last week, but they bumped up because everyone and their fucking grandma installed Twitter because everyone is afraid and wants news. Everyone who was on FB was already on FB, no one started using it more because they're hom - they started using shit like ZOOM, and TWTR, and AMZN, and you know, the shit people started using a lot. FB -same - so no bump in trajectory to make the dollar numbers easier to swallow. It's straight fucking down, and they want to stick a little bit of that to GOOG and AMZN if they can.",

        "selftext": "TLDR: Any Call strike in 2021 or 2022\n\n**Detailed DD:**\n\nAlmost a penny stock till last month.\n\nIt has seen major movement in the last few weeks.\n\nThe key catalysts being:\n\n1. Getting $1B semi-govt funding and raising $485m by issuing equity: which takes away the bankruptcy fears which have been driving it down in the recent months. Enough liquidity now till 2022\n2. The actual car delivery numbers have sky rocketed in the last 3 months m-o-m and y-o-y\n\nCommon misconceptions:\n\n1. Owned by the chinese govt: No it is not owned by the Govt, the investment was by Hefei City Construction and Investment Holding. Think of it similar to the usual tax-breaks and other incentives offered by local county/state govts here, but instead of just giving free money, they are instead taking 24.1% of equity in the new entity created, and in return the province gets a premium car maker to set base and generate employment\n2. Nio like all Chinese cars is shit quality: No, based on anecdotal feedback all the Nio models are very premium with great interiors at par with Lexus. Infact in terms of premium feel of interiors and experience, Nio is heads and shoulders above Tesla's low cost plastic feel\n3. Battery swap is a deal breaker: Actually Nio cars can be charged using both a Supercharger as well as battery swap.\n\nSome strengths of Nio:\n\n1. Battery swap: It takes away the biggest risk of owning a EV vehicle. Also, the 4 minute battery swap also includes a full diagnostics run in parallel for the car. It can also upgrade systems during the swap. If there is a better generation of batteries in production the car can be upgraded to a better battery with longer miles\n2. Supercharger + Battery Swap + Call-anywhere-anytime-support-guarantee where they send a charging vehicle if stranded anywhere\n3. Premium positioning: They are positioned at the top end of luxury/premium vehicle space, and the interiors and experience is top-notch\n4. Pricing: It is high enough to provide a path to profitability, also only premium segment vehicle to qualify for govt subsidies. Tesla had to reduce its pricing in China to qualify for its base models.\n5. Technology: Self driving, AI, voice assistant hardware, 0-60 acceleration and the whole bag of tricks. Battery range and features are almost nearing Tesla\n6. Nerd Positioning: Till date NIO's cars hold the world record for fastest EV vehicles, which are not just prototypes, but real cars.\n7. Exclusive Community: The car owners don't just buy a car, they get a premium luxury community experience exclusive to NIO owners in multiple cities. Current count: 22 NIO Houses and 55 NIO Spaces in 57 cities in China\n8. Low overheads in terms of not owning huge debts and running a production site. They do all R&amp;D and design in-house but outsource all manufacturing, just like Apple\n9. New ES8 model launch pretty successful and more exciting models coming soon\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nForward outlook:\n\n1. Currently gross margins are negative, projected to reach unit profitability within this year.\n2. It may or may not become a $100 Billion company, but certainly enough juice to stay in the race and go upwards\n\nRisk issues:\n\n1. Accounting frauds or shady stuff unearthed in the future at some time or the other. After Luckin Coffee etc, one can never be sure.\n2. Falling out with the manufacturing partner\n3. Not being able to scale beyond 4k-5k cars a month\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:   any call strike in 2021 or 2022. Could be a $100 or $0 stock in the coming years.\n\nAnyways, all this is my take, i am not a financial advisor or such, so do your own research. I have a few $NIO 7c  Jan 2022, and a few Feb 2021 $4c and $5c.\n\nI would be happy to hear more from your DD and correct me if I am wrong!",

        "selftext": "There's a lot happening next week that potentially can serve as catalysts to move the markets one direction or another. How I see is each of these events  on its own won't make much of a difference, but rather all of them working off of each other. Here's what I see.\n\nMonday the stimulus bill proposal should be announced.\n\nTuesday FOMC press conference with JPow.\n\nWednesday and Thursday has earnings for FB, SHOP, and AAPL.\n\nThursday has GDP report for Q2.\n\nIf the proposed stimulus bill isn't as big as expected, JPow may make a comment on how he can't prop on the markets on his own. With earnings of these tech companies, the standards are really high and if we don't meet expectations, tech doesn't look like a safe haven anymore. GDP report could reinforce the necessity of a strong stimulus bill.\n\nIf all of this happens, I can see the market start a W shaped recovery. On the other hand, if one of these events doesn't look too bad, the rest of the news will be made insignificant and we continue upwards towards and probably passing ATHs.\n\nTLDR: Tell me how autistic I am.",

I'm calling the top this week (7/12) or the next as mentioned in the original comment. The behavior of TSLA and others during the past week has all the hallmarks of a blown off top. Here's the original text:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \\---------------------------------\n\n40 contracts on VIX 70c 08/22\n\nI usually get call contracts for VIX as a hedge. Last time paid off handsomely as it coincided with dklev's post.\n\nI am seeing the same behavior and decided to re-enter the position at $0.8 per contract. In my opinion here are the following catalysts for VIX potentially breaching $80\n\n1. EU ban on American travel including Business starting on July 1st.\n2. Inevitable lockdown measures from Florida and Texas. Death rate is not yet high because both states still have ICU beds. That will change in the next 10 days after which, unfortunately, the death rate will spike in those states.\n3. New stimulus check will not pass until we get a few red days. Internally, the GOP is facing an existential crisis. There are MANY members who oppose continuing the $600/week or the $1200 round 2. But they will change their mind with a 15-20% drop on SPY.\n4. NIKE earnings. This is much bigger than people realize and I honestly think this will be one of the main catalysts. NIKE showed that the USA is completely halted sale-wise but also that the REST of the world including the countries that are already on post-covid reality. Spending habits have changed, perhaps for the foreseeable retail future and Q2 earnings will bring a barrage of bad news plus very conservative guidance (if any at all)\n5. RH/Day trader/Home trader: this is exactly the same thing that happened in 2000. After record spending in IT many IT contractors found themselves at home with spare cash to spend and all of a sudden considering day trading as a serious full time job. With a \"stonks only up\" market many proceeded to make serious $$$ while making fun of Buffett, Wall St, etc. But eventually the lack of full time job and inevitable market slowdown required people to take profits and this happens at a time where earnings were just starting to get really sour. Well, the same exact thing is happening now. The last unemployment checks will come on July 26th. People are already curtailing their spending very aggressively. RH traders that are beating the market handsomely will keep doing it until the first serious red days (i.e. when a major player like AAPL or similar reports a big drop - same like in 2000s when AMZN reported lackluster quarter). The lack of discipline combined with the diamond hands effect will drive this market into the ground. Fundamentals will get it going but RH/home traders will drive it into overdrive just like in the turn of the century. I believe this will happen within the next 2 month time frame.\n\nTLDR: I'm calling rally market top in the 2nd or 3rd of week of July followed by maybe 1-2 days of blown top (i.e. major green day) and then the inevitable deleveraging.\n\nVIX 70c 08/22",

        "selftext": " Forget  the hype about Tesla, Amazon is undervalued and is the safest place to  park your money. I breakdown the reasons why below. Excuse the long  post, but I like helping people make $. TLDR at the end.\n\nThe  only way to look at Amazon's business is to separate it out into three  very large businesses, I will break down each and why I believe the  company as a whole is undervalued:\n\nA/  Retail &amp; Marketplace - this is the consumer facing portion of their  business where Amazon buys at wholesale and then sells to shoppers. The  latter (Marketplace), is the faster growing and more profitable  business unit, now accounting for over 55% of all orders. Sellers use  FBA and sell their products to shoppers directly where Amazon takes a  \\~7%-\\~15% fee depending on the category.\n\nB/  AWS \u2013 fast growing cloud business operating at 26% gross margins with a  $50B run-rate growing 30% YoY (do you know how crazy it was typing that  out?)\n\nC/ Amazon Media Group -  this includes their fast growing advertising business, Twitch, Amazon  Music, and Amazon Prime Video. This is the least-known portion of their  business, but is the fastest growing with highest margins.\n\n**Retail &amp; Marketplace**\n\nThere\u2019s  not much to say here, other than Amazon does roughly \\~$250B in sales  and growing 30% YoY on average here. For reference, Walmart does \\~$500B.  Even if you gave the retail/marketplace portion of Amazon\u2019s business a  conservative valuation of $500B (2x revenue), it\u2019s a very large  business. Now, take into consideration how much they are emphasizing 3P  sellers and private label products, Amazon\u2019s profitability metrics will  greatly improve in this business as it lowers its overhead so the  business in value will continue to grow. This also fails to mention  their breadth of their FBA business and how many sellers use the product  offering. If anyone has sold anything on Amazon or knows someone that  does, 99% of sellers use FBA because of how easy, convenient, and  cost-effective it is. With the tailwinds associated with COVID, this  business will likely surpass 30% YoY growth, which is just incredible  growth #s for a business this large. In comparison, Walmart is usually  &lt;10% YoY growth when it comes to their revenue metrics.\n\nMy valuation of the business = \\~$500B - $750B\n\n**AWS**\n\nAWS  is projected to do around $50B-$60B in sales for 2020. Latest public  analyst valuations peg it around \\~$500B, which I believe is unfair. For  reference, MongoDB is trading at 20x revenue, Crowdstrike, DOCU,  Datadog, all SAAS/cloud providers are trading at 20x or even more!\n\nValuing  AWS as a standalone business for anything less than $500B would be  under-representing just how large and fast-growing this business is.  Growing at 30% YoY at a $50B run-rate is just unfathomable. If we were  looking at this at a 20x revenue multiple (which I believe it would be  valued at a 20x multiple if it was a standalone company), AWS would be  at a $1 trillion market cap alone. It's the de-facto choice for  start-ups, even as Azure continues to take customers away, AWS is the  leader for all new tech/start-up companies and will continue to see  massive tailwinds as the entire economy shifts to cloud-based offerings.  COVID has also accelerated this business as usage is undoubtedly up for  their core segment of customers, while customers that are most affected  (restaurants) are not really AWS-like customers.\n\nMy valuation of this business unit = $650B\n\n**Amazon Media Group**\n\nAdvertising  \u2013 Many people don\u2019t know much about this business, but you know the  products you click on while you\u2019re shopping around on Amazon? It\u2019s safe  to say a bunch of those products are paying Amazon significant dollars  on a PPC basis (pay-per-click) to surface higher in the search results.  This business generated $14 billion in revenue in 2019. Google, the  leader in advertising, is valued at 10x revenue, so this business alone  is probably worth close to $16B after 2020 alone. $FB did $73B in  revenue trailing 12 months, this would mean FB is about 4.5x the size of  Amazon's Advertising business ALONE. I just compared FB as a whole to  Amazon's \"side-business\" in Advertising.\n\nTwitch  \u2013 this is a tough business to value, but Needham and others have pegged  it at \\~$15 billion alone. It\u2019s the clear leader in online streaming and  Microsoft recently shutdown Mixer (their Twitch competitor). The  possibilities here are endless, look for Amazon Advertising to plug in  their data capabilities to target viewers of live streaming events with  products soon. Twitch will soon be merged into the advertising ecosystem  to begin serving targeted ads to viewers. Think ad-supported streams  where there is some sort of revenue share back to the streamers. This  feeds into the ecosystem where content creators make more $ (won't  leave), advertisers get access to a valuable niche audience, and Amazon  reaps the benefits of high-value/profitable advertising at 65% gross  margins.\n\nPrime Video \u2013 the most  surprising stat for Prime Video is that 20% of Prime members sign up  primarily for Amazon Prime Video. With over 150M subscribers, analysts  peg the value of Prime Video alone at $200b. Amazon has also entered the  OTT ad-supported streaming market with IMDB TV (ad-supported free  television). This is exclusive inventory that Amazon can offer to brands  to advertise on, and compete directly with ROKU, which is valued at 15X  revenue.\n\nLastly, Amazon Music has  30M subscribers. Apple has 60M, and Spotify 100M. Amazon Music (Who the  fuck uses it, is already half the size of Apple Music and about a 3rd  of Spotify...)\n\nBecause all the  businesses aren\u2019t broken out, it\u2019s tough valuing the entire Media Group  business, but it honestly could be in the range of anywhere b/w  $300B-$600B off the synergies and potential for expansion. Again, as a  standalone business, this suite of products would have public market  investors salivating over the growth potential.\n\n**Hidden Value (Areas of Opportunity)**\n\nI  went this entire DD without mentioning the huge competitive MOATs  around voice (Echo = the leader), as well as their entire  logistics/ground fulfillment network, Amazon GO stores, and their  venture in the medical health space. Because it's nearly impossible to  value these things as a whole, you can basically pencil w/e you want  here from a valuation perspective.\n\n*Amazon Retail/Marketplace Business - $650B*\n\n*AWS - $650B*\n\n*Amazon Media Group - $400B*\n\n*Hidden  Value - Go stores, Fulfillment Network, Self-driving, Echo (voice),  Whole Foods, Medical Venture with JP Morgan &amp; Berkshire = $300B*\n\n**Total = $2B**\n\nTLDR:  Amazon is undervalued at a $1.6B market cap, and the stock will be up  to $3500 in the next year. Business units valued as stand-alone  companies would be valued way more, growth potential is endless, and  COVID has accelerated trends in favor of Amazon for the next 5 yrs.\n\n\\- Longterm bag holder",

So before anything else, thanks for the advice, learning, and retarded-ass humor. Yeah I'm a simp fuck you\n\nStarted in late Feb during the airline/travel crash with $850; I accidentally diamond-handed on a cross country flight, made 500 bucks, and was.... intrigued. Also had puts on the airline I was flying which felt like living on the edge. \n\nLong story short, I got serious, and by serious I mean reading the fucked up DD that was all over this sub. Also started learning about theta gang, only chucking around FD's when I was willing to lose the money, etc. Made it to around 15k and stagnated between that and \\~10k for a while fucking around with AMZN FD's; finally got out of that with some dumb luck, TSLA, and FLIR calls. Passing 25k felt like an emancipation, but I quickly found out that the paper hands you get with unlimited day trades is risky as fuck. Started running the wheel on high dividend energy stocks and playing a stupid FD or two; made it to 40k largely on Amazon and Tesla calls, then went back down to 26k trying to catch the falling knife on both. Been crawling back up with theta and earnings plays and trying not to repeat my mistakes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, these gains are small compared to the big fish on here, but they represent a whole new way of how I look at $, and a whole bunch of knowledge, stupid decisions, and good times that I wouldn't have had without this sub.

Even though AMZN, MSFT, FB, AAPL, beat earnings, I suspect there will be major sell offs; thus, SPY will plummet (and VIX will rise). Unlike the last ER, all of these are currently at ATH in anticipation for the upcoming ER release, and many will sell due to no pending tech news followed by a significant drop in buying power.\n   * We observed a near \\~3% (290 -&gt; 282) drop at the end of tech rally 3 months ago on April 30 (after AMZN released their ER)\n* VIX just hit a 5-month All-Time-Low @ $24.50\\~\n\n[VIX Index](https://preview.redd.it/pizgacgpr1c51.png?width=1519&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb25f162ed87299b668134b39eb8e9ed78aaedfd)\n\n**Predictions:**\n\n* IT (expect this industry to rise until July 30 with slight fluctuations here and there.

        "selftext": "*This is pretty long--if you don't care to read something long no need to complain, just skip to the bottom, as I understand this is a Wendy's/ If MRNA gives fodder for my skepticism, I'll update it here/my Twitter of the same username*\n\nThe story of Theranos is a commonly floated parable in Silicon Valley for fast-rising startups that speaks more to the excitement of the time we were in--and the pressure on startup CEO's to succeed-- than it did the individual players involved, namely the 21 year old founder/CEO Elizabeth Holmes and to a lesser extent, her partner Sunny Balwani.\n\nA decade ago, at the height of Silicon Valley mania once the dotcom bubble burst had become more history than cautionary tale, investors were wowed to the tune of a 10 billion dollar valuation by the BioTech startup Theranos and it's charismatic young CEO Holmes.  The Stanford dropout, after spending months locked away working on a thesis, had conceived and was now promising the ability to diagnosis a wide array of diseases using only one drop of blood and her own proprietary device--in less than four hours.  This shattered the industry  standard (QUEST, etc) of multiple IV blood draws done in a lab and sent for testing, an accepted but somewhat gruesome process that could take days  to produce results as the potentially ill patients and their doctors awaited the results.\n\nThe concept of one drop, wide-ranging diagnosis was beyond revolutionary; the most comparable recent memory in Silicon Valley being the innovations of the person she idolized and obsessed over; Steve Jobs and his reviving of Apple--only this one could save lives on a mass scale.  Imagine a machine in your home the size of a cell phone that could screen you for .  Through confidence and charm, she took advantage of the desperation of FOMO in a wide and prominent group of people who desperately wanted to be in on the ground floor a silicon valley \"unicorn\".  **Her biggest supporters  included some of the most popular and renowned faculty at Stanford, four star generals including recent Secretary of Defense Mattis, and even Henry Kissinger.**  They all served on her board, and raked in billions of dollars in investments from individuals and Venture Capitalists.  **Rupert Murdoch, Betsy DeVos and a wide range of other celebrities and politicians invested hundreds of millions by the time they were in Series B.**\n\nNevermind the fact that at this point Holmes was a college dropout without any successful previous research to show, or had presented any working demos of her product that could be verified by independent science, they were all in.  The world needed this now, and she was promising it.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nFast forward ten years and the entire market is reliant on the perception that COVID will be placed under control.  Upcoming elections, decimated economies, and lives lost have made the chase for a vaccine a higher stakes version of the Silicon Valley boom with the money and pressure to match. Large pharmaceutical companies like JNJ, PFE, and MERCK, are moving along slowly, encumbered by their internal bureacrocies and, more importantly, the need to get things right in order to protect their investors and reputations.  Merck's CEO Ken Frazier sounds caution at development speed and promises being made, but he is largely ignored after one day of headlines in favor of splashy headlines.  Smaller companies dive in and begin throwing their all into the hunt for a vaccine, particularly ones that have yet to have taken a previous trial vaccine development to fruition.  Once again, previously untested companies and leaders without a track record are throwing their hat in the ring and valuations are soaring on the prospect of success without any sound accomplishment.  **Traditonal timeframes of vaccine development--multiple years--are completely cast aside for swifter promises.**\n\nModerna thrives in this environment.  Their work in 2019 on an RNA vaccine for Zika was developed in a shockingly low--record breaking--amount of time.  **Their CEO Stephane Bancel was an excellent motivator, hype man, and cunning salesman--and still is.   He has secured distribution deals for his wholly incomplete Vaccine with Longa, and signed up the nation of Brazil to distribute his vaccine to their masses** that, while surprisingly keeping the virus contained in comparison to some of its South American neighbors, is in desperate need of a game changer to turn things around for their COVID denying President who was recently diagnosed and quarantined.  The deals are on the table before the work is done, but how could they not be?  After squeaking by medical approval thresholds which have been loosened by Operation Warp Speed's singular focus on expendience, they are starting the first Phase 3 trial in earnest on a whopping 30,000 people, even more than the initial 10,000 they sought.  They're in the big leagues.\n\nWhile MRNA is securing deals with countries, getting full backing from entire nations, the POTUS, and even the usually grim Fauci, Elizabeth Holmes is awaiting trial on federal charges for doing the same; her high profile investors are all seeking damages from being sold a bill of dreams.  **Previously celebrated deals with Walgreens and Safeway that fell through when the level of Theranos' failure was realized have caused those companies to feel the affects for years.**  Among other injustices, the CEO of Walgreens' demise was brought about by his blind reverence to Holmes, and losses for companies and individuals that bet on Theranos ran over a billion dollars.\n\nThat's because nobody knew 1) they were lying about their ability to deliver the product, let alone in the timeframe they proposed and 2) everybody believed the product would work because their large investments needed it to.  Theranos engaged in outright deception in order to push things along and keep their investors happy.  The White House wants to push things along and keep investors happy.\n\n**I don't think Moderna is lying.**  MRNA is not lying because they don't *have* to, and they are not cutting corners to the point of fraud because they don't have to; the government is doing it for them.  **Operation Warp Speed is not true government oversight nor regulated expedience, rather it is the US government issuing lax regulatory standards and weakened scientific accountability in multiple areas in order to get the good news out to the public faster on a consistent bases**.  Theranos created their own rules as they went along; Moderna is playing by the new rules created by our government, and a President determined to win re-election.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThree alarms were sounded that let folks know Theranos wasn't what it was cracked up to be which draw distinct parallels with Moderna\n\n**1) Sketchy practices by their leadership:** much like Elizabeth Holmes would bluster her way into higher valuations with grandiose claims, Moderna does similarly.  We often hear about the dates of further progress--both medicinal and regulatory-- before the trial data itself.  Just as Elizabeth Holmes repeatedly promised Walgreens, Safeway, and other business entities dates they would be ready to launch the obligations of their contract when she didn't even have a functioning prototype, Moderna routinely tells media and partners about the expected dates their vaccine will be ready before the study phases are complete, or have even started.  This puts their promoters in the same no-win situation Theranos investors were in.  I've read through several MRNA news articles, and it seems that the date of vaccine production fluctuates between two months and 9 months from now, the only difference being slight alterations in wording.  \"Vaccine production\", \"regulatory approval\" and other phrases are tossed around in a confusing melange that leads one to believe they could have a vaccine by the fall, but the fine print and wordplay they \n\n**1b) Sketchy practices by leadership have already led to lawsuits**, but quashed by media and the fmemory loss granted by time.  Suits were filed on behalf of Moderna investors after their initial stunts during early Phase trials in May and June.  Remember when the CEO announced great results coming and then dumped his stock, and we forgot about it?  His clients--Moderna's own investors--didn't https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200519006005/en/MODERNA-INVESTIGATION-INITIATED-Louisiana-Attorney-General-Kahn\n\n**2) Questionable science:** First of all, if they are talking producing a vaccine as fast as they claim, they have to work out a number of adverse affects in their product in a short period of time.  **While they can cross the 50% affectiveness threshold at producing antibodies, the amount and severity of side affects from their Phase 1 and 2 trials would indicate they have a long way to go in getting a product remotely ready for market.**  That's fine, because large pharma companies like Merck and JNJ are going through the same things-but they are NOT acting like it means they are ready for showtime anytime soon (PFE has recently changed their tune to swifter, as of today).  This is reminiscent of when Theranos swore they could do blood tests on their proprietary devices when they didn't even have the inner mechanics down.  What did Theranos do?  They ended up using EXISTING devices from pharma giants in secrecy and pretended it was their own proprietary devices, which sat discarded in labs between varying levels of disrepair.  Don't be surprised when you see Moderna latching onto JNJ, PFE, AZN and others' \"distribution methodology\"\n\n**2b) the big boys are catching up to them**, and their results are getting better than Modernas.  A look at the most recent trial data from PFE shows a much more robust immune responses than Moderna's, they just both happen to exceed regulatory federal re.\n\n**3) People expect them to do the impossible, and that is not their fault.**  Just like people wanted to believe every business in Silicon Valley had a legitimate shot at an insane valuation with the right promise. Warp Speed for better and worse has made it easier for smaller companies without the expertise to respond crucially to believe they can.\n\n**4) Patent issues:** Theranos was rife with patent issues, including a battle centered on the fact that they didn't own their own patent for a crucial part of their process.  Neither does fucking Moderna! https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/moderna-stock-sinks-as-patent-case-spurs-concern-for-covid-19-vaccine\n\nThis is another serious hurdle to profit that investors are overlooking.  *MRNA already has to keep pricing in accordance with new Presidential mandates and public demand; now they likely have to share the research they claim will be their golden ticket with another party.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nElizabeth Holmes and Theranos kept rising in popularity, prestige, and valuation until the reality of unrealistic expectations according to the science took over.  In that way, this situation is no different.  Just as Holmes graced the cover of almost every magazine including Forbes, Fortune, and WIRED, Stephane Bancel is becoming ubiquitous as we approach Phase 3 results.  But then what?  Even if they succeed in regulatory approval first, then what?  This company is going to revolutionize a vaccine and get it mass distributed before the other companies?  After the fall of Theranos, Quest and other diagnostics gaints came in and made changes based on some of their general concept, but mostly bolstered their current business. This won't be any different. \n\nPFE, Merck, and JNJ are the companies that will profit off of this pandemic.  **This vaccine race is not the creation of apps, or some TechCrunch call for \"disruption\"; this is the distribution of potentially multiple-shot vaccinations to billions of people that every politican, market, and human is counting on.  Passable trial results aren't enough, and a wink and a pat on the back from the President aren't good enough--especially when any Pharma company worth their salt is saying they won't initially profit and is prepared for short term losses.**  By the time a smaller, less-experienced business like Moderna has figured out how to distribute their first batch of 150,000 doses in conjunction with the government, the big pharma companies will have improved their own vaccine and stolen Moderna's; they will have the public's trust due to not being some new untrusted company and offering at cost, and therefore soak up the remaining government funds grants, and partnerships.  \n\n*Meanwhile, Moderna will be be fighting for their own damn patent so they can profit.*\n\nI don't think MRNA is purposefully deceptive, or evil, or that Bancel is anything like Holmes, but I do believe they are riding a hype train straight to hell.  And **I think the problem here is not Moderna, but that the desires of the administration have earned them a fall-guy position as poster children for Operation Warp Speed and America's answer to AZN.** What I stated in the opening sentence about Theranos applies here to Moderna; they're coming fall speaks more to the time we're in than MRNA themselves.\n\nAsk yourself; next year, when you go to get your vaccination shot, will the name Moderna mean anything to you aside from the faint recalling of some summer tendies you made that year prior?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* \n\n**TLDR:** MRNA is being set up for failure without good leadership, realistic timetables, and unrealistic administration pressure.  Look for them to fall immensely behind once the hype from being \"first\" gives way to the reality of need for \"best\".  They on some Theranos shit.\n\n**PFE 12/18 45c**\n\n**JNJ 12/18 160c**\n\n**MRNA 12/18 75p** (wait until MRNA mania reaches a fever pitch closer to Phase 3 results)\n\n**VXRT 12/18 15c** *(Vaxart is creating something critical--a tablet version of the vaccine.  Once the big companies have gotten the vaccine ready for production, logistical uncertanties around distribution of multi-shot treatments to billions will send their value skyrocketing, and they are not far behind the others)*\n\n**I'm now prepared for you all to tell me \"Sir, this is a Wendy's\" and downvote me for length of post.**",

It's close to the bottom it had in march at 45 usd. And I am thinking it could be a good entry point in a few days, what are your toughts on intel? \n\nI have been reading that Apple is planning to offer a macbook without intel processors and would be cheaper so I guess nothing that shinny for the company.  Anyways I think Intel is too big to be beaten easily by its rivals but I'm not really sure at all. May be I would wait a little bit more until this stick falls more.",

        "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI wanted to share my DCF calculations from Apple, and hopefully get some feedback. I'm wondering if I made a mistake somewhere because I'm getting $223 fair value. Just fyi. I am aware of all DCF drawbacks, lots of predictions etc, I'm also aware that tech sector may be slightly overvalued at the moment (or not?). I just want to focus on DCF, and whether I missed something.\n\nIn any event, I took the most optimistic estimates from Yahoo Finance for Revenue Growth Rate for 2020 and 2021 and still it's very low compared to current price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are my calculations, maybe I'm doing something wrong:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**These are actual data:**\n\n||2016|2017|2018|2019|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Free Cash Flow|$52,276,000.00|$50,803,000.00|$64,121,000.00|$58,896,000.00|\n|Net Income Total|$45,687,000.00|$48,351,000.00|$59,531,000.00|$55,256,000.00|\n|Free Cash Flow / Net Income|114.42%|105.07%|107.71%|106.59%|\n|Revenue|$215,639,000.00|$229,234,000.00|$265,595,000.00|$260,174,000.00|\n|Revenue Growth Rate||6.30%|15.86%|\\-2.04%|\n|Net Income Margin|21.19%|21.09%|22.41%|21.24%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Then, I made these projections:**\n\nProjected future Net Income Margin: **21%** (based on years 2016-19)\n\nFuture ratio of (Free cash flow / Net Income): **108.45%** (average from years 2016-19)\n\nProjected Revenue Growth: Taken from Yahoo finance for 2020 and 2021 (and these are *\"High Estimate\"*)\n\nProjected Revenue Growth Rate for 2022 and 2023: **3%**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Based on the above projections, I expect these data:**\n\n||2020|2021|2022|2023|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Free Cash Flow|$60,067,743.75|$67,626,600.30|$69,655,398.31|$71,745,060.26|\n|Net Income Total|$55,387,500.00|$62,357,400.00|$64,228,122.00|$66,154,965.66|\n|Free Cash Flow / Net Income|*108.45%*|*108.45%*|*108.45%*|*108.45%*|\n|Revenue|$279,500,000.00|$323,720,000.00|$333,431,600.00|$343,434,548.00|\n|Revenue Growth Rate|*7.43%*|*15.82%*|3%|3%|\n|Net Income Margin|21%|21%|21%|21%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I take *Free Cash Flow* from 2020-2023, and calculate Present Value and Terminal Value.

        "selftext": "**Recap**\n\nLast week, I posted Bullish Option Plays \\[2-4 Month Horizon\\], found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hrbexa/bullish\\_options\\_plays\\_24\\_month\\_horizon/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hrbexa/bullish_options_plays_24_month_horizon/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)\n\n**TL, DR:**\n\n*WFC $27.50c Oct 16 2020, $1.30 DOWN to $1.12 today*\n\n*WFC $30c Oct 16 2020, $0.79 DOWN to $0.63 today*\n\n*TWTR $40c Dec 18 2020, $3.25 UP to $4.25 today*\n\n*TWTR $40c Jan 15 2020, $3.45 UP to $4.50 today*\n\n*LUV $40c Dec 18 2020, $3.05 DOWN to $2.77 today*\n\n*LUV $40c Jan 15 2020, $3.40 DOWN to $3.20 today*\n\n*ERIC $11 Nov 20 2020, $0.50 UP to $1.50 today*\n\nTWTR and ERIC contracts netted +$305 on a $720 investment. WFC and LUV netted -$79 on a $854 investment. *These figures are based on buying one of each contract last week and selling them today*.\n\n**This post covers 3 Bullish or Bearish Option Plays across various industries.**\n\nCriteria for selecting Option Plays:\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM +\n* Uptrend or Downtrend detected\n\nUsing these criteria, I have curated a basket of plays. The time frame of these options are 3-6 months out, to avoid Theta burn and maximize ITM potential. The beauty of long plays is that the stock only needs to move a few % to be profitable, with a long time horizon as a hedge. Close the position within 2-4 months to minimize theta and maximize delta opportunity. I have also included a shorter time frame with higher risk/reward and lower premiums. Short plays are laid out, but not recommended.\n\n**1) Twitter $TWTR \\[Technology\\] - BULLISH**\n\nI recommended Twitter last week, and will do it again. Earnings, shaking off the security breach, and upcoming features all make $TWTR a very strong bullish pick.\n\nTwitter is poised to dominate with its huge reach and rumored subscription platform for content creators. Source:\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing)\n\nThis is a buy the rumor, sell the news play. I anticipate Twitter announcing this platform in the next 3 months. Twitter is up 3.5% today with earnings on Thursday, 3 days away.\n\nBullish Twitter Case:\n\nInvestments in product enhancements and video content could return the monthly active user growth rate to the double digits.\n\nThe deal with the NFL to live-stream Thursday night games and provide a platform for interaction and conversation about the games may attract more premium content providers to use the Twitter platform.\n\nGrowth in ad revenue per user remains strong at Twitter, more than offsetting the deceleration in user growth.\n\n[$TWTR Profile, from FindMarketPlays early access platform](https://preview.redd.it/bo8rzhhw83c51.png?width=3256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24a9bb3bc17df5398c5b485d4594f39d7918a14d)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap \\[29B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[30M\\]\n* Uptrend detected \\[Strong upward trend since March\\]\n\n[$TWTR overlay with $SNAP and $FB - the three social media giants posting huge gains](https://preview.redd.it/v52p8ht793c51.png?width=1082&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51c3f1edbc2536059e6e50a3db71f854245097a1)\n\nThe value that $TWTR and $FB lost due to lack of advertiser revenue has been recouped. The arrival of a subscription service is very bullish, because more and more people are looking to make money online since being laid off by COVID - Twitter's reach makes it incredibly well positioned to solve this problem. Subscriptions made $MSFT and $AAPL cash cows, expect the same for $TWTR.\n\nThe security fears involving accounts of Elon Musk, Bill Gates and the like have been squashed. By taking the breach as a positive, Twitter will beef up security for their accounts and prevent such attacks from occurring again.\n\nLets take a look at the options scanner:\n\n[Big money on a upwards $TWTR move, from FindMarketPlays early access platform](https://preview.redd.it/fcwcfeuya3c51.png?width=1946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a69a702620df59648ab047e9beb964d89372fa8a)\n\nDespite recommending this play last week, $TWTR surprised even me these past few days, completely powering through the security breach and meeting my % target 2 months early. Today, taking a Strike of $40, that is 8% OTM of the current price. If they announce the platform within the next 6 months (I predict they will), the stock will explode.\n\nWith this information, I propose:\n\n**Short Term Play \\[HIGH RISK\\]:**\n\n*TWTR $40c Aug 21 2020, trading at $1.81 at time of writing. 31% Probability ITM.*\n\n**Long Term Play:**\n\n*TWTR $40c Jan 15 2020, trading $4.50 at time of writing. 35% Probability ITM*\n\n**2) Moderna $MRNA \\[Biotechnology\\] - BEARISH**\n\n$MRNA has been riding the wave of COVID-19, and mercilessly profiteering off vaccine news. It popped on my radar because it made it on my most active movers watchlist, down 12% today.\n\n[Moderna Profile, from FindMarketPlays early access platform](https://preview.redd.it/3qi2d44fe3c51.png?width=3244&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fce5c1c7700bc516502f662ee67ef42e6844ffe)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap \\[32B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[43M\\]\n* Downtrend detected \\[Strong downtrend, crashing off ATH\\]\n\n[$MRNA has a history of big dumps.

A staggering 15,685,052 shares sold vs 55,568 bought in the **last 3 months**. Has executives selling a stock ever been a bullish sign?\n\n[Out of 15,740,620 shares traded in 3 months, only 55,568 were bought.

Unsurprisingly, it is hardly talked about across finance communities anymore, because it is finally consolidating around a range that I can feel comfortable with, especially with the quiet adoption of plant-based food sweeping the country and fast food chains.\n\nBullish Beyond Meat case:\n\nPlant-based meats (PBM) should continue to grow rapidly as the products gain additional share from the traditional ground meat category.\n\nBeyond Meat should be a major beneficiary of PBM growth, given its first-mover advantage, and the brand\u2019s strong performance in taste tests (consistently second only to privately held Impossible Foods).\n\nWe think Beyond Meat is the most likely PBM supplier to secure a U.S. deal with McDonald's, as Impossible Foods has backed out of the race, stating it does not have sufficient capacity to supply the chain.\n\n[Beyond Meat Profile, from FindMarketPlays early access platform](https://preview.redd.it/x9hk3tewh3c51.png?width=3320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35905e85c4db29eddeaee79d6a57fd40d8cb4b89)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap \\[8B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[5M\\]\n* Uptrend detected \\[Consolidating near support, KFC news\\]\n\n[$120-$130 has served as a key support\\/resistance for $BYND in 2020](https://preview.redd.it/9d45mw4ai3c51.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=289c0441e2f8099179fc4320add1676a4fdce397)\n\nKFC is testing Beyond Meat fried chicken.

        "selftext": "I'm going to leave out the obligatory background bit about why my two cents might be helpful.  Just dig it up in my history.\n\nThere's profit-taking and sector rotation and then there is collapse. The first is a very healthy trim of the froth that built up over the past few months. Investors are simply reallocating the profitable portions of their book to previously avoided sectors to participate in their anticipated rise.  Collapse is when everybody, and I mean everybody, sell absolutely everything, even at deep losses just to get out.\n\nRight now, we are seeing a measured and controlled trimming.  Short-term cash might move over to tradeable opportunities in the non-tech space for a few weeks, maybe even just days but the US economy is an absolute mess right now. There are truly only two smart positions, well-establish tech equity and cash. It will flow back into tech at a discount.  The same people selling are the same people buying back at a 20% discount.\n\nI've got no advice for you if you're rolling dice with P&amp;Ds, buying bankrupt companies or flipping ridiculously short-term options but if you're like most people here, buying companies because they make sense over a longer time horizon and especially in a post Covid world (if that's even possible), the next few days or weeks will not matter after a few months.\n\nSo what do I currently own?\n\n30% cash, PFE, WMT, MSFT, AMZN, AMD, NVDA, GOOG, AAPL and TSLA.  All are still substantially in the green. I've trimmed about 25% of all positions last week and move over the cash. VIX is currently at 28.  In March, it was 80.   \n\nSo folks, it's cool.

        "selftext": "Peloton is going to the moon and here's why:\n\n1. Peloton, for the first time in it's history of being a public company, is expected to post a profit of $55M to $65M. For a company that is growing 70% YoY, expected to hit 1M subscribers with \\~60% gross margins on their subscription product, this is incredible. We all know how much Wall Street loves profitability. \n\n2. June traffic YoY has essentially DOUBLED. Monthly uniques will prob land somewhere b/w 2M-3M monthly unique visitors. June 2019 they were b/w 500K-1M monthly unique visitors (see below).\n\nWhen looking at last year's numbers during the same time period, they posted $223M in revenue. This quarter they are expected to post $520M, which I believe is a very conservative estimate. For reference, they posted \\~$525M LAST quarter, so they are expecting numbers to essentially be flat this quarter, which I find strange and clear sand-bagging (subscribers have grown exponentially and demand is still through the roof). Their YoY growth for this quarter will be minimum 100% growth, and likely be closer to 200% YoY revenue growth (!). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0yroa0hib6951.png?width=816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=132cc9d6592630e66a07a55558bbef12cbb14887\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Please take into consideration, how many subscribers 1M subscribers actually is. Right now, they have 850K \"Connected Fitness Subscribers\" and 150K \"Digital Subscribers.\" Let's just say all are paying customers (no free trials, little churn etc) that's around $34M (850K x $40) in Connected Fitness Subscriber Revenue and $2.1M (150K x $14) in revenue for digital subscribers per month. That's almost $500M in annual subscription revenue at 60%+ gross margins alone assuming absolutely no growth in their subscription numbers. Not only is $500M in annual subscription revenue impressive, they have over a 97% retention rate (which is unheard of). \n\n5. International Expansion. Peloton, rightfully so, is reinvesting much of their cash and profits into expensive ventures getting into costly legal battles (i.e. Flywheel) with competitors that are infringing on their copyright/technology. However, a lot of their spend is going and will be going towards international expansion. Think Netflix pre-international spike and what that did to their numbers. In the UK and Germany (the next two biggest markets), they barely have a presence. The at-home fitness will only grow, and this is going to be huge for the future growth. \n\n6.  I view the at-home fitness movement as one of the key trends that has the potential to be game-changing. If you think about the trends in the market that have the potential to return your money 10x, I would bet on gaming, computer chips, gambling (maybe), AI, self-driving, and at-home fitness. Even if you believe there is no trend and people will go to the gym, it's undeniable the impact of COVID and how much liberal tech elites love this product. The wealthy will be the least affected by the pandemic, and guess what, their target market is the liberal elite/wealthy (most scared of COVID, and will always spend $ no matter what on expensive luxury items like a TESLA or PELOTON). \n\nAt absolute worst case scenario, I see this company at a \\~$50 stock price (which is essentially 2x from where they were pre-covid). Their business has easily doubled since then, and if you are a forever pessimist and expect zero or negative growth (unlikely), then the stock drops maybe \\~20%. The risk-reward here for me is undeniable. This has the potential to be a $100+ stock by the end of the year and definitely by 2021 with the potential to even have $SHOP or $TSLA like gains if the at-home fitness trend is here to stay. If it's not, then at worst you own a stock in a company that has over 1M subscribers, a rabid community/fan base, and a product that people love (like TESLA) with high NPS scores (70+) with a price around \\~$50.\n\nIn the end, I never try and short or doubt a company where customers are absolutely in love with the product. This is the case with Peloton, with incredible tailwinds because of COVID and economies of scale with their growing subscriber base, ability to gain manufacturing scale, and also best in class talent (fitness instructors).\n\nTLDR: At home fitness is early days of the trend, subscriber numbers doubling YoY with 95%+ retention, NPS scores on par with Apple and Disney, and potential for international expansion with an already profitable business growing 60% YoY. $100 by EOY.",

        "selftext": "**This post covers 4 Bullish Option Plays across various industries.**\n\nCriteria for selecting Bullish Options Plays:\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM +\n* Uptrend detected\n\nUsing these criteria, I have curated a basket of plays. The time frame of these options are 3-6 months out, to avoid Theta burn and maximize ITM potential. The beauty of these plays is that the stock only needs to move up a few % to be profitable, with a long time horizon as a hedge. Close the position within 2-4 months to minimize theta and maximize delta opportunity. \n\n**1) Wells Fargo $WFC \\[BANKING\\]**\n\nWells just got hammered after an expected poor earnings. This makes it a prime candidate for upward movement.\n\nBullish Wells Fargo Case: \n\nWells has a history of prudent underwriting, and we are probably closer than not to a turn in the credit cycle.\n\nWells Fargo's retail branch structure, advisory network, product offerings, and share in small and medium-size enterprises is difficult to duplicate, ensuring that the company's competitive advantage is maintained.\n\nWells offers the scale advantages of a money center bank without the risks and volatility associated with extensive capital markets operations.\n\n[Wells Fargo Profile, from my personal research platform](https://preview.redd.it/ln8hjd3hkva51.png?width=3338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34c36c2a9d23b21b2a82b7ba6d19bdaeab4d0811)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap  \\[99B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[46M\\]\n* Uptrend detected \\[Bounced off 52Wk Low as support\\]\n* \\*\\*Within 10% of 52 Week Low \\[52 Week Low was $22, WFC is trading at $24.14\\]\n\n[$WFC Overlay with $JPM - The charts are nearly identical](https://preview.redd.it/hleymqo1mva51.png?width=1110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=871a3aa9795b6f39e0b3b3ce1f54e3c1af34e556)\n\nAs a big 4 bank, it is impossible for the Fed to allow WFC to go down. They have a good balance sheet, with a P/E ratio of 8.9, down from 11. The lower P/E ratio alone will bring in more long-term investors. If that isn't enough to make you comfortable, WFC offers a whopping 8% dividend yield, making it even more attractive. \n\nThis is an attractive investment for both options and stocks.\n\nLet's take a look at options on $WFC, which I found using my unusual options scanner:\n\n[Big Bullish bets for October 16 2020, 2 days after their next earnings. ](https://preview.redd.it/0ohji0l2ova51.png?width=3354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d7bb6293c1d8fb4d3e79b54d9f0274eec8de2f0)\n\n[More Bullish Bets on WFC for October 16 2020](https://preview.redd.it/hf683xmlova51.png?width=3354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96e327f7aeca2a2dd8a5aad2a36c17184d07e7bb)\n\nThese huge bets range from $25 to $30, 3 months down the line. This averages to a $2.5, or 11% increase over the next 3 months. With this information, I propose:\n\n*WFC $27.50c Oct 16 2020, trading at $1.30 at time of writing. 24% Probability ITM.*\n\n*WFC $30c Oct 16 2020, trading $0.79 at time of writing. 16% Probability ITM.*\n\nI am currently invested in $WFC stock, and hold the $30 Oct 16 Calls.\n\n**2) Twitter $TWTR \\[Technology\\]**\n\nTwitter is poised to dominate with its huge reach and rumored subscription platform for content creators. Source:\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing)\n\nThis is a buy the rumor, sell the news play. I anticipate Twitter announcing this platform in the next 3 months.\n\nBullish Twitter Case:\n\nInvestments in product enhancements and video content could return the monthly active user growth rate to the double digits.\n\nThe deal with the NFL to live-stream Thursday night games and provide a platform for interaction and conversation about the games may attract more premium content providers to use the Twitter platform. \n\nGrowth in ad revenue per user remains strong at Twitter, more than offsetting the deceleration in user growth.\n\n[Twitter Profile, from my personal research platform](https://preview.redd.it/4rsgs7vprva51.png?width=3354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d169d63baad270497c11271a9e34907e642050e)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap  \\[27B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[30M\\]\n* Uptrend detected \\[Strong upward trend since March\\]\n\n[$TWTR Overlay  with $FB - the charts are nearly identical](https://preview.redd.it/e10qmi7csva51.png?width=1124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cd525f27ecab551640be77d81cb4324ba9c7465)\n\nThe value that $TWTR and $FB lost due to lack of advertiser revenue has been recouped. The arrival of a subscription service is very bullish, because more and more people are looking to make money online since being laid off by COVID - Twitter's reach makes it incredibly well positioned to solve this problem. Subscriptions made $MSFT and $AAPL cash cows, expect the same for $TWTR. \n\nThis is an attractive investment for both options and stocks.\n\nLet's take a look at options on $TWTR, which I found using my unusual options scanner:\n\n[Huge Bullish $TWTR bets for Jan 15, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/3b7tab2ntva51.png?width=2988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02e6cf57ae8b131a386a575319a25a14060c893d)\n\n[Huge Bullish $TWTR bets for Jan 15, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/hilyf24ptva51.png?width=2988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a21184af85f93f1ad7c6ab164d3f2c20f0262e8)\n\n[Huge Bullish $TWTR bets for Jan 15, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/4qj7816stva51.png?width=2988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d50b9844aa56cfa978370c9c02ed9c10d9c9ffdd)\n\nThese bets were placed BEFORE COVID, and $TWTR is trading at the same price as when these were placed. The strikes range from $40 to $60, 6 months down the line. Taking a Strike of $40, that is 15% OTM of the current price. If they announce the platform within the next 6 months (I predict they will), the stock will explode.\n\nWith this information, I propose:\n\n*TWTR $40c Dec 18 2020, trading at $3.25 at time of writing. 28% Probability ITM.*\n\n*TWTR $40c Jan 15 2020, trading $3.45 at time of writing. 29% Probability ITM.*\n\nBuying $40 Jan 15 2020 Calls are only $20 more for an extra month. Look to close these after their earnings next quarter, when they will likely announce the subscription platform.\n\nI am currently invested in $TWTR stock, and hold the $40 Dec 18 Calls.\n\n**3) Southwest Airlines $LUV \\[AIRLINES\\]**\n\nWarren Buffet and COVID have caused investors to turn a nose up at airline stocks. I don't blame them - the uncertainty will affect airlines more than most other industries. That said, don't miss this opportunity to profit off Southwest Airlines, as they have the best balance sheet in the industry.\n\nBullish Southwest Airlines Case:\n\nSouthwest enjoys the strongest brand in the industry thanks to its simple fare prices, free checked bags, and solid customer service. This brand equity will enable it to continue growing faster than peers and support unit revenue.\n\nMergers among Southwest's competitors will engender pricing power for the airlines, and oil prices will remain low for longer, boosting Southwest's top and bottom lines.\n\nSouthwest's aggressive expansion will continue, driving growth at the carrier.\n\n[Southwest Airlines Profile, from my personal research platform](https://preview.redd.it/90axs37lwva51.png?width=3246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ed735a4742277bc94aff3fb0879be955666c5aa)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap  \\[20B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[15M\\]\n* Uptrend detected \\[Strong upward trend since June\\]\n\n[$LUV Overlay  with $AAL and $DAL - Delta and American have been hit worse than Southwest for a reason.](https://preview.redd.it/2pam3ml2xva51.png?width=1116&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dedbe0c6860f3e2285ffe2c9adfdffa9ebc1fed)\n\n$LUV is performing better than its competitors, with higher lows and higher highs when comparing the charts. With the best balance sheet, its exposure to oil has been proven to be overcome since the whole oil futures fiasco. They have been prepped for the second wave and are most likely to weather the storm out of all the airlines.\n\nMy options scanner did not find any significant options data for $LUV.\n\nI propose:\n\n*LUV $40c Dec 18 2020, trading at $3.05 at time of writing. 25% Probability ITM.*\n\n*LUV $40c Jan 15 2020, trading $3.40 at time of writing. 26% Probability ITM.*\n\nI am currently invested in $LUV stock.\n\n**4) Ericsson $ERIC \\[Telecommunications Equipment\\]**\n\nWith growing tensions between the US and China, it is unlikely Huawei will be allowed to provide 5G infrastructure. The UK just announced that Huawei will NOT be providing 5G infrastructure, so Ericsson is poised to seize a huge market share.\n\nBullish Ericsson case:\n\nIncome sources could diversify as licensing revenue from 5G patents may grow through applications outside of Ericsson's handset manufacturer agreements.\n\n5G may afford Ericsson a longer spending cycle and higher equipment demand than previous wireless generations. Additionally, 5G should create more use cases for Ericsson's software and services within Internet of Things device networks.\n\nEricsson's turnaround measures are happening at an opportune time. Management's focused strategy should expand operating margins while 5G infrastructure spending increases top-line results.\n\n[Ericsson Profile, from my personal research platform](https://preview.redd.it/thm35y3pzva51.png?width=3236&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edac1ae4a6043beb014b71d7f1eeb98ca529e847)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap  \\[29B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[13M\\]\n* Uptrend detected \\[Strong upward trend since March, even stronger after UK Huawei announcement\\]\n\n[$ERIC Overlay  with $NOK - Both stocks are strongly trending upward, with almost 100&amp;#37; gains since march.](https://preview.redd.it/acs9fx4zzva51.png?width=1104&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ab330031f62700cad62c068278106f5438366ee)\n\n$ERIC is poised to bank on 5G since Huawei is being punished in retaliation to Chinese handling of Hong Kong.

        "selftext": "I'm going to keep this as short as humanly possible. This is a speculative situation since publicly-traded companies are not allowed to confirm the thoughts of the public, even if they're on the dot. However, they always try to leave you a trail of crumbs to find the missing pieces of information, and so far no one else has gone to the same lengths to dissect what was given to us yesterday. This took a *very* long time to put together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Very briefly so you know who FRSX is:**\n\nFRSX is in the technology and autonomous driving industry. They create software and physical hardware such as cameras and sensors for the use of larger (car) companies. They are also developing COVID-19 thermal sensors with pending patents, but I'm not even going to talk about that right now.\n\n**Very briefly so you know who Huawei is:** \n\nHuawei is one of the largest and most famous/infamous companies in the entire world. They are one the original reasons why Chinese and U.S. trade tensions ran so high. Because they sparked controversy of stealing/copying intel from the U.S. and posing as a foreign threat to the economy.\n\nThey are a massive tech conglomerate with intense market share (more than Apple in China). Many of you have probably used one of their products.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here is the step-by-step process of how I figured out who that unnamed \u201cmulti-billion dollar Chinese tech company\u201d is in their latest order and moving forward.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 1.**[ Press Release From Yesterday](https://ir.foresightauto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/QuadSight-prototype-sale_telecom_270720-ENHE-FINAL.pdf) \\- Introductory Order from \u201cmulti-billion dollar Chinese Tech Company\u201d\n\nStart with the basics. Any company that\u2019s not Chinese is out. Any company under $2 billion valuation is out. Any company not in the tech sector is out. Any company that doesn't operate on a global scale is out. Any company without an Autonomous Vehicle subdivision is out.\n\nSpoiler: This is Huawei, who has become increasingly active in the race for autonomous driving market share. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 2.** [FRSX Germany Tier 1 Auto Supplier](https://ir.foresightauto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/QuadSight-prototype-sale_autonomous-trucks-Tier-One-060520-EN-HE-FINAL.pdf) \\- FRSX products were showcased and successfully demoed in Germany. They received an introductory order from a Tier 1 German auto supplier involved in the $1 Billion USD Autonomous Vehicle/Truck market. \n\nAfter hours of research, this supplier is Veoneer, who supplies AV components for Volkswagen/Audi and a handful of other companies within Huawei\u2019s AV plan. (see below).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 3.**[ Huawei - Autonomous Driving Plans for Germany and China (2020-2022).](https://www.ft.com/content/6ee22ee4-8ce2-11e9-a24d-b42f641eca37) \\-  \n\nHuawei's Chief Strategy Architect, Dang Wenshuan, told the Financial Times that Huawei will be providing autonomous power and components for Germany's Volkswagen/Audi, and China's GAC Group, Beijing New Energy Automobile and Changan Automobile.\n\n*(you need to pay for this information, but it\u2019s not expensive)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 4.** Due to the current politics and long-lasting economic tension between the U.S. and China, Huawei is under serious trade restrictions from the U.S. \n\nTwo years ago they were banned from the U.S. to send a message to China. FRSX is an Israeli company, and if Huawei wants to uphold their agreement to consistently provide AV components, they have limited options unless they want to start from the ground up.\n\nAdditionally, just this week the U.S. and China shut down each other\u2019s consulates in Houston and Chengdu out of spite? Yeah. Not a good look for their political friendship, but potentially great for FRSX.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 5.**[ FRSX Enters Partnership with FLIR to develop and distribute FRSX's Quad-sight Camera](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200401005370/en/FLIR-Systems-Foresight-Sign-Agreement-Develop-Market)\n\nThis is a MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION partnership from FLIR to market the same camera that was ordered from supposed Huawei and Veoneer. This benefits FRSX the most as FLIR\u2019s bluechip status helps put the quad-sight camera in a stronger spotlight.\n\nFLIR already holds AV connections to Volkswagen/Audi, Mercedes, and BMW, and works in[ Autonomous Vehicles.](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/foresight-automotive_how-do-thermal-cameras-work-activity-6685498395815120897-TWi4/) They are partnered with Veoneer as well, the company who ordered right before Huawei.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 6**.[ Fisker soon to IPO, autonomous vehicle project using FRSX \"top level\" autopilot system.](https://ownsnap.com/foresight-autonomous-frsx-surges-while-fisker-preps-for-ipo-before-installing-autopilot-system/)\n\nFisker used to be heavily involved with Tesla vehicles and also redesigned certain cars such as the BMW z8. They now have conflict with Tesla and are heavily connected to FRSX while planning to hit the front end of Volkswagen autonomous vehicles hard. Their autopilot system is called \"Foresight\" as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 7.** [Tencent, NIO, and Mobileye.](https://www.nio.com/news/nio-inc-announces-strategic-collaboration-mobileye-bring-level-4-autonomous-driving-vehicles) NIO and Tencent have partnered with Mobileye as their camera technology instead of FRSX, therefore eliminating Tencent as the other \"Multi-billion dollar Chinese Tech company with an Autonomous Vehicle Subdivision\".\n\nTencent currently owns over $2.25 Billion dollars in NIO. The two giants (Huawei and Tencent) have worked together before on different tech projects, but this one is now a competition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 8.** Connect the dots and eliminate the variables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Roadmap of Connections ](https://preview.redd.it/lenzqw3qpod51.png?width=966&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d69919c7918f11bf306691ff15d229af15be2e45)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter using the parameters provided by FRSX, the list was narrowed down to a handful of companies (all strong contenders due to the fact that they had to be a multi-billion dollar tech company to begin with.) The search for elevating factors such as citations of German/Chinese/Huawei/FRSX AV ventures helped us paint a road map of the connections between companies in the AV sector.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do these orders mean? FRSX has several orders from AV ventures who are trying to gather and test the components for their autonomous driving projects. Their partnership with FLIR, absorption into FISKER\u2019s AV business model, and direct orders from Tier 1 Supplier, Veoneer, and a company that fits the parameters of Huawei, signifies potential penetration into this market, which is all traders care about: Potential. \n\nTheir COVID-19 projects/pending patents deserve their own separate speech, but this is where the money is for a shot at true relevancy.",

        "selftext": "Wallstreet had very high hopes for tech companies to perform during the lockdown. While most had already reported a boost in revenue this quarter, we cannot deny there is signs of a slow down/peaking.\n\nTake Netflix for example. I don't know about you, but I am not in a rush to buy Netflix right now. The worst thing an overvalued growth stock can run in to is any sign that growth is slowing, and that's exactly what is happening to Netflix. Anyone who needed/wanted to use their service already has it, and with increased competition, I see Netflix stock price suffering the next few quarters.\n\nSame can be said for any FAANG actually. You need to analyze if this quarters revenue is a growing trend, or if it's just a spike in demand from the pandemic. I expect the same thing to happen to Amazon actually, because most people are only buying essential items right now, which yields them the lowest margin. Granted, Amazon's situation is different from Netflix because of the multiple revenue streams, but everyone that needed to use AWS is already using AWS. The concept is the same.\n\nEnter Peloton. While people could say it is the same case for Peloton regarding \"it's only getting a boost because of the lockdowns\", that's not exactly true. I expect Peloton to report a large increase in revenue from the previous quarter, and unlike other tech companies, I do not expect for it to slowdown in the coming quarters. Why you ask? Because Peloton has a massive backlog of bike orders that need to be fulfilled, and their revenue will continue to increase each quarter because each new member equals another tree planted in the recurring revenue stream.\n\nPeople also don't realize that there is a seismic shift happening in the personal fitness industry. Streaming workouts is becoming the new norm, and I think we all expect for physical gyms to suffer for a long time as things try to get back to normal.\n\nCompetition is an issue you say? I think not. Peloton is displaying the same behavior when Apple first came out with the iPhone. Yes there were other phones, but everyone wanted an iPhone because of the brand/prestige that comes with it. Peloton is the leader in the digital workout sector, and it's brand recognition cannot be denied. People investing in streaming workout equipment want the best. They want the product with the strongest community and support, and Peloton has that big advantage. As we learned from Apple and Tesla, don't mess with a cult like following. They also rigorously defend their patents geared towards their software and community features.\n\nThis is not speculation. Everyone I know (including myself) have been trying to get a Peloton product for weeks/months. They acknowledged at their last earnings the spike in demand, and said they have taken great measures to get bikes to people faster. They also have a newer/cheaper tread coming out soon, with factory expansions on the way.\n\nOne last thing I will mention. A lot of people only think about the individual consumer side. What about hotels, apartment complexes and businesses? My wife's office has 2 Peloton's in their gym, and she says they are always occupied. Peloton even has a map on their website where you can find hotels that have their product and book a room there. Granted, this side of the market share probably isn't buying right now due to lockdowns, but it's something to consider for long term growth/investors when buying in.\n\nThe bottom line is, there are still growth stocks out there that will continue to thrive during the current climate. FAANG got a boost this quarter due to increase in demand, however I think for some of those companies, the growth will slow down. That's why I like Peloton right now, I see them remaining high in demand for a while. I signed up for their digital membership to see what the hype was about before buying in, and I can see why reviews are littered with language like \"this product has changed my life\". Investors should take notice of that. Thanks for reading and good luck in your investments.",

Those law firms \u201csuing\u201d IDEX are only in it for the clouts. Do your DD and look up law firms. They are literally some firms no one heard of. This doesn\u2019t only apply to IDEX;  big companies like Apple and Tesla were filed lawsuit by firms, and nothing really happened.\n\n4. EV is the future.

        "selftext": "I know what you\u2019re thinking here comes the crayon chart! Nope just my red and green dildo collection history. I am extremely bearish overall but also recognize situations that always pound my ass with green dildos! Monday patterns below!\n\n-Mondays \nLast 8/10-green\u2014 3/3 100% following red Friday \n\nSince March 15/24-Green\u20148/10 80% following a red Friday\n\n3 red days in a row. June 9-11 -6.8%, may 11-13 -4%, March 5-6,9th -12.3%. 3rd red days Opened 3 points down, opened 13 points down, opened 48 points down.\n\n-Though, this is what happens before a significant pull back after a run! Big boys make choppy waters as they sell off profits and retail holds their bags. Example for retards- you own 10% of $100 stock now at $200. You want to take all profits at top vs $190-$200 area so you unload slowly while it bounces back through highs. This also crushes theta and Vix to make cheaper premiums for your put options plays. This is currently happening no matter whatever side you are pulling for and will result in a transition to a bear market!\n\n-So as a bear now I recognize the boring stuff like I hate that we bounced off 3193 support again Friday with what I felt was never significant pressure. As long as we stay above there then no significant fall will happen. We didn\u2019t have a covering pump Friday which opens up a short squeeze opportunity. Economy is screwed and free money is drying up. Even if republican stimulus proposed Monday is decent it won\u2019t become active for at least a couple weeks but the hype will be there for retailers and pumping will occur for more bags to be transferred. \n\nGreen cases\n-Monday\u2019s are green\n-Following 2 red days\n-Strong support 3193\n-Stimulus proposal \n-Fang run ups into earnings \n-no short covering spike Friday \n-run up into FOMC \n\nRed Cases\n-corona,unemployment, blah blah\n-strong resistance on double top\n-another republican stimulus delay\n-China retaliation \n-Bad Fang earnings\n-FOMC mid week\n\nI think republicans will propose a decent plan Monday with another stimulus check, $200/$400 unemployment additions or 70% pay with cap. You could have filed another 3 months extension for mortgages already and too soon for more PPP. Don\u2019t see a surprise negative happening so just a green dildo Monday/Tuesday followed by a depressing FOMC, stimulus/unemployment finalization concerns, disappointing earnings, weak dollar, and a toppy market.\n\nPositions \n\nSpy 8/21 315 puts (bought near top)\nTqqq 8/21 105 puts (bought near top)\n\n(Bought at low of day)\nSpy 7/29 320 calls\nMsft 7/31 207.5 calls\nINTC 7/31 52 calls\nBaba 7/31 257.5 calls\nAAPL 7/31 380 calls",

        "selftext": "I've been working on this background DD for the past week, waiting for the right time to release it-- when the stock price moved to a good buy-in point for investors. Now is the time. I believe T2 is headed for a huge breakout, as more people find out about the company, and the amazing tech that powers it.\n\n## Stock Price\n\nTTOO was down to 1.59 in the pre-market (while writing this, it bumped up to 1.66). This is a near-week-low, after hitting a high of 1.90 five days ago.\n\nSince the beginning of June, the stock has been on a tear, going from below a dollar, to a high of $2.31 on July 1, when it regained compliance with the NASDAQ requirement for stock price. It has subsequently retreated, but should continue to rise with upcoming catalysts.\n\n## Technology Overview\n\nT2 Biosystems is still an early-stage biotech developer, based on cutting edge research done at Harvard University. It was founded in 2006, and had its IPO in August 2014.\n\nIt has a proprietary diagnostic platform-- the \"T2Dx Instrument\"-- which is currently used in 200 hospitals and labs. \n\nThe machine, incorporating established RT-PCR (Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) technology, uses \"nuclear magnetic resonance\" along with nanoparticles to target specific molecules for detection. \n\nThis allows them to directly detect and measure pathogens, such as bacterial microbes, in whole blood (along with other liquid forms, such as plasma, saliva, sputum, etc)-- without the need to purify or extract molecules from the sample first.\n\n**T2 has the only diagnostic platform that can make that claim.**\n\nThe T2Dx Instrument was initially focused on sepsis-causing microbes, both in bacterial and fungal form, so the first panels which have been FDA-authorized are [T2Bacteria](https://www.t2biosystems.com/products-technology/t2bacteria-panel/), [T2Candida](https://www.t2biosystems.com/products-technology/t2candida-panel/) -- both of which are first-of-their-kind diagnostics, cutting down detection time to hours from the \"standard\" blood culture method, which takes up to 5 days or longer.\n\nFuture developments include an ongoing contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Department of Health and Human Services, to develop new testing protocols for blood-borne bacteria.\n\nAnd in the pipeline is a direct test for the Borrelia bacteria-- the cause of Lyme disease from tick bites-- which has already been shown to be the most accurate diagnostic yet available. \n\n(More about the tech behind the platform below.)\n\n## Catalyst: COVID-19 Test EUA\n\nMuch has been written about its EUA application for a COVID-19 panel test, using its T2Dx Instrument. \n\nT2 submitted for the EUA on July 1, after they had already validated it on their machines. It is still pending, in part because the FDA has been focused on revising rules about serology EUA process --  but should be cleared soon.\n\nHowever: the test has been available from T2, and marketed since the beginning of July.\n\nThe [T2SARS-COV-2 panel](https://www.t2biosystems.com/products-technology/t2sars-cov-2-panel/) can detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus in a sample with 100% specificity and 95% sensitivity. And it can do so in under 2 hours, with an estimated 60 tests per day possible on a single machine.\n\nThe test is actually a [licensed version of an existing EUA-approved Covid-19 assay](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/24/2005861/0/en/T2-Biosystems-Announces-Worldwide-Licensing-Agreement-of-COVID-19-Novel-Coronavirus-Assay-from-Hackensack-Meridian-Health-s-Center-for-Discovery-and-Innovation.html) designed by NJ's Center of Discovery and Innovation. The license agreement was announced on March 24, and T2 subsequently adapted it for use on their own platform.\n\nOne additional thing to note is that under the license agreement, \"Hackensack Meridian Health will also adopt the T2Dx\u00ae Instrument and test panels within its Center of Discovery and Innovation.\"\n\nThis shows how flexible the technology that T2 has: the platform was originally targeted for sepsis-causing microbe diagnosis, but was quickly pivoted to viral detection.\n\n## Real Catalyst: New CEO and Board members\n\nSix months ago, T2 transitioned from its original CEO and President, John McDonough, to new leadership: John Sperzel, who just prior was the CEO of [Chembio Diagnostic Systems](https://www.newsday.com/business/chembio-diagnostics-john-sperzel-1.40449267).\n\nLast month, the board added [three new high-power members](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/15/2048364/0/en/T2-Biosystems-Announces-Changes-to-Board-of-Directors.html), from the biotech and life-science industry: the CEO of QIAGEN, Thierry Bernard; the CEO of Navicent Health, Dr. Ninfa Saunders; and Robin Toft, the CEO of the Toft Group, a head-hunting firm for life-science executives.\n\nOne of the board members replaced was co-founder MIT Professor Michael Cima, who can continue to focus on his teaching and research. (See below.)\n\nAlready these changes are paying off in contracts with organizations, such as the a multiyear [\"Innovative Technology\" deal with Vizient](http://www.clpmag.com/2020/03/t2-biosystems-receives-multiyear-innovative-technology-contract-vizient/), \"the nation's largest group purchasing organization.\"\n\n## Origin Story: Co-founders and connection to Harvard &amp; MIT\n\nT2's co-founder is [Dr. Ralph Weissleder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Weissleder). \n\nWhy is that important?\n\nDr. Weissleder is a pioneer in cutting edge medical research, founding [Harvard's Center for Molecular Imaging Research](https://csb.mgh.harvard.edu/cmir) in 1994. \n\nThis role was expanded, as director of the [Harvard's Center for System Biology](https://csb.mgh.harvard.edu/weissleder).\n\nA 2010 article published by the NIH, describes the founding of the company: [Diagnostic Magnetic Resonance \u2013 Miniature System Could Have Huge Public Health Impact](https://www.nibib.nih.gov/news-events/newsroom/diagnostic-magnetic-resonance-%E2%80%93-miniature-system-could-have-huge-public-health-impact)\n\nThe technology is a commercialized application of the [work done by Weissleder and  Michael Cima](https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/start-ups/startups-t2-biosystems), also a co-founder, and a [materials science and engineering professor at MIT](https://ki.mit.edu/people/faculty/cima).\n\n**What this all means that the T2 has a direct pipeline into the brightest medical technology researchers from Harvard and MIT.**\n\n## Futuristic super-science: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)\n\nImagine being able to get into Apple when it first came out with the Macintosh: a revolutionary computer on a proprietary platform, that cost more than the competition, leading it to be a niche player-- but one that would influence the rest of the market.\n\nThat's how important I think T2 is.\n\nThe tech that powers T2's miniaturized \"nuclear magnetic resonance\" (NMR) only became possible in the last decade. T2 Biosystems refers to it as \u201c[T2MR](https://www.t2biosystems.com/products-technology/t2mr-technology/)\u201d without the \"nuclear\" part, to reduce confusion that there's anything radioactive about it. \n\nT2 holds [over 70 patents](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/t2-biosystems-inc), which include the [fundamental technology behind its instrument](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20121218005124/en/T2-Biosystems-Announces-Issuance-Patent-Direct-Detection). The latest one, granted just last month, \u201c[NMR methods for monitoring blood clot formation](https://patents.justia.com/patent/10697984)\u201d indicates possible future uses for the T2 platform to diagnose blood clots.\n\nBeyond T2, I cannot find any other commercialized applications of miniature magnetic resonance for diagnostics at this level.\n\nOne company I came across is \"[WaveGuide](https://waveguidecorp.com/our-technology)\" -- but their device is very different, and the company appears to be in developmental, private stage of their technology.\n\n## Finances\n\nT2 will have its second quarter report out within the next week, but already [last month released its preliminary numbers](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/30/2055796/0/en/T2-Biosystems-Announces-Preliminary-Second-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html) -- and they look good:\n\n&gt; * Estimated second quarter 2020 total revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.4 million to $2.6 million, compared to $1.8 million in the prior year period.\n&gt; * Estimated second quarter product revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.0 million to $1.1 million, compared to $1.3 million in the prior year period.\n&gt; * Estimated second quarter research and grant contribution revenues are expected to be in the range of $1.4 million to $1.5 million, compared to $0.5 million in the prior year period.\n&gt; * During the second quarter of 2020, the Company raised $8.4 million of net proceeds from the sale of 6.4 million shares through its ATM facility.*\n&gt; * Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2020 are expected to be approximately $36.5 million.\n\n^* Note the important factor: the company has the ability to raise funds \"At The Market\" by selling shares as needed. This obviates the \"secondary offering\" panic that is often precipitated by companies which announce they might be diluting their outstanding shares with a placement. *This indicates smart planning on the part of the company.*\n\n## Risk Factors\n\nCosts: as a new proprietary technology, the T2Dx platform is relatively pricey, at ~~$125,000~~ $100,000 a machine. However, as more labs buy in, this cost will go down due to economy-of-scale, and manufacturing improvements.\n\nAdoption: In part, owing to the costs, but also to the fairly recent establishment of the company, labs may be reluctant to invest in a new diagnostic system, with only a limited number of applications so far. As T2 adds more test panels to the platform, the case for its adoption will become easier to make.\n\nCompetition: There are many players in the RT-PCR diagnostic space, including QIAGEN's soon-to-be new owner, heavyweight Thermo Fisher. Thus, choosing the T2Dx Instrument may be overshadowed by bigger companies. However, having QIAGEN's CEO on the board may open the door to a possible acquisition of T2 Biosystems, to get access to its proprietary technology and patents.\n\n*Disclosure: I hold a small position of 800 shares in TTOO, and continue to add to it on dips*\n\nEDIT: Added Financials; fixed some grammar, punctuation.\n\nEDIT 2: Corrected list price, based on [earnings transcript from May 2019.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1492674/000119312519140936/d929260dex992.htm).",

I currently have 119 shares of SPCE at $15.30 (about \u00a31500) because it was something I believed in, and I built that up gradually after owning Apple, Amazon, Tesla etc and selling after I made small gains that I was happy with just to learn, and overall made maybe \u00a3150 in the process while building my account up to \u00a31500 (which to me is a lot). I had always held SPCE and did a lot of researching about the business and I whole heartedly believe in it, so I put that entire \u00a31500 into the stock and I'm currently up over 30% (although there's been a **lot** of sideways movement). Anyway, I'm coming around to investing my next large amount and to be honest I'm *very* apprehensive. I really missed the boat with Tesla (which is another company I truly believe in), and the FAANG stocks seem insanely overvalued while the others simply move sideways. \n\n**So, my question is this:** ***is this current market worth investing in?*** Are there any stocks out there that remain good buys? I'm in my early 20's and I'm looking to invest to help me get enough money for a property in the medium term (within 5 years), but I'm very worried that everything is so over valued, and also that there could be a second crash or significant correction.

The time frame of these options are 3-6 months out, to avoid Theta burn and maximize ITM potential. The beauty of these plays is that the stock only needs to move up a few % to be profitable, with a long time horizon as a hedge. Close the position within 2-4 months to minimize theta and maximize delta opportunity.\n\n**1) Wells Fargo $WFC \\[BANKING\\]**\n\nWells just got hammered after an expected poor earnings. This makes it a prime candidate for upward movement.\n\nBullish Wells Fargo Case:\n\nWells has a history of prudent underwriting, and we are probably closer than not to a turn in the credit cycle.\n\nWells Fargo's retail branch structure, advisory network, product offerings, and share in small and medium-size enterprises is difficult to duplicate, ensuring that the company's competitive advantage is maintained.\n\nWells offers the scale advantages of a money center bank without the risks and volatility associated with extensive capital markets operations.\n\n[Wells Fargo Profile, from my personal research platform](https://preview.redd.it/3f8ujvv2ewa51.png?width=3338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b461e92145d6899d7687ad57875c88594d0ac975)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap \\[99B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[46M\\]\n* Uptrend detected \\[Bounced off 52Wk Low as support\\]\n* \\*\\*Within 10% of 52 Week Low \\[52 Week Low was $22, WFC is trading at $24.14\\]\n\n[$WFC Overlay with $JPM - The charts are nearly identical](https://preview.redd.it/ig0t44y4ewa51.png?width=1110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=689f9828b64c20c7be6b9bd072450fedac1e5668)\n\nAs a big 4 bank, it is impossible for the Fed to allow WFC to go down. They have a good balance sheet, with a P/E ratio of 8.9, down from 11. The lower P/E ratio alone will bring in more long-term investors. If that isn't enough to make you comfortable, WFC offers a whopping 8% dividend yield, making it even more attractive.\n\nThis is an attractive investment for both options and stocks.\n\nLet's take a look at options on $WFC, which I found using my unusual options scanner:\n\n[Big Bullish bets for October 16 2020, 2 days after their next earnings.](https://preview.redd.it/9mcjifp6ewa51.png?width=3354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9e2026e3e5ed0104617eed11e8da53811e6b35b)\n\n[More Bullish Bets on WFC for October 16 2020](https://preview.redd.it/x2xktlc8ewa51.png?width=3354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85d8b91c0ec3fa064cfe526245d3cfc2b8167d79)\n\nThese huge bets range from $25 to $30, 3 months down the line. This averages to a $2.5, or 11% increase over the next 3 months. With this information, I propose:\n\n*WFC $27.50c Oct 16 2020, trading at $1.30 at time of writing. 24% Probability ITM.*\n\n*WFC $30c Oct 16 2020, trading $0.79 at time of writing. 16% Probability ITM.*\n\nI am currently invested in $WFC stock, and hold the $30 Oct 16 Calls.\n\n**2) Twitter $TWTR \\[Technology\\]**\n\nTwitter is poised to dominate with its huge reach and rumored subscription platform for content creators. Source:\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing)\n\nThis is a buy the rumor, sell the news play. I anticipate Twitter announcing this platform in the next 3 months.\n\nBullish Twitter Case:\n\nInvestments in product enhancements and video content could return the monthly active user growth rate to the double digits.\n\nThe deal with the NFL to live-stream Thursday night games and provide a platform for interaction and conversation about the games may attract more premium content providers to use the Twitter platform.\n\nGrowth in ad revenue per user remains strong at Twitter, more than offsetting the deceleration in user growth.\n\n[Twitter Profile, from my personal research platform](https://preview.redd.it/h0s26zv9ewa51.png?width=3354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1918faa353fcf0a92faa3f80688487534c10e73)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap \\[27B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[30M\\]\n* Uptrend detected \\[Strong upward trend since March\\]\n\n[$TWTR Overlay with $FB - the charts are nearly identical](https://preview.redd.it/h1dw581dewa51.png?width=1124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6768d69d773bcacb3889bfdc8e8aba142bbebb88)\n\nThe value that $TWTR and $FB lost due to lack of advertiser revenue has been recouped. The arrival of a subscription service is very bullish, because more and more people are looking to make money online since being laid off by COVID - Twitter's reach makes it incredibly well positioned to solve this problem. Subscriptions made $MSFT and $AAPL cash cows, expect the same for $TWTR.\n\nThis is an attractive investment for both options and stocks.\n\nLet's take a look at options on $TWTR, which I found using my unusual options scanner:\n\n[Huge Bullish $TWTR bets for Jan 15, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/59zizipeewa51.png?width=2988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dddcc03302fc0afebb346ad1c8f43a956f9e72e)\n\n[Huge Bullish $TWTR bets for Jan 15, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/tsn493rfewa51.png?width=2988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2691d1610be9118c14bbb88231c45d42f8fd82a)\n\n[Huge Bullish $TWTR bets for Jan 15, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/xr249owgewa51.png?width=2988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b831b18eb55a5753384dbcd300700d2410f1bf8)\n\nThese bets were placed BEFORE COVID, and $TWTR is trading at the same price as when these were placed. The strikes range from $40 to $60, 6 months down the line. Taking a Strike of $40, that is 15% OTM of the current price. If they announce the platform within the next 6 months (I predict they will), the stock will explode.\n\nWith this information, I propose:\n\n*TWTR $40c Dec 18 2020, trading at $3.25 at time of writing. 28% Probability ITM.*\n\n*TWTR $40c Jan 15 2020, trading $3.45 at time of writing. 29% Probability ITM.*\n\nBuying $40 Jan 15 2020 Calls are only $20 more for an extra month. Look to close these after their earnings next quarter, when they will likely announce the subscription platform.\n\nI am currently invested in $TWTR stock, and hold the $40 Dec 18 Calls.\n\n**3) Southwest Airlines $LUV \\[AIRLINES\\]**\n\nWarren Buffet and COVID have caused investors to turn a nose up at airline stocks. I don't blame them - the uncertainty will affect airlines more than most other industries. That said, don't miss this opportunity to profit off Southwest Airlines, as they have the best balance sheet in the industry.\n\nBullish Southwest Airlines Case:\n\nSouthwest enjoys the strongest brand in the industry thanks to its simple fare prices, free checked bags, and solid customer service. This brand equity will enable it to continue growing faster than peers and support unit revenue.\n\nMergers among Southwest's competitors will engender pricing power for the airlines, and oil prices will remain low for longer, boosting Southwest's top and bottom lines.\n\nSouthwest's aggressive expansion will continue, driving growth at the carrier.\n\n[Southwest Airlines Profile, from my personal research platform](https://preview.redd.it/infcvuqiewa51.png?width=3246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2991f099086973e667d6da4803aefb6dcd8fa64d)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap \\[20B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[15M\\]\n* Uptrend detected \\[Strong upward trend since June\\]\n\n[$LUV Overlay with $AAL and $DAL - Delta and American have been hit worse than Southwest for a reason.](https://preview.redd.it/xfy42kdkewa51.png?width=1116&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66499e33390418d218c222b558cd13424b9a3209)\n\n$LUV is performing better than its competitors, with higher lows and higher highs when comparing the charts. With the best balance sheet, its exposure to oil has been proven to be overcome since the whole oil futures fiasco. They have been prepped for the second wave and are most likely to weather the storm out of all the airlines.\n\nMy options scanner did not find any significant options data for $LUV.\n\nI propose:\n\n*LUV $40c Dec 18 2020, trading at $3.05 at time of writing. 25% Probability ITM.*\n\n*LUV $40c Jan 15 2020, trading $3.40 at time of writing. 26% Probability ITM.*\n\nI am currently invested in $LUV stock.\n\n**4) Ericsson $ERIC \\[Telecommunications Equipment\\]**\n\nWith growing tensions between the US and China, it is unlikely Huawei will be allowed to provide 5G infrastructure. The UK just announced that Huawei will NOT be providing 5G infrastructure, so Ericsson is poised to seize a huge market share.\n\nBullish Ericsson case:\n\nIncome sources could diversify as licensing revenue from 5G patents may grow through applications outside of Ericsson's handset manufacturer agreements.\n\n5G may afford Ericsson a longer spending cycle and higher equipment demand than previous wireless generations. Additionally, 5G should create more use cases for Ericsson's software and services within Internet of Things device networks.\n\nEricsson's turnaround measures are happening at an opportune time. Management's focused strategy should expand operating margins while 5G infrastructure spending increases top-line results.\n\n[Ericsson Profile, from my personal research platform](https://preview.redd.it/utcfp62mewa51.png?width=3236&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b62bffb1ec2fb915dbc8d11aa3b2b501f188b1f)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap \\[29B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[13M\\]\n* Uptrend detected \\[Strong upward trend since March, even stronger after UK Huawei announcement\\]\n\n[$ERIC Overlay with $NOK - Both stocks are strongly trending upward, with almost 100&amp;#37; gains since march.](https://preview.redd.it/bv5ozwmnewa51.png?width=1104&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=805b65f5b4f2a452677147a2f6f118d7cfd00d59)\n\n$ERIC is poised to bank on 5G since Huawei is being punished in retaliation to Chinese handling of Hong Kong. Expect more growth as infrastructure expands and Apple announces their 5G line this fall.

Regardless, I am picking up these calls.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on my research, $WFC, $TWTR, $LUV, and $ERIC are poised for big gains over the next 2 quarters. All the plays have a 25% chance of being ITM, but do not need to be ITM to be extremely profitable.\n\n**TL,DR:**\n\n*WFC $27.50c Oct 16 2020, trading at $1.30 at time of writing. 24% Probability ITM.*\n\n*WFC $30c Oct 16 2020, trading $0.79 at time of writing. 16% Probability ITM.*\n\n*TWTR $40c Dec 18 2020, trading at $3.25 at time of writing. 28% Probability ITM.*\n\n*TWTR $40c Jan 15 2020, trading $3.45 at time of writing. 29% Probability ITM.*\n\n*LUV $40c Dec 18 2020, trading at $3.05 at time of writing. 25% Probability ITM.*\n\n*LUV $40c Jan 15 2020, trading $3.40 at time of writing. 26% Probability ITM.*\n\n*ERIC $11 Nov 20 2020, trading at $0.50 at time of writing. 25% Probability ITM.*",

        "selftext": "So with a 4-1 split, how does that affect options volume and profitability in the future?  For example, let's say you are making 3-4 momentum moves a day on Apple in 5 contract lots.  Would there now be 4 times the volume of options traded thereby increasing liquidity or would this actually make it more difficult because the price is less per contract or??? \n\nTheoretically you can time 5 lot moves now and make $50-500...but a 5 lot move with a quarter of the price is a lot more challenging to make as much cash...as where 20 contracts make this about the same.  Hopefully this isn't confusing...",

        "selftext": "  \n\nMy fellow bulls, this is my first DD which gives this a 100% chance success rate. I\u2019ll keep this short and sweet. While you guys spent $85 watching grown men hug in an island for hours, I spent my time securing tendies for you. TSM is the play to make next week and here\u2019s why:\n\nTSM $64\n\nTSM is the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker and produces for Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, and Huawei. They do more than just this but I suggest doing your own research as I promised to keep this short and sweet. They are in a great position financially and have recently reported revenue in June of 40% increase over the last year and a 28% increase from the previous month. Obviously 5G stocks have been mooning, and although TSM will not be responsible for creating the technology, they will likely be the company producing those 5G chips. On top of this, Merica\u2019s government is paying TSM to build a $12 billion plant in Arizona. TSM produces chips for the U.S. F-35 jet. Setting up a plant in the U.S. will make it much easier for future productions of any military related needs, as they have less restrictions to worry about. \n\nAside from all of that, TSM has also recently agreed to the world\u2019s largest corporate green power purchase agreement. WTF does this mean? Well this purchase gives them ownership of some of the world\u2019s largest wind farms. Their goal is to be a 100% renewable energy operated company. Why the fuck does this matter? Besides it making this world a safer and healthier blah blah blah, it is a nice PR move. People love this kind of shit and it will definitely shed positive light into the company. More importantly, major companies such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook, are part of the RE100 (Renewable Energy 100). In the future TSM may be the supplier of this renewable energy to these major companies. \n\nAnd for those of you who care, the technicals on this are very bullish. It is not overbought nor is it oversold and the MACD crossover is signaling buy. I\u2019d say we hit at least $70 by EOW. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/wc0waMF](https://imgur.com/a/wc0waMF)\n\nAll the \u201cfinancial experts\u201d rate this as a great buy. Earnings will also be released 07/16 pre market. This is not an earnings play but regardless they are expected to beat their estimated earnings. I will be getting shares Monday and buying 08/28 $70c and 01/15/21 $80C. I will post proof of positions on Monday or as the kids say nowadays\u2026. BAN",

        "selftext": "So listen up you dumbfucks. This is an opportunity for those of us who aren't gay. My wifes boyfriend said he was holding Danske Bank A/S **(****DANSKE.CO****)** stock (he ain't that much of a chad afterall) and i started looking into the company. Here comes the juicy part for you low attention span fucks.\n\nThe 7. September 2017 DANSKE finally surpassed it's all time high of 250,775 DKK (that's 250.775 DKK for those dumb americans out there) it had reached back in 2008 and hit 257,400 DKK. Unfortunately, this is when shit hit the fan, and they where caught doing what banks do. Laundering money.\n\n[Apparently the bank was caught laundering 200bn euro over 9 years through their Estonian branch](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/21/is-money-laundering-scandal-at-danske-bank-the-largest-in-history), and apparently it was the biggest in history. Ofcourse investors where all over this shit suing left and right. DANSKE were going to defend themselves and have done so pretty decently so far. They are still gonna pay but not as much as first feared [as Danish state prosecutors dropped their investigation back in may](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-danske-bk-moneylaundering-ey-idUSKBN2351B8).   \nIt seems more likely that it is the  [executives that are going to pay the highest price](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-danske-bank-lawsuit-idUSKCN1P32CF), as they were the ones keeping a lid on this shit, even after being warned.\n\nThis all resulted in the price plummeting like most of you guys account value.  \n\n\n[Just putting this here. Some of you dumb cunts might want to look at a nice graph](https://preview.redd.it/xhmin8gd71b51.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbd2711230372e86f28a9c0798eee98f9073ba27)\n\nAt this point i'm questioning why i decided to write this bullshit. \n\nDANSKE have certainly taken a huge hit, but it is way to big. Yes they have lost a small bit of income From their Estonian branch as it has unfortunately been closed, But on the bright side they have taken their beating, and are recovering. Other big European banks had their [own scandals or were directly involved in this shit.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-moneylaundering-factbox-idUSKCN1QP1P2) However, they were not affected as much as DANSKE, and lets be honest, they probably have a scandal or two coming their way. (Who the fuck even buys Deutche Bank?!)\n\nAnyways, the bank had solid financials before the scandal and arguably aren't going to hit the highs of 2017 anytime soon, but it is just massively undervalued. The company is still the biggest lender in Denmark, and owns the app Mobilepay (more on that in a minute)\n\nEven though the bank lost a little more than 33.000 customers in total in 2018 and 2019, and their profit is down, it is mostly down to them putting in a real effort to clean up their image.  [(Yeah, you are outta luck you monolingual idiot, this one is in danish, but lets be honest who even reads the sources?)](https://www.berlingske.dk/virksomheder/danske-bank-taber-kunder-og-venter-kaempe-milliarddyk-i-2020)\n\nMaybe i should've just tagged this as a shitpost so i didn't have to use these fucking sources.\n\nBack to Mobilepay! It is basically a different version of apple pay, not related though, 90% of the danish population uses this shit, even my old grandma, who can barely use a phone, sends me money for my birthday through Mobilepay. This is big shit in this little communist shithole.  [Back in 2018 they surpassed 4 million users and were  introducing it to the Finnish market.](https://www.mobilepay.dk/nyheder/2018/12/06/mobilepay%20passerer%204%20millioner%20danske%20brugere) \n\n[That's 69&amp;#37; \\(nice\\) of the population using this fucking app daily ](https://preview.redd.it/wmjw011od1b51.png?width=514&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e976acdb2698caacd5059579f33f3683a7686725)\n\nThis app is also used by pretty much every fucking business in Denmark. Restaurants, mechanics, hotels, internet stores, anything you can imagine. This isn't going away, apple pay can gtfo. Mobilepay has been build up for almost 10 years and apple and google think they can come into our little communist country and win market share?! Ha, classic american businesses. Literally everyone uses this fucking app, so the pussies who didn't want to be customers in DANSKE, probably used their products anyways. \n\nAs we would say in danish, the short of the long is, buy some fucking calls on this shit. If you can't find options grow some balls and buy some CDF's like a real man instead of those pussies over there in america, saying they have so much freedom and yet the government has outlawed CDF's\n\nWell, i have to go cook up a romantic dinner for my wife and her boyfriend.Vi ses idioter!",

        "selftext": "**TL;dr: Buy Apple \ud83c\udf4e**\n\n* **Background lore:** [On March 23rd](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200323b.htm) the Feds made history by buying junk bonds ETFs ($LQD, $HYG, $JNK) for the first time in America's history.  Since then the Feds have been injecting liquidity into the financial market through SPVs set up for that specific purpose in order to prop the market up and effectively de-risked the market and in turn obstructed price discovery. 1.3 billion later, the market is trading sideways with dwindling volume in the equities market.\n* **Moving Forward:** With the Feds exhausting M1 (Open Market Operations), M2 (dropping reserve requirement to 0) and M3 (dropping the discount rate to 0.25%) we are at a stage where QE, interest rate and forward guidance have little effect in pumping up the market any further. If we see another plunge, the only thing that can save the market is providing [PPT (plunge protection team)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plunge-protection-team.asp) with unlimited firepower. The way to provide PPT with unlimited firepower is to let the Feds start purchasing ETFs directly. This brings us to the beginning of the Japanification of the US equities market.\n* **Japanification (Americanization):** Japan back in the 1990s walked the very same steps the US is walking today with the implementation of a zero interest rate policy in 1999. QE in 2001. And in 2010, Bank of Japan did the unthinkable and committed to buying TRILLIONS of yens of ETFs that track the Nikkei per year. BoJ currently owns over 75% of the country's equities market. The first tranche is dedicated to ETFs linked to Nikkei 225, JPX-Nikkei 400,\u00a0and the\u00a0Topix Index,\u00a0while the\u00a0second tranche is allocated exclusively to ETFs that track the Topix. Now here's the interesting bit. The Nikkei is a PRICE-WEIGHTED INDEX much like the DOW. Which means unlike the SP500 or TOPIX in this instance, ETFs that tracks the NIKKEI has holdings proportions that correspond to the price per share. Which means the more BoJ buys those ETFs, the more stocks with high prices pumps.\n* **The Play (DOW and SP500):** Now how can you profit from this? When you look at the DOW and the SP500, it has quite a lot of similar top holdings. AAPL, MSFT. BUT here's the thing.... since the DOW is PRICE-WEIGHTED, if the Feds start buying ETFs that tracks the DOW and the SP500 the biggest benefactors would be\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Top 4 Components|[DOW](https://www.marketscreener.com/DJ-INDUSTRIAL-4945/components/)|[SP500](https://www.marketscreener.com/S-P-500-4985/components/col=7&amp;asc=0)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Apple ($389)|Microsoft|\n|2|United Health Group ($303)|Apple|\n|3|Home Depot($259)|Amazon|\n|4|Goldman($211)|Facebook|\n\nNow you're gonna say, well fucking-golly-gee man. That's a lot of fucking words just to say \"buy Apple\" and you'd be right, though this does put into perspective which are the stocks that stand to gain the most from the Feds moving onto buying equities ETF (which they likely will when wave 2 hits for real and second wave of nationwide shut down is required). Let's not forget BA, CAT, CVX and a lot of O&amp;G companies that were hit the hardest and haven't recovered yet. They see to gain quite substantially from this policy. If you got some spare change, might be worth gambling a few bucks on calls to see if they spike. Long-dated, 2021 earliest.",

        "selftext": "Forget the hype about Tesla, Amazon is undervalued and is the safest place to park your money. I breakdown the reasons why below. Excuse the long post, but I like helping people make $. TLDR at the end. \n\nThe only way to look at Amazon's business is to separate it out into three very large businesses, I will break down each and why I believe the company as a whole is undervalued:\n\nA/ Retail &amp; Marketplace - this is the consumer facing portion of their business where Amazon buys at wholesale and then sells to shoppers. The latter (Marketplace), is the faster growing and more profitable business unit, now accounting for over 55% of all orders. Sellers use FBA and sell their products to shoppers directly where Amazon takes a \\~7%-\\~15% fee depending on the category.\n\nB/ AWS \u2013 fast growing cloud business operating at 26% gross margins with a $50B run-rate growing 30% YoY (do you know how crazy it was typing that out?)\n\nC/ Amazon Media Group - this includes their fast growing advertising business, Twitch, Amazon Music, and Amazon Prime Video. This is the least-known portion of their business, but is the fastest growing with highest margins.\n\n**Retail &amp; Marketplace**\n\nThere\u2019s not much to say here, other than Amazon does roughly \\~$250B in sales and growing 30% YoY on average here. For reference, Walmart does \\~$500B. Even if you gave the retail/marketplace portion of Amazon\u2019s business a conservative valuation of $500B (2x revenue), it\u2019s a very large business. Now, take into consideration how much they are emphasizing 3P sellers and private label products, Amazon\u2019s profitability metrics will greatly improve in this business as it lowers its overhead so the business in value will continue to grow. This also fails to mention their breadth of their FBA business and how many sellers use the product offering. If anyone has sold anything on Amazon or knows someone that does, 99% of sellers use FBA because of how easy, convenient, and cost-effective it is. With the tailwinds associated with COVID, this business will likely surpass 30% YoY growth, which is just incredible growth #s for a business this large. In comparison, Walmart is usually &lt;10% YoY growth when it comes to their revenue metrics.  \n\nMy valuation of the business = \\~$500B - $750B\n\n**AWS**\n\nAWS is projected to do around $50B-$60B in sales for 2020. Latest public analyst valuations peg it around \\~$500B, which I believe is unfair. For reference, MongoDB is trading at 20x revenue, Crowdstrike, DOCU, Datadog, all SAAS/cloud providers are trading at 20x or even more!\n\nValuing AWS as a standalone business for anything less than $500B would be under-representing just how large and fast-growing this business is. Growing at 30% YoY at a $50B run-rate is just unfathomable. If we were looking at this at a 20x revenue multiple (which I believe it would be valued at a 20x multiple if it was a standalone company), AWS would be at a $1 trillion market cap alone. It's the de-facto choice for start-ups, even as Azure continues to take customers away, AWS is the leader for all new tech/start-up companies and will continue to see massive tailwinds as the entire economy shifts to cloud-based offerings. COVID has also accelerated this business as usage is undoubtedly up for their core segment of customers, while customers that are most affected (restaurants) are not really AWS-like customers. \n\nMy valuation of this business unit = $650B\n\n**Amazon Media Group**\n\nAdvertising \u2013 Many people don\u2019t know much about this business, but you know the products you click on while you\u2019re shopping around on Amazon? It\u2019s safe to say a bunch of those products are paying Amazon significant dollars on a PPC basis (pay-per-click) to surface higher in the search results. This business generated $14 billion in revenue in 2019. Google, the leader in advertising, is valued at 10x revenue, so this business alone is probably worth close to $16B after 2020 alone. $FB did $73B in revenue trailing 12 months, this would mean FB is about 4.5x the size of Amazon's Advertising business ALONE. I just compared FB as a whole to Amazon's \"side-business\" in Advertising. \n\nTwitch \u2013 this is a tough business to value, but Needham and others have pegged it at \\~$15 billion alone. It\u2019s the clear leader in online streaming and Microsoft recently shutdown Mixer (their Twitch competitor). The possibilities here are endless, look for Amazon Advertising to plug in their data capabilities to target viewers of live streaming events with products soon. Twitch will soon be merged into the advertising ecosystem to begin serving targeted ads to viewers. Think ad-supported streams where there is some sort of revenue share back to the streamers. This feeds into the ecosystem where content creators make more $ (won't leave), advertisers get access to a valuable niche audience, and Amazon reaps the benefits of high-value/profitable advertising at 65% gross margins. \n\nPrime Video \u2013 the most surprising stat for Prime Video is that 20% of Prime members sign up primarily for Amazon Prime Video. With over 150M subscribers, analysts peg the value of Prime Video alone at $200b. Amazon has also entered the OTT ad-supported streaming market with IMDB TV (ad-supported free television). This is exclusive inventory that Amazon can offer to brands to advertise on, and compete directly with ROKU, which is valued at 15X revenue. \n\nLastly, Amazon Music has 30M subscribers. Apple has 60M, and Spotify 100M. Amazon Music (Who the fuck uses it, is already half the size of Apple Music and about a 3rd of Spotify...)\n\nBecause all the businesses aren\u2019t broken out, it\u2019s tough valuing the entire Media Group business, but it honestly could be in the range of anywhere b/w $300B-$600B off the synergies and potential for expansion. Again, as a standalone business, this suite of products would have public market investors salivating over the growth potential. \n\n**Hidden Value (Areas of Opportunity)**\n\nI went this entire DD without mentioning the huge competitive MOATs around voice (Echo = the leader), as well as their entire logistics/ground fulfillment network, Amazon GO stores, and their venture in the medical health space. Because it's nearly impossible to value these things as a whole, you can basically pencil w/e you want here from a valuation perspective.\n\n*Amazon Retail/Marketplace Business - $650B* \n\n*AWS - $650B*\n\n*Amazon Media Group - $400B*\n\n*Hidden Value - Go stores, Fulfillment Network, Self-driving, Echo (voice), Whole Foods, Medical Venture with JP Morgan &amp; Berkshire = $300B*\n\n**Total = $2B**\n\nTLDR: Amazon is undervalued at a $1.6B market cap, and the stock will be up to $3500 in the next year. Business units valued as stand-alone companies would be valued way more, growth potential is endless, and COVID has accelerated trends in favor of Amazon for the next 5 yrs. \n\n\\- Longterm bag holder",

WFC and LUV netted -$79 on a $854 investment. *These figures are based on buying one of each contract last week and selling them today*.\n\n**This post covers 3 Bullish or Bearish Option Plays across various industries.**\n\nCriteria for selecting Option Plays:\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM +\n* Uptrend or Downtrend detected\n\nUsing these criteria, I have curated a basket of plays. The time frame of these options are 3-6 months out, to avoid Theta burn and maximize ITM potential. The beauty of long plays is that the stock only needs to move a few % to be profitable, with a long time horizon as a hedge. Close the position within 2-4 months to minimize theta and maximize delta opportunity. I have also included a shorter time frame with higher risk/reward and lower premiums. Short plays are laid out, but not recommended.\n\n**1) Twitter $TWTR \\[Technology\\] - BULLISH**\n\nI recommended Twitter last week, and will do it again. Earnings, shaking off the security breach, and upcoming features all make $TWTR a very strong bullish pick.\n\nTwitter is poised to dominate with its huge reach and rumored subscription platform for content creators. Source:\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing)\n\nThis is a buy the rumor, sell the news play. I anticipate Twitter announcing this platform in the next 3 months. Twitter is up 3.5% today with earnings on Thursday, 3 days away.\n\nBullish Twitter Case:\n\nInvestments in product enhancements and video content could return the monthly active user growth rate to the double digits.\n\nThe deal with the NFL to live-stream Thursday night games and provide a platform for interaction and conversation about the games may attract more premium content providers to use the Twitter platform.\n\nGrowth in ad revenue per user remains strong at Twitter, more than offsetting the deceleration in user growth.\n\n[$TWTR Profile, from FindMarketPlays early access platform](https://preview.redd.it/v1ceykzbl3c51.png?width=3256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96fe76510776bb17607ce94665011cca7a902411)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap \\[29B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[30M\\]\n* Uptrend detected \\[Strong upward trend since March\\]\n\n[$TWTR overlay with $SNAP and $FB - the three social media giants posting huge gains](https://preview.redd.it/iguysw8dl3c51.png?width=1082&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=709b748003d0683cb943efa34eeee55a3d84e107)\n\nThe value that $TWTR and $FB lost due to lack of advertiser revenue has been recouped. The arrival of a subscription service is very bullish, because more and more people are looking to make money online since being laid off by COVID - Twitter's reach makes it incredibly well positioned to solve this problem. Subscriptions made $MSFT and $AAPL cash cows, expect the same for $TWTR.\n\nThe security fears involving accounts of Elon Musk, Bill Gates and the like have been squashed. By taking the breach as a positive, Twitter will beef up security for their accounts and prevent such attacks from occurring again.\n\nLets take a look at the options scanner:\n\n[Big money on a upwards $TWTR move, from FindMarketPlays early access platform](https://preview.redd.it/dsj3zipel3c51.png?width=1946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59afc505803bc2640b0f102f619505da3c4d45f2)\n\nDespite recommending this play last week, $TWTR surprised even me these past few days, completely powering through the security breach and meeting my % target 2 months early. Today, taking a Strike of $40, that is 8% OTM of the current price. If they announce the platform within the next 6 months (I predict they will), the stock will explode.\n\nWith this information, I propose:\n\n**Short Term Play \\[HIGH RISK\\]:**\n\n*TWTR $40c Aug 21 2020, trading at $1.81 at time of writing. 31% Probability ITM.*\n\n**Long Term Play:**\n\n*TWTR $40c Jan 15 2020, trading $4.50 at time of writing. 35% Probability ITM*\n\n**2) Moderna $MRNA \\[Biotechnology\\] - BEARISH**\n\n$MRNA has been riding the wave of COVID-19, and mercilessly profiteering off vaccine news. It popped on my radar because it made it on my most active movers watchlist, down 12% today.\n\n[Moderna Profile, from FindMarketPlays early access platform](https://preview.redd.it/6wwbjjvfl3c51.png?width=3244&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05ed95f2e55134c877cdaa651e93f8da24ecc9d8)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap \\[32B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[43M\\]\n* Downtrend detected \\[Strong downtrend, crashing off ATH\\]\n\n[$MRNA has a history of big dumps.

Unsurprisingly, it is hardly talked about across finance communities anymore, because it is finally consolidating around a range that I can feel comfortable with, especially with the quiet adoption of plant-based food sweeping the country and fast food chains.\n\nBullish Beyond Meat case:\n\nPlant-based meats (PBM) should continue to grow rapidly as the products gain additional share from the traditional ground meat category.\n\nBeyond Meat should be a major beneficiary of PBM growth, given its first-mover advantage, and the brand\u2019s strong performance in taste tests (consistently second only to privately held Impossible Foods).\n\nWe think Beyond Meat is the most likely PBM supplier to secure a U.S. deal with McDonald's, as Impossible Foods has backed out of the race, stating it does not have sufficient capacity to supply the chain.\n\n[Beyond Meat Profile, from FindMarketPlays early access platform](https://preview.redd.it/8u0opy9ol3c51.png?width=3320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8594b4b92c088cbfa0301195cadb74cef55b07f8)\n\nMeets Criteria?\n\n* 500MM + Market Cap \\[8B\\]\n* Average Daily Volume 5MM + \\[5M\\]\n* Uptrend detected \\[Consolidating near support, KFC news\\]\n\n[$120-$130 has served as a key support\\/resistance for $BYND in 2020](https://preview.redd.it/7dcj065rl3c51.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efb1a2ce40ada665a7f8bbe6ebd5c2abb1e26430)\n\nKFC is testing Beyond Meat fried chicken.

        "selftext": "God this post is such heat.\n\nWhen looking at where the market is going to go, it is obviously important to have an understanding of where we have been. Let's take a look at one of my favorite stocks: AAPL. Let's see what they are up to down in Silicon Valley.\n\n[OOF! WTF Tim Cook? ](https://preview.redd.it/9mo3mqf8tzc51.png?width=2194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad226ae523d4ac81d23954d79e6f24721f2a19d5)\n\nNow, if you look closely you'll see what I like to call, A Triangle. This is a 10/10 shape. Perfection. Not included in this chart was the MACD indicator which was showing HEAVY bearish divergences for about 2 weeks prior to breakout. If you had gotten into puts near that tip of the triangle you could ridden AAPL down from nearly 382-284 to 356-60. Now this is where things get tricky, you may be asking yourself, \"But, if I buy puts, does that mean I'm a gay bear?\". Good question, but no. You will not become a Gay Bear as long as you lose money buying FDs after you cash out at the bottom.\n\nAnyway, back to the main attraction:\n\nI'm sure by now all of you have heard about the LEGENDARY stock that is AMD. Well, when looking at AMD's slightly more successful older brother, **NVDA**, we see something worth a second look...\n\n[Do you see what I see???](https://preview.redd.it/h2n8kwzduzc51.png?width=2328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2257c88b3d7e51b85840bc4571dd353b9975a86)\n\nBoys, we got ourselves another triangle. God I fucking love triangles. 11/10 shape. Now, looking at what happened to AAPL we know that a good volume push close to the tip of this triangle is going to be PARABOLIC. Now, I'm no stock expert, I'm an autist like you. BUT, I'm gonna be watching this stock as the week goes on and I see a massive move coming in the future. NVDA could just blow up and hit 500, IDK, AMD did some wacky shit hitting 70 this week so weirded things have happened. Honestly though, I'm personally bearish on it as of now, too early to tell.\n\nOh boy, I'm getting excited thinking about the tendies I'm gonna make on NVDA. Alright, we got more work to do though. Onto **BABA**:\n\n[I'll let you guess what shape it is ;\\)](https://preview.redd.it/zpwnnb5pvzc51.png?width=2204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad856a70513a8925b2a1d48e602367f84adeeab1)\n\nI never have any complaints about this shape. Squares, circles, I could take em or leave em, but Triangles?! I'm there every time. I'm very bearish on BABA. MASSIVE bear flow coming in early last week and I fully expect it to continue this week. A break of this triangle on the downside and we see 230. Buckets.\n\nWe got ONE MORE, because TWO guaranteed plays seriously just isn't enough. \n\n[I stumbled on this Bad Larry last week, thank god for FlowAlgo seriously ;\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xxnrssdkxzc51.png?width=1790&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89795a6361062584b2bea420052fe59cda54b586)\n\nIt looks like this triangle still has a long time to go before we see anything worth playing but if you wanted to get really freaky, you could the bounced off the trend lines ;). Up to you and your own RM. Anyways, This play I could see going both ways but there is no denying we are consolidating right now and when we break out I'm gonna waiting to scoop up all the tendies like and finally buy my girlfriend's husband something nice. \n\nIf you guys see any triangles, let me know! I'm always down to talk geometry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: \n\n**NVDA, BABA, SQ, next week watch for FLOW and breakouts, big moves incoming.**",

While investing in ESG covers a broad range of themes, we are focused on evaluating suitable targets that have existing environmental sustainability practices or that may benefit, both operationally and economically, from our management team\u2019s commitment and expertise in executing such practices. We believe our management team\u2019s experience allows us to evaluate targets in industries such as **manufacturing (including auto, building materials), chemicals, services (including waste, environmental, construction), logistics (including transportation, distribution), technology (hardware, software, devices), agriculture (including biofuels) and energy (with focus on renewable generation, utility services, energy efficiency/management), among others**. Furthermore, our target universe could include **companies undergoing a transition to increase their environmental sustainability profiles**, reflecting an opportunity to bring environmentally sustainable practices to companies that may not have historically been focused on environmental sustainability. We believe there is a wide array of companies undergoing this **\u201cbrown-to-green\u201d transition** in our target universe.
