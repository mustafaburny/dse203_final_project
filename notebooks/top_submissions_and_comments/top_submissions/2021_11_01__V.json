        "selftext": "Hey guys I wanted to share my story in hopes that some of you defend will learn from my mistakes. Also for those of you who are experiencing something similar, I want you to know you can make it. So without further ado, here is my story (proof).\n\nhttps://ibb.co/3r1pNVX\n\nFor every gains porn post someone out there is on the other end with a loss. I can still remember when the GME runup began. I was so sure it would blow over in a day, and I picked up 10k in 3 month out puts just as GME crested 40 dollars. I remember as it skyrocketed I even found myself up on my position as the I/V grew. But I wanted more and I was so sure it would be back to 4 dollars in a month or two. Lesson one, don't get too smart, and don't fight the market.\n\nWell, a few months rolled by and the expiration on my options was getting close, they had slashed in value down to a third and even though GME had fallen, they weren't worth what I paid for them. I could have cut my losses and been out about 5k. But this is where I made my second mistake. Trading options on emotion. I couldn't believe my puts were priced correctly so I rolled them out a few more months, and aggressively. My position was now 50k instead of 10k. I couldn't let go of my ego and take the loss.\n\nWell, as fate would have it, a few days later GME would rip back up into the 200s. My freshly rolled position, started collapsing, and fast. I remember sitting at work every day, constantly pulling out my phone and staring at the GME ticker, waiting for any drop, hoping to be saved. But, my salvation never came, and my position got worse and worse. Enter my third mistake, doubling down. At this point I was desperate. I wanted, needed, to make my money back, so I averaged down, and averaged down again. My position was now worth just over 100k.\n\nWith each passing day, my position ticked down in value. I remember one day so vividly as I saw my losses pile up into the 80k range I noticed sharp pain in my chest. It had been getting harder and harder every day, and the extreme stress was taking a toll on my body. I held on for a few more days, but the pain was getting worse, and I was literally shaking (tm), from the stress. Finally I called it. I closed my position down a total of just over 100k. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done. \n\nAs pathetic as this sounds, I remember actually crying several times thinking about what an idiot I was. When you lose that kind of money, and for me this wasn't play money, it takes you to a dark place. I remember ringing in my head over and over, what was I thinking, how could I make such a mistake. It was one of my lowest points ever, and it felt like I would never feel normal again, anyone who has been in my shoes knows what I'm talking about.\n\nWell, it's been 7 months sense then and I will never touch an option again. I know now that I have a gambling problem and I can't put myself in that kind of position. It has been hard, to come to terms with losing something I spent many years of my life building, but I have made it through. To anyone who is where I was, right now, I know how it feels, and I promise you the age old adage, time heals all wounds is true, it does get easier.\n\nAnyway, thanks to anyone who read all the way through, I hope I can somebody out there learns from my mistakes, or at the very least cracks a smile laughing at my misfortune. I wouldn't be who I am now without my experience, so cheers you beautiful bastards.",

        "selftext": "Greetings, lads. Elon\u2019s TweetThreats and PP posts aside, EV stocks are melting faces this month. Consider the following\u2026\n\n* Rivian IPO blew up. Share price $110. Now $98B market cap.\n* Tesla +120% since May. SP $1,190. Now $1.2T MC.\n* Lucid +100% in three weeks. SP $52. Now $86B MC.\n\nLike you, SoFi didn\u2019t fill my $RIVN IPO order. Nor did I catch the $LCID  $15 dip. And sadly, I wasn\u2019t able to get in on $TSLA at $40 two years  ago.\n\nBut here\u2019s our chance for an early entry into one of the only EV \u201cpure plays\u201d in the market:\n\nPolestar \u2014 Volvo\u2019s EV spinoff brand \u2014 estimates 2021 revenue of $1.2B and 29,000 vehicles on the road.\n\nIt\u2019s now coming to market at a $20B valuation with $GGPI in Q1 2022.\n\nPolestar is the only global EV \u2018pure play,\u2019 other than Tesla.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/av4nl8i87d181.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68f1d78905547fea74ffaba96cd6265c7a4a33a8\n\n**History**\n\nA little background\u2026\n\n* \u201cPolestar\u201d takes its name from the North Star, or Polaris \u2014 not the resourceful co-ed grinding the early-evening shift at the Spearmint Rhino. That\u2019s *Polstj\u00e4rnan* (literal translation, \u201cPole Star\u201d) if you\u2019re Swedish.\n* Polestar was started in 1996 by Volvo\u2019s partner, Flash/Polestar Racing.\n* Volvo acquired Polestar in 2015. Volvo had itself been acquired in 2010 by Geely, a China-based auto brand that sells vehicles under the brands Geely Auto, Lotus, Lynk &amp; Co, Proton, and Volvo. Geely sold over 2.4 million cars in 2020.\n* Volvo and Geely describe the Polestar brand as being \u201cindependent since 2017.\u201d\n* Polestar is co-owned by Volvo and Geely, and headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden.\n* Polestar is now being taken public at a $20B valuation by the Gores-Guggenheim, ticker GGPI.\n\n**Comps**\n\n**GGPI is trading at a significant discount to TSLA and LCID, based on EV/sales multiples.**\n\n* Applying Tesla\u2019s 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of $42.51 As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase of 210%.\n* Applying Lucid\u2019s 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of  $47.58. As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase  of 247%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vrmfi8ga7d181.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c0a7af961e3f7ee4e20df9747b005fbff44af7d\n\n**Peer Multiples -- EV Pure Plays**\n\n* GGPI is essentially valued at the same forward multiples as XPEV and NIO.\n* Bear in mind, XPEV and NIO are higher-risk companies that deserve valuation discounts because:\n\n1. The CCP can theoretically shut them down at any moment without warning (see: $DIDI).\n2. The stocks are actually ADRs and based in the Cayman Islands, so you don't even own the actual companies.\n\n* By comparison, GGPI is headquartered in Sweden and already US-listed on the Nasdaq.\n* Polestar is already an established OEM, leveraging the strategic relationship with Volvo in manufacturing, design and marketing. Hence, the investment   opportunity is lower risk since Polestar is not a start-up.\n* As with most present-day multinationals, there is some China-related production risk. However, Polestar is addressing the issue by opening US factories going forward.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n5mgt00e7d181.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7487924a42825ba052899aa03fc4fae3d1abe9ec\n\n**Gores' Deals**\n\nGores\u2019 track record speaks for itself\u2026\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t1uq0jcg7d181.jpg?width=1972&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6571264d9347fd8f8c237881e1d511b8cca7fae\n\n**The EV Graveyard**\n\nThe EV battlefield is littered with bodies.\n\nBut Polestar?\n\nThey've   been executing all year and have already delivered 29,000 cars. How  many deliveries of the first-gen Roadsters had Tesla made in 2010 when  they IPO\u2019d? Answer: 1,400.\n\nPolestar just makes cars, baby.\n\nCEO Thomas Ingenlath: \u201cWe have a proven track record. We actually deliver cars. We have 29,000 deliveries this year.\u201d\n\nClaim confirmed. And look at that jawline.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bdws59yi7d181.jpg?width=279&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acb198c00c9a8a7fd9ddbfa26f07a251d0438ccf\n\nPolestar estimates 65,000 deliveries in FY22 and revenues in excess of $3B.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tdq7nril7d181.jpg?width=841&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfe3b9e83a69063aec615d270af306824db49745\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dzlwasso7d181.jpg?width=991&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db9cf4dfb907d3d3313827d086b4a76b653cd4a7\n\n**The Product**\n\nThe Polestar 1 came out in 2019. It\u2019s a hybrid premium sports car that will set you back $155K\u2026 619 horsepower, 738 lbs of torque, 0-60 in 3.8 seconds and clears the quarter mile in 12.0 seconds at 119.1 mph. They\u2019re badass, and hard to find.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0dasupiq7d181.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=434e3a17bb658785780fc7c8b6fff3256126e0bc\n\n**Polestar 2**\n\nThe Polestar 2 launched in 2020. Polestar 2\u2026 What is it?\n\nThink Subaru Outback meets the Model 3 \u2014 with a dash of the minimalist Swedish aesthetic. It\u2019s a sedan, but its higher ride- height and rugged body make it seem more like a crossover. It opens like a   hatchback. Let\u2019s call it a \u201ccrossover coupe.\u201d Available now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x8zmzdds7d181.jpg?width=855&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a84378d4ccd083505763069ba3fbd8d058eeead8\n\n**Comparison**:\n\n\\*\\*Versus the Tesla Model 3\\*\\*\n\nThe Polestar 2 compares favorably to the Tesla 3 in both price and range:\n\n**Polestar 2**\n\nMSRP:   $47,200\n\nFederal tax credit:  -$7,500\n\nTotal:      $39,700\n\nRange:      265 miles (single-motor base model)\n\n**Tesla Model 3**\n\nMSRP:       $43,990\n\nFederal tax credit:      Does not currently qualify\n\nTotal:      $43,990\n\nRange:      262 miles (base model)\n\nSource: [https://www.kbb.com/comparison/2022-polestar-2-vs-2022-tesla-model-3/](https://www.kbb.com/comparison/2022-polestar-2-vs-2022-tesla-model-3/)\n\n**Upcoming Polestar lineup\u2026**\n\n* Polestar 3 (2022) \u2014 luxury electric SUV built in the USA at Volvo\u2019s South Carolina factory.

This is all pending passage in the Senate, but it looks promising.\n\nRelevant highlights:\n\n* The bill includes a restructured federal tax credit for EVs to up to $12,500.\n* Promises $7.5 billion to help establish a nationwide network of EV charging stations.\n* An additional $65 billion will be invested toward overall clean energy and renewables for the US electricity grid.\n\nSource: [https://electrek.co/2021/11/06/congress-passes-1-2-trillion-infrastructure-bill-12500-ev-tax-credit-still-awaits-passage/](https://electrek.co/2021/11/06/congress-passes-1-2-trillion-infrastructure-bill-12500-ev-tax-credit-still-awaits-passage/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Brand Rollout**\n\nWhile watching the Braves clap the Astros in the World Series a couple weeks ago, I saw this TV commercial:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY99MWzQFlk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY99MWzQFlk)\n\n* It turns out Polestar launched a massive brand campaign on Oct. 22nd across key markets globally.\n* Launched ahead of COP26, the campaign features an environmentally-themed spot narrated by American astronaut Karen Nyberg that reflects on human advancement, the way we live now and the damage we're doing to the   planet.\n* Nyberg: \"Our need to advance our species often comes at the expense of our home.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What\u2019s our boy Cramer at CNBC have to say?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x4416g7y7d181.jpg?width=404&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f2cb070788b53713d719de41c9eac937041c70c\n\n***Cramer on $GGPI:***\n\n* \u201cThey\u2019re connected with Polestar. OK, here\u2019s the problem: Rivian is coming public. This group has gotten a little too hot.

GGPI on the other hand, has a NAV (net asset value) floor of approximately $10 until merger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What does Leo have to say?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ftekhvy08d181.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=323fed8deaa4eac96ef21ac80768900f4afd3bc9\n\nWell, we don\u2019t know a lot about Leo\u2019s investment in Polestar, but Bloomberg reports:\n\n* \u201c\\[CEO\\] Ingenlath declined to comment on how big a stake\u2026 DiCaprio \\[has\\] in  the  company. \u2018One of the strong stories that is inherent to Polestar is sustainability,\u2019 Ingenlath said on Bloomberg Television. \u2018It\u2019s as well very important for Leo.

Actually melting all minerals and produce from \u201cscratch\u201d.)  BOFs are huge, expensive, time consuming and 'old school'\n\nNOTE:  If you have never seen an EAF operate then click the following link and enjoy. No nothing in the video is going wrong, that is how its suppose to run..... insane.....\n\n[EAF FURNACE @ 80 MW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j2jESz7Zl8&amp;ab_channel=%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%90%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B4%D0%B8)  \n\n\nCurrently there is a nationwide CONCERN growing in scrap haulers, steel salesman (me) but most of all, in the EAF mills. These concerns are about nationwide scrap supply. Like serious concerns. In fact steel prices have taken a very aggressive dip within the last 3 weeks and right now there is talk of scrap costs going up. (Seems impossible, but it suggests the mills are nervous about supply moving forward.  \n\n\nSOOO why is this important? Well what happens if for some reason the EAF mills cannot get scrap they have ONE alternative\u2026. They must use what the industry calls iron pellets. And how do you make those in large volume, large enough to sustain an entire mill?  \n\n\nWith an 'old school' BOF mill.........\n\n  \nCLF (gonclaves) has been buying A LOT of the old BOFs in this country. People have laughed at him for it since they arent cutting edge anymore. Perhaps he sees something. And I believe he does.  \n\n\nCLF could be in a position at one point where they are suppling their competitors pellets because their competitors cant fill their own orders.  \n\nNucor uses an EAF mill.  They also have DRI plants which make these pellets.  However most EAF mills do NOT have that capability.  And even with Nucor they cannot make enough to run all of their operations.  ALSO, MORE EAFs are currently being built, in my opinion flooding the market.... there is another selective pressure on scrap supply/cost.\n\nSo my prediction is that scrap will get tight, maybe even experience the dreaded 'shortage' and the only way for them to melt more steel is buy the pellets from a BOF mill.\n\nAnd who owns most of the BOF mills in the country?  Cleveland Cliffs.....\n\nMy god is this a long play but the upside potential\u2026..\n\nNO i did not look at charts, or do analysis, nor did i look at trends. (Trends are fucking retarded right now, there are no trends.... we in the steel industry are in total uncharted waters.)  Why uncharted? \n\nThis is the highest steel costs have ever been.  And not the highest in the country's history.... the highest they have been in the entire history of the steel industry from the day it was created.... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my predication comes from 12 years buying and selling nonprime, working in a processing facility, tracking pricing and steel 'futures' while also analyzing the chemistry of certain items AND bidding on material on a weekly basis. \n\nCharts are great and all, but a chart/technicals cannot hold my jockstrap.  Cant beat the info you get actually being on the battlefield. \n\nPlease reach out if anyone has any questions!",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve made and continue to make mistakes trading options, but every mistake makes me better and helps ensure I take a step back and don\u2019t get complacent. I\u2019ve committed to posting regularly to save others the pain of losing if I can and to help cement what I\u2019ve learned in my own head. I hope this post helps. It\u2019s not at all meant to show off, as I\u2019ve traded sideways in this IRA account for several months now, but recently changed strategies and they are working despite a little pull backs the past couple days. \n\n**Buying &amp; Selling Pfizer**\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of headlines about Pfizer lately, most of it very good news. So it\u2019s not surprising that the stock has been moving up. But it\u2019s wildly undervalued in my opinion. Prior to Covid, the stock was trading around $38 per share with about 50B in revenue. Last quarter alone they did $24B in revenue with sales boosted by the vaccine sales. Not only will this revenue trend continue, but they will be adding capacity to sell 21 million doses of the Covid-19 oral therapy next year at $700 a dose. That\u2019s another $15B of revenue. \n\nThe naysayers think these sales figures are short-lived or will wane quickly with the virus, but to this I say two things: first, it doesn\u2019t matter, money is money. Second, they are not accounting for the fact that 90 governments have already stepped forward to begin purchasing and stockpiling these pills to avoid the sort of supply chain issues everyone was having when the vaccines first appeared. So even if no one takes the pills, they will be purchased and stored. The U.S. has already ordered \u201cmillions\u201d of the anti-viral pills. \n\nPfizer expects vaccine sales of 36B in 2021 and 29B in 2022. Add to that the anti-viral pills and they are going to be hitting $44B in covid drugs next year - that\u2019s the entire revenue of previous years and does not count any sales from their other products. Now, they do share revenue with BioNTech, so we need to discount the vaccine sales by half, but that still equates to almost $30B more revenue next year.\n\nTo the naysayers that argue this revenue is short-lived: we don\u2019t yet know that is true as this virus has proven to be tricky and it\u2019s likely the covid shot is the new annual flu shot, as was the case with swine flu. More importantly, the profit from these drugs will fuel a major acquisition spree. They can go buy their next blockbusters without R&amp;D risk.\n\nSo what am I doing about all this? I bought 30 Jan23 options contracts $40 strike when Pfizer dipped last month. I sold 10 last week for a 100% gain. I\u2019m going to ride the remaining 20 up to a price target of $65 a share. I will pick up more on any major selloffs. \n\n**I Loaded Up on CROX**\n\nI can\u2019t say enough good things about this stock, which I have been trading for a couple years now because I don\u2019t like holding through the volatility. The short version is, they are absolutely killing it and despite initial concerns about potential knock offs and rubber shortages, people continue to stay brand loyal and buy them up. When you walk down the street and see half the kids wearing them, you know they have done something amazing with their brand. And they financials show it: \n\n425% earnings growth\n\n73% revenue growth\n\n65% gross margin (incredible)\n\nP/E of 15\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to find bargains in this market, but when CROX pulled back in October, I bought some 2023 calls when the price rose above 140 (because I could tell the momentum was under it then). It\u2019s hanging around 174 right now and normally I would have exited but because of my past trades of getting out a little early, I sold my original investment and am going to hang on to the rest until the stock crosses 200.  \n\n**I Bought On QualComm\u2019s Buyback**\n\nOn Oct 12th, I got an alert from my favorite new system, LevelFields, that QualComm would be buying back $10B worth of stock aka 7% of the company at the time. IMHO there is no stronger signal to the market of a company\u2019s financial health than a buyback. It means, typically, that the leadership is so confident in the market position, sales, cash flow, and economic environment that they\u2019d rather repurchase stock than spend more money to grow revenues or save for a rainy day. \n\nWhen the buyback occurs before earnings are out, it\u2019s a good sign it\u2019s going to be a blockbuster earnings report. When the news hit, the stock was trading at 122/share. Sure enough, when earnings came out in November, they crushed it. Record revenue, beat earnings consensus by 13% ($2.55/share), and upped guidance revenue going forward. \n\nI bought the Jan 2023 calls at a 140 strike price and intend to hold them until the stock reaches 200. \n\nThe stock hit 170 recently and had a bit of a pullback on what appears to be profit taking and inflation worries.\n\nThere\u2019s some volatility ahead but I will hold through the chop this time because the company is on the right path and the analysts are all calling for 185-204 ranges. \n\n**I Bought and Sold Puts on Pullbacks** \n\nA strategy I\u2019ve grown to love is selling puts towards the end of a pullback on stocks I want to own. I did this for Visa after its earnings sell-off at the end of October. Now, I have owned Visa since its IPO and the position has grown quite large over time so I\u2019ve been trimming it over the years and now look for ways to profit from trading it. Headed into earnings, I suspected a good chance of a pullback and got ready to sell the dip. \n\nAs expected, it sold off, got hit with a government antitrust investigation, and tumbled some more. On the government investigation news, I sold puts on it when it had fallen 10% down to the 210 level and raked in the premiums. \n\nI like using Fidelity\u2019s options analyzer to help ensure the puts I\u2019m selling fall outside at least one standard deviation from expected price movements. It\u2019s one of the more helpful ways of visualizing where to aim.\n\nI also bought puts on Visa prior to earnings at the money for one week out with an order to sell once I hit a $10,000 profit. It sold off in a few hours and I got the Fidelity notification I had just made $10,000 in a day while making lunch. \n\nThere are some more trades I made, but I\u2019m out of time for writing today so hopefully can come back to those another time (UPST, INMD, UCTT, CELH).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[25&amp;#37; in cash, 75&amp;#37; invested in this account for effective return of 36&amp;#37; until the recent pullback](https://preview.redd.it/tn38hd19nyy71.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12693a0d345ce0838452cfb8f0e7f5ba893a8af5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xen04fvhnyy71.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efb6614d4f6e2a30e69f53e81f09cd6242683c6d",

        "selftext": "TLDR:  I did a bunch of math based on some reasonably good ideas to determine a  selection of stocks worth investing in. Tables of stocks found below.  My diamond hands are so rough on my fleshy...forearms. I can't type anymore.\n\n# Observations/Assumptions\n\nBefore  you jump down my throat, these are simplified observations/assumptions,  not internationally agreed upon mandates from heaven. Okay, now you can  jump down my throat.\n\n* Companies  with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a  sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies  missing one or more of those attributes.\n* For most people it is impossible to time the market\n* Stock prices have all available information priced into them.\n* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.\n* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)\n* [Index  fund returns, such as the S&amp;P 500, are now predominately determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)\n* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).\n* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 (yes, simplified)\n* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.\n* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.\n* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:\n   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)  even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have had  losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing in  that same set of stocks in the same proportions.\n   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don\u2019t want to support.\n   * Due  to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the  index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when Tesla  was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on 11/16/2020,  forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up the price,  which had already been driven up by people buying the stock knowing it  was then going to get added to the index forcing more people to buy the  stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular, that\u2019s because it is.\n\n# Hypothesis\n\nUsing  industry benchmarking against the best of the best of the best  companies in each industry in order to purchase only the best companies  in equal measure should provide a well-diversified portfolio that over  the long term should be able to beat the S&amp;P 500.\n\n# Experiment 2020\n\n750  largest US stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry  (Industry details available further down the post). Stocks were given a  score based on their relative percentage compared to the industry index.  For example, each companies\u2019 average ROE of the last 4 years was  compared to this index value with the following type of breakdown:\n\n* ROE &lt; Index ROE = Poor = 1\n* ROE &gt; Index ROE = Moderate = 2\n* ROE &gt; 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3\n\nFor  example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was  10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,  they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they would  receive a moderate rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would receive a  great rating.\n\nThis was done for all of the metrics below:\n\n* ROE\n* Revenue Growth %\n* EBITDA %\n* FCF %\n\nThe  relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there  was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth  only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be  decreased to 125% for a better distribution.\n\nAny stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.\n\n[ROE Example](https://preview.redd.it/t7l27u9tu6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f904309edb170cc8679189ea62f7bbe057646a3d)\n\nROE Example\n\nThat left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.\n\nThis  left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the  company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently  in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them  being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire? Has  WSB said it's a buy? Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason  that I want to exclude them?\n\nThat left 26 across 7 sectors.\n\n[Industries 2020 Experiment Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/3gurx91wu6081.png?width=366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e37aa1afdb655721fc83dff4e75867923e48cc1)\n\n**2020 Industry Breakdown**\n\nThese  26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and  September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total  purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.\n\n2020 Experiment Results July, August, and September 2020 purchases to 11/16/2021\n\n* **S&amp;P 500** total return reinvested dividends: **49.09%**\n* **My 26 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **61.53%**\n\nCan we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.\n\n# Experiment 2021\n\n2,850  tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.  The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:\n\n* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company\n* Profit Margin \u2013 shows how effective the business is at making money\n* Operating Margin \u2013 shows how much money the company earns on its revenue\n* FCF Margin \u2013 shows how efficient a company is with their cash\n* EBITDA Margin \u2013 shows a companies\u2019 operating profitability\n* ROE \u2013 shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money\n* ROA \u2013 shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits\n* ROIC \u2013 shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns\n* Debt/Equity Ratio \u2013 shows the financial stability of a company\n\nMore  metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to  determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to  median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of  the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:\n\n\u00b7  3 stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over  the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry is  then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmark.\n\nEach  stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the  metrics and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite  score out of 27, from 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the  metrics. The scores are based on how much better they are then the  average. I measured them against the benchmark using the same  methodology as previously performed: Poor &lt; 100%, Good &lt; 150%,  Great &gt; 150%. Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the  particular metric to find a useful distribution.\n\nI  also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst TICKER THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED (evidently a stock that cannot be named because I was banned the first time I posted this) with a score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9 categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn\u2019t match the original  input (congratulations on your reading comprehension), this is primarily  due to mergers/acquisitions or the stock being taken private. Another  stock was acquired during the analysis, changing the max number yet  again.\n\nHere is an example showing Aerospace &amp; Defense scoring:\n\n[Aerospace &amp; Defense scoring](https://preview.redd.it/5r8i1qb0v6081.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=947be14d943204b8211c0933e9c1f1a41d4a1986)\n\nHere is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company\u2019s most recent year):\n\n[Growth Scoring](https://preview.redd.it/a2nq8c1av6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1f79a62b587bf6f1530f5beefda1b174b5d7d43)\n\nHere is an example of the visualizations for the data:\n\n[Data Visualization Example](https://preview.redd.it/5d41vcvdv6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26567d730e1d668ccef856a18497fab38345577b)\n\nI  applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at  the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock  that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a  high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.\n\nNext,  I read the description of \\~300 stocks and looked through their  financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off  their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly  leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that  Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns  Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them (how could you not?), no  there are not great synergies between the sectors of the business, yes,  they are aware of this. I also eliminated industries I wasn\u2019t interested  in reviewing, such as REITS due to the need to look at different  metrics like FFO, Oil and Gas because it\u2019s oil and gas, etc. These  activities eliminated \\~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I\u2019d  need to build a separate model.\n\nI  then looked at each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made  the cut. Are all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are  the profit margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt  situation, did WSB say it's a buy, etc. Who deserves to be on this list?  This eliminated \\~75.\n\nWe were down  to 84 stocks at this point. I then looked at each company's investor  presentation, annual report, etc. to better understand what the company  does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was not nearly as thorough on  this portion this year compared to last year just due to the substantial  increase in companies, 26 vs 84. My hourly wage at McDonald was going  to be better than my returns from the analysis if I took too long. I  only eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies across 31 industries. Breakdown below:\n\n[Industry Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/0bmcwyuiv6081.png?width=390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0df395664265ef942ff736c889108711216e76ed)\n\nI then purchased all of these in equal proportion in April, May, and July of 2021.\n\n2021 Experiment Results April, May, and July 2021 purchases to 11/16/2021:\n\n* **S&amp;P 500** total return including reinvested dividends: **11.93%**\n* **My 2021 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **14.26%**\n\n# Industry Classification\n\n* For Experiment 2020, the Sector was used to determine how companies should be compared.\n   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.\n   * This  seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each other  that aren\u2019t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE below.\n* For Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.\n   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.\n   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).\n   * I  ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further. Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less than 10  stocks. I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they could be combined such  as biotech and pharmaceutical.\n\n# 2020 Stocks\n\nABMD\n\nADBE\n\nANET\n\nBWXT\n\nCRL\n\nDG\n\nENR\n\nETSY\n\nEXEL\n\nICLR\n\nISRG\n\nKLAC\n\nLKQ\n\nLRCX\n\nMNST\n\nMPWR\n\nMTCH\n\nOLED\n\nPAYC\n\nPHM\n\nTER\n\nTTD\n\nUI\n\nVEEV\n\nVMW\n\nVRTX\n\n# 2021 Stocks\n\nAAON\n\nAAPL\n\nACN\n\nADBE\n\nAEIS\n\nALGN\n\nAMAT\n\nANET\n\nAPH\n\nATR\n\nATVI\n\nAX\n\nBLD\n\nCDNS\n\nCGNX\n\nCHD\n\nCHE\n\nCORT\n\nCPRT\n\nDLB\n\nDORM\n\nEPAM\n\nESNT\n\nETSY\n\nEW\n\nEXPD\n\nEXPO\n\nFAST\n\nFB\n\nFIX\n\nFOXF\n\nFTNT\n\nGGG\n\nGOOG\n\nGRMN\n\nHEI.A\n\nHELE\n\nIDA\n\nINS\n\nINTC\n\nINTU\n\nIRBT\n\nISRG\n\nCCSI\n\nZD\n\nKLAC\n\nLRCX\n\nLULU\n\nMASI\n\nMED\n\nMKSI\n\nMKTX\n\nMNST\n\nMORN\n\nMPWR\n\nMSFT\n\nNMIH\n\nNRC\n\nNVDA\n\nODFL\n\nOLED\n\nOLLI\n\nPAYC\n\nPAYX\n\nPRLB\n\nQLYS\n\nREGN\n\nRMR\n\nROAD\n\nSCCO\n\nSFBS\n\nSLP\n\nSTMP\n\nTDY\n\nTER\n\nTREX\n\nTROW\n\nTTD\n\nTYL\n\nUI\n\nV\n\nVEEV\n\nVRTX\n\nWAL\n\nYETI\n\n# Notes\n\nI  partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments.

        "selftext": "tl;dr -- Palantir has a one of a kind product but it doesn't solve my small pp issue. If you want a video that does a bad job of me describing this, here you go [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2k4ZBHydz4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2k4ZBHydz4)\n\nBackground on myself, currently I work as a backend engineer, doing data intensive projects. I exclusively work in AWS and use redshift, snowflake, AWS Glue, lambdas, etc. I'm also retarded, have no clue what I'm doing 100% of the time at work (bless the worker shortage) and have shit myself twice this year (not joking sadly). You have been warned.\n\nSo often, I see people saying \"I have no clue what Palantir does, the company is too much of black box, pp poopie.\" And I get it, the company sucks at explaining what foundry and gotham do, so despite me being too dumb to work there (applied and got rejected instantly), I'll try and explain it.\n\nLet's say we have a big industrial dairy company called \"Double D Milkshakes\". Double D Milkshakes has lots of large scale industrial farms. In addition, they have facilities that pasteurize the milk. After pasteurizing the milk and bottling it, they then have to transport it to various distributors across the country. \n\nThis means, that Double D Milkshakes, is sitting on a fucking trove of data. They have data on each individual cow (what feed the cow is being given, how much milk it is producing, the breed, who its mommy and sperm donor daddy is). They also have an immense amount of data on the living conditions the cows are in (such as what temperature the pastures are kept in). Double D Milkshakes also has data on the facilities that pasteurize the milk (lot of sensor data that goes into this). They also  have all kinds of supply chain information and customer information trapped away in horrific ERM and salesforce systems (kill me please).\n\nNow, every once in a while, some happy, unscarred monkey in management, goes \"Hey, if we can tap into all this data, we could make all kinds of optimizations, increase milk production, reduce cost and oo ee ee\".\n\nSo this monkey is granted funding, hires idiots like me who can't get jobs at real tech companies and tasks us with centralizing all this data into a data warehouse where the data scientist who are also lower tier can analyze the data and unlock all this value hidden in the data. Here is where it all falls apart. Moving all this data from the corporate farms into a data warehouse proves to be a difficult task. Setting up integration with sales force and all this other siloed data throughout the enterprise also proves to be a rather slow and difficult task. Not to mention, we don't really understand what any of the data means. Two years of your life go by and that gun under the bed starts talking to me every night, saying \"HEY duuddddeeee, don't you think I'd feel good against your template.\" At the same time, half the team has left, the data scientists claim the data is unclean and \"does not make sense\". Worse, that happy, innocent, monkey of a manager that got funding for the project left to go work for Kum &amp; Go.\n\nHere is where Palantir's Foundry comes in. They recognized this problem way back in the early 2000s and thought, \"geez, let's build an entire data platform so people don't have to do that.\" So, low and behold, they built the operating system for data. \n\nHere is what Foundry does:\n\n1. Foundry can be deployed at the \"edge\". This means at each individual farm and facility that Double D Milkshakes owns, they can deploy foundry to aggregate and collect the data at that location. In addition, workers at these locations can use Foundry to analyze the localized data themselves and make optimizations at the \"edge\". \"But how can these, hard working, illegal immigrants that don't know english do that? Don't you need to be a data scientist?\" Foundry does an excellent job visualizing data. Anyone with actual ambition (illegal immigrants and first gen americans) could figure it out.\n2. With Foundry deployed at the edge, we can also deploy it at corporate and use all these out of the box integrations to integrate with the various databases, scattered throughout the company. They make it super, duper easy. In addition, all the foundry instances deployed at the edge will send the data they are collecting and analyzing to the main foundry instance\n3. We can import business ontology to organize the data and actually make sense of it. All this really means, is data often sucks and makes no sense. Foundry allows us to describe what the data means in English and remembers for us. In addition, we can organize the data and foundry makes it easy to clean datasets and do a bunch of other data sciencey crap. The hard part is still figuring out what the data means at first but at least when half the development team leaves for better jobs, the data at that point has already been described and the knowledge will not be lost.\n4. AI and Machine Learning made simple. Go out and try running machine learning algorithms on large datasets. Takes fucking effort. Foundry makes it so fucking simple that HR can do it.\n5. Simulations. Probably the biggest fucking win in my book. Building a system to run simulations takes an immense amount of work. Foundry, makes it dead simple. So the workflow becomes this: We import all this data into foundry, describe and organize it. Foundry runs its big brain AI on the datasets and gives us insights, like \"hey dumbo, maybe if we change the feed from feed x to feed y we can increase milk production. I noticed this because one of the farms uses feed y and gets more milk out of those cow tittes.\" We can then simulate what would happen if we changed all of our feed from grain x to y AND see if the cost benefit (because y is more expensive) is worth it.\n6. A bunch of other shit like alerts, metrics, dashboards, applications can all be created in foundry. \n\nI've gone on to long. I do own Palantir at an average cost of $13.06/share. Bought some at IPO and more shortly after. Can't talk to why number goes down. That's for other monkeys to figure out but hopefully this sheeds light on what Palantir does.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/41kpok5wig181.png?width=2166&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4144240be6b37c258200096bea612b5bf8cc9636",

        "selftext": "Greetings, lads. Elon\u2019s TweetThreats aside, EV stocks are melting faces this month. Consider the following\u2026\n\n* Rivian just upsized its IPO. Share price range: $72-74. Projected $65B market cap.\n* Tesla +120% since May. SP $1,222. Now $1.22T MC.\n* Lucid +90% in two weeks. SP $41.80. Now $67.2B MC.\n\nLike you, SoFi didn\u2019t fill my $RIVN IPO order this week. Nor did I catch the $LCID $15 dip. And sadly, I wasn\u2019t able to get in on $TSLA at $40 two years ago.\n\nBut here\u2019s our chance for an early entry into one of the only EV \u201cpure plays\u201d in the market:\n\nPolestar \u2014 Volvo\u2019s EV spinoff brand \u2014 estimates 2021 revenue of $1.2B and 29,000 vehicles on the road.\n\nIt\u2019s now coming to market at a $20B valuation with $GGPI in Q1 2022.\n\nPolestar is the only global EV \u2018pure play,\u2019 other than Tesla. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ygvdc21kkey71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=672e1bcea882eaa1694dc3b3bf45dfa6edcd2eae\n\n**History**\n\nA little background\u2026\n\n* \u201cPolestar\u201d takes its name from the North Star, or Polaris \u2014 not the resourceful co-ed grinding the early-evening shift at the Spearmint Rhino. That\u2019s *Polstj\u00e4rnan* (literal translation, \u201cPole Star\u201d) if you\u2019re Swedish.  \n* Polestar was started in 1996 by Volvo\u2019s partner, Flash/Polestar Racing. \n* Volvo acquired Polestar in 2015. Volvo had itself been acquired in 2010 by Geely, a China-based auto brand that sells vehicles under the brands Geely Auto, Lotus, Lynk &amp; Co, Proton, and Volvo. Geely sold over 2.4 million cars in 2020. \n* Volvo and Geely describe the Polestar brand as being \u201cindependent since 2017.\u201d\n* Polestar is co-owned by Volvo and Geely, and headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden.\n* Polestar is now being taken public at a $20B valuation by the Gores-Guggenheim SPAC, GGPI.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Comps**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cjhasg7skey71.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a57236ff26ed8ae0b2910d0bbfee3b24ddf0605\n\n**GGPI is trading at a significant discount to TSLA and LCID, based on EV/sales multiples.** \n\n* Applying Tesla\u2019s 2022E multiple (17.2x) to Polestar implies a share price of $27.46. As GGPI is currently trading at $10.70, this yields an increase of 156.64%. \n* Applying Lucid\u2019s 2022E multiple (29.6x) to Polestar implies a share price of $47.27. As GGPI is currently trading at $10.70, this yields an increase of 342.78%. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ginl0ciukey71.jpg?width=1297&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=779eef17f69c5acd516425d3d8a0ae10494552a0\n\n**Peer Multiples -- EV Pure Plays**\n\n* GGPI is essentially valued at the same forward multiples as XPEV and NIO.\n* Bear in mind, XPEV and NIO are higher-risk companies that deserve valuation discounts because:\n\n1. The CCP can theoretically shut them down at any moment without warning (see: $DIDI). \n2. The stocks are actually ADRs and based in the Cayman Islands, so you don't even own the actual companies.\n\n* By comparison, GGPI is headquartered in Sweden and already US-listed on the Nasdaq.\n* Polestar is already an established OEM, leveraging the strategic relationship with Volvo in manufacturing, design and marketing. Hence, the investment opportunity is lower risk since Polestar is not a start-up.\n* As with most present-day multinationals, there is some China-related production risk. However, Polestar is addressing the issue by opening US factories going forward. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8kt1miyxkey71.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e771bc7dd377abf7233926b3302c0bc76d57b85\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dv6nu4o0ley71.jpg?width=554&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed57210e7fd7d962b18952e56d361074f702e832\n\n**Gores SPACs**\n\nFor those new to SPACland, Gores\u2019 track record speaks for itself\u2026\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nuvx0647ley71.jpg?width=1972&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cb66ac0a639c150a9f8845d6eb764a0438fd01d\n\n**The EV Graveyard**\n\nThe EV SPAC battlefield is littered with bodies (RIDE, WKHS, NKLA). \n\nBut Polestar? \n\nThey've been executing all year and have already delivered 29,000 cars.

        "selftext": "First, credit to u/Forestur for the tipoff here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qs0l9c/goev\\_canoo\\_earnings\\_report\\_speculation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qs0l9c/goev_canoo_earnings_report_speculation/).  Without his initial work, this opportunity might have slipped right by.\n\n**Who is Canoo / GOEV?**\n\n[Canoo](https://www.canoo.com/) is an electric vehicle company designed around a subscription or lease model.  This is because their core technology is an EV drivetrain with interchangeable bodies.  [https://www.canoo.com/platform](https://www.canoo.com/platform)  This kind of business model is great for fleet vehicles and long term maintenance.  Businesses can order and return cars as needed, and canoo can refurbish or swap the body section to make the car ready for the next customer.  Critical motor or battery problem under warranty?  Swap the body to a new platform and roll back out with minimal downtime.  I have been bullish on Canoo since day 1 and FOMO\u2019d in hard as soon as I heard about the SPAC deal.  It\u2019s got a fucking window by your feet [so everyone can see your wife\u2019s hot legs while she\u2019s out with her boyfriend.](https://youtu.be/xnQXHMj3byc)\n\nUnlike the cars you can buy today which need to be stripped for parts, the Canoo business model is going to completely change the way people think about a new or used car.  Did you know modern cars get totaled by hail?  What a piece of shit.  If you have a canoo your MPP is untouched and you just need your cabin swapped out.  If their business needs to move between providing pickups, passenger vans, delivery vans, and luxury sedans, [Canoo can do all of this easily.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqCaDBv4K-g) \n\nLook at how much effort it takes Ford or Tesla to create a new vehicle type, Canoo is going to turn this on its head.  This is the same kind of tech Rivian has, and Rivian has 50x the valuation.  [Rivian has only delivered maybe 75 trucks,](https://insideevs.com/news/542908/rivian-production-numbers-first-month/) Canoo will deliver 1500 cars next year.\n\nSpeaking of car delivery, Canoo is working with [VDL,](https://www.vdlgroep.com/en/vdl-companies/car-assembly) who makes cars for people like BMW, to do their early phase manufacturing; and they just got Oklahoma to give them $300M in incentives to build out a factory. After the 1500 vehicles next year Canoo is slated for 20,000-25,000 vehicles in 2023, while building out the OK factory.  These guys are on track to be a major domestic player, but based on previous calls they\u2019re very bullish on international markets since other countries are very serious about forcing a transition to EVs.  The reason I\u2019m heavily invested in EV tech is because the requirement to transition is global, not just exclusive to rich people in California.\n\nThey\u2019re also smart and flexible.  You know how new vehicle sales are lagging because semiconductors are hard to source?\n\n&gt;\\[We have\\] consolidated our Electrical Architecture into a narrow set of controllers using fewer chips. Fewer parts overall mean we believe we are less exposed to global supply chain disruptions.\n\nYou should want to get in on this stock as an incredibly cheap play on great EV tech, just buy some shares and thank me later.  \n\n**What is going on with this company\u2019s stock?**\n\nAs we know, the market is completely irrational, especially when it comes to EVs.  GOEV is not delivering cars until basically a year from now, so their value is still *highly* speculative, as a result, the value has been driven *more by shorts and hedgies* than by catalysts.\n\n**The history of shorts**  \nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest\n\nAs soon as the DA was announced, people started shorting the stock. Fuck shorts, they hate the little guy.  From reading the nasdaq data and running my own crayon-level estimates, the shorts had the following positions open at the beginning of the year:\n\n* 5.9M @ $16.25\n* 2M @ $18\n* 1.1M @ $11.25\n* 1M @ $10.25\n\nSince the beginning of the year the shorts have tripled down, with the following notable buying periods:\n\n* 8M @ $12.40\n* 12M @ $9\n* 4.7M @ $10.4\n* 1.7M @ $7.2\n\nGiven the available data on the number of closed positions, I\u2019ve estimated the open shorts at something like\n\n* 6.2M @ $12.40\n* 1.1M @ $11.25\n* 5.8M @ $10.25\n* 12M @ $9\n* 0.9M @ $8\n* 3M @ $7.25\n\n**GOEV - Shorts run this town**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kjqldfae4sz71.jpg?width=666&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65a5383eced97bc0a387d5f73a762f2cd02d5f0a\n\nLet\u2019s look at the data we have on shorts for the last year and see how their behavior has affected the stock price.  I know we try not to say that correlation is causation, but when shorts move at least 800,000 shares, the share price responds, often by spiking up or down by $1.50-3, with the largest correlated move over $6, when shorts sold 8 million shares and the price tanked.\n\nFrom March 15 thru June 30, shorts behavior is driving the share price: big sales drive the price down, and when a significant number of positions are closed the share price rebounds.  From July 30 thru Oct 29, any time shorts move 800k+ we see a direct correlation, while periods of limited short behavior continue a very slow trend down (lack of positive catalysts for the company, it makes sense).\n\nLet\u2019s go over that key information again: increased volume of 800,000 - 8,000,000 shares through hedgie has regularly driven the share price with a correlated impact of $1.5-$6.6.  This stock price is *very sensitive to volume*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m0bbjt2i2sz71.png?width=662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58407637a5eca04aaccd7dd5a2896ec19ced5031\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uw4haftm2sz71.png?width=545&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fdc120875acfb6ef3469905aa290ecf86b0f938\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z1myllpo2sz71.png?width=459&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2c6dfb7d29af4f5b4e46b3a8b2e250a7dca672c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fw4mno8r2sz71.png?width=516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cafd33aef995a93e0be5ce6744aacaf32617ef31\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/moldq0bs2sz71.png?width=904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b1e5e4d9f13158d086087d96502647d9b637a37\n\n**What\u2019s going on this week?**\n\nTwo things are happening.  **First,** there will be an earnings report TONIGHT (Monday), and this could introduce a catalyst that drives the share price up or down.  Tony Tequila is gonna bring the good news and put us on the launchpad.  From the horse\u2019s mouth: \u201cwe will teach people not to short our stock.\u201d  **Second,** a lot of options are expiring this week, with between 900,000 and 6.3M shares expiring ITM between calls and puts.  Our win here involves the closing contracts creating pressure to buy shares, which drives the price up, putting more contracts ITM, and creating a feedback loop.  There are currently *over one million* shares due with ITM contracts, this is already a statistically significant volume.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/resfe8xz3sz71.png?width=460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8789ee8546a34dbcdeb0004f51a2140da348fb04\n\n**What\u2019s going on with the shorts?**\n\nShorts are uncertain.  They put out over 2 million shares when the price was under $8, but also closed 4.6 million shorts in the same time frame.  When shorts closed their positions the stock *rocketed* up, it seems like they can\u2019t push it much harder, or aren\u2019t hungry to.  Most of the shares are shorted between $9 and $13 which is making the shorts ITM and feeling bullish, but it seems like the stock has strong support for rebounds whenever the shorts let up on pressure.  We want the stock over $13, putting the hedgies underwater on their bets and turning the heat up.  If they panic and close, the stock pops.  We are still near ATH shorted amounts, but the stock has been running up.\n\n**Are there other factors?**\n\nInsiders hold over 50% of the company, and they are *not fucking selling*, which is an extremely positive sign.  ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/insider-activity))\n\n**OK, OK, but what is the fucking play?**\n\n**Shares and calls.**  No warrants.  Shares because we need to eat up the bid/ask and calls because I want a fucking lambo and don\u2019t have hedgie money to buy $50M in shares and do this on my own.  If we can get this to $10 it jumps, to $12.50 and it explodes.  Remember that every 800k shares is significant: At $9, 1.2M shares are due; at $10 it\u2019s 3M, then there\u2019s a gap to $12.50 4.25M, and at $15 it\u2019s 5.1M shares.  The shorts have been working super hard to keep this under $9/share.  **If we get over $9 keep buying** and it flips their leverage.  We have already climbed from $6.99 to $9 this month, we can push it back to $9 and then load up with \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83d\udc8e.  Once we moon buy every dip to build support.\n\nBest case scenario, it\u2019s already inevitable and we\u2019re at $25 by Friday.  Worse case scenario we need to drive 400k+ shares to give this bad boy a 50c boost.  That\u2019s 4000 apes in for 100 shares each.  Worst case scenario the hedgies short another $100-200M in shares and we have to fucking buy through it but they don\u2019t have the balls because this company is about to moon.  You don\u2019t short Tony Tequila.\n\nWe will push all the shorts underwater.  Let\u2019s look at the estimates again:\n\nRight now, about 4M shorts are underwater with shares shorted under $8.50.  If we get this to $10, that number goes to 16M shorts underwater.  At $11 it\u2019s over 20M shorts, and above $12.50 over 25 million shorted shares will be upside down.  This is not an infinite squeeze, but it\u2019s got a lot of potential to run.  \n\n**Tl;dr -** Shorts want the bangbus to fail, we want the bangbus to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.  Buy GOEV shares, ITM calls, ATM calls.

Thanks in part to nepotism and lack of moral fiber, he had kept this job until an administration change. When things began to get rough for him, and the contracts dried up, he saw the opportunity that was WallStreetBets, and took it. \n\nThis individual went on to write a book about us, a book that contains information he wasn't here to witness. Yet, this did not dissuade him from speaking (and continuing to speak to this day) as an expert during many interviews with multiple media outlets. He was after all the founder of WallStreetBets, why shouldn't he have a say in the democratization of finance? \n\nThe truth is, those of us here to remember what happened after the book came out, the ads on the sidebar, the coup that took place, the mass bannings by this man's business partner, and the attempt to sell us an options training and video courses for $1,497 annually, understand who he is. He is a man who will take advantage of those who are looking to get ahead. He is a man who has, and will, take advantage of us. He is a man who partnered with other individuals who have done wrong for a very, very long time. \n\nToday I'm letting everyone know that another domino has fallen. The men who I've repeatedly warned you about, the men the founder of WSB partnered with, and I discuss in [my videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caoF3jH7yG4&amp;list=PLFn5m64rEzQg5_9Acd9tz0kLGhQ5gsPPn&amp;index=1), are now being held accountable by the SEC. \n\n[https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2021/33-10994.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2021/33-10994.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery)\n\nWho are those guys? See \"WallStreetBets Exposed Part 1\" and \"WallStreetBets Exposed Part 3\" for specifics and background that I won't cover here. \n\n**In total, they will pay over $1,250,000 collectively for violating multiple laws.** And I'm not even talking about the civil suits that are also in progress. \n\nAs a user on WSB once said after the fall of the founder in 2020, \"RIP in shit, fuckboy.\"",

        "selftext": "Hey all, hope you\u2019re doing well! Today, I\u2019m going to be delivering a short writeup on a fun little market phenomenon known as the Gamma Squeeze. I\u2019ll be breaking it down into three sections to try making it as digestible as possible allowing everyone to easily follow along. To those looking for a more in-depth explanation with visual examples, feel free to check out the video I made on the topic **[here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYvMZ9JHx4c)** Let's get into it!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Overview of the Gamma Squeeze\nIn short, a gamma squeeze is the phenomenon that occurs when a stock has extremely high open interest on its options chain, and the price of the underlying rises suddenly. This sudden rise in price causes the delta on the open options contracts to rapidly increase, forcing market makers to buy extra shares to keep their open positions delta neutral. If enough contracts are open, when the market makers buy extra stock to stay delta neutral, they will cause the price of the underlying to increase, thereby causing the delta on the contracts to increase AGAIN, thereby forcing themselves to buy more shares to remain delta neutral. Rinse and repeat. Let\u2019s break it all down!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#What Exactly Happens When You Buy a Call Option?\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re extremely bullish on stock $ABC. You decide to buy an out of the money call option on $ABC instead of the underlying shares for extra leverage. You are now ***delta positive***, meaning you profit if $ABC rises in value. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOn the flipside of the trade, you\u2019ve got the market maker who sold you the option, who is now ***delta negative***. He will now lose money if $ABC rises in value. **The market maker does not want this.** His job is to provide liquidity to the markets, and he makes his profits through the bid-ask spread. Him being delta negative or delta positive can cause him to incur serious losses, therefore he makes a large effort to remain delta neutral. The market maker can become delta neutral by buying shares of $ABC equal to the **delta** on the contract he just sold.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf the delta on the contract is 0.15, he will hedge the call he sold by buying 15 shares of $ABC. If it\u2019s 0.43, he will buy 43 shares, etc. This relationship is dynamic, meaning that **the market maker will buy or sell shares to match the delta on the contracts as it changes as a result of the price of the underlying changing.** If the price of $ABC rises, the delta on the call options will also increase, causing the market maker to buy more shares in order to keep his position hedged. If the price of $ABC falls, the delta will decrease, and the market maker will sell some of his shares as he no longer needs them to stay properly hedged.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe key takeaway from this section is that a market maker will almost always be on the flipside of your trade, and that market makers will ***always*** aim to be delta neutral by hedging their positions (most often with shares) so they can always make profits, regardless of a stock's movement. The market makers job is to provide liquidity to the markets, and they make all of their money through the bid-ask spreads.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Effect of Call Buying on the Markets\n\nNormally, this unique relationship between call-buyer and market maker rarely has an effect on the price of the underlying since people generally don\u2019t buy large volumes of out of the money options contracts. Even if volume is high, **the delta on out of the money options contracts is low, meaning that market makers aren't forced to buy many shares to remain delta neutral.** This is further mediated by the fact that the change in delta relative to the price of the underlying, measured by gamma, will also be extremely low, meaning that even if the underlying does move up in price, delta won\u2019t increase much, meaning that the market maker won\u2019t have to buy many more extra shares to remain hedged. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo illustrate my point, let\u2019s say that my buddy Jim is extremely bullish on $ABC and wishes to capitalize on his thesis by buying out of the money options. **If Jim slams 100 OTM contracts on $ABC with a delta of 0.15, he\u2019ll force a market maker to purchase 1500 shares of $ABC.** Initially, that may seem like a lot, but you need to consider that most tickers have *millions to billions* of shares out on the open market, so those 1500 shares are just a drop in the bucket. Even if Jim had a good read, and the OTM call options end up being ITM by expiration giving them a delta of 1.00, they will still only control 10,000 shares of the underlying, likely not moving the price much, if at all.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe key takeaway from this section is that volume, delta, and gamma all work together to keep things from getting out of hand. If either one of these variables is low, it suppresses the other two and keeps things in check. So what gives? How is it even possible for a Gamma Squeeze to occur?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Criteria Necessary for a Gamma Squeeze\n\nIn order for a gamma squeeze to occur, you need lots of gamma, of course! But how is this accomplished? As dumb as it sounds, all you *technically* need is volume. A lot of it. A catalyst also helps too, no matter how small. Let\u2019s revisit our example from above.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet\u2019s say that alongside Jim, we had 1000 other people buying 100 of the exact same 0.15 delta OTM contract. We\u2019ve now forced a market maker to buy 1,500,000 shares of $ABC just to remain delta neutral. This ***definitely*** moved the price of the underlying, even if it was just a little. Depending on the magnitude of the move, this could\u2019ve even caused the delta of these contracts to go up, meaning that the market maker would need to buy even more shares on top of the 1.5 million he\u2019s already picked up just to stay hedged.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet\u2019s say that a small catalyst hits, and the underlying organically jumps in price. The delta on the $ABC options would also jump up, meaning the market maker will be forced to buy even more shares. For example, if the delta on the contracts goes up to 0.35, the market maker will have to buy an additional 2,000,000 shares just to remain hedged, bringing up his entire position to 3,500,000 shares of $ABC.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe purchase of these 2,000,000 additional shares would undoubtedly affect the price of the underlying at this point, meaning that after the market maker buys his shares to hedge, the delta on the contracts he just hedged would\u2019ve gone up. He then has to buy even more shares to hedge, so he does, causing the delta to go up again, causing him to have to buy more shares to hedge, etc, until we ultimately reach a point of equilibrium and end up with a highly inflated stock price.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***The situation above can also occur even with the absence of a catalyst, given that there is enough degeneracy.***\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet\u2019s recycle the same situation with Jim and his 1000 buddies. They buy 100 0.15 delta OTM contracts each and force a market maker to buy 1,500,000 contracts, causing a small bump in the underlying price. Other people then see the underlying starting to rise, and then they decide to buy some OTM options as well. We\u2019ve now got 500 extra people slamming 100 of those options, forcing the market maker to buy an additional 750,000 shares. This causes the underlying to rise, as well as the delta on everyone's contracts to go up to 0.2, meaning the market maker buys some extra shares to remain delta neutral. The market maker is now in possession of 3,000,000 shares. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe price is starting to inflate, so naturally people slam some more OTM options. Another 500 people join the party, forcing the market maker to buy even more shares to stay hedged, driving both price and delta even higher. **Like a dog chasing his tail, the market maker is forced to buy shares to match the delta on his contracts, only for the delta to increase as a result of him buying shares,** ultimately reaching a point of equilibrium alongside an inflated stock price.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThese situations are purely hypothetical, and are aimed to illustrate that although ***no two gamma squeezes are the same***, they all ultimately occur due to a rapid change in delta as a byproduct of high volume. Once the change in delta becomes high enough, a situation similar to the ones above is inevitable. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe key takeaway from this convoluted section is that high volumes of call buying causes an underlyings price to increase alongside delta, and the rate at which delta increases is amplified the closer we get to being ITM on our OTM contracts. These moves start slow, but ramp extremely quickly causing explosive moves to the upside as the change in delta rapidly increases. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Conclusion\n\nAlthough gamma squeezes are complex beasts, I hope I managed to shed some light on some of the underlying mechanics at play to give you all a deeper understanding of what\u2019s going on!

(Hey, I've seen certain governments use that strategy to rival countries before)  \n\n\nSo right now you have to ask yourself, does this company deserve to be priced at 60 bucks a share? 48 billion market cap? Simply because of sexual misconduct in the workplace? Woke much? This happens at every workplace...Happened at Tesla recently, but got swept under the rug? WHY IS THERE SO MUCH HATE FOR BLIZZARD AND KOTICK??? it seems irrational to me. I bought the dip. When the world is telling you to sell, sometimes you just have to do the opposite.",

        "selftext": "There was a small amount of hype for this company last month, but I wanted to remind you in case you got distracted and forgot that this play is a thing, and they have earnings on the 15th. Isn't that exciting?\n\n[It has a rocket on its logo. Bullish](https://preview.redd.it/xwvfwuo4iny71.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7919da585ec69338f00f377f90a18db56919d8d)\n\nIll list some of my reasons for liking this rocket company.\n\n1. They have received the contract for NASA's first Artemis launch, as NASA begins building the necessary infrastructure for further Lunar missions. They will be putting a single cube sat into a highly technical, unique, lunar orbit launching in March of 2022. This is additionally important because it would be the first time their trademark Electron and accompanying Photon satellite bus would carry a payload to Lunar orbit. That's huge! But why? A lunar orbit has been done plenty of times before (*~~or has it?~~*), well, what if I told you the Electron rocket is one of the most cost affordable rockets available on the market at the moment. The successful launch of a NASA satellite into lunar orbit via an Electron and Photon configuration would open up lunar satellite launches to many different countries, organization's and even private citizens. Forget a lambo, I want my own moon satellite. \n2. The launch window for their next mission, *Love At First Insight,* opens on Thursday night, US time. This will be the first launch of a series of three for the same customer. With a proven track record of successful launches, I spy with my little eye no reason to believe this launch will be any different, except that it will be their first launch since IPO. Additionally, it will be their first live launch including ground experimentation with helicopter recovery.\n3. You read that right. Helicopter recovery. Let me clarify, that while they will not be recovering this booster by helicopter, they will be making a dry run at it, to investigate its possibility further, as they already have with static aerial drops. [Rocket Lab | Mid-Air Recovery Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3CWGDhkmbs) As they continue to develop this system, we could see potential that a booster could be recovered by helicopter, landed back on the launch pad to refuel and be inspected, have a new payload added and be launched again. Makes a lot more sense when you consider that Rocket Labs main launch site, the Mahia Launch Complex in New Zealand has potential for a very rapid launch cadence, and so does their Electron Rocket. \n4. Lets look at the bigger picture of what this company is. They're filling a niche market, providing solutions for launches that otherwise would not be economically feasible. They are *not* looking to be SpaceX's competition, although they could someday, if they wanted to, but at the moment, its simply not in their interest. Their Electron rockets are small, agile, and resusable, and can be tailored to almost any low earth orbit.\n5. They are currently in development of a larger rocket, Rocket Lab Neutron, which is expected to be operational by 2024 and will launch from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in New Zealand.\n6. I want to mention again that this upcoming launch will be their first launch since IPO, considering that a month after IPO the stock price reached a ATH of $21.34 on Sep 9th, I see it having significant potential to bounce back to these numbers as they keep pushing out more and more news. \n\nFor these reasons, I now consider RKLB to be the best aerospace play of the year, and consider a price target of $25 feasible. Ill be buying more and more while it is still on sale.",

        "selftext": "**BULL CASES**\n\n/1. INTC is the only real US chip manufacturer that can reasonably compete with Korean Samsung and Taiwanese TSMC (-100 credit score for acknowledging Taiwan). It is getting lots of literal boat load of cash(probs something like $50B equivalent) from the government that is positive for the shareholders, while maintaining the buybacks and dividends.\nYes, TSMC and others are also hedging and gonna start making some chips in USA but realistically the gubment will give most of the cash to INTC.\n\n/2. US gubment is in a cold war with China, this means it's also a technological warfare. This means supercomputers, missile, Starlink chips(private company) etc and Intel is likely going to be one of the prime suppliers of this boom in tech investment.\n\n/3. TSMC and Samsung are pretty much bottlenecked. Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Mediatech, Broadcom, various carmakers, electronics manufacturers etc and not to mention Intel themselves are a big buyer. Specifically, Intel and Apple has bought out all capacity of TSMC 3nm(equivalent to Intel's 5 nm probs, I forgot). This means there is an enormous demand that is not being fulfilled and Intel launching their foundry services and already signing deals with Qualcomm, Amazon is a big deal.\n\nFor reference, TSMC's market cap is bigger than 3 Intel (yes, that's a unit I invented). In 2024-2025, you might even see Apple, NVIDIA and the likes fabricating their chips from Intel just to give a big F U to TSMC (who is currently slightly overcharging if the rumours are to be believed).\n\n/4. Intel is launching a GPU. The GPU market is also in a huge bottleneck due to higher demand from gamers and corn miners. Everyone expects that they are likely to sell their GPUs very easily. Think about this for a sec. Intel is just about to become one of the players in this huge GPU market.\nWhich would also make way for their server GPUs and AIs and the likes.\n\n/5. Think 10-15 years from now. Your fridge, doorbell, light, heating system and every ducking thing will have some chips and Intel is likely to remain a dominant player in this market. I think this will be bigger than the current entire semi market as it is. IOT is just getting started.\n\n/6. Intel is one of the forerunner player in AI techs like autonomous vehicles through their various investments(Mobil eye for one) and will likely remain so. I don't know how big this will be in 10 years, but it's likely that Intel will be one of the bigger players in the market like Google (through Waymo), Tesla and NVIDIA.\n\n/7. Intel also recently launched their big little architecture, where it has already became competitively better than AMD especially in gaming with low power consumption and huge power. Not to mention being very power efficient most of the time for using its efficiency cores most of the time. Not that it matters that much, seeing the gamer Steam reports, very few people actually play on the latest of the latest gen. But, that's also something that's worth noting at least. \n\nHowever, the vast majority of pc sales is in just your average boomer laptops and desktops. And they have a good lead there.\n\n*Tips for those wanting to build a high end new pc. Wait for Intel's lineup to be available broadly, high end pc gamers will dump their last gen AMD chips for the Intel one in the second hand market, causing a flooding of cheap AMD CPUs, buy one of them. Source: Did this once.*\n\n/8. One worrying factor is in the server market. Everyone seems to be launching their own server chips and AMD is very competitive and eating away market share. But Intel's management seems to be guiding us towards the right path. If their predictions prove to be right, they are on the right track.\n\n/9. Intel announced that they will launch Angstrom scale CPUs in the future, that's good I guess. They are also working in RISC-V and other CPU architectures.\n\n/10. Pat has an approval rating of 96% in Glassdoor and the employees would recommend others to work in Intel 89% of the time. This is a huge ass jump for both scores from the Bob Swan era. Go to Wayback Machine, you will see. This means a noticeable change has taken place within this huge organisation in such a short time.\n\n/11. Intel stock always seem to have price support at around $50. And it's near that range right now.\n\n/12. Most analysts are bullish on the stock. Comparatively cheap stock in this clown market. Wanna buy a $5.48B gravity powered truck company anyone?\n\n/13. Intel actually has one of the highest talented employee pull who can be expected to deliver. Contrary to popular belief.\n\n**Bear Cases**\n\n/1. This is a boomer stock according to reddit's circejerk. So, it's difficult to convince people that it is actually expected to grow around 11% CAGR just by the current demand circumstances alone by management's conservative estimates for the next few years. This is mega bearish. If the market doesn't care about a stock, no matter what the management do, the stock will not perform.\n\n/2. Intel has repeatedly failed to prove that their foundry division's predictions are reliable. If they went fabless like AMD, it would have probably rocketed already. But a big part of the cheapness of the stock comes from the unreliability of their foundry division. Yes, the management has finally started getting serious about their foundry, but one cannot ignore their past failures.\n\n/3. Government contracts and the likes are not completely free money like some of you believe, delays in delivery and contract fulfillment could make what is essentially a free money glitch to a costly mistake and a billion dollar loss with a brink of an eye. The terms are generally very strict, so Intel has to deliver.\n\n/4. Investments are going to be a lot and semiconductor industry being cyclical means, if Intel fails to deliver, its market share will be eaten away and lose billions in potential profit.\n\n/5. Stock seems to be largely rangebound like Microsoft was for 15 years.\n\n[positions or ban. bought 100 shares for now. will be selling some puts to enter into more. And then around the next earnings, will buy some calls](https://imgur.com/a/xxYyDIE)",

Muse noted that though shares of memory chip makers such as Micron have lagged behind the [PHLX Semiconductor index since early June](https://www.barrons.com/quote/index/us/xnas/sox?mod=article_inline), he believes tides are shifting.\n\n*\u201cWe believe negative sentiment was due to investor concerns over the sustainability of PC, handsets, and cloud demand, which was also compounded by DRAM spot pricing that began to flatten out in May/June 2021,\u201d wrote Muse.*\n\nMuse noted that WSt expectations for Micron\u2019s Feb/May quarter earnings have been cut by 33%/31% respectively, since August. While there could be further downside, weakness is now priced in. He believes either Feb or May quarter will be a bottom for Micron\u2019s earnings. Micron shares tend to outperform one or two quarters before a bottom in earnings, hence he believes the stock could begin a run soon.\n\n*\u201cAnd once they do\u2014we think the stock action could be fast,\u201d Muse wrote. \u201cWe also note most investors expected the memory trade to begin to work in 1Q22 based on our investor survey last month and would not be surprised to start seeing investors look to get positioned in the name ahead of January 1st, 2022.\u201d*\n*Other reasons for the climb:*\n* Citi analyst Christopher Danely said in a research note that recent channel checks show there has been increased demand for DRAM memory among PC makers, and that a pricing correction in the DRAM market is \u201cdrawing to a close\u201d.\n* Danely also said the outlook for enterprise server sales in Q1 22 is better than expected. The server market is improving \u201cdue to recent increases in spending from cloud companies such as Meta and Google\u201d. Danely maintained his buy rating and a $120/share price target.\n* Earlier this week hedge fund Appaloosa Management said it recently sold off almost 3 million shares of MU, to leave the fund with 2.75 million shares.\n**Higher future DRAM demand and how this affects Micron**\n\nMicron is a market leader in DRAM and NAND memory, with a market share of 20%/11% respectively. In 2021, DRAM revenues accounted for 72% of MU\u2019s total revenues, and grew by 38% YoY.  [The company is improving its 1-alpha DRAM](https://www.micron.com/1alpha-dram-technology) to compete with Samsung/SK Hynix.\nThe DRAM market is expected to grow over the long term, due to rising DRAM use in smartphones, PC\u2019s, consumer electronics, automotive and industrials. \n\n*Smartphones:* \n[Since 2016 the average DRAM capacity has risen from 2.4GB to 4.75GB (average of iOS and Android).](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/smartphones-dram-trends-2019-2020/) Micron has stated that 5G phones feature 50% more DRAM than 4G phones. It also expects that 5G and AI will drive new applications such as optimised video capture and editing, which will further fuel DRAM requirements. Phones are very much powerful PC\u2019s living in our pockets now, and as software advances we can expect that DRAM requirements will increase. For example, think about how old iPhones struggle to run new versions of iOS, partially due to insufficient DRAM in older models. \n\n[Check this graph!](https://imgur.com/d9oI7WW)\n\n*Data Center:*\nDRAM is integral in servers, notably in data centre applications, it is rapidly evolving to support growing workloads for AI, big data and machine learning. Micron is working on DDR5 to support data center transitions to DDR5 platforms this year.\nData creation is projected to grow at a rate of around 23% in the next 5 years. This would require larger cloud infrastructure in order to handle this. Data centres are generally backed up by an SSD storage array, Micron remains committed to this through it\u2019s NVMe SSD portfolio, and is introducing PCIe 4.0 data centre SSDs. As demand for cloud storage rises, Micron could see increased demand for these products. \n\n*PC/Gaming:*\nFaster RAM leads to faster processing speeds. Intensive use of PCs such as gaming, video editing and streaming require better and more efficient RAM.\nFrom Statista, the chart below shows increasing PC DRAM memory density, with the share of memory &gt;[4GB increasing to 82% in 2020](https://imgur.com/w9w0xPq) \n(https://www.statista.com/statistics/781438/worldwide-computer-dram-shipment-market-share-by-density/)\n\n*Automotive DRAM:*\nAutomotive DRAM only accounts for 1.8% of the DRAM market currently. However, advances in automotive tech such as autonomous driving and vehicle connectivity will drive an increase in this. The Tesla Model 3 has 14GB of DRAM, and next-generation models will use GDDR5 and are expected to have a minimum of 20GB. Although, the average vehicle is estimated to have only 4GB of DRAM in 2021. I expect newer/next-gen vehicles will continue to use even more computing power/DRAM, therefore increasing the market share of Automotive DRAM. Note that Micron are specialists in GDDR5 and 6 memory. Auto NAND accounts for 7% of the NAND market, [it is also expected to see rapid growth due to the rise of ADAS](https://www.eetasia.com/another-nand-flash-for-automotive-ota-ai-and-more/) and clusters of vehicle instruments added to infotainment (requiring greater storage capabilities).\n\n*Industrials &amp; Consumer Electronics:*\nDRAM is used in systems/equipment in manufacturing processes. Industrial type DRAM is more focused on providing a stable solution for reliability. Automation and IoT (Internet of Things) is likely to increase demand for memory/increased memory. In consumer electronics, DRAM is used in tablets, wearables, games consoles, etc. This is the least significant growth factor but still important to note. \nAnother important note is that the PS5 and Xbox use Micron GDDR6 RAM. Samsung and Micron both started producing GDDR6 RAM 3 years ago, while SK Hynix is still ramping up production. The PS5 actually uses Micron RAM (16GB GDDR6 SDRAM), while 512MB of SK Hynix DDR4 RAM is used for background tasks. THe Xbox Series X also uses 16GB of Micron GDDR6 SGRAM. \n\n**My Nvidia thesis:**\n\n**I worked as a qualified IT Hardware, Networking and Software Engineer for 5 or 6 years, and am now an Engineering student at college. I\u2019m a computer geek, especially for hardware. So I\u2019m going to enjoy writing this part. I hope my knowledge lends to it.**\n\n\nAlthough you won\u2019t find much correlation in the [charts](https://imgur.com/o3EaSAV), apart from the recent semi-boom. Nvidia and Micron are very strongly linked. \n\n\n*Increasing penetration of GPU\u2019s in data centres*\n\n\nRecently, data centres have developed into the fields of AI and Machine Learning for functions where a solution is required via rapid iterations. This works well with GPU\u2019s. GPU\u2019s lend themselves perfectly towards [Machine Learning (ML-OLD) functions in data centres](https://www.eetimes.com/ai-chip-menu-expands-for-data-centers/).\n\nNow remember that GPU\u2019s are highly memory intensive. \nThis is corroborated from the data specs of Nvidia\u2019s newest chip, the A100 GPU just released, [designed for AI in data centers](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258419/nvidia-ampere-gpu-ai-data-centers-specs-a100-dgx-supercomputer).\n[You can also read more here.](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ampere-architecture/)\n\n\u201cThe first GPU to use Ampere will be Nvidia\u2019s new (as of 2020) A100, built for scientific computing, cloud graphics, and data analytics. Nvidia new A100 GPU will also include 19.5 teraflops of performance, 6,912 CUDA cores, *40GB of memory*, and *1.6TB/s of memory bandwidth.\u201d* *There\u2019s also a version using 80GB!*\n\n\u201c*Smarter and Faster Memory*\nA100 brings massive amounts of compute to data centers. To keep those compute engines fully utilized, it has a class-leading 2 terabytes per second (TB/sec) of memory bandwidth, more than double the previous generation. In addition, A100 has significantly more on-chip memory, including a 40 megabyte (MB) level 2 cache\u20147X larger than the previous generation\u2014to maximize compute performance.*\u201d\n\nI cannot find any sources (after half an hour of searching) that specify the exact manufacturer of the A100\u2019s memory. However based on my experience, Nvidia consumer GPU\u2019s use either Micron, Samsung or SK Hynix memory. Micron *does* manufacture the [HBM2E memory used in the A100](https://www.micron.com/products/ultra-bandwidth-solutions/hbm2e#:~:text=HBM2E%20%7C%20Micron%20Technologies%2C%20Inc), hence I suspect Micron is one of their memory vendors for their data centre GPU\u2019s. \n\nI found that the Nvidia DGXA100 system (the world\u2019s first AI system built on the A100 Tensor Core GPU, using 8 A100 GPU\u2019s with up to 640GB of GPU memory), actually happens to use [Micron NVME drives](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/pdf/dgxa100-service-manual.pdf).

Micron. \n*\u201cMicron has created the world\u2019s fastest discrete graphics memory solution, GDDR6X. GDDR6X was launched with NVIDIA on the GeForce\u00ae RTX\u2122 3090 and GeForce\u00ae RTX\u2122 3080 GPUs (including Ti) to take graphics beyond gaming into true AI. Watch to learn how Micron was able to achieve incredible speeds up to 1 TB/s system memory bandwidth.\u201c*\n\n[Read more here.](https://www.micron.com/products/ultra-bandwidth-solutions/gddr6x)\n\n[Comparison between GDDR5X, GDDR6 and GDDR6X](https://imgur.com/fl8FY68)\n\nThis means Nvidia is dependant on Micron to deliver/manufacture their higher end GPU\u2019s (as Micron are the only manufacturer of GDDR6X memory). Furthermore, Micron GDDR6 memory is commonly found in RTX3050, 3060, 3070 (including Ti) GPU\u2019s. They are not the only manufacturer for this, but are frequently used, for example my RTX 3060 laptop has Micron memory, and my RTX 2070 Super has Micron memory. I use them for crapto mining, and the memory overclocks well. \n\n**Overall I would conclude as long as Nvidia remains strong/bullish, you can be bullish on Micron as Nvidia are dependent on them for their products, particularly in the high-end.**\n\n\n**The AMD link**\n\nAlthough not as dependent on Micron as Nvidia. AMD [are using Micron GDDR6 memory in their RX6000 series graphics cards:](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-delivers-high-performance-gddr6-memory-amd-radeon-rx-6000)\n\n\u201cMicron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU), today (November 1st) announced that its high-performance 16Gb/16Gbps GDDR6 memory solution is now available with AMD Radeon\u2122 RX 6000 Series graphics cards built on the AMD RDNA\u2122 2 gaming architecture. Using Micron\u2019s advanced 1z process technology, this latest version of GDDR6 enables up to 512GB/s system performance for demanding applications like gaming and graphics. Today\u2019s announcement continues Micron\u2019s rich history of innovation and collaboration with industry leaders to deliver breakthrough performance that enables the most advanced gaming solutions.\n\n\u201cRadeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards were built to deliver high-performance, no-compromises gaming experiences, and the addition of Micron memory to the product line will help us meet that objective,\u201d said Scott Herkelman, corporate vice president and general manager of the Graphics Business Unit at AMD. \u201cMicron has a strong history of developing advanced memory products, and we worked closely with their engineering team to optimize GDDR6 for RDNA 2 architecture-based graphics cards, giving our board partners more choice and flexibility to produce additional designs for gamers.\u201d\n\n**Is Micron a buy right now?**\n\nFor the past half year, Micron shares have been trending downwards, however this has changed in November. The shares trended downwards due to a difficult pricing environment for its PC memory products, and macro developments have had their part to play in the downtrend (\u2018mostly the supply chain issues behind a lack of non-memory components which has led to some customers cutting back on memory and storage purchases\u2019).\n\nMicron has recently stated that over the next 10 years, it intends on spending $150 billion (combined) on Global Manufacturing and R&amp;D. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill believes this plan has brought questions of \u201cpotential over-capacity issues and whether a plan like this would be a large drag on free cash flow.\u201d\n\nMicron believes that \u201csecular growth drivers\u201d such as 5G and AI use cases should see increasing demand for DRAM and NAND. **I covered this in the \u2018Higher future DRAM demand and how this affects Micron\u2019 section of my DD. Thus I think Micron is justified in this belief and spending plan.** Gill thinks it\u2019s a good move, and worries are overblown.\n\n*\u2018\u201cThe current spending plan,\u201d said the 5-star analyst, \u201cWhen annualized and put into context, is nothing out of the ordinary and should neither cause significant increases in industry capacity (so there should be no resulting price wars from the competition) nor be a significant drag on free cash flow, which would continue to grow and reach historical highs as a % of sales.\u201d\u2019*\n\nGill agrees with Micron, in that continued demand for DRAM and NAND based on 5G/AI drivers is important to focus on.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Gill thinks the company will have enough free cash flow to provide it with a \u201chigh level of capital return flexibility,\u201d which during cyclical sell-off periods, for example, could see the company repurchase shares. Additionally, should the need arise for \u201ccompetitive reasons,\u201d it will also provide a \u201csafety buffer\u201d for more R&amp;D or CapEx spending.\u201d\n\nGill reiterated a Buy rating for MU stock with a $130 price target. 14 other analysts join Gil on the bull list, with another 6 holds and 1 sell, the stock has a moderate buy consensus rating (as of Oct 27 2021, I\u2019ll add more recent figures in the following section). \n\n[\u201cThe 47 rating InvestorsObserver gives to Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) stock puts it near the middle of the Semiconductors industry. In addition to scoring higher than 38 percent of stocks in the Semiconductors industry, MU\u2019s 47 overall rating means the stock scores better than 47 percent of all stocks.\u201d](https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/does-micron-technology-inc-mu-have-what-it-takes-to-be-in-your-portfolio-friday)\n\n[WSJ Analyst Ratings](https://imgur.com/fgGQbHV)\n[TipRanks Analyst Ratings](https://imgur.com/k85pW0e)\n[MarketBeat Analyst Ratings](https://imgur.com/6KStq0U)\n\n**Has Micron Run Its Cyclical Course?**\n\nI will be heavily sourcing from [this great and recent Nasdaq article](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/has-micron-run-its-cyclical-course) for this section.\n\n\u2018On the face of it, year-to-date, Micron\u2019s stock price is almost at the same level. However, its stock has been on a 2021 roller-coaster ride. It opened 2021 at $77.42, and hit $95.3 in the first week of April. Since then, the stock steadily fell until it hit $67-levels in October. It spent time consolidating in October before starting to rise again.\u2019\n\nThis fall is due to Micron\u2019s cyclical nature of business. The stock moves based on the demand/supply for memory. \u2018When the world needed semiconductors, the stock moved up. Now, as the world is slowly opening up, there was a fall in its stock price. However, Micron stock seems to have bottomed out.\u2019\n\nThe company has beaten earnings expectations in the last four quarters (each of), the company has delivered profits and has not disappointed investors. \n\n\u2018Micron Technology president and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the demand outlook for 2022 was strong, and Micron would continue to deliver innovative solutions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company\u2019s guidance is $7.65 billion in revenue, with a gross margin of 46%.\u2019\n\nA June report by Global Market Insights states that semiconductor memory market revenue will cross $180 billion by 2027. It said, \u201cThe growing uptake of Dynamic Random-access Memory (DRAM) in gaming consoles, PC hardware, and high-performance computing devices will support the industry growth.\u201d\n\nMicron has stated that memory and storage are a growing portion of this industry, representing approximately 30% of the semi market. The company also stated that government support would be crucial for its expansion plans, as memory manufacturing in the US costs around 35%-45% more compared to lower cost markets. \u2018Funding to support new semiconductor manufacturing capacity is a must, said EVP of Global Operations Manish Bhatia. He added, \u201cSustained government support is essential for Micron to ensure a resilient supply chain and reinforce technology leadership for the long term.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018The top three companies in the sector invest billions of dollars every year to manufacture chips. These chips are increasingly getting more complicated and expensive with every passing generation. It is very unlikely that price wars will break out over market share. The game will be played on quality.\u2019 **Refer to my section about GDDR6X memory, Micron is delivering TOP quality.**\n\nInvestors (regards) will have to accept that the company stock price is generally going to be volatile, due to its cyclical nature. However you can take comfort in the fact that the lows/highs for the stock will generally move up. \u2018The company has realized this and has purchased 15.6 million shares of its common stock for $1.2 billion during the fiscal year of 2021.\u2019\n[Here is a useful article explaining the volatility of MU this past month.](https://investchronicle.com/2021/11/16/here-is-why-micron-technology-inc-mu-stock-volatility-recorded-over-the-last-month-was-2-30/)\n\n\u2018Tipranks\u2019 Stock Forecast Tool indicates 15 out of 22 analysts have given MU a Buy rating, while six analysts have a Hold rating on the stock and just one has a Sell rating on the stock.\n\nThe average Micron price target is $96.09, which indicates 24.2% upside potential.\u2019\n\u2018A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Barclays decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $110.00 to $87.00 and set an \"overweight\" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $140.00 to $100.00 and set an \"overweight\" rating for the company in a report on Friday, September 24th. UBS Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $95.00 to $90.00 and set a \"buy\" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Morgan Stanley restated a \"hold\" rating and set a $75.00 target price on shares of Micron Technology in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Finally, The Goldman Sachs Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $104.00 to $88.00 and set a \"buy\" rating for the company in a report on Thursday, October 14th. One equities research analyst has rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned a hold rating, twenty-three have assigned a buy rating and two have assigned a strong buy rating to the company's stock. Based on data from MarketBeat.com, the stock has an average rating of \"Buy\" and an average target price of $103.31.\u2019\n\n**Upcoming Quarterly Sales/Next Earnings**\n\n[Analysts expect that Micron will report $7.66 billion in sales for the current quarter](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-mu-consensus-analyst-rating-2021-11-2-3/), according to Zacks Investment Research. The highest sales estimate of 6 is $7.67 billion, and the lowest is $7.65 billion. Micron posted sales of $5.77 billion during the same quarter last year, indicating YoY growth of 32.8%. Next earnings date is Monday, December 20th. \nOn average, analysts expect full-year sales of $31.34 billion (for the current financial year). For the next fiscal year, analysts forecast reported sales of $35.60 billion on average. \nMicron last issued its earnings results on Monday, September 27th. \u201c The semiconductor manufacturer reported $2.42 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the Thomson Reuters' consensus estimate of $2.33 by $0.09. The business had revenue of $8.27 billion during the quarter, compared to analyst estimates of $8.21 billion. Micron Technology had a return on equity of 15.98% and a net margin of 21.16%. Micron Technology's revenue for the quarter was up 36.6% on a year-over-year basis. During the same quarter in the prior year, the firm earned $1.00 earnings per share.\u201d\n**I could write way more for this DD.

Expecting us to pullback into a corrective wave 2 into a very buyable dip around $70. Be patient on this one, it's only getting started\u201d My gut says this guy is incorrect tbh, given the recent push. \n\n\n**[After 200 days we can see a breakout](https://imgur.com/Vmhx9Al) - Nov 12, very in-depth:**\n\u201cToday we will take a look at Micron Technology , a company that engages in the provision of innovative memory and storage solutions. Time to check the Technical elements on the chart:\n\n1) From 2018 until November 2020 the price was inside a massive range until we saw the breakout of it and a 50% bullish movement from that situation towards the top of the bullish impulse\n\n2) From April until today the price has been consolidating on a clear corrective pattern where we can define both top and bottom edges\n\n3) How can we know that the structure is finished? Two reasons here: first we have clear edges (previous item) and second the structure has made contact with a key level, in this case, the ascending trendline.\n\n4) Now we have a breakout of the corrective pattern. Remember that Technical Analysis is a statistical discipline, which means that we are never gonna have certainty about a situation. However, we know that if we engage in quality situations over certain periods, we will be able to observe consistent results.\n\n5) We are not taking setup on this stock, (we already have exposure on other assets). However, it's an interesting situation to wait for a throwback (retest of a broken structure). IF that happens, we have defined an activation level as you can see on the chart (ALWAYS ABOVE THE TRENDLINE)\n\n6) Depending on how aggressive is the setup you are taking, the invalidation level can be: FIRST below the whole structure 65.00 / SECOND below the throwback (this setup provides a massive risk to reward ratio, however, is prone to a quick stop loss)\n\n7) Targets: IF I would be executing a setup here, I would protect my setup once the price reaches the previous top, which shares a major resistance zone that you can see on the weekly chart (2% below that, I want to be risk-free) / Now, the places to close setups on profit can be the first or 2nd Fibonacci extension . The expected duration of a movement like this may be between 200 to 300 days.\n\n8)RISK: This is the formula I use to trade: I never have more than 5 setups at the same time NEVER EVER. And the maximum % of risk I take on any setup is 3% (ONLY with a STRATEGY THAT YOU HAVE a lot of EXPERIENCE WITH). Let's understand this better, most of my setups happen on the daily chart , which means that time resolutions are between 2 weeks to 3 months. Another rule I use is that my setups must happen on uncorrelated assets example: NFLX / BTCUSD / XAUUSD / FCX / AMZN . So my worst-case scenario is losing all at the same time which means a -10% to -15%. That's more than acceptable for me. And the most probable thing is that I would be able to open 4 to 5 new setups 1 to 2 months later. That's why this type of trading style is so secure. Even in apocalyptic scenarios, you would face a manageable loss, and it will take you time to develop new setups (you avoid impulsive trading)\u201d\n\n\n**Tickeron AI TA, copied here so you don\u2019t have to sign up for an account.

It is investing heavily in itself. Nvidia is dependent on them. I am very bullish on MU after doing this research. I will try to open a position of LEAPS and shares as soon as I have the funds. \n\nTL;DR:\n\n* MU bounced on Friday, perhaps this is the sign that its downtrend is reversing.\n\n* Higher future DRAM demand will push up Micron. DRAM is used in Smartphones, Data centres, PC/Gaming, Automotive, Industrials and Consumer Electronics. Increased demand in these sectors will drive up Micron\u2019s value. \n\n* Nvidia uses Micron memory in it\u2019s data centre GPU\u2019s.\n\n* Nvidia\u2019s ONLY supplier of GDDR6X memory used in higher-end gaming GPU\u2019s is Micron. Nvidia is dependent on them for this high-performance memory.\n\n* AMD are using Micron GDDR6(not X) memory in their RX 6000 series GPU\u2019s.\n\n* Micron\u2019s downtrend has changed in November. \n\n* Micron intends to spend $150 billion combined on Global Manufacturing and R&amp;D.\n\n* $130 price target from Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill.\n\n* Micron moves based on the supply/demand for memory.\n\n* Micron may have bottomed out now, and is due to go up.\n\n* \u2018Tipranks\u2019 Stock Forecast Tool indicates 15 out of 22 analysts have given MU a Buy rating, while six analysts have a Hold rating on the stock and just one has a Sell rating on the stock.\nThe average Micron price target is $96.09, which indicates 24.2% upside potential.\n\n* [Analysts expect that Micron will report $7.66 billion in sales for the current quarter](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-mu-consensus-analyst-rating-2021-11-2-3/), according to Zacks Investment Research. The highest sales estimate of 6 is $7.67 billion, and the lowest is $7.65 billion. Micron posted sales of $5.77 billion during the same quarter last year, indicating YoY growth of 32.8%. Next earnings date is Monday, December 20th. \n\n* On average, analysts expect full-year sales of $31.34 billion (for the current financial year). For the next fiscal year, analysts forecast reported sales of $35.60 billion on average. \nMicron last issued its earnings results on Monday, September 27th. \u201c The semiconductor manufacturer reported $2.42 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the Thomson Reuters' consensus estimate of $2.33 by $0.09. The business had revenue of $8.27 billion during the quarter, compared to analyst estimates of $8.21 billion. Micron Technology had a return on equity of 15.98% and a net margin of 21.16%. Micron Technology's revenue for the quarter was up 36.6% on a year-over-year basis. During the same quarter in the prior year, the firm earned $1.00 earnings per share.\u201d\n\n\n**Are there any sections or points I'm missing?

        "selftext": " \n\nOkay so posted a long comment I made as a DD but it was taken down cause no tickers...which makes sense. Here's some more info on what to expect in the near term with the new \"Nu\" covid variant:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r2kpzy/comment/hm5m0hz/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r2kpzy/comment/hm5m0hz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nTL;DR of that comment - bunch of mutations, could be vaccine resistant and transmissible enough to overtake Delta.\n\nIf South Africa is a microcosm of what is going to happen world wide, Nu may take over Delta as the dominant strain. Its done so in a short amount of time in SA.\n\n[https://fortune.com/2021/11/26/new-covid-variant-south-africa-nu-mutations-delta-dominant-strain/](https://fortune.com/2021/11/26/new-covid-variant-south-africa-nu-mutations-delta-dominant-strain/)\n\n**\\*\\*\\*Next important catalyst could be EOD as the WHO is meeting to decide a designation for Nu Today! \\*\\*\\*** It started at 6:00am est.\n\n[**https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/25/who-calls-special-meeting-to-discuss-new-covid-variant-from-south-africa-with-large-number-of-mutations.html**](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/25/who-calls-special-meeting-to-discuss-new-covid-variant-from-south-africa-with-large-number-of-mutations.html)\n\n**Most important is how they decide to classify it.**\n\nThere's three categories:\n\nVariant of Interest (none currently)\n\nVariant of Concern (Delta)\n\nVariant of High Concern (none currently)\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html#anchor\\_1632158885160](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html#anchor_1632158885160)\n\nNo way to say which if any they will choose.\n\nIf they DO NOT designate it and just make some noises about \"keeping on eye on it\" and shit, \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nIf they designate it a Variant of Interest, I think that's priced in (pure speculation but it seems like sentiment is that will be the minimum).\n\nIf they designate it a Variant of Concern, we tank all the way through next week imo. Delta took awhile to be designated as such and this variant was discovered pretty recently.\n\nI really don't think they'll designate it a Variant of High Concern since it hasn't spread that far yet but if they do, look out below. (In fact they've said in intereviews now they won't).\n\nI don't normally like youtube for research but with a thing like this where there isn't a lot of quality shit published yet, I think looking at interviews with frontline people is important. This is an interview with a South African researcher who's actually dealing with these cases. (really only have to watch the first 3 minutes or so)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnOg9zpHRyw&amp;t=210s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnOg9zpHRyw&amp;t=210s)\n\nNotice at about 1:00 she seems to very carefully select the phrase \"*This is a variant of great concern\"* to us. She's also careful to use the phrase \"variant of interest\" distinctly in other parts of the interview.\n\nAgain this is speculation, but I think the frontine doc's are freaked the fuck out about this one and are going to lobby hard for Nu to get put into the Variant of Concern category right away. Which could be exceptionally intimidating to markets given that this variant was just discovered recently.\n\nHere is another bread crumb based on language selection but a WHO official explicitly used the term \"concern\" and it seems now like the plan is to designate it either as a VOI or VOC but a non-designation may be off the table:\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-meeting-friday-designate-new-variant-b11529-2021-11-26/](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-meeting-friday-designate-new-variant-b11529-2021-11-26/)\n\nRisks:\n\nLooking back on the corresponding dates of other variants when they were declared \"Variants of Concern\" there wasn't identifiable market correction. Obviously one way to take that is that this too will be a nothing burger and markets are acting sensitive for some other reasons rn (evergrande?).\n\nAnother way is that none of the variants, aside from delta, were quite as scary. Idk, that's up for debate.\n\nWays to play it:\n\nSpy puts for monday. I think the odds are high that *at a minimum* more cases will be discovered in more countries over the weekend which should at least cause a good dip monday morning. If they designate it as a VOC after hours today, I think those will really print.\n\nYANG calls. Going to enter these next week but I think China is a terrible position to handle another covid wave and lockdown. Evergrande has credit markets shook-up already, compounding that with the crazy shit they'll try to do to contain it and markets could flip the fuck out (like welding apartment doors shut with residents inside).\n\nPick a travel stock and buy puts. Looks like CCL has already dropped a bunch today but if this thing evades vaccines and the WHO makes it a VOC, the bottom may not be in yet.\n\nMight also look at longer dated SPY puts/Yang calls etc. since it'll take a few weeks for them to really get a good look at this little fucker. If its as bad as the pessimists think, they won't have to wait for lab results, it could blow-up and go world wide before they calculate its transmissibility.\n\nTLDR - WHO is meeting for a long time today to decide if they designate Nu as VOI or VOC. VOI could likely be priced-in, VOC might not and we go \ud83d\udcc9.\n\nNot investment advice. I'm terrible at this. Listening to me about anything is fundamentally dangerous and costly.\n\nCheers! \ud83c\udf7b",

As you may or may not know, it is a SPAC that is planned to go public sometime in the first half of 2022, no date yet confirmed. The company is seeking to compete in the EV market, and has a leg up on some of its competitors, in that it already has vehicles in production, and delivery of over 10,000 vehicles. The car itself isn't very fancy in terms of features, but it is pretty basic and offers what you would want from a very standard EV at this price point. I am concerned they may not be very popular, but it seems they are the talk of the EV town at the moment. What are your thoughts?

        "selftext": "tl;dr -- Understanding quantitative easing did **not** cure me of my 26 years of virginity or solve my small pp problem.\n\nThe journey starts on a cold winter night in January. It is my birthday and in my drunken stupor, I proclaim to my friends that this will be the year I enlarge my small pp, get over my fear of woman and lose my virginity. Thus, I embarked on the journey of trying to understand what quantitive easing is. My hope was that understanding this magic term would lead me to great wealth that would cure me of my small pp and virginity. Spoiler alert, I do not have great wealth, my pp is the same size and I'm still a virgin. \n\nSo help me God\n\nFor those of you who wish to also know this useless knowledge that I have obtained, buckle up because this is a long one. \n\nTo start, we first need to understand \"how does the banking system works?\" \n\n# Banking 101\n\nA bank has a balance sheet. On one side we have the banks assets and on the other, the liabilities. Here is a simple balance sheet:\n\n|Assets|Liabilities|\n|:-|:-|\n|Securities -- Government Debt (S)|Deposits (D)|\n|Loans (L)||\n|Reserves (R)||\n\nDeposits are liabilities because the bank owes you that money. On the asset side, the bank holds securities (short term government debt, usually 1-3 months), loans (money to be paid back with interest) and reserves which is basically just cash (digital or physical). A simple way to calculate reserves is to do D - S - L = R. Works most of the time.\n\nOne other key concept, is the reserve ratio. This is a magic number set by central banks. If the reserve ratio is 10, that means that banks **must** have a minimum of 10% of the total deposits as reserves. So if I have 10,000 dollars in deposits, I must have 1,000 dollars in reserves.  \n\nNow, banks have a special power that allows them to create more money. They use reserves as collateral to create a loan, which in turn creates a deposit, hence creating more money! Let's take the following example:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33nba8szrl181.png?width=2292&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0572a1aef069da80c13800fd810a3520e6d38c7\n\nIn this example, Alice deposits 10,000 dollars into Bank A. Mr. John, in need of a pp enlargement surgery, takes out a 9000 dollar loan, which gets deposited into Mr. John's bank account at Bank A. Now, Mr. John takes out that money and gives it to Doctor Big D, who performs the surgery and puts that money into Bank B. So, let's walk through the balance sheets! Aren't we having fun??!?!?!?\n\nBank A: Alice deposits 10,000 dollars\n\n|Assets|Liabilities|\n|:-|:-|\n|0 (S)|10,000 (D)|\n|0 (L)||\n|10,000 (R)||\n\nBank A: Mr. John takes out a loan for 9,000 dollars\n\n|Assets|Liabilities|\n|:-|:-|\n|0 (S)|19,000 (D)|\n|9,000 (L)||\n|10,000 (R)||\n\nNow at this point, Bank A has just created 9,000 dollars of new money. Because the money was put into Mr. John's bank account, the total amount of reserves at this bank, have not yet decreased. In addition the reserve requirement went from 1000, to 1,900 dollars.\n\nBank A: Mr. John withdraws the 9,000 dollars for pp enlargement surgery\n\n|Assets|Liabilities|\n|:-|:-|\n|0 (S)|10,000 (D)|\n|9,000 (L)||\n|1,000 (R)||\n\nSince Mr. John. withdrew this money, we now only have 1,000 dollars left in reserves (D - S - L = R), meaning Bank A can no longer create any new money through the creation of loans because they have no excess reserves (amount of reserves over the reserve requirement).\n\nIn the meantime Doctor Big D will deposit the 9,000 dollars at Bank B (Thanks for the op Doctor Big D!). These 9,000 dollars will become reserves that Bank B can use to create more loans and expand the amount of money in the system.\n\nBank B: Doctor Big D deposits the 9,000 dollars\n\n|Assets|Liabilities|\n|:-|:-|\n|0 (S)|9,000 (D)|\n|0 (L)||\n|9,000 (R)||\n\nSo what have we learned? Well, the banks use reserves as collateral to create loans, which create deposits, thus increasing the amount of money in the system. As the money works its way back into the banking system, those new deposits become reserves which can be used to create more loans. Depending on what the reserve requirement is, changes how much the money can be \"multiplied\" by. So a reserve requirement of 10, means we can multiple the base reserves in the system by a factor of 10 (theoretically). If we have 1,000 dollars of base reserves, it could eventually be turned into 10,000 dollars.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/91q0rkrcyl181.png?width=1336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13c162a986861f4b64afa2b12c12d30e8d1974cf\n\n\"So how do base reserves get created?\" We'll look at that in the quantitive easing section but first let's look at what happens when Mr. John starts paying back his loan. Then we'll look at the security part of the bank's balance sheet. After that, it is onward to the credit cycle, and quantitive easing.\n\n**Loan repayment**\n\nLoans are a sneaky son a bitch and help create demand for money because the loans have to be paid back with interest. This is one way, money derives its value (i.e. more demand, more valuable something is). Now when a loan is paid back, it destroys the amount of deposits in the banking system, thus lowering the amount of money.\n\nSo let's say, after Mr. John get his pp enlargement surgery, he finally has the balls to ask his manager for a raise due to the new found confidence from having a big dick. Due to this new raise, Mr. John starts paying back his loan to Bank A. \n\nBank A: John gets a 1,000 dollar paycheck\n\n|Assets|Liabilities|\n|:-|:-|\n|0 (S)|11,000 (D)|\n|9,000 (L)||\n|2,000 (R)||\n\nBank A: John pays 1000 dollars back on his loan with 100 dollars going to interest\n\n|Assets|Liabilities|\n|:-|:-|\n|0 (S)|10,000 (D)|\n|8,100 (L)||\n|1,900 (R)||\n\nSo what happened here? Well, 900 dollars were removed from circulation since they are no longer deposits. Im addition, 100 dollars were paid as interest to bank A. As the bank pays their expenses with those 100 dollars, the 100 dollars just end up back in the banking system as deposits.\n\nThis leads to an important concept. As the amount of loans grow in the system the amount of money will expand and as those loans are paid back the amount of money in the system decreases. Or in male monkey talk, the more ass and boobies, pp expands, the less ass and boobies, pp contracts. \n\n**Securities**\n\nOkie dokie, securities are not any different from loans. Banks need to pay interest to depositors (although this is pointless today), so when banks can't find people to give loans to (only so many pp enlargement surgeries to be had), they instead buy short term government debt. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/st52wbx2em181.png?width=1212&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9736a12a5056dea1ad11a690031fc721dbb5c59\n\nLet's say in the example above, AOC thought it was unfair some males had a small pp and other had a big pp. Thankfully, AOC, being the progressive she is, passed the bill, equal pp sizes for all. This bill reimburses men afflicted with the curse of a small pp. So back to the balance sheets.\n\nBank A: Starts off with 10,000 dollars in reserves\n\n|Assets|Liabilities|\n|:-|:-|\n|0 (S)|10,000 (D)|\n|0 (L)||\n|10,000 (R)||\n\nBank A: Buys 9000 dollars of government securities\n\n|Assets|Liabilities|\n|:-|:-|\n|9,000 (S)|10,000 (D)|\n|0 (L)||\n|1,000 (R)||\n\nBank A: The government reimburses Mr. John for the 9,000 dollar pp enlargement surgery by depositing the money into Bank A\n\n|Assets|Liabilities|\n|:-|:-|\n|9,000 (S)|19,000 (D)|\n|0 (L)||\n|10,000 (R)||\n\nIn this example, the money that the government borrows will work its way back into the bank system, thus increasing the total amount of deposits by 9,000 dollars, thus increasing the total amount of money. Much wow, very cool. For Americans this means we all own US debt \\^.\\^.\n\nNow that we understand the basics of banking and how the money is created, let's move on to the next step, the credit cycle.\n\n# The Credit Cycle\n\nYou've made it this far, and we still have a ways to go. Take a break, watch a youtube video, engage in that late modernity cest pool of dopamine. I certainly did at this point.\n\nThe creation of new money through debt is usually referred to as the \"expansion of credit.\" As we expand the amount of credit in the economy, more and more debt is being taken on. Eventually, something is gonna go, wrong, very wrong. You see, Doctor Big D had a boom in business after AOC passed the equal pp sizes for all bill. So Doctor Big D took on lots and lots of debt to expand the number of clinics he ran. However, eventually the pp enlargement business faced a great bust. There was simply not enough pps left to enlarge!   \n\nEverything starts going south. Doctor Big D, unable to pay back his debt, blows his brains out. His business, \"Big Ds for All\" goes under. His army of 10,000 pp enhancers all lose their jobs. No longer can they make their debt payments. Banks across the nation panic as mortgage default rates start increasing. They tighten up their lending standards. Companies, start panicking and cutting cost by laying off workers. Suddenly those workers don't have money to pay back their debts. More defaults! The economy enters free fall as everyone cuts spending, hordes dollars, and pray they'll have enough money to service their debts in this credit contraction.\n\nYikes! Now, who the fuck wants to live through that? Not me AND ESPECIALLY NOT BOOMERS. So this is where where the FED (or whatever the fuck your central bank is called) comes in with its big bad ass weapon, quantitive easing.\n\nYou can skip this part, and go to quantitive easing but if you want to see how a bank goes insolvent during a credit contraction, we gotta look at the balance sheet. FUCK, I hate these things.\n\nBank B: Life is good\n\n|Assets|Liabilities|\n|:-|:-|\n|0 (S)|120,000 (D)|\n|90,000 (L)||\n|30,000 (R)||\n\nLet's say this is Bank B, before Doctor Big D kills himself and Big Ds for All goes under. They've loaned 70,000 of that 90,000 to Big Ds For All. \n\nBank B: Big Ds for All defaults  \n\n|Assets|Liabilities|\n|:-|:-|\n|0 (S)|120,000 (D)|\n|20,000 (L)||\n|30,000 (R)||\n\nO dingis in my kungbunghole! Bank B, now only has 50,000 dollars in assets but 120,000 dollars in liabilities. They'll never get enough money back in the form of loan repayments to pay back their depositors. This is how a bank enters insolvency.\n\n# Quantitative Easing\n\nShit, this has taken all morning. My brain is shot... Here, I made a video on my anal abscess [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPu8rvk3QZc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPu8rvk3QZc). I gotta pretend to work for a bit.\n\nOkay, where did I leave off, ahh yes! Quantitative Easing. So remember that question you had, \"So how do base reserves get created?\" Well, this is where central banks come in. They're the bank for the banks. Thus central banks also have their own balance sheet (GOD DAMMIT).\n\n|Assets|Liabilities|\n|:-|:-|\n|Government Bonds and Securities (S)|Base Money Supply (B)|\n|Loans to Banks (L)||\n|Other Assets (A) -- mortgage backed securities, stonks, teslas, gold, whatever ||\n\nIn order for central banks to get some juicy assets, they go to their respective commercial banks and swap out commercial bank assets and in return give them reserve notes. From here, I'll just refer to central banks as the FED because I'm too retarded to think generically.\n\nHere is a simple digram:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uqteb41adn181.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=007fe17d3b9669a74fc50f6d4b54bb4d3ec6bf0f\n\nAnd in balance sheet shenanigans:\n\nBank A: Has 90,000 dollars of U.S. treasuries\n\n|Assets|Liabilities|\n|:-|:-|\n|90,000 (S)|100,000 (D)|\n|0 (L)||\n|10,000 (R)||\n\nNow the FED comes in and takes those 90,000 dollars of treasuries and gives Bank A 90,000 dollars of reserves.\n\n|Assets|Liabilities|\n|:-|:-|\n|0 (S)|100,000 (D)|\n|0 (L)||\n|100,000 (R)||\n\nHere's the thing, the FED just increased the base reserves in the system, making it easier for banks to give out loans. Thus this is referred to as making credit cheaper. At the same time, Bank A, still gave the U.S. government 90,000 new dollars that will work its way back into the banking system as 90,000 dollars of deposits thus increasing the amount of reserves again, by 90,000 dollars!\n\nIn the meantime the FED balance sheet has become this\n\n|Assets|Liabilities|\n|:-|:-|\n|90,000 (S)|90,000 (B)|\n|0 (L)||\n|0 (A) ||\n\nHistorically the FED has engaged in this mechanism through what is called the target Federal Funds Rate. There's quite a bit to this actually but the key takeway here is when the FED lowers the federal funds rate, one action they take is swapping short term securities from banks for reserves. When they raise the federal funds rate, they sell the securities back to the banks and take the reserves. Here is a chart of the Federal Funds Rate over time. (Note, these securities are so short in duration, the FED only has to wait 1 to 3 months for the US government to pay them back and thus, destroy the reserves)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lm03ez44fn181.png?width=2342&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93ff9fbf1b200e4932df061915abe48d50835d2\n\nAs we can see, the federal funds rate has been mostly declining since the 1980s and every time we enter a credit contraction in the credit cycle, we massively cut the federal funds rate. This blunts the credit contraction by increasing bank reserves, lowering interest rates and resuming the increase in credit and debt. Low and behold the graph below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p2lpq2iqin181.png?width=2376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3610eb6edafeb4dd3ad14dba66b3f97522ee16eb\n\nThis means, we keep kicking the can down the road and never letting the credit cycle complete. But remember, no one, and especially boomers wanted to go through a full contraction of the credit cycle. Today, it would be global suicided.\n\nSo, in 2008 (or if your Japan 2001), eventually the federal funds rate hits zero and it is time to get serious. Quantitative Easing (QE) is the next step. QE simply allows the central banks to swap what ever they want from a bank's balance sheet for reserves. For example, QE has allowed the FED to gobble up mortgage backed securities. The result is banks loan at lower interest rates in order to get home buyers to take out more/new loans. This result occurs because when a central bank engages in a swap with the bank, the bank loses an asset it was gonna make money on. Now the bank needs to create that asset again.\n\nSo QE helps keep the credit cycle going by increasing reserves, lowering interest rates and ultimately increasing the amount of credit/money in the system. Now for reasons in a different post, consumer price inflation has remained low despite this all this. However it has arguably caused massive asset inflation, contributing to an ever increase of wealth concentration.  \n\n\\---\n\nTo end it all, let's get back to the story of Doctor Big D and his clinic Big Ds for All. Let's imagine, instead of Doctor Big D having to kill himself and his life work going under, the FED in it's all mighty power comes in, engages in huge amount of QE, lowering interest rates for all! Big D is able to refinance, keep his business solvent and see his business recover as more zoomers come of age and get pp enlargement surgery. A happy ending for the day. Happy Thanksgiving.\n\nbut alas, Doctor Big D doesn't exist, my pp is small and I'm still a virgin.  \n\nSo help me God.",

        "selftext": "Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe.  Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe\u2019s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition.  I recommend starting with the [introduction in Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qkg3i5/gaining_visibility_on_paysafe_psfe/) (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 8. Management\n\nAs part of Paysafe\u2019s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they\u2019ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They\u2019ve hired PayPal\u2019s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook\u2019s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl\u2019s Head of Payments.  This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook.\n\nStill, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of [positive news](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/), the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe\u2019s value story.  It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader\u2019s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value.  Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers.\n\nRegardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of [Visa](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/skrill-usa-launches-skrill-virtual-visar-prepaid-card-in-us/), [Coinbase](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-issues-coinbase-s-new-visa-debit-card-enabling-easier-cryptocurrency-spending/), [Fubo Gaming](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-streamlines-payments-for-interactive-wagering-with-fubo-gaming-in-us/), [FOXbet](https://www.njgamblingfun.com/nj/sports-news/paysafe-continues-its-push-into-online-gaming), [Golden Nugget](http://www.greensheet.com/newswire.php?newswire_id=53685), [Bankable](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-partners-with-bankable-to-provide-omnichannel-banking-services/), [Wix](https://www.pymnts.com/digital-payments/2021/smbs-can-accept-payments-with-paysafe-skrill-on-wix/), [Repay](https://www.repay.com/repay-partners-with-paysafe-to-enable-u-s-merchants-to-accept-online-cash-payments/), [WynnBet](https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/news/wynnbet-taps-paysafe-for-payments-and-marketing-solutions/), [Betfred USA](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-expands-betfred-usa-sports-partnership-through-income-access-deal/), [OwnersBox](https://incomeaccess.com/contenthub/ownersbox-launches-affiliate-program/), [Dutch neobank bunq](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/bunq-partners-with-paysafe-to-enable-cash-deposits-for-digital-banking/), [IntelliPay](https://intellipay.com/paysafe-expands-us-partnership-with-intellipayto-offer-online-cash-payments/), Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, [Smart Property Systems](https://globalfintechseries.com/banking/digital-payments/paysafe-partners-with-smart-property-systems-in-north-america/), Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, [Montana Lottery](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-powers-online-payments-for-montana-lotterys-sportsbook/), PlayUP, [SuperBook Sports](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-platform-launches-with-superbook-sports-in-colorado-and-new-jersey/) and [Bitrise](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-accelerates-innovation-with-bitrise-for-faster-digital-wallets-payments/).\n\nIn that same period, they\u2019ve also:\n\n* expanded their US launch of digital wallet Skrill to [48 states](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafes-skrill-expands-its-crypto-service/),\n* expanded their digital wallets to [trade](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafes-neteller-launches-fiat-to-crypto-withdrawal-service/) 38 \\[digital\\]currencies and 40 global fiat currencies\n* launched online cash payments on Microsoft\u2019s [Xbox](https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2021/xbox-gamers-can-now-pay-with-cash-online-with-paysafe/) in 22 countries\n* struck deals with [Snowflake](https://www.atmmarketplace.com/news/paysafe-integrates-snowflake-to-power-cloud-based-approach-for-enhanced-customer-experiences/) and Amazon\u2019s [AWS](https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/news/paysafe-partners-aws-to-become-cloud-based-payments-provider/) to support its migration to a cloud-based platform as part of their strategy to scale quickly and leverage data to drive customer acquisition,\n* [launched](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-launches-safeguarding-model-for-the-travel-industry-globally/) a new global travel safeguarding model,\n* a unique innovation that quickly led to a new [deal](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-and-arc-partner-to-deliver-innovative-payments-solution-for-airlines/) with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally.\n\nAlso during this time, they announced the appointments of:\n\n* Digital wallet division CEO, [Chirag Patel](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-appoints-chirag-patel-to-lead-its-digital-wallets-division/) (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander)\n* North American iGaming CEO, [Zak Cutler](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-appoints-zak-cutler-to-lead-its-north-america-igaming-business/) (fmr DraftKings exec),\n* Boardmember [Mark Brooker](https://fxnewsgroup.com/forex-news/executives/paysafe-appoints-mark-brooker-as-non-exec-director/) (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill)\n\nAll that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada\u2019s [newly opened](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/canada-legalizes-single-game-sports-191629457.html) sports betting market).  As Bill Foley said, \u201cwe\u2019re seeding the future growth right now\u2026 The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective\u2026It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\u201d  They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America.\n\nLastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value.  Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers.\n\nThe types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe\u2019s \u201cvalue creation playbook\u201d which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley [said](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Foley-Trasimene-Acquisition-Corp-II-and-Paysafe-investor-call-Final.pdf), \u201cthose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.\u201d\n\nIn this context, it\u2019s worth underscoring Foley\u2019s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies.  Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He\u2019s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, \u201cMy whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.\u201d  Though he\u2019s not Paysafe\u2019s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that \u201c  Bill is highly engaged with the company.\u201d Personally, I don\u2019t doubt it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 9. Lockup Expiration\n\nSome bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares ([20F p. 135](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000119312521104105/d159702d20f.htm#toc)). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe\u2019s value creation playbook. Between Foley\u2019s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone\u2019s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold.\n\nUpon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified \u201cbase returns for a four year hold period\u201d of \u201c2.9x to 3.8x\u201d from $10.  \n\nFrom their proxy statement (SEC filing-[DEFM14A](https://pdf.secdatabase.com/2681/0001193125-21-060961.pdf)): \u201cThe Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 10. Valuation\n\nPaysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts.  By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples.\n\nNow trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner\u2019s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures.  But Paysafe is anything but that.\n\nOr maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a \"300% higher\" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of \u201c$3.7 billion\u201d, exclusive of debt.  Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to [Reuters.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/qfopku/credit_suisse_revised_to_neutral_detail/)  To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars.\n\nInitially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE\u2019s financial data, like YF\u2019s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a [Credit Suisse analyst](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/qfopku/credit_suisse_revised_to_neutral_detail/) offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER.  Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA).  Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick.  Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new.  It\u2019s not like the market is [unaware](https://www.sec.gov/tm/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsanalystshtm.html) of analyst [conflicts of interest](https://web.williams.edu/Economics/Honors/2004/MSirignanoThesis.pdf) or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on [Archegos](https://fortune.com/2021/07/29/credit-suisse-report-archegos-loss-bank-massive-culture-problem/), [$5.3B fine](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/23/deutsche-bank-and-credit-suisse-agree-billion-dollar-fines-with-us-authorities.html) for mortgage backed securities,[$2.5B fine](https://cn.reuters.com/article/uk-creditsuisse-investigation-idUKKBN0E00WM20140520) after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent [$547M fine](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/credit-suisse-resolves-fraudulent-mozambique-loan-case-547-million-coordinated-global) after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market.  If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades.\n\nObviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn\u2019t matter in the long run.\n\nTrue price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil then, here are a few reference points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at Paysafe\u2019s eCash segment as a separate company:\n\nThe eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that.\n\nAdyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen\u2019s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe\u2019s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That\u2019s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue.\n\nUsing Adyen\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe\u2019s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company\u2019s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62.\n\nAgain, that represents less than a third of Paysafe\u2019s total business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBrick &amp; Mortar Payment Processing\n\nPaysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth.  Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick &amp; mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison.\n\nFor 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively. \n\nIn all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X.  This would put PSFE at $41.80.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDigital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet\n\nMany compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here\u2019s a deeper look into that comparison:\n\nAs noted earlier, Paysafe\u2019s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS.\n\nBy comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal\u2019s troubles as a \u201cbuying opportunity.\u201d\n\nSome will reasonably say that\u2019s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal\u2019s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ([$5.6b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal) to [$21.5b](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ([$169m](https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908) to [$1.43b](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_60f30e3ae06e5db5459655316a65dc97/paysafe/db/1111/9761/file/Supplemental+Financial+Information_+Paysafe+Limited_+Q1+2021.xlsx)).\n\nPaysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020\u2019s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe\u2019s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal\u2019s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted.\n\nPaysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a \u201cfree cash flow machine,\u201d Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin).\n\nThere\u2019s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL\u2019s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE\u2019s potential acquisition debt and dilution:\n\n* PayPal\u2019s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10\n* PayPal\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90\n* PayPal\u2019s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40.\n* PayPal\u2019s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75\n* PayPal\u2019s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41\n\nThose metrics average to a share price of $27.31\n\nWhen factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSector multiples:\n\nBecause Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a \\~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group.\n\nAfter removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here\u2019s Paysafe\u2019s share price with the averaged peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67\n* EV/Rev ratio : $40.17\n* EV/FCF ratio : $39.72\n\nAverage : $41.84\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS\u2019s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE\u2019s recent price action, but certainly not all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure, it\u2019s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, \u201cthe market doesn\u2019t care,\u201d but I\u2019m confident that\u2019ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER\u2019s gradually shift focus from the past to the future.  Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of \u201clook at the chart\u201d and \u201cprice is truth.\u201d  This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth.\n\nNo, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, \u201cThe stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.\u201d\n\nDo with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own.  Given how much disinformation has been out there, I thought I\u2019d do my bit to peel back the layers on what I consider to be a reliable long term investment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis concludes our public service announcement. We now return to normal programming.",

        "selftext": " \n\n&gt;Like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal\n\nThis is how they define themselves. [Wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) is a community that has gained a following of 11MM+ members over the years. As much as it\u2019s fun to follow their ups and downs and the laugh-out-loud memes that they post, the question in the back of everyone\u2019s mind is: **Is there really more to WSB than just the memes and jokes?** Do they have real insights?\n\nIn this analysis, I try to use historical data about the conversations on WSB to see if there\u2019s a method to the [madness and chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg85H26wyLk) and [GME hype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze): to see if **we can beat the market by using the stock picks made on WSB.** After all,\n\n*Processing img tkrcc2xsh6x71...*\n\n*Processing img exloyxuuh6x71...*\n\n**Data**\n\nReddit\u2019s PRAW API and Pushshift API were used to obtain the data for this analysis. There were more than 20 million comments and posts made on WSB in 2021. I have had a VM running for collecting the live data from all the financial subreddits since Dec\u201920.\n\nThe summary sheet containing the analysis will be shared at the end in a Google sheet but if you want access to the full historical data, you can get it from [Pushshift API](https://github.com/pushshift/api).\n\n*Processing img trqixawuh6x71...*\n\n**Analysis**\n\nAhh, this is where it gets tricky. There are multiple ways to consider what constitutes a recommendation from WSB. Since there are millions of comments, it\u2019s not realistic to invest in each and every recommendation made on the subreddit.\n\nSo what I have done to simplify this is to calculate the most popular tickers for each day \\[2\\]. Why I settled on this logic is because a stock from this list is what a person is most likely to see when he/she would randomly browse through the subreddit and the higher the number of mentions, the more the chances of investing in the said stock.\n\nConsidering the practical limitations, I kept the cut-off at the top 10 stocks. Once we have found the top 10 discussed stocks of that day, we invest in them at the market close. Then we calculate the returns generated by the stocks over the next\n\na. One Week\n\nb. One Month\n\nc. Till Date ( From the date of investment to Today)\n\nThe benchmark for comparison is SPY\\[3\\]. We will compare the returns against SPY to see if the most popular recommendations generated by the platform can beat returns by SPY during the same time period.\n\n*Processing img jqpax2xuh6x71...*\n\n**Results**\n\nBefore we jump into the returns, here is a visualization of **how the most popular stocks have changed over the last year in WSB.**\n\n*Processing video fgmsogzyh6x71...*\n\n *In case the visualization is not loading,* [*check it out here.*](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7685282/) \n\n*Processing img 90xrkbf2i6x71...*\n\nWe would have made a grand total of 2,613 investments \\[4\\] in 2021 following this strategy. We would have lost money on more than 51% over the next week and more than 60% over the next month. But if you consider till date, we are slightly above 50%. If you compare this to SPY, its an extremely poor performance, as during the same period SPY would have given a positive return of 66% over one week, 76% over one month, and 100% Till Date (as SPY is trading at an all-time high now)\n\nBut, the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately \\[5\\]. Out of the 100 stocks you pick, even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high (which is what WSB is aiming for - it\u2019s definitely not for safe plays).\n\nSo, how has the average performance of WSB picks fared?\n\n*Processing img cjwlugp3i6x71...*\n\nWould you look at that! **WSB recommendations have hands down beaten SPY across all time periods.** It gave a 2% overperformance over the period of one week and 2.2% over one month and a whopping 6% if you had held on to your stocks.\n\nBut keep in mind that your performance is skewed towards a few stocks which got featured repeatedly in the top 10 list.\n\n*Processing img m6dlg6e4i6x71...*\n\nGME has been in the top10 discussed stocks in 100% of the days and on average you would have gained 73% if you invested in it every day. Both AMC and TSLA are close followers with both of them giving substantial returns. Among the other ones who have made the list repeatedly, only BB, CLOV, and WISH on average have lost money \\[6\\].\n\nNow that our main question is out of the way, we can really do a deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns.\n\n*Processing img lxryhi65i6x71...*\n\nUnsurprisingly, Gamestop and AMC are at the top of the pile with GME returning an insane 788% in one week. Even if you remove GME and AMC (due to the unlikely scenario of a short-squeeze), the other 3 stocks would have doubled your investment in one week. \n\n*Processing img d7nn1gj6i6x71...*\n\nFor every winner, there are bound to be losers. If you bought into GME at the top of the rally, you would have lost 73% of your investment in the next week. All the other companies on the list had a brief jump in popularity but folks who invested in that ended up holding the bag.\n\nBut what if you did not want to invest in 10 stocks every day. What if you only wanted to invest in the **top stock of the day** (ie, the one creating the most discussion)? Would you have beaten the market?\n\n*Processing img ylhpu4e7i6x71...*\n\nUnsurprisingly, you would have beaten the market by a wide margin. This is mainly due to the insane returns generated by GME, AMC, TSLA, etc. which came to the top of the list. You are just being rewarded for the high amount of risks you are taking by putting all your investment into a few stocks \\[7\\]. \n\n*Processing img ej6f9rxuh6x71...*\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThere are some limitations to this analysis which you should be aware of\n\n* As explained in footnote-1 there are 8-12 days of missing data - though this is not going to affect the results in any significant way as it\u2019s lesser than 5% of the total days in the analysis.\n* This analysis does not consider Options which is a big part of what WSB is made of. The returns from options can be wildly different from what we are observing in the case of buying stocks\n* We have just considered the last year of data where it was predominantly a bull market and meme stocks have made insane rallies. The results might be different if we expand our time horizon.\n* Finally, the above analysis only considers the chatter and not the sentiment about the stock. I would invest no matter if people are saying positive or negative things about the company. My hypothesis is that we would be able to generate more alpha if we can distinguish the sentiment in comments. A part-2 of this analysis incorporating sentiment is in the works \u2014 stay tuned!\n\n*Processing img hkyn8wzuh6x71...*\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBefore starting the analysis, I fully expected to end it with\n\n&gt;The real returns were the friends we made and the fun we had along the way!\n\nI was expecting that the chatter in WSB would be a lagging follower of the stock price rally and the people who invest in them would end up holding the bag.\n\nBut I was pleasantly surprised to see that on average the stock that made it to the trending list beat SPY in returns, that too ***across different time periods.***\n\nEither it\u2019s due to the self-fulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter that will lead to more investments that will cause the stock to rally even more. Or it might just be that WSB is the place where we can successfully leverage the [Wisdom of crowds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wisdom-crowds.asp).\n\nWhatever the case may be, you truly would need nerves of steel to keep holding on to a stock that rallies 700% in one week only to drop 70% in value next week and then finish net positive by the end of the year. For that, you are rewarded with market-beating returns!\n\nIf you liked reading this issue, you will love\n\n* How to [consistently make returns](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/crypto-dca) from the Crypto market!\n* [Should you follow insider transactions](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/insider-purchase) while investing?\n\nUntil next week\u2026\n\n*Processing img wuxkeczuh6x71...*\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] During the GME rally in January, the traffic was so high that the VM failed. I have used Pushshift to fill in the details wherever possible, but keep in mind that there are 7-8 days of missing data from 28th Jan to 8th Feb and 4 days of missing data in April 2nd week.\n\n\\[2\\] To find the most popular tickers I used a base of around 9,000 stock tickers that I got from IEX cloud. The program would flag if any of these tickers were present in a comment or post. This is by far the most data-intensive exercise I have done. if you hypothetically consider the loop as a cross join, we processed more than 200 Billion rows to find the most popular tickers.\n\n\\[3\\] If SPY was in the top 10 tickers, we would invest in that as well. I feel that this would slightly reduce our risk profile.\n\n\\[4\\] It\u2019s lesser than the expected 2,900 investments as there are some days in between where we had data loss (footnote 1) and also some stocks got delisted or underwent mergers (eg. Aphira) due to which we could not get the financial data from Yahoo Finance.\n\n\\[5\\] Take the classic example of Keith Gill (aka DFV). He at one point had a $50MM return using a 50K call option. Even if he had another 99 50K call options in other stocks which expired worthless, just this one right pick would have made him a net profit of $45MM. This phenomenon is known as [black swan farming](http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html).\n\n\\[6\\] This is very surprising given the amount of risk we are taking investing in meme stocks. Also, in my mind, you cannot complain about the skew towards a few stocks as it\u2019s bound to happen. Even in the case of S&amp;P500, a vast majority of returns is [driven by a few tech stocks](https://www.ajg.com/us/news-and-insights/2020/dec/s-p-500-index-top-heavy-tech-heavy/).\n\n\\[7\\] The Beta of this portfolio would be through the roof and you beating the market is more probable as we are in a rally. Remember, [what Beta giveth, Beta can take it away](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) just as easily.",

They obviously are not going to do that but in a very rare case and situation liquidity is secured.\n\nCircle team is just a gem, their CEO(3\\*) is not a young entrepreneur, it's senior 50yo man with a lot of experience in business and practices.\n\nNot only that the rest of the team are very talented and experienced people with nice curriculums and career, Why I'm mention this?

So they have un-official support of EEUU government.**\n\nAs a Stock market investor and Crypto currency too I could say USDC is been growing very fast, mostly because their main competitor Tether is filled with obscure practices and controversy, Circle could surpass them in a very short term maybe under a year.\n\nCircle is the second biggest reserve of stable coin in all the crypto market giving them a lot of possibilities to future use of that liquidity.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.

        "selftext": "**BULL CASES**\n\n/1. INTC is the only real US chip manufacturer that can reasonably compete with Korean Samsung and Taiwanese TSMC (-100 credit score for acknowledging Taiwan). It is getting lots of literal boat load of cash(probs something like $50B equivalent) from the government that is positive for the shareholders, while maintaining the buybacks and dividends.\nYes, TSMC and others are also hedging and gonna start making some chips in USA but realistically the gubment will give most of the cash to INTC.\n\n/2. US gubment is in a cold war with China, this means it's also a technological warfare. This means supercomputers, missile, Starlink chips(private company) etc and Intel is likely going to be one of the prime suppliers of this boom in tech investment.\n\n/3. TSMC and Samsung are pretty much bottlenecked. Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Mediatech, Broadcom, various carmakers, electronics manufacturers etc and not to mention Intel themselves are a big buyer. Specifically, Intel and Apple has bought out all capacity of TSMC 3nm(equivalent to Intel's 5 nm probs, I forgot). This means there is an enormous demand that is not being fulfilled and Intel launching their foundry services and already signing deals with Qualcomm, Amazon is a big deal.\n\nFor reference, TSMC's market cap is bigger than 3 Intel (yes, that's a unit I invented). In 2024-2025, you might even see Apple, NVIDIA and the likes fabricating their chips from Intel just to give a big F U to TSMC (who is currently slightly overcharging if the rumours are to be believed).\n\n/4. Intel is launching a GPU. The GPU market is also in a huge bottleneck due to higher demand from gamers and corn miners. Everyone expects that they are likely to sell their GPUs very easily. Think about this for a sec. Intel is just about to become one of the players in this huge GPU market.\nWhich would also make way for their server GPUs and AIs and the likes.\n\n/5. Think 10-15 years from now. Your fridge, doorbell, light, heating system and every ducking thing will have some chips and Intel is likely to remain a dominant player in this market. I think this will be bigger than the current entire semi market as it is. IOT is just getting started.\n\n/6. Intel is one of the forerunner player in AI techs like autonomous vehicles through their various investments(Mobil eye for one) and will likely remain so. I don't know how big this will be in 10 years, but it's likely that Intel will be one of the bigger players in the market like Google (through Waymo), Tesla and NVIDIA.\n\n/7. Intel also recently launched their big little architecture, where it has already became competitively better than AMD especially in gaming in both power consumption and power. Not that it matters that much, seeing the gamer Steam reports, very few people actually play on the latest of the latest gen. But, that's also something that's worth noting at least. \n\nHowever, the vast majority of pc sales is in just your average boomer laptops and desktops. And they have a good lead there.\n\n*Tips for those wanting to build a high end new pc. Wait for Intel's lineup to be available broadly, high end pc gamers will dump their last gen AMD chips for the Intel one in the second hand market, causing a flooding of cheap AMD CPUs, buy one of them. Source: Did this once.*\n\n/8. One worrying factor is in the server market. Everyone seems to be launching their own server chips and AMD is very competitive and eating away market share. But Intel's management seems to be guiding us towards the right path. If their predictions prove to be right, they are on the right track.\n\n/9. Intel announced that they will launch Angstrom scale CPUs in the future, that's good I guess. They are also working in RISC-V and other CPU architectures.\n\n/10. Pat has an approval rating of 96% in Glassdoor and the employees would recommend others to work in Intel 89% of the time. This is a huge ass jump for both scores from the Bob Swan era. Go to Wayback Machine, you will see. This means a noticeable change has taken place within this huge organisation in such a short time.\n\n/11. Intel stock always seem to have price support at around $50. And it's near that range right now.\n\n/12. Most analysts are bullish on the stock. Comparatively cheap stock in this clown market. Wanna buy a $5.48B gravity powered truck company anyone?\n\n/13. Intel actually has one of the highest talented employee pull who can be expected to deliver. Contrary to popular belief.\n\n**Bear Cases**\n\n/1. This is a boomer stock according to reddit's circejerk. So, it's difficult to convince people that it is actually expected to grow around 11% CAGR by management's conservative estimates.\n\n/2. Intel has repeatedly failed to prove that their foundry division's predictions are unreliable. If they went fabless like AMD, it would have probably rocketed already. But a big part of the cheapness of the stock comes from the unreliability of their foundry division. Yes, the management has finally started getting serious about their foundry, but one cannot ignore their past failures.\n\n/3. Government contracts and the likes are not completely free money like some of you believe, delays in delivery and contract fulfillment could make what is essentially a free money glitch to a costly mistake and a billion dollar loss with a brink of an eye. The terms are generally very strict, so Intel has to deliver.\n\n/4. Investments are going to be a lot and semiconductor industry being cyclical means, if Intel fails to deliver, its market share will be eaten away and lose billions in potential profit.\n\n/5. Stock seems to be largely rangebound like Microsoft was for 15 years.",

Are you a despondent PLTR investor but a believer in Palantir to only start investing above $25 (lol)? This might be the opportunity for you! \ud83d\ude80 $RocketLab (US National Asset) has it\u2019s launch window opening today! Overall launch window ranges from the 11th-24th of this month with possible launch imminent around 8:30pm West Coast or 11:30 pm East Coast Time. What the fuck does this have to do with Palantir? Well here comes BlackSky.. not only can you invest cheaper than that fucking Maven Alex Karp that we all love and drastically hate, \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude09 ($BKSY current price $9.96 he bought $8 million at $10.00 \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb) but Palantir is the actual Metaverse\u2026 not joining with Facebook\ud83e\udd21 (I\u2019ll never say Schmeta) and not even Zucky McRobotFace knows this\u2026 but with Blacksky\u2026who serves to create near real time geospatial intelligence for its select customer base (National Reconnaissance  Office             \n\ud83d\udc41\ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udc41 and other benevolent 3 letter agencies) plus varying vetted public customers.

BlackSky is one of those steps to success\u2026 Seeking to NETwork the SKY, Palantir and BlackSky have partnered together to put the Gotham program in space\u2026 That\u2019s right this SkyNet will be powered by Palantir\u2019s incredible data analytics and fusion programs, with BlackSky\u2019s networked near real time global monitoring capability through it\u2019s satellite constellation\u2026.. \ud83d\ude80    \ud83d\ude80     \ud83d\ude80 Forget about the Schmetaverse with Facebook, that\u2019s for holding your fake boyfriend\u2019s fake dong in a fake world\u2026 Palantir is creating the metaverse in REAL TIME to protect Western interests and to annihilate anyone that even curls a lip in our direction\u2026 Sensor Fusion (Metaverse) is the future..Today is one small step for Man and another big step to killing people and tracking the idiots who show up at their funeral\u2019s more efficiently..

A positive outlook from semiconductor giant Qualcomm contributed to evidence that the industry's squeeze is lessening. Short-maturity Treasury yields fell as global investors reviewed the future for monetary policy after the Bank of England defied expectations by leaving interest rates unchanged.\n* The decision came after weeks of speculation that the BoE would be the first major central bank to boost borrowing costs since the pandemic began. It also occurred a day after Fed's Powell announced the beginning of a pullback in asset purchases while indicating policymakers may be patient with rises. Interest-rate futures contracts, which had priced in two quarter-point increases in 2022, pushed the second one into 2023.\n* \"We thought the amount of market pricing for Fed hikes really around the middle of next year was very full, and that should come down,\" said Mark Cabana, head of US rates strategy at Bank of America Global Research.\n* Saudi oil output will top 10 million barrels per day for the first time since the pandemic, according to al Arabiya TV.\n* OPEC+ decides to ease cuts by 400k in December - sources.\n* JMMC supports no change to OPEC policy of easing cuts by 400k bpd - sources WTI weakened\n* Traders push out the first 15bps BoE hike to February, and see 1% in September.\n* BoE Gov.

        "selftext": "Hi Guys,\n\nOver the last few years I've been investing relatively successfully and getting some good returns.\n\nDuring the same time period my dad has inherited some money and has not done a lot with it. He's maxed out his premium bonds (we're UK based) and the rest of the money is in various bank accounts but it's not returning anything due to low interest rates etc. I've mentioned to him on several occasions that he needs to speak to a FA but he's been resistant. Mainly because he's quite risk adverse and doesn't trust people he doesn't know with his money.\n\nMy wife mentioned to him the other day that some of my recent investments have done quite well. When he found out he got quite excited at the idea of investing some money with me telling him what to invest in. I guess he trusts me more than an external financial advisor. \n\nMy investment style is very much buy in to things I'm confident about and don't check the value very often. The reason being that if it's gone down I'll worry and be tempted to sell and if it's gone up then I'll also be tempted to sell.  This works pretty well for me and ultimately if I lose money, it's my money. I never take money from anything that could affect anything shared between my wife and I.\n\nThe problem now is that I feel pressured by investing someone else's money. I know my dad is going to check the prices frequently. \n\nHas anyone else done something like this? How do you deal with it? \n\nMy strategy is going to be to invest in \"safer\" investments. Things like V, MSFT, SPY, QQQ. Any suggestions for me to investigate and potentially invest in are always welcome as well.",

        "selftext": "US Market Wrap - Financial Juice\n\n* After corporate earnings, good hiring data, and a covid treatment breakthrough boosted optimism in the world's largest economy, US equities crept higher, with the S&amp;P 500 recording its longest winning run since 2017. The value of the dollar and treasuries decreased.\n* For the eighth session in a row, the S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.1% powered by energy producers and materials, as investors flocked into firms that profit the most from a healthy economy. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 plummeted, weighed down by Tesla Inc.'s 4.9% drop after Elon Musk asked his Twitter followers if he should sell 10% of his stock, to which they responded positively.\n* Last week's news flow, which included the passing of a $550 billion infrastructure bill, washed away concerns that high inflation and the Federal Reserve's intention to reduce asset purchases would disrupt economy. The results of Pfizer Inc.'s viral therapy, as well as the easing of US travel restrictions, have fueled anticipation that corporations will continue to report excellent earnings.\n* However, the recent rate of increases may make it difficult for stocks to move much higher in the absence of a new trigger.\n* On Wednesday, markets will be watching a measure of US consumer pricing intently after advances in US payrolls last week revealed an increase in average hourly earnings.\n* Oil fell to $82 a barrel in New York after the United States suggested it may reveal measures to lower oil and gasoline costs as soon as this week. Meanwhile, European gas and power costs have risen on fears that Russia may not fulfill the supply boost promised by Putin.\n* In Europe, the Stoxx 600 remained almost unchanged.\n\n# SPY Recap - Nov. 8SPY - Nov. 8 - Analysis\n\n* *Support - 468.99 - 467.29*\n* *\ud83d\udd0e resistance - 470.68*\n* *\ud83d\udc02 \ud83c\udfaf - 473.54 - 476.08*\n* *\ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udfaf - 465.26 - 463.61 - 462.01*\n* *\ud83d\udc02 in charge above 20 SMMA*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hpywp33vtgy71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18e7ce973f297b262c46dd256078a16819786c0c\n\n## SPY - Nov. 5 - Price Action\n\n* *Open: 469.70*\n* *High: 470.22*\n* *Low: 468.20*\n* *Close: 468.93*\n* *Volume: 46,571,832*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qtmrrbdytgy71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddc7a638d69702c71430acf377663007a2d32a55\n\n# SPY - Nov. 9 - Analysis\n\n## Options Data\n\n* Put Volume Total: 1,990,534\n* Call Volume Total: 1,741,604\n* Put/Call Volume Ratio: 1.14\n* Put Open Interest Total: 13,343,120\n* Call Open Interest Total: 6,655,094\n* Put/Call Open Interest Ratio: 2.00\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/006bcy80ugy71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee5e8f4c5d92906404d07af55b11b8c36988902a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9uuvcp41ugy71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=935e6fa8384567bfa2e3649446497ead740de19c\n\n## Technical Analysis - 65 min.\n\n* Support - 468.99 - 467.29\n* \ud83d\udd0e resistance - 470.68\n* \ud83d\udc02 \ud83c\udfaf - 473.54 - 476.08\n* \ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udfaf - 465.26 - 463.61 - 462.01\n* \ud83d\udc02 in charge above 20 SMMA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/epjcx0u4ugy71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c83df4bc39681477497969ee59986a5e03a4281a\n\n## RSI - 65 min.\n\n* Above 50\n* Continued downtrend from Nov. 5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/58mnsmj6ugy71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bf1e2a015e37fabde2255574c172b564aad568d\n\n# MACD - 65 min.\n\n* Cross extension\n* Broke uptrend from Oct. 28\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yjss4r88ugy71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbc3c97c771566fe89ea7488d6b1acd8136c7f06\n\n## SPY v Vix - 65 min.\n\n* 17.22+0.74 (+4.49%)\n* \ud83d\udc02 want VIX under 16.28\n* \ud83d\udc3b want VIX 17.79+\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pjbffvz9ugy71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbc502d4e95ca563b6b483c2228f9178658a53c6\n\n## Need to Know Market Risk - Financial Juice\n\n* Fed's Evans: By the spring, we will know a lot more about the inflation picture.\n* Fed's Harker: I does not expect the Federal Funds Rate to rise before the Fed's bond tapering is completed.\n* Euronext to ditch London stock exchange for clearing by 2024.\n* Fed's Clarida: By the end of 2022, I expect a full recovery to pre-pandemic employment levels, with the unemployment rate at 3.8% and participation growing.\n\n# Positions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4e5g173eugy71.png?width=840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f70651b0aba8496030de82c750521bbee20c200\n\nThanks for reading,\n\n\ud83c\udf1dNightMan",

In previous years we have seen significant trading volatility in the lead up to drilling and whilst waiting for results.\n\nWe like to invest in 88E well before the wild speculation that can accompany each drilling season, and we have a position in 88E now, and are looking forward to Merlin-2.\n\n88E has acreage across a number of projects in the North Slope of Alaska, home to some of the largest oil fields in the US, including Prudhoe Bay - the largest onshore oil field in North America, having produced over 12 billion barrels of oil since discovery.\n\nRecently on the North Slope the \u201cBrookian sequence\u201d was discovered - unlocking the Pikka discovery - 1.4 billion barrels, and also Willow - a 750 million barrel discovery by oil major ConocoPhillips.\n\n88E\u2019s Project Peregrine is on trend to ConocoPhilip\u2019s Willow discovery to the north, and is in the same play type.\n\n88E drilled Merin-1 on its Project Peregrine earlier this year, targeting an oil discovery of its own. Whilst there were some operational issues that prevented full sampling, Merlin-1 was a success, detecting light oil across three reservoir intervals.\n\n88E\u2019s \u201csequel well\u201d Merlin-2 follows on from Merlin-1 - this [recently released video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxg2fxPLG-k) gives a good background to the project, its potential, and the plan for Merlin-2 in glorious 3D animation.\n\n**88E\u2019s Merlin-2 well is targeting 652 million barrels with a geological chance of success of 56%.**\n\n**News last week was that 88E\u2019s drill rig has been contracted - another step in the journey towards the spudding of the Merlin-2 well.**\n\n88 Energy[ASX:88E, ](https://www.nextoilrush.com/company/88e/)AIM:88E\n\nWe have followed 88E every step of the way in its Alaskan exploration journey started in 2014 - and every year it manages to fund and drill an oil well with company making potential.\n\nGenerally each time 88E drills a well, there is significant market speculation on the outcome of the drilling. Earlier in the year we saw speculators spike 88E up from 0.9c to as high as 9.4c in the space of a few days, largely driven by a new US retail following in the stock. Prior to the well drill earlier this year, 88E started trading in the US under the ticker **OTC: EEENF** and caught their attention.\n\nThe trading volatility that we witnessed in the lead up to the Merlin-1 well result burnt a few traders and new investors chasing the spike - however long term investors who took a position prior to March 2021 would be very happy with 88E\u2019s performance, as the price is still up about 450% higher than where it sat for most of 2020.\n\nWhat\u2019s different to last year?\n\n**88E has a better balance sheet \u2705**\n\n88E is in a much better funding position than the Merlin-1 well last year, with A$36M in the bank and no debt. This comes after 88E recently raised $23.96M at 2.8c - which is around the same share price as 88E is trading at the moment.\n\nThe strong balance sheet means 88E has flexibility in how it pays for the Merlin-2 drilling - it can drill it alone and retain 100% of the working interest of the outcome, OR, if the right strategic partner comes along that wants to get exposure to the outcome of the drilling event, it could look to farm down a stake in exchange for the partner covering a share of the well costs. 88E didn\u2019t have this financial flexibility last year.\n\n**88E already found oil in Merlin-1 \u2705**\n\nMerlin-2 is an \u201cappraisal\u201d well - taking all of the valuable learnings of what was found at Merlin-1 and applying that information to select the best location for Merlin-2 to hopefully confirm an oil discovery.\n\nThe Merlin-1 well successfully demonstrated the presence of oil in the N20, N19, and N18 reservoir intervals.\n\nMerlin-1 found 41 feet of net log pay across those three reservoir intervals, and geochemical analysis determined that the oil had an estimated API gravity between mid-30 and low-40 (light oil).\n\n**New well location for Merlin-2 - expecting thicker and higher quality reservoirs \u2705**\n\nArmed with all the precious data gathered at Merlin-1, 88E is going to try and drill again through those three reservoir intervals hit on Merlin-1, but this time 88E is going to move the drilling location to the east - **where the formation is proven to thicken and be of a better quality** \\- so hopefully it can intersect greater net pay.\n\n**Three well locations have been prioritised - and final well location selection is expected to occur shortly.**\n\nWhat\u2019s happening next?\n\n**Drill Planning and Permitting**\n\nWith the rig now contracted, 88E is currently going through the process of planning and permitting its Merlin-2 well.\n\nThere is a window of time in Alaska over winter when wells of this nature can be drilled - this is when the ice roads allow for the transport of heavy machinery. Once the ice roads melt, the drilling season is over.\n\n**That\u2019s why 88E are planning on drilling in February 2022 - just in time, and only a few months away now.**\n\n**Strategic Farm in Partner?**\n\nThis might happen - as we said above, 88E has some flexibility here and does not depend on securing a partner for the cost of the well.\n\nBUT if the right strategic partner came along... one that perhaps could add technical value as well... and the price was right... we assume 88E management would consider a deal.\n\n**Precise Merlin-2 Well Location to be confirmed**\n\nAs we pointed out above, 88E has three locations that are in the short list for the location of Merlin-2 - we expect this to be 100% locked in soon.\n\nProject Peregrine (Main Bet #1)\n\n**Project Overview**\n\n**\u2705** [**Acquired Project Peregrine**](https://www.nextoilrush.com/more-shots-goal-ahead-88e-reveals-next-multi-billion-barrel-oil-opportunity/)  \n**\u2705** [**Farmout Agreement Secured**](https://www.nextoilrush.com/88e-confirms-farm-partner-stage-set-february-2021-drilling-event/)  \n**\u2705** [**Buy back of 100% of Project Peregrine from APDC**](https://www.nextoilrush.com/88e-back-100-ownership-16-billion-barrel-project/)  \n\ud83d\udd32 Potential Farmout Peregrine to new partner  \n\ud83d\udd32 Planning for a possible in-fill 2D or 3D seismic\n\n**Merlin-2**\n\n**\u2705 Drill Rig Contracted**  \n\ud83d\udd04 Drilling Permits Secured  \n\ud83d\udd32 Drill Rig Mobilised to Site  \n\ud83d\udd32 Drilling Commenced \\[Q1 2022\\]  \n\ud83d\udd32 Drilling Complete  \n\ud83d\udd32 Lab Results 1  \n\ud83d\udd32 Lab Results 2  \n\ud83d\udd32 Lab Results 3\n\nInvestment Milestones\n\n**1st Key Drilling Event - Feb 2021**\n\n**\u2705 Initial Investment:** u/0\\*\\*.5c (\u22489 months before key drilling event)\\*\\*  \n**\u2705 Increase Investment:** u/0\\*\\*.6c (\u22486 months before key drilling event)\\*\\*  \n**\u2705 Price increases 500% from initial entry**  \n**\u2705 Price increases 1000% from initial entry**  \n\ud83d\udd32 Price increases 2000% from initial entry  \n**\u2705 Free Carry (days before key drilling event)**  \n**\u2705 Take Some Profit (days before key drilling event)**  \n**\u2705 Hold position for key drilling event**  \n**\u2705 Decide New Investment Plan after results of key drilling event**\n\n**2nd Key Drilling Event - Q1 2022**\n\n**\u2705 Increase Investment:** u/2\\*\\*.5c (\u22489 months before key drilling event)\\*\\*  \n\ud83d\udd32 Increase Investment  \n\ud83d\udd32 Increase Investment  \n\ud83d\udd32 Price increases 200% from investment  \n\ud83d\udd32 Price increases 400% from investment  \n\ud83d\udd32 Price increases 600% from initial entry  \n\ud83d\udd32 Free Carry (days before key drilling event)  \n\ud83d\udd32 Take Some Profit (days before key drilling event)  \n\ud83d\udd32 Hold position for key drilling event  \n\ud83d\udd32 Decide New Investment Plan after results of key drilling event\n\n**Disclosure**: The authors of this article and owners of Next Investors, S3 Consortium Pty Ltd, and associated entities, own 6,645,000 88E shares.",

The dollar increased.\n* While stock prices are approaching all-time highs, bolstered by strong earnings, a viral comeback may halt the economic recovery at a time when inflation is at an all-time high.\n* Austria was the first country in Western Europe to adopt sweeping restrictions. Non-essential businesses were also closed in areas of Germany, and the Netherlands had previously ordered shops and bars to close early.\n* Biden's centrepiece plan to extend the social safety net, confront climate change, and reform tax policies passed the House of Representatives on Friday morning, with House Rep. Speaker Pelosi uniting divided Democrats to send the bill to the Senate, where its fate remains uncertain.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4kgv9zvxks081.png?width=1405&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f58461e0bebc1049ec60ceefb37b144b3cf6cf0a\n\n[\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I SPY TA - Friday Nov. 19, 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qx5332/i_spy_ta_friday_nov_19_2021/)\n\n# SPY - SPY Recap - Nov. 19\n\n## Price Action\n\n* *Open: 469.61*\n* *High:* 470.94\n* *Low: 468.51*\n* *Close: 468.86*\n* *Volume: 51,165,359*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uemnaj4cls081.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c24b9d3eea56b2f1d7e75155290ef29c36ecbe75\n\n# SPY - Nov. 22 - Analysis\n\n## Options Data \n\n*Volume totals reflect options traded during the current session (11/19)*\n\n* Put Volume Total: 2,062,262\n* Call Volume Total: 1,504,125\n* Put/Call Volume Ratio: 1.37\n* Put Open Interest Total: 14,345,570\n* Call Open Interest Total: 7,265,739\n* Put/Call Open Interest Ratio: 1.97\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u4nxcwcfls081.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5d2c393f1c195cedeb6876e4134152bdd5d08a2\n\n* V: 13.62\n* Dvol: 0.86\n* 465.07 - 473.11\n* Key 473\n* Crossover: 468\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4d2rffghls081.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=465c0deb130212ebbc41098a488a1f7b7d2a5fb5\n\n# Technical Analysis - 30 min.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e2clo0qjls081.png?width=891&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24f98c079ffd195cab03e6b34c842f096c904c29\n\n* Support : 467.76\n* Pivot: 468.86 (Current Support)\n* Resistance - 471 - 470.49\n* Bullish Targets: 472.35 - 474.68\n* Bearish Targets: 466.67 - 464.21 - 463\n* Consolidating around 20 SMMA\n* Near bottom of uptrend support\n* Bulls not being able to find support above 471 is concerning\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ipejpkhlls081.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb9650f67c620015cc7ac4e298b96892e55ce3a8\n\n## RSI - 65 min. \n\n* Essentially consolidating since Nov. 17\n* Look for a 60.60 break for ATH\n* Look for 45.35 break for more downside\n* Neutral\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t1zxglgnls081.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66e2f632c583c813602ef073ec5e42fc90d54281\n\n## MACD - 65 min.\n\n* Consolidated\n* Bearish cross\n* Slight advantage to bears\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyvoknfpls081.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbbc91a39c035519a72a34342c4ffd22c7b4f19c\n\n## DMI - 1 day\n\n* Uptrend slightly weakened from Nov. 5\n* Bulls like to see +Di (blue) to 36.2367 - 41.9097\n* Bears like to see -DI (orange) to 21.649+\n* Advantage to bulls until -DI (orange) crosses 21.649\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/na75g8arls081.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58fc73c35f6f8859a15321b89ebb3c6b369faf51\n\n# SPY -  Jan. 21, 2022 - 65 min. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/glysb7vuls081.png?width=889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d981e0dfd078ddf4d109c4949e6cea5e383c2f6e\n\n* Support: 462.53\n* Resistance: 470.59 \n* Bullish Target: 481.57 - 490.73 - 496.85 - 503.51\n* Bearish Targets: 453.85 - 448.56 - 437.23  - 429.83\n* About 6 touches since Nov. 5 @ 470.59 ish (R1)\n* At median of parallel channel \n* If bulls can establish support above R1 I believe we can see 481.57 - 490.73 before Jan. 21 exp. \n* I will begin to worry about a downturn if we cross 462.53. \n   * If 462.53 breaks I\u2019m looking for a bottom at 453.85 - 448.56\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7rdg19bxls081.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac946d9104eceafd86b29cdc8a79fab9584cba4c\n\n## Need to Know Market Risk - Financial Juice\n\n* WH Press Sec.

Target Corp. fell after warning that cost pressures are increasing, fueling fears that inflation may eat into retailer profitability. The NASDAQ 100, which is heavy on technology, beat key indexes, spurred by a rally in tech titans Apple and Tesla.\n* According to GS' CEO Solomon markets may face a rough period as the economy attempts to recover from the rapid impact of the epidemic. If interest rates rise, it will \"take some of the euphorias out of some markets,\" he said in an interview at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore.\n* The worst quarter for the S&amp;P 500 since the pandemic appears to have scared off some do-it-yourself investors. According to the SEC and market data compiled by major newswire Intelligence, the retail trading surge that began with lockdowns has now subsided, with total equity volume from individual investors falling to 19% in the third quarter, down from 24% at the start of the year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ju2yrnews8081.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c11ad4f01ef9a8c4b9560a2c0bdfb74d60383c47\n\n[\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I SPY TA - Wednesday Nov. 17, 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qvmaho/i_spy_ta_wednesday_nov_17_2021/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n# SPY Recap - Nov. 17\n\n* *Micro support - 468.94*\n* *Micro resistance - 470.58*\n* *Bullish targets - 471.34 - 472.99 - 474.33*\n* *Bearish targets - 467.61 - 466.66 - 465.60 - 463.78*\n* *2nd support at 465*\n* *Support at 20 SMMA*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nszakdj1t8081.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0f92ed12ac0aa25f4efa14f7a9b2e5318c93165\n\n# SPY - Nov. 17 - Price Action\n\n* *Open:* 469.00\n* *High:* 469.19 \n* *Low:* 467.48\n* *Close:* 468.14 \n* *Volume: 46,208,252*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s7yjcen3t8081.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=742c3dafca38527e665fab9005bd83648362048a\n\n# SPY - Nov. 18 - Analysis\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uzscpoi7t8081.png?width=1414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f52360100d4c01732637719bbcd2e65d69424992\n\n## Options Data\n\n*Volume totals reflect options traded during the current session (11/17)*\n\n* Put Volume Total: 1,886,197\n* Call Volume Total: 1,775,665\n* Put/Call Volume Ratio: 1.06\n* Put Open Interest Total: 13,817,319\n* Call Open Interest Total: 7,070,888\n* Put/Call Open Interest Ratio: 1.95\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jx57x3f9t8081.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99cf328f4fa5b5657df4f0d11002bf054ec8f6c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lefyqxwat8081.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e493d8ec301238980707f6e441f7e264b9b6cb80\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qyvrbowbt8081.png?width=1188&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd230f5c9e3aa94e965d339046bf43a4bbb1b99a\n\n## Technical Analysis - 65 min.\n\n* Micro support - 467.50\n* Micro resistance - 469.10\n* Bullish targets - 470.49 - 471.34 - 472.99\n* Bearish targets - 466.68 - 465.60 - 463.78\n* Major support at 465\n* Consolidation around 20 SMMA\n* Best case for bulls is we gap above 469.10\n* Best case for bears is gap below 467.50\n\nNotes: \n\n* Bought these near end of day and expecting small AM pop tomorrow.\n* Currently losing on 468c 11/19 - will trim at 469.10 and let ride to bullish targets.

        "selftext": "***Summary:***\n\nYesterday, the stock price for Chegg ($CHGG) dropped \\~50% due to comments by the CEO that are blown out of proportion and an unfounded lawsuit by Pearson. The financials for the company are still good and although this may be minorly affected by falling enrollment numbers and the reintroduction of in-person classes, it is unlikely the subscriptions would decline enough to warrant the current price swing. Additionally, the lawsuit made by Pearson is unlikely to succeed. However, with laws being up for interpretation, we will be forced to wait for the outcome of the case to fully know the effects it will have on Chegg. At the company's current price it is evident that there are inefficiencies in the current market surrounding it.\n\n**Chegg's Products:**\n\nChegg sells a myriad of products including textbooks, exam prep, and solutions to questions asked by students. The solutions they sell are a key part of their business model. While it allows students to cheat, it is a Q&amp;A-type service and is legal to operate. It is also a key part of the lawsuit where Pearson alleges that Chegg infringes on their copyright due to this. The Q&amp;A service is a major part of their business model and while it did decrease by nearly 500,000 subscribers between Q2 and Q3 it is still nearly double what it was in Q3 2019 (2,214,000 v. 4,394,000). While we did also see the number of textbooks sold drop it is within the standard range of it has stayed in for the past 2 years.\n\n**Pearson v. Chegg:**\n\nAs mentioned previously, Chegg is being sued by Pearson for copyright infringement due to the answers they provide to students derived from Pearson's textbook questions. To put it simply the case is a long shot because most answers provided are from users themselves and not the work of Pearson. Most of the questions asked are simple and replicated in multiple textbooks. While there is no claim directly for the answers it could have merit under what is called a \"derivative work\". A \"derivative work\" is the production of material based on the copyrighted work of a different entity (which in this case would be the questions asked by Pearson). A \"derivative work\" can infringe on the copyright of the original work, however, I do not believe it applies because the questions asked by Pearson are common and commonly asked questions are not copyrightable ( ***\u00a7 102. Subject matter of copyright: In general*** ). The only way I see them winning is if they prove the exact phrasing of the questions was used (relevant only for long written questions) otherwise the case is as good as dead.\n\n**The Comments by the CEO:**\n\nWhile the CEO of Chegg has said they expect further drops in subscription and textbook sales due to dropping enrollment numbers and the reopening of schools it is blown out of proportion. It is likely the number of sales will drop but it will likely stay at or just below the amount it saw before the pandemic began. This corresponds to the company being valued at around $40 if it does stay at that rate due to the increased reliance on the software from students. In essence, the CEO wanted to foreshadow the decrease in sales which resulted in an overselling of stock.\n\n**Financials:**\n\nOn paper, the financials for Chegg are decreasing at an alarming rate but we need to look deeper. Subscriptions are up YTD approximately 20%, however, the sale of required materials is down nearly 26% in that same period. Required materials are a synonym for textbooks and it is alarming that it has fallen at such a rate I believe the rate is this way not because of decreasing enrollment (because the difference wouldn't make sense) but due to eTextbooks and piracy. Why pay for physical textbooks when you're online? Why not use libgen to pirate it? So in this case we could see some rebound for required materials as students go back to in-person learning. The major financial hit could be in subscription sales if the lawsuit succeeds because it is where they garner most of their revenue. As stated I don't believe the suit has merit. The financials are dropping relative to their environment which is natural but I believe once we go back to some semblance of normalcy in education it will lead to it leveling out or even a slight increase relative to where it was before the pandemic.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nChegg is a risky play with many variables but I believe it will succeed in rebounding to somewhere in the \\~$45 range due to past valuations. The lawsuit could take out their main form of revenue and if their sales number of required materials doesn't increase it would lead to a devastating effect on their stock price. If the lawsuit fails and their required materials revenue increases it is in a ripe position to garner profits for those who buy it at such a low price.\n\nSources:\n\n\\[1\\] [https://s21.q4cdn.com/596622263/files/doc\\_financials/2021/q3/Financial-Results-Q3-2021-FINAL.pdf](https://s21.q4cdn.com/596622263/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Financial-Results-Q3-2021-FINAL.pdf)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://s21.q4cdn.com/596622263/files/doc\\_financials/2021/q3/Q3'21-IR-Data-Sheet-FINAL.pdf](https://s21.q4cdn.com/596622263/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Q3'21-IR-Data-Sheet-FINAL.pdf)\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a registered financial advisor and I do have a small position in Chegg (3 shares @ $33.40).

Previously, the app required users to be at least 18 years old, like rival Venmo. The company says younger teens will need to get a parent or guardian to authorize their account, but can then begin to send peer-to-peer payments and take delivery of a customized Cash Card, powered by Visa.\n\nIn addition, teens will be able to send and receive peer-to-peer payments with family and friends, or anyone else on Cash App\u2019s network of over 40 million monthly active users.  Other features also mirror the existing version of Cash App, including access to spending rewards at top retailers, ATM access with a $2 fee, and support for paycheck direct deposit.\n\nThis is a good news for square as more people can use cash app. As it competing with venmo, this first move will provide square the opportunity to increase the users loyalty to cash app. Square is still growing revenue at a fast pace and the best fintech stock to own for the next decade.",

EV/Rev multiple: 9.9x (2021)\n* eToro has a first mover advantage in the international market.\n* eToro trades at a deep discount to peers\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lfwgz8guu6181.jpg?width=1111&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d560acd47a83adf62fcfc013c40bb87fab22601\n\n**Merger**:\n\nOn  March 16th, 2021, eToro struck a deal to bring the company public  through Betsy Cohen\u2019s FinTech Acquisition Corp V (ticker: FTCV) in Q4  2021. FTCV filed their fifth F-4/A last week, so -- if history is any indicator -- a merger vote date can be expected soon.\n\neToro will have an estimated equity value of $10.4B at closing.  The transaction of $9.6B includes $250M in gross proceeds from FTCV\u2019s  cash trust and $650M from a fully committed PIPE at $10 per share.\n\n**Platform:**\n\neToro  is one of the world\u2019s leading (and most undervalued) social trading and  investment platforms. Like SoFi, Robinhood, and Coinbase, eToro  provides access to:\n\n* stocks\n* index funds\n* forex\n* cryptocurrencies\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ygbf0ov2v6181.png?width=1136&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f940694b0f10aa981c62da70536e05d686abf191\n\n**Global**:\n\nOne  difference between eToro and its competition is its global reach. eToro  has an ex-US focus with users in 140 countries. It\u2019s a well-known  global brand with 69% of funded accounts originating in Europe and 18%  in Asia/Pacific. There are currently 24.8m total registered users on the  platform.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iuuhpe6wu6181.png?width=1136&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1816b9ca6bb9f351b52f900313630ccd84665138\n\n**Features:**\n\nThe following unique platform features distinguish eToro:\n\n* Stocks - Beginning Dec 1st, American investors can also invest in stocks on eToro (beta testing)\n* Crypto - Traders can build a diversified portfolio with 17 popular coins.\n* DeFi - eToro's DeFi portfolio offers eleven DeFi crypto-assets, including Ether (ETH) and Uniswap (UNI).\n* Copy trading - Investors can mirror the moves of popular investors and utilize that expertise to their advantage.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n0c6v1e4v6181.png?width=1136&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05b0f1a2c3b541f6d19e4469e64ad7f9003292bc\n\n**Financials**: \n\neToro recently released Q3 2021 earnings. Financial highlights include:\n\n* $222M revenue in Q3 2021 and reaffirmed guidance.\n* Net trading income of $176 million, up 56% versus Q3 2020\n* 2.14 million funded accounts as of September 30, 2021, up 152% compared with September 30, 2020\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dv5lp0e7v6181.png?width=1136&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2be5aaadef399b724dd03b6513df72260eba5e7d\n\n**Revenue model**:\n\neToro  earns revenue through both trading and non-trading fees. In addition,  they operate as a market maker, meaning eToro\u2019s exposure to users\u2019  trades is hedged.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j0v7fvk8v6181.png?width=1136&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25efc168b6d5192ababcd695116a13826ec1dd71\n\n**Competition**:\n\nHere\u2019s how eToro matches up against its peers using street projections sourced from atom.finance:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4dd1vwwbv6181.png?width=1008&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6c6dcbd306bb155344521834a92c80ebb196943\n\n**Comps:**\n\n**1. SoFi (Social Finance) \u2014 $SOFI .**  Sofi is a fintech platform with a suite of features including zero  commission investing. SoFi\u2019s current valuation: $18.55B. EV/Rev  multiples: 22.1x (2021E) and 10.3x (2023E).\n\neToro  comp: Applying SOFI\u2019s forward multiples to eToro implies a share price  range of $15.41-$21.39. With FTCV trading at $10.40, this yields a  potential upside of 47-104%.\n\n**2. Robinhood \u2014 $HOOD.**  Made infamous during the \u201cmeme stock\u201d craze of January 2021, Robinhood  offers zero commission stock and cryptocurrency trading. RH\u2019s current  valuation: $23.87B. EV/Rev multiples: 13.1x (2021E) and 7.6x (2023E).\n\neToro  comp: Applying HOOD\u2019s forward multiples to eToro implies a share price  range of $11.56-$12.98. With FTCV trading at $10.40, this yields an  increase of 10-24%.\n\n**3. Coinbase -- $COIN.**  An eToro peer, Coinbase is one of the most popular and widely used  cryptocurrency platforms, offering an easy platform for people to invest  in crypto. CB\u2019s current valuation: $70B. EV/Rev multiples: 10.1x  (2021E) and 9.6x (2023E).\n\neToro  comp: Applying COIN\u2019s forward multiples to eToro implies a share price  range of $10.17-14.41. With FTCV trading at $10.40, this yields an  increase of -3-38%.\n\n**4. Bakkt \u2014 $BKKT.**  Bakkt allows users to purchase crypto and convert rewards points into  cash. Bakkt has agreements with Starbucks, Google and Mastercard.  Bakkt\u2019s current valuation: $5.35B. EV/Rev multiples: 97.2x (2021E) and  15.0x (2023E).\n\neToro comp:  Applying BKKT\u2019s 2023E forward multiple to eToro implies a share price of  $22.07. With FTCV trading at $10.40, this yields an increase of 111%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ai01sndv6181.png?width=549&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e8f0bb8fa84f328603b0847707a33c8d64720d6\n\nIn  short, eToro is a full-service, EBITDA-positive investment platform  generating greater revenue than SoFi, yet trading at half the valuation.  Largely under the radar due to its more limited presence in the U.S.,  eToro trades at a significant discount to peers and offers incredible  value in both the short- and long-term.\n\n**Disclosure:** Long FTCV shares + warrants + options.",

        "selftext": " \n\nI like the stock...and I did a test drive and review of the car. As well, I discuss the upcoming merger. Either way, the company is planned to go public sometime in the first half of 2022, no date yet confirmed. The company is seeking to compete in the EV market, and has a leg up on some of its competitors, in that it already has vehicles in production, and delivery of over 10,000 vehicles. The car itself isn't very fancy in terms of features, but it is pretty basic and offers what you would want from a very standard EV at this price point. I am concerned they may not be very popular, but it seems they are the talk of the EV town at the moment. What are your thoughts? Have ya'll given any thought to this company and its future potential?\n\nFeel free to check out my vid review.\n\n[Polestar 2 Review | Test Drive | Merger Discussions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIF7ztdJi4Q&amp;t=385s&amp;ab_channel=HossTalksStocks)\n\nAlso, many people say hydrogen power is years down the road, but we already have a company that is delivering vehicles, but mostly for commercial spaces and heavy trucking. Have ya'll heard of Hyzon? I am seriously taking a good look at this company, as they already are delivering and have been working on their tech for almost 20 years. I think this could be a very exciting time, and give other companies a run for their money.

        "selftext": "Dear boys,\n\nThis is a simple PSA. Stay away from small-cap venture stocks if you like money. Although my old finance professor told me that 9/10 companies on the TSX venture exchange will go to 0, I decided to test this theory and invest a *very* small amount of capital in a couple of TSX-V companies back in February 2021 to see what would happen. Below are the results:\n\nCloudMD Software: -50%\n\nGreenlane Renewables: -30%\n\nMission Ready Solutions: -68%\n\nKraken Robotics: -45%\n\nEvidently, not strong returns. Although these might be successful long-term holds with upside potential, a new investor would not realize that and take the losses rather than hold the bag for 5-10 years. Key takeaway? Just buy VFV; best returns, least amount of effort.",

(PPGH) that sets Gogoro's enterprise value at $2.35 billion; upon closing, the combined company will list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol \"GGR.\"\n\nThe business combination is expected to provide approximately $550 million in proceeds (assuming no redemptions) to Gogoro's balance sheet including an oversubscribed PIPE of over $250 million as well as $345 million currently held in trust by Poema Global.\n\nThe PIPE is funded by strategic partners including Hon Hai (Foxconn) Technology Group and GoTo Group, the largest technology group in Indonesia, vehicle partners, and new and existing financial investors including Generation Investment Management, Taiwan's National Development Fund, Temasek as well as Gogoro's founding investor, Dr. Samuel Yin of Ruentex Group.\n\nUse of proceeds include expansion into China, India and Southeast Asia as well as continued research and development of Gogoro's leading battery swapping ecosystem and its smart, sustainable urban mobility solutions.\n\nThe transaction closing is targeted for the first quarter of 2022.  \n\n\n**About Gogogro -** Gogoro was founded ten years ago in Taiwan, which has the highest density of gas-powered scooters in the world. In 2015, Gogoro launched its first electric scooter, the Gogoro Smartscooter, which was tethered to a nationwide network of swappable battery stations in Gogoro's domestic market.\n\nGogoro owners pay a monthly subscription fee to access that network of over 2,000 GoStation kiosks, which supply charged batteries and eliminate the need for on-site charging. Gogoro's network handles approximately 250,000 battery swaps each day, and its batteries also power compatible electric scooters from partners like **Yamaha**, Hero MotoCorp, PGO, and eMOVING.  \n\n\n**Gogoro Network**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/norepw4e5y081.png?width=1300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b769d4b46734ade29e039b133bff122475f004b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Gogoro Network is a hyper-efficient battery swapping platform that was recognized by Frost &amp; Sullivan with the 2020 Company of the Year Award for the Global Swappable Battery Electric Scooter Market. With more than 375,000 riders and 2,055 battery swapping stations, Gogoro Network manages 265,000 daily battery swaps with more than 200 million total battery swaps to date.\n\nThe Gogoro Network is an open platform for battery swapping and smart mobility services, delivering a fresh alternative to legacy fuel. Gogoro Network combines the power of connectivity, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to create a new generation of swappable battery refueling that is smart, scalable and continually optimizing itself to be dynamic and versatile for people, communities and businesses. The Powered by Gogoro Network Program gives Gogoro's vehicle maker partners access to Gogoro innovations and intellectual property including its intelligent drivetrains and controllers, components and smart systems, so they can develop and roll-out unique electric vehicles that integrate Gogoro Network battery swapping.\n\nA key aspect to the Gogoro Network\u2019s success has been the company\u2019s ability to make use of the huge amount of data produced by the network. With hundreds of millions of battery swaps under its belt, Gogoro has fine-tuned the art of nationwide battery swap infrastructure. These small details have been critical to Gogoro\u2019s success. For example, the stations feature dynamic pricing that helps to reduce peak demand during rush hour by incentivizing swaps outside of heavy-use hours. Batteries are mostly naturally moved throughout the system by riders instead of by Gogoro employees needing to readjust battery inventory at stations. And the stations are even self-powered from the batteries so they don\u2019t go down during unexpected blackouts. In fact, the stations can be used to feed energy back into the grid during emergencies.\n\nIt\u2019s not just a box on the side of the road charging batteries. It\u2019s the culmination of years of research and implementation to fine tune the system in Taiwan before expanding it internationally.\n\nAnd now that system is finally going to be implemented in the countries that need it most \u2013 and the countries where it can have the largest impact. It\u2019s hard to overstate the gravity of this announcement.\n\n**Battery Tech**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ornhgdik5y081.png?width=1302&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0556e2e05474c4bf981d6b882703c55934ced3f0\n\nGogoro's new batteries offer a higher energy density in the same shell by utilizing Panasonic\u2019s new 2170 battery cells to replace the previous 18650 cells. Panasonic is also Tesla\u2019s battery manufacturing partner. The company\u2019s 2170 cells were first included in the Model 3, and may eventually make their way into the Model S and X.

According to a Biden administration official, the virtual summit, which begins at 7:45 p.m. on Monday night in Washington, will span many hours, including translation for both leaders in their third conversation this year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/55lcmiu2kuz71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e08d744cd67788f96e52bb627af99ce8b6c8766\n\n[\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I SPY, QQQ, IWM TA - Monday Nov. 15, 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qt3r2c/i_spy_ta_monday_nov_15_2021/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n# SPY Recap - Nov. 15\n\n* *\ud83d\udd0e support - 463.79*\n* *Pivot - 467.59*\n* *Resistance - 469.32 - 470.09*\n* *\ud83d\udc02 \ud83c\udfaf - 471.34 - 474.33 - 476.68*\n* *\ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udfaf - 461.96 - 460.64 - 459.65 - 456.75*\n* *Support at 20 SMMA*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1w505od7kuz71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da5dfd94ceafefe1011eb211903a55eee2a1ac01\n\n## SPY - Nov. 15 - Price Action\n\n* *Open: 468.64*\n* *High: 468.79*\n* *Low: 466.23*\n* *Close: 467.43*\n* *Volume: 41,714,621*\n\n*Processing img jnixe439kuz71...*\n\n# SPY - Nov. 16 - Analysis - Neutral\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3nqtnwwakuz71.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59d3e4dc19fba361a85da2457ad1ac2e1129d9f3\n\n## Options Data\n\n*Volume totals reflect options traded during the current session (11/15)*\n\n* Put Volume Total: 1,736,723\n* Call Volume Total: 1,817,586\n* Put/Call Volume Ratio: 0.96\n* Put Open Interest Total: 13,767,537\n* Call Open Interest Total: 7,029,826\n* Put/Call Open Interest Ratio: 1.96\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8wc110rckuz71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97ea15013266563ec25f77d8ce14a80f2b2649e2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ui0t5ldkuz71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b7c583ec12da74e6579e0f95c0f37680bbaf3a4\n\n## Technical Analysis - 65 min.\n\n* Support - 466.6 - 467.61\n* Resistance - 469.32 - 470.09\n* Bullish targets - 471.34 - 472.99 - 474.33\n* Bearish targets - 463.78 - 461.96 - 460.64 - 459.65\n* Support at 20 SMMA\n\nNotes:\n\n* OPEX on Friday, expecting volatile week\n* Bulls need to follow through for a complete reversal\n* 20 SMMA acting as support\n* I\u2019d like to see strikes above 470 increase\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f448b5gfkuz71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54c39bf4c3b03436627a21ff58f840f72b20cdc2\n\n## RSI - 65 min.\n\n* Above 50\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jd7zosygkuz71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd79455446870dcb5387b072c52eec57521c85e7\n\n## MACD - 65 min.\n\n* Bearish cross\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2lx325likuz71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdca5e8e3cda02535542165fe00983e7cccc11e4\n\n## VI - 65 min.\n\n* Consolidated\n* Momentum slightly favors bulls\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ky6u75ckkuz71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d95707253573d5dc3a001cc1e1ef66b62ed6c5e\n\n## SPY Long-term - 65 min. - Jan. 27, 2022\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bykq4c1mkuz71.png?width=1388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c2641fa47973e5edcf37b2091b1660d56bc4575\n\n* Major support - 462.57\n* Major resistance - 470.39\n* Bullish targets - 481.57 - 490.73 - 496.85 - 503.51\n* Bearish targets - 453.85 - 448.56 - 437.23 - 428.71\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y43t0ronkuz71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c93665fe205c1864589e59f25443ff51a5faefe8\n\n## SPY v VIX - 65 min. \n\n* Bears want VIX above 17.27\n* Bulls want VIX below 16.28\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t2xbmpepkuz71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b5c971c58cedfbfc3f09178834e0e2a4c40da45\n\n## Need to Know Market Risk - Financial Juice\n\n* Congressional budget office to release full cost estimate for 'build back better' plan by end of day on November 19th    \n* BoE's Saunders: The risk of postponing hiking rates for too long is that they will have to go up a little faster and further.\n* BoE Gov.

        "selftext": "# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice\n\n* After corporate earnings, good hiring data, and a covid treatment breakthrough boosted optimism in the world's largest economy, US equities crept higher, with the S&amp;P 500 recording its longest winning run since 2017. The value of the dollar and treasuries decreased.\n* For the eighth session in a row, the S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.1% powered by energy producers and materials, as investors flocked into firms that profit the most from a healthy economy. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 plummeted, weighed down by Tesla Inc.'s 4.9% drop after Elon Musk asked his Twitter followers if he should sell 10% of his stock, to which they responded positively.\n* Last week's news flow, which included the passing of a $550 billion infrastructure bill, washed away concerns that high inflation and the Federal Reserve's intention to reduce asset purchases would disrupt economy. The results of Pfizer Inc.'s viral therapy, as well as the easing of US travel restrictions, have fueled anticipation that corporations will continue to report excellent earnings.\n* However, the recent rate of increases may make it difficult for stocks to move much higher in the absence of a new trigger.\n* On Wednesday, markets will be watching a measure of US consumer pricing intently after advances in US payrolls last week revealed an increase in average hourly earnings.\n* Oil fell to $82 a barrel in New York after the United States suggested it may reveal measures to lower oil and gasoline costs as soon as this week. Meanwhile, European gas and power costs have risen on fears that Russia may not fulfill the supply boost promised by Putin.\n* In Europe, the Stoxx 600 remained almost unchanged.\n\n# SPY Recap - Nov. 8SPY - Nov. 8 - Analysis\n\n* Support - 468.99 - 467.29\n* Micro  resistance - 470.68\n* Bullish targets: - 473.54 - 476.08\n* Bearish targets - 465.26 - 463.61 - 462.01\n* Bulls in charge above 20 SMMA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kw4sbpl1vgy71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=368091a669a9c202e9ed1fee5a93aa8977e4f32d\n\n# SPY - Nov. 5 - Price Action\n\n* *Open: 469.70*\n* *High: 470.22*\n* *Low: 468.20*\n* *Close: 468.93*\n* *Volume: 46,571,832*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f9wl4hx3vgy71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88531c8f2076862a76904b7cdf7a35bf7db342ca\n\n# SPY - Nov. 9 - Analysis\n\n# Options Data\n\n* Put Volume Total: 1,990,534\n* Call Volume Total: 1,741,604\n* Put/Call Volume Ratio: 1.14\n* Put Open Interest Total: 13,343,120\n* Call Open Interest Total: 6,655,094\n* Put/Call Open Interest Ratio: 2.00\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fs0474q5vgy71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=910398aee4bd9fa0c39cf99a739fd56b3e12dbb4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/alagbym6vgy71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d41d566cbd105b99a6ce7a361514ea33a4973387\n\n# Technical Analysis - 65 min.\n\n* Support - 468.99 - 467.29\n* Micro resistance - 470.68\n* Bullish targets - 473.54 - 476.08\n* Bearish targets - 465.26 - 463.61 - 462.01\n* Bulls in charge above 20 SMMA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ctleefm8vgy71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92b3d9436f3fe7b2eedb14ec586e6e624e2c697b\n\n# RSI - 65 min.\n\n* Above 50\n* Continued downtrend from Nov. 5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12d06vdavgy71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=864a1323bebe02ecbaca5cbe5690b497a55df7b0\n\n# MACD - 65 min.\n\n* Cross extension\n* Broke uptrend from Oct. 28\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jjeugr2fvgy71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1d732a1caffc29b4154b6287d86c8390e968d26\n\n# SPY v Vix - 65 min.\n\n* 17.22+0.74 (+4.49%)\n* \ud83d\udc02 want VIX under 16.28\n* \ud83d\udc3b want VIX 17.79+\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2o40osbhvgy71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d56a2010b69567ab0adee2c0792af695e319bdd\n\n# Need to Know Market Risk - Financial Juice\n\n* Fed's Evans: By the spring, we will know a lot more about the inflation picture.\n* Fed's Harker: I does not expect the Federal Funds Rate to rise before the Fed's bond tapering is completed.\n* Euronext to ditch London stock exchange for clearing by 2024.\n* Fed's Clarida: By the end of 2022, I expect a full recovery to pre-pandemic employment levels, with the unemployment rate at 3.8% and participation growing.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\n\ud83c\udf1dNightMan",

        "selftext": "Fundamentals are growing and strong with $709 million in total commissions and $560 million in net trading income as of 1H21 \u2013 both above their 2020 totals \u2013 and total commissions expected to reach $2.5 billion in 2025. eToro\u2019s total commissions include commissions from trading activity, interest, and other charges. It generates majority of its revenues from trading commissions, which accounted for 87% of total commissions in 1H21. The net trading income is derived directly from total commissions after adjusting for trading cost. \n\nFrom 2016 to 2020, eToro\u2019s total commissions increased tenfold, from $60 million in 2016 to $602 million in 2020, led by the increase in cryptoasset prices and trading volume in 2017 and 2018, the launch of zero commission stocks trading in 2019, and increased retail participation in equities market in 2020. Furthermore, as eToro expands, its proprietary technology, effective marketing activities, and ability to operate globally via a single platform (with adjustments per market), will enable it to grow its total commissions from $1.0 billion in 2021 to $2.5 billion in 2025; while profitability (EBITDA) is expected to jump ~46.6x to $700 million during the same time period.\neToro\u2019s Total Commissions and Adj. EBITDA are Estimated to Near $2.5 Billion and $700 Billion in 2025, Respectively\n\nIn March 2021, eToro announced a definitive business combination agreement with FinTech Acquisition Corp. V (NASDAQ: FTCV) that values the company at ~$9.6 billion (pro forma EV). The transaction includes $250 million in gross proceeds from FinTech V\u2019s cash in trust and $650 million in gross proceeds from a fully committed private placement in public equity (PIPE) at $10.00 per share from various strategic and institutional investors. These include ION Investment Group, Softbank Vision Fund 2, Third Point LLC, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, and Wellington Management, that will close concurrently with the business combination. The company is expected to have ~$800 million net cash on its balance sheet to support future growth. After the transaction, eToro\u2019s existing equity holders, including current investors and employees of the firm, will remain the largest investors in the combined company retaining ~91% ownership. The company is expected to have an estimated implied equity value of ~$10.4 billion at closing. This reflects an implied EV of ~$9.6 billion for eToro, which equates to 9.7x 2022E net revenues of $990 million. This valuation multiple is significantly lower than its high-growth FinTech peers (26.2x), high-growth international brokers (17.0x), and developed tech led brokers (12.0x), making eToro an attractive choice for investors chasing growth at a reasonable valuation. The transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both eToro and Fintech V, is expected to close in 2021 and the combined entity will be listed on NASDAQ.\n\nSource: Intro-act, eToro Investor Presentation",

Please note, though, that the idea here is that these are *common* misconceptions: if you have an idea, please make sure it's something you've seen more than once, not just some strange one-off idea you saw a long time ago.\n\nPlease also feel free to contribute further ideas to the explanations.  I'd like the explanations to remain relatively brief, or at least avoid expanding into an entire page worth of text and illustrations, because many of them probably are discussed in more detail in some of the other resources.\n\nSo, without further ado, please keep in mind, each of the below statements is **false!**\n\n# A particular buyer and seller are linked\n\nMany times we will see someone who sold an option short wonder about what will happen if \"my buyer\" exercises.  *There is no \"your buyer.\"*  When you sell to open an option, you just go into one big pool of all people who are short that option.  When you buy to open an option, you just go into one big pool of all people who are long that option.  When a long exercises, the OCC picks a brokerage at random to find someone to assign, and then that brokerage picks a short either at random or in a FIFO fashion.  So your option position is not linked to the fate of any other.\n\n# A PMCC is a covered call\n\n\"I bought a LEAPS call, and now I want to do a PMCC.  I'm trying to sell a nearer-expiration call against my LEAPS, but my brokerage won't let me.  What gives?  My account page says I'm approved for covered calls; why is it giving me this error message?\"  Time for an English lesson, people: \"poor man's\" is an idiom for something that is kind of like a cheaper version of another thing, but *is not actually that thing*.  If someone says \"chicken liver is the poor man's foie gras,\" and then goes to a restaurant and orders foie gras, would you expect them not to be disappointed if they were served chicken liver?  Of course not!  \"Poor man's covered call\" is just a nickname for a long diagonal call spread set up in a certain way and used for a certain purpose, because when done in this way and for this purpose it kind of behaves somewhat like a covered call while being cheaper.  *It's not actually a covered call!*  It's a diagonal spread, and in order to trade one, you must be approved to trade spreads.\n\n# If I sell to close a long option, I am an \u201coption seller\u201d and therefore can be assigned\n\nYou may have read that when you \"sell an option,\" or if you are an \"option seller,\" you can be assigned.  In the world of options, \"selling\" is usually used as shorthand for the strategy of collecting premium by selling *to open* and then buying to close for less or letting the position expire worthless.  If you opened your position by buying to open a long option, when you sell to close, that puts you in a completely different position from people who sold to open and does not make you an \"option seller\" in the sense you have been reading about.  Put another way, it's not the *act of selling* an option that puts you on the hook for assignment, it's *having* a short option position.\n\n# \"In the money\" means that my position is currently profitable\n\nSometimes we will see people say \"I bough this option for $100.  Earlier this morning it was worth $110 so I was in the money, but now it's down to $90 so I'm out of the money.\"  No, \"in the money\" does not mean that you have an unrealized gain.  It does not mean that if you closed your position right now, you would take a profit.  Notwithstanding [old show tunes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJOjTNuuEVw), \"in the money\" has a narrow, specific, technical definition in the world of options.  It simply means that an option has intrinsic value.  For a call option, this means that the spot price of the underlying is greater than the strike price of the option, and for a put, it means that the spot price of the underlying is less than the strike price of the option.  That's it; that's all it means.  You can be losing money on an ITM option, and making a profit on an OTM option!  ITM vs. OTM does not mean you are making or losing money!\n\n# Moneyness includes breakeven, or premium paid/received\n\nSometimes we will get a post from someone who, for example, sold a covered call, let it expire ITM, and didn't expect to get assigned.  \"Help, I got assigned despite my CC being OTM!  I sold a 50 strike call, collected 2.00 premium, so my buyer's breakeven was 52, so it was OTM.  The stock closed at 51 but I got assigned!  Why did this happen?\"  Well, this option was *not* out of the money, it was in the money.  See the previous entry.  A call is ITM if the spot price of the underlying is greater than the strike price of the call, period.  51 &gt; 50, so this option was ITM!  Those sources you read about how you would be assigned if the option expired ITM?  That's what they meant.\n\n# My short option will not be exercised unless the underlying exceeds strike price plus premium received\n\nAn extension of the previous entry, but deserves its own entry because people don't always misuse ITM/OTM when they misunderstand this.  See the first entry, about how there is no \"my buyer.\"  You got chosen at random to be assigned and you have no idea what the financial situation of the particular party who exercised is.  If you let a short option expire ITM, you will be assigned; the amount of premium you collected to sell the option is irrelevant.  Furthermore, even if it were relevant, at expiration time, it's always \"worth it\" to exercise an option if the only alternative is letting it expire worthless, even if the underlying has not surpassed one's \"breakeven.\"  Just think about it and crunch the numbers yourself--isn't it better to recapture some value than to take max loss by losing your entire premium?\n\n# If my short leg is assigned, my broker will exercise my long leg for me\n\nNo, brokerages can't read your mind and don't know how you want to manage your position.  If you have a long diagonal call spread (aka a PMCC,) and you get assigned on your short leg, or, far worse, a vertical credit spread that expires with the underlying between the strikes, your brokerage is not going to just exercise your long option for you.  You need to be aware of all the different legs that make up your position and how they function, and all the different ways your position can play out, and *you* need to actively manage it according to your trading plan.\n\n# If something I didn't expect happened with my trade and it was to my disadvantage, my broker did it to me on purpose because they make money off the situation\n\nSometimes people think that if they got assigned early on a short position, or their broker didn't exercise an OTM long for them to cover a short assignment, or their broker wouldn't let them exercise a long option because they had insufficient buying power, the broker did this intentionally for their own profit.  No, your brokerage doesn't profit off of these situations, and besides, they have no control over assignment and the rules for use of margin and buying power are tightly controlled by SEC and FINRA.  These things happened/didn't happen because those are the rules of options.\n\n# The reason it says \"max loss: infinite\" when you go to sell a covered call is that it's counting your potentially missing out on gains as a loss\n\nSometimes people will post to ask why their brokerage order page says \"max loss: infinite\" when they go to sell a covered call, and someone else will \"helpfully\" explain \"it's because now the most you can make is $500, so if the stock moons it would be as though you lost all those gains.\"  This is not helpful, because it's wrong.  A $500 gain is not a loss just because you could have made $5000 instead had you done things differently, and if you don't believe me, try telling the IRS otherwise and see if you get away with it.   The reason your brokerage order page says this is that it's \u201cdumb\u201d and doesn\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d about your other positions; namely, the long shares.  It's treating the max loss calculation as though you're selling a naked call.\n\n# There is a person on the other end of my trade who, like me, is a Joe/Jane Sixpack sitting at their home computer using their retail brokerage software\n\nInspired by the \"who would buy this option?\" posts.  Sometimes people are concerned that if they have a long option that does well, it's way ITM and near expiration, they won't be able to sell it for a profit, and when told they will, express amazement that anyone would buy it.  \"Who is buying options like this?  Why would they pay such a high premium--in order for them to profit, the stock would have to go way higher, and it's afternoon of expiration already!\"  When you buy or sell an option, you're not buying from or selling to a small-potatoes retail trader like yourself.  The party on the other end is a market maker; you don't know whether they're opening or closing their own option inventory, and their job is to, well, make the market by providing trades.  They can dynamically hedge their position with long/short shares of the underlying as necessary to keep their delta exactly at 1 and they make their money off the bid-ask spread.  Don't worry; if there's a bid you can sell, and if there's an ask you can buy.  That's what markets are for, and going all the way back to misconception #1, it doesn't matter who's on the other end anyway!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n___\n\nThoughts/comments/contributions?  Remember, I'd like to make sure these are common as opposed to uncommon misconceptions.  Also, while I enjoy complaining about pet peeves as much as anyone, I'd like the comments here not to devolve into nothing but a head-shaking fest where we're all just sharing something particularly foolish we heard one time and saying \"can you believe this rube thought that?\"  I'd like to make sure the discussion furthers constructing an actually useful addition to our list of resources.",

I also have a Logitech gaming mouse (G700s), which came out as the best mid-end option in my research at the time. I\u2019m a sim racer and have had a Logitech sim wheel, was a great budget option at the time. I\u2019ve now upgraded to a high-end brand though. I also used a Logitech flight stick for literally forever, never failed me, I think it got lost somewhere when I stopped playing flight sims. I have a Logitech C920 webcam, bought on the recommendation of my cam-girl friends. I just use it for MSTeams/Google Classroom though...lol. I also had a Logitech microphone back when I was a teen gamer, which lasted fucking forever and was good quality for the price. My point is, if you\u2019re a gamer, sim racer, flight sim enthusiast, enjoyer of music, office worker, remote worker, pandemic student, or general PC user...you\u2019ve probably owned or still own many Logitech products. How have these products held up for you, were they good quality? Did they last long? I\u2019ve generally found them to be high quality for the price, and seemed to last forever. \n\n**LOGI (Logitech International SA) popped up on my morning gap up market scanner this morning.**\n\n\"Profit booking on the minds of LOGI investors as it marginally outperforms\"\n\"LOGITECH INTERNATIONAL SA delivered good returns today.

The firm offers solutions for healthy computing, wireless charging, streaming, virtual reality, rom home, schools, healthcare, and software and apps.

Please PM me if you want this since Reddit blocks a few of the links:**\n\n**Logitech is referenced as a good post-pandemic play, for a variety of reasons:**\n* The company is benefiting from COVID trends, but also secular trends (\u201cA secular trend or market is one that is likely to continue moving in the same general direction for the foreseeable future. ... The secular movement of a long-term trend can be neutral (flat), positive, or negative in its direction.\u201d).\n\n* It is sustaining YOY growth, paying a very safe dividend (in my research it is strongly recommended as a dividend stock). The company is investing in the \u2018future\u2019 (i\u2019ll get onto this later).\nOperations are within target, there\u2019s strong cash flow and free cash flow.\n\n* Logitech had a great quarter (despite rising costs, material shortfalls and margin pressure). On a two year basis, revenue is up more than 82%. No doubt due to the gaming boom during the pandemic. \nIt is said that logitech is underperforming in cams, tablet accessories, video and headsets (which all saw high-double-digit growth last year). Which I\u2019m surprised to see, as I\u2019m friends with some cam girls, and the device of choice in that industry is and always has been the Logitech C920 webcam. Maybe a surge of Pandemic cam girls will offset this (in all seriousness lol, great brand loyalty to Logitech there).\n\n* They are delivering strength in keyboards, pointers and gaming equipment. Which doesn\u2019t surprise me. I\u2019ve been doing flight sims and sim racing for a long time. On the low to mid end, Logitech has been my choice and the recommended choice for flight sticks and sim wheels. Logitech is killing it in the low/mid end sim racing market. \n\n**Earnings:**\n\n* Operating income, both GAAP and adjusted, fell 40% but largely due to a 60% increase in marketing and 30% increase in R&amp;D. Which are acceptable reasons, as they should result in higher sales long-term. \n\n* The company reaffirmed its guidance for revenue and earnings at the previously stated range. \u201c This is calling for full-year growth in the range of flat to +/- 5% which we view as a wide range given this year\u2019s YTD strength. The comps are going to get tougher before they get easy again but the two strongest quarters of the fiscal year are still ahead. In our view, Logitech should produce at least flat to slightly higher YOY revenue if not growth in the mid-single-digit range.\u201d (https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/logitech-is-still-a-logical-choice-for-dividend-growth-portfolios/?focus=NASDAQ:LOGI)\n\n* \u201cIn Q2, adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share fell short of the consensus estimate of $1.10 per share.

Logitech pays out annually, and only recently made the last distribution.\n\n**The Dip:**\n* Logitech has declined this year following supply shortages and a Q2 result miss (which there are \u2018logical\u2019 reasons for.)\n\n* Logitech is down 15% this year. It sells for 15 times earnings, it\u2019s normal multiple in the past decade has been 23. It hasn\u2019t been a bad year for Logitech. Revenue in the past year was up 51% and earnings were up more than 32%.\n\n* The stock peaked in June at about $138 and has fallen to the $80-range.\nCritics say the company has spent excessively on marketing. Profit margins have shrunk.\nHowever, based on Logitech\u2019s long term record, I think it is a good play.\n\n**The Growing PC Gaming Accessories Market:**\n\n* \u201cAdvance Market Analytics published a new research publication on \u201cPC Gaming Accessories Market Insights, to 2026\u2033 with 232 pages and enriched with self-explained Tables and charts in presentable format. In the Study you will find new evolving Trends, Drivers, Restraints, Opportunities generated by targeting market associated stakeholders. The growth of the PC Gaming Accessories Market was mainly driven by the increasing R&amp;D spending across the world.\u201d\n\n* \u201cControllers, gamepads, keyboards, cameras, virtual reality headsets, and other gaming peripherals are included in the category of gaming accessories. The global demand for gaming accessories has increased in recent years due to the rising usage of PCs. Furthermore, innovations such as virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) have aided the worldwide gaming accessory market\u2019s expansion.\u201d\n\n* I\u2019ve requested a report sample from the market research companies that publish it. I\u2019ll update the DD later with it:\n\n* \u201cDear (commodoregoat, I\u2019ve removed my name lol),\nA specialist from our team will get in touch with you shortly to help you find the right insights based on your research goals.\nAs a premier market research firm, we guarantee more than 90% accuracy on the data we provide.\u201d\n\n* \u201cDear (commodoregoat)\nThank you for your Inquiry for Global Wireless Keyboard Market Equipment Analysis and Forecast (2021-2027) by Platform type, End user and Application. Report. Our team will get back to you shortly.\n\nGlobal Wireless Keyboard Market , summary linked to this report: https://imgur.com/Wj3zYW2\n\n* I\u2019m going to update this with some of my own research later, as well as my findings from this report if they send me it. I requested a section relevant to Logitech. Using my student cred to hopefully get them to send me it even though I\u2019m not a professional. \n\n**Is Logitech a bargain right now?:**\n\nI found an interesting article (after discarding many during my research) analysing if Logitech is currently a cheap stock, I\u2019ve quoted the important parts below:\n\n* \u201cLogitech, which makes input and interface devices for personal computers and electronics such as keyboards, computer mice, bluetooth speakers and universal remotes, saw its share price more than double over 2020, with the good times continuing over the first half of this year. But the stock has fallen on hard times of late, dropping 37 per cent since early June.\u201d\n\n* \u201cAppealing to the company\u2019s significant runway ahead, however, David Driscoll (Portfolio Manager) named LOGI one of his Top Picks for the next 12 months while speaking on a BNN Bloomberg segment on Friday.\u201d\n\n* \u201cWe\u2019ve spoken about companies that have fallen more than 20 per cent from their highs despite the fact that the revenue growth and profit growth is there. The reason [Logitech] has fallen as much as it has from its high price of 124 Swiss francs to where it is at 82 is simply because of the COVID variant lockdowns,\u201d Driscoll said.\n\n* \u201cYou\u2019re not getting people out there in the gaming industry having competitions and people showing up at movie theatres to watch it,\u201d said Driscoll, President and CEO of Liberty International Investment Management. \n\n* \u201cThis company makes computer mice and the trackballs, game controllers, keyboards, video cameras and multimedia speakers. So, the long term outlook for the company is very strong because, again, video gaming is going to be a thing of the future,\u201d he said.\n\n* \u201cThe stock trades at 13x earnings so it\u2019s very cheap right now. Dividends have been rising by ten per cent a year and free cash flow yields are around ten per cent relative to where bond yields are. And then when we look at the return on capital of 46 per cent versus the cost of capital at eight per cent it certainly gives Logitech a great opportunity to raise the dividends and innovate and to spend on research and development for the future,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSo, I just think where we are at it\u2019s very cheap stock,\u201d Driscoll said.\n\n* \u201cWe\u2019ve started strong in Fiscal Year 2022, with Q1 sales up 58 per cent in constant currency and profits doubling versus last year,\u201d said Bracken Darrell, Logitech president and CEO, in a July 26 press release. \u201cOur key categories grew high double digits. This performance demonstrates the strength of our capabilities, excellent operational execution, and ability to capitalize on long-term trends, like gaming, streaming and creating, hybrid work and video everywhere.\u201d\n\n* With Logitech\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter results in April, the company announced both an increase to its share buyback program bringing it to up to $1 billion and a dividend increase of ten per cent, saying the two moves show the company\u2019s \u201ccontinued commitment to consistently return cash to shareholders.\u201d\n(https://www.cantechletter.com/2021/10/logitech-is-a-really-cheap-stock-right-now-this-investor-says/#)\n\n**What makes Logitech a good buy?:**\n\nI dislike the Motley Fool and Seeking Alpha, but I haven\u2019t found any other good research for this section. Take (some of)this section with a grain of salt as I\u2019m using them as my sources. If you feel like it skip past the Motley Fool/Seeking Alpha section to see my own analysis and what I\u2019ve wrote from other sources. But so far the Fool/SA articles seem to be a rare gem on them and I\u2019m getting useful information. I\u2019ve mixed a decent amount of my own opinion/writing in (it isn\u2019t just paraphrased).\n\n* \u201cLogitech is still seeing high demand for webcams, keyboards, and gaming products.\nIt's gaining market share in secular growth categories like gaming.\nThe stock is trading at cheap levels, despite a long runway of growth ahead.\u201d\n\n*Takeaways from earnings report:*\n\n* Logitech\u2019s sales were up 58% year over year, while its operating profit more than doubled.\n\u201c In a statement, CEO Bracken Darrell said, \"This performance demonstrates the strength of our capabilities, excellent operational execution, and ability to capitalize on long-term trends, like gaming, streaming and creating, hybrid work and video everywhere.\"\n\nSee below:\nhttps://imgur.com/UbNXJZA\n\n(IMAGE SOURCE: LOGITECH INTERNATIONAL'S FISCAL Q1 2022 EARNINGS PRESENTATION.)\n\n* The global market for webcams was estimated at $6.1 billion in 2019 (according to Grand View Research.)\u201cAccording to an analysis published in May 2020, it\u2019s expect to grow at a compound annual rate of 8% through 2027\u201d\n\n* \u201cIn a similar report on gaming peripherals, the market was estimated at $3.9 billion in 2019, and forecast to grow at a compound annual rate of 10.4% through 2025.\u201d\n\n* \u2018Investors now seem overly concerned about a near-term deceleration in growth as the company begins to lap periods when demand spiked for its products during the pandemic. But investors should base their view of Logitech as an investment on the long-term opportunities in front of it. As Darrell said on the earnings call, \"We have an exciting long-term growth potential ahead from this bigger [sales] base.\"\u2019\n\n*Gaining market share:*\n\n* While riding trends in remote work and gaming, Logitech is also gaining market share.\nIt is the leader in most categories it operates in (important ones to note are webcams for cam girls and web conferencing, keyboards, mouses, sim racing, flight sims, other gaming peripherals)\n\n* Market share gains are difficult to come by during pandemic due to supply shortages.\n\u201cBut with supply catching up to demand, Logitech reported share gains across most categories last quarter.\u201c\nLogitech has gained market share in gaming, where sales increased by 76% \u2018on a currency-neutral basis.\n\n* \u201cDarrell said that Logitech's marketing around gaming is \"probably the best we've had.\" ...having seen this statement I\u2019m going to write a section on their marketing, to see what\u2019s up.\n\n* \u201cLogitech\u2019s PC peripherals business grew 49% year over year, products that have been on the market for 2 years are still driving sales, including the MX Master 3 mouse and MX keys keyboard.\u201d\n\n*Demand is high for hybrid solutions:*\n\n* The growth of Logitech\u2019s webcam business (lmao camgirls and zoom) supports Logitech management's belief that the pandemic has forever changed the workplace. \n* \u201cDarrell suggested that some people may find it awkward to do audio-only calls in the future. The company's 73% sales growth in webcams implies that the need for hybrid solutions in the office will continue to support demand of Logitech\u2019s products \u201c\n* \u201cThe installed base of PCs is estimated at 1.4 billion, which gives Logitech a massive market in which to grow sales for many years. \"[W]e think the opportunity there is very significant, and we're going to keep investing,\" Darrell said. \u201c\n\n*Secular opportunities to drive long-term growth:*\n\n* \u201cLogitech listed four secular growth trends at its investor day held in March this year: the growth of remote work, the transition from audio toward video calls, video gaming as a spectator sport, and the spike in streaming and content creation.\u201d\n\n* \u201cLogitech expects these trends to create new opportunities\u201d such as:\nWorkspaces will have to be upgraded, as workers move to remote, or a hybrid model that includes remote and the office.\n\n* \u201cAs a result, employees/organizations can be expected to invest more money into peripherals such as keyboards, mice, tablets, and speakers, among other items.\u201d all of which Logitech is a market leader in.\n \n* This just reminded me I\u2019ve been buying logitech speakers for a long time, they\u2019ve always been great as a budget option for this category. I also have a Logitech gaming mouse (G700s), which came out as the best mid-end option in my research at the time. I\u2019m a sim racer and have had a Logitech sim wheel, was a great budget option at the time. I\u2019ve now upgraded to a high-end brand though. I also used a Logitech flight stick for literally forever, never failed me, I think it got lost somewhere when I stopped playing flight sims. I have a Logitech C920 webcam, bought on the recommendation of my cam-girl friends. I just use it for MSTeams/Google Classroom though...lol. I also had a Logitech microphone as a teen gamer, which lasted fucking forever and was good quality for the price. My point is, if you\u2019re a gamer, sim racer, flight sim enthusiast, enjoyer of music, office worker, remote worker, pandemic student, or general PC user...you\u2019ve probably owned or still own many Logitech products. How have these products held up for you, were they good quality? Did they last long? I\u2019ve generally found them to be high quality for the price, and seemed to last forever. I like this paragraph so I\u2019m going to copy it as the intro. Sorry for making you re-read it, but it\u2019s relevant to this section.\n\n* This investment by organisations into peripherals would spark a \u2018refresh cycle\u2019 and likely increase demand of Logitech\u2019s products (eg pointing devices, keyboards, and tablet accessories.\nLogitech, from my personal impression, is a leader in the webcam sector. Cam girls all use the C920, and now students, teachers, office workers etc are all buying the C920 and others for video calls. \nThe shift to video calls due to the pandemic means that demand for video collaboration equipment and webcams is likely to increase.\n\n* \u201cThird-party research estimates the webcam market will grow at an annual pace of 16.6% through 2026 and hit $24.6 billion in value. The videoconferencing market is also expected to clock double-digit growth over the long run.\u201d\n\n* This is a good sign for logitech, as video collab equipment and webcams produced more than 28% of its revenue last year.\n\n* The video gaming market is also driving sales for Logitech/the need for new equipment, due to the growing adoption of esports (I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but I think Motley Fool forgot normal gamers here, a lot of us have been upgrading our PC\u2019s, mouses, keyboards, microphones.).\n\n* \u201cAccording to third-party estimates, the global esports market could clock 15% annual growth through 2026. This would encourage gamers to invest more money into the latest equipment, unlocking another solid opportunity for Logitech.\u201d\n\n* Due to catalysts including esports, online education and other forms of content creation (eg Twitch, Youtube, Camgirls), the video streaming market is anticipated to grow at 21% a year through to 2028 \u2018according to Grand View Research.\u2019\n\n* \u201cSo it is safe to say that Logitech is sitting on a bunch of impressive growth drivers that could help the company deliver eye-popping results in the long run.\u201d\n* \u201cAs such, investors looking to add a growth stock to their portfolio shouldn't delay further. Logitech's recent pullback has made the stock cheap, with its price-to-sales ratio of 3.96 falling below last year's average multiple of 4.5. The earnings multiple of 22 is also below the 2020 average of 24.6. A strong earnings report could kick-start Logitech stock's rally, which is why now looks like a good time to go long.\u201d &lt;- this is as of Jul 17 so outdated info, please check elsewhere in this DD for more recent info.\n\n*Logitech is an attractive opportunity now:*\n\n* \"Logitech is very undervalued at current levels.\"\n\n* \"The company has a superb track record of beating earnings estimates.\"\n\n* \"We think current price levels are attractive for long-term investors. However, we'd like to see a trend reversal before jumping in.\"\n\n*Growth Catalysts:*\n\n* Video games. \u201cThe average time spent playing video games is projected to increase from 1.1 hours per person per day to 1.5 hours during the next 5 years.\u201d (https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/7dbf4906-4a13-47f9-9a4c-f7898ff6d1b4)\n\n* Reddit brings this to an average of 3-24 hours. You fucking degenerates. \n\n* \u201cThis can be attributed to 2 factors. The first one is that video games are becoming increasingly social. The second one is thanks to the rise of eSports which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.1% from 2019 to 2024.\u201d (https://influencermarketinghub.com/esports-stats/)\n\n* \u201cThe second catalyst is the content market which is expected to see growth of 13% CAGR from 2021 to 2026. This includes industries such as movies, music, education, and others.\u201d (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/digital-content-market-size-usd-397-390-million-by-2026-at-cagr-13--valuates-reports-301187341.htm)\nCAGR = Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)\n\n*Valuation:*\n\n* \"The intrinsic value has dropped a little to $124 per share. However, at the current price, there is finally a good margin of safety for Logitech.\u201d\n\n*Potential Short-Term Catalysts and Risks:*\n\n* Logitech share price has been falling for several months, this is likely due to the expectation that the boost from the pandemic will disappear and growth will decline temporarily.\nCurrent price may be too pessimistic, \u201cespecially when considering that it is already undervalued even with the expected decline in growth.\u201d\n\n* Logitech tends to beat earnings estimates often.\nKeep in mind that recent larger beats could be due to pandemic boost. The company may face bigger headwinds than anticipated going forward. \n\n* However if the trend of beating earnings continues, it could give the stock a push upwards.\n(I\u2019ve covered this later in the DD) Logitech is unlikely to be immune from supply chain issues that have impacted a large number of companies around the world. \n\n* This is an important risk to consider, especially as Logitech is largely pushing hardware products. If Logitech were to announce its inventory has been impacted, it is very possible that the stock would tumble even if they beat on expectations. Note: I think this might very well be the explanation for the current price at the $80 range, read my segment on supply chain issues later in the DD.\n\n*Final thoughts on this section:*\n\n\n* \u201cLogitech is significantly more attractive today than it was back in July. Long-term investors could potentially consider entering at these prices. However, we rate it a hold because its stock price is still on a short-term downtrend and would like to see the trend reverse before entering.\u201d (Oct 12, 2021)\n \n**How Logitech is benefiting from the work from home revolution:**\n\n* \u201cLogitech\u2019s share of the global computer peripheral equipment market grew from 0.6% in calendar 2019 to 1.0% in calendar 2020.\n\n* The permanent shifts in where people work and how they spend their free time may have created a new, larger base for Logitech\u2019s sales.\n\nLogitech\u2019s largest segments are projected to grow at much faster rates than the rest of the computer peripherals market.\u201d\n\n* The firm is well positioned to continue to profit from growth in gaming and work from home:\n\u201cthe shift to work from home (WFH) will support elevated profits going forward\nits strong position in the gaming peripherals industry, which is expected to grow 10% compounded annually through 2025\n\n* The firm\u2019s history of profitable growth.\n\n* The current valuation already implies profits fall 32%\u201d (Oct 11, 2021)\n\n**I will be posting part two later today, I wrote this 7 days ago also, but I will be updating with more recent information**",

        "selftext": "# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice\n\n3 Nov 2021\n\n* Stocks climbed to a record after the Fed signaled that monetary policy will remain accommodative even as the central bank starts reducing its massive bond-buying program this month.\n* The S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones, NASDAQ 100, and Russell 2000 all closed at all-time highs for the second straight session, a feat not seen since January 2018. The yield curve steepened after Fed Chair Jerome Powell sought to emphasise that the tapering decision does not imply that rate rises are imminent. He stated that officials can be patient with tightening, but will not hesitate to act if inflation warrants it. The dollar dropped.\n* Traders mostly kept their bets on the timing of interest-rate hikes at the level they were at before the decision. Rate rises of around 55 basis points are predicted by money-market derivatives by the end of 2022. According to overnight index swaps, the first raise is expected around July, with a roughly 70% likelihood of occurring the month earlier.\n* On Wednesday, the Treasury revealed the first decline in its quarterly sale of longer-term debt in more than five years, showing reduced borrowing needs as the wave of pandemic-relief spending recedes.\n* Companies in the United States created the most jobs in four months, indicating that employers are making headway in filling a near-record number of unfilled positions. The figures come ahead of the Labor Department's monthly employment report, which is expected to indicate that private payrolls climbed by 408,000 in October.

The stock has had solid momentum over the last 30 days, and especially the past three days. Micron shares have gained 27% this month, the last 30 days have brought the annual gain to 34%.\n\n**Why did MU pop on Friday:**\n\n**Micron opened at 78.93, had a high of 83.86, a low of 78.93, closed at 83.03 (7.80% change), and 47.22M volume.**\n\n[Covered in the first DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzkdma/mu_micron_technology_deepdive_adderallfueled_dd/) *Micron climbed a lot on Friday. This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks. [He anticipates a return to earnings growth next year.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-stock-price-earnings-chip-shortage-51632864045?mod=article_inline).*\n\n(\n*\u2018\u201cIn his note, Muse wrote that while shares of chip makers like Micron have lagged behind the PHLX Semiconductor index, or SOX, since early June, the tide may be shifting.*\n\n*\u201cWe believe negative sentiment was due to investor concerns over the sustainability of PC, handsets, and cloud demand, which was also compounded by DRAM spot pricing that began to flatten out in May/June 2021,\u201d Muse wrote.\u2019*\n\n[Useful Nasdaq article explaining Friday\u2019s hype \"Why Is Everyone Talking About Micron Stock?\u201d](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-is-everyone-talking-about-micron-stock)\n\nThis is also due to the Citi upgrade (see Monday section).\n\n**Why did MU pop on Monday:**\n\n**Micron opened at 83.66, had a high of 87.67, a low of 83.66, closed at 83.86 (1.00% change) and 34.35M volume.**\n\nMU popped again on Monday, with shares rising as much as 5.6%. Monday\u2019s rise was due to a variety of reasons, outlined below.\n\n**An important thing to note is that despite the market slide on Monday, Micron generally held its own and remained green.** The rest of my calls were obliterated, meanwhile the calls I bought pre-market and 5 minutes after open remained in profit. I did not sell these on the peak, I am still holding them. \n\n\n*Evercore ISI analyst upgrade from Friday:* \nAgain due to the Evercore ISI price upgrade on Friday, MU saw strong momentum on Monday.\n\n*Citi analyst upgrade from Friday:*\n*\u201cCiti analyst Christopher Danely said the pricing correction in the DRAM market was \"drawing to a close\" as the PC and server markets stabilized and expanded. As such, he expects Micron to benefit from \"more positive catalysts\" in the coming months and maintains a \"buy\" rating with a price target of $120 -- more than 40% above its current price.\u201d*\n\n*CNBC article released pre-market:*\n[An article was released on Monday from CNBC, 7:00AM EST.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/22/micron-stock-has-best-day-in-18-months-traders-see-bigger-breakout.html)  This highlighted the two analyst upgrades, their targets, and the upside. Due to CNBC\u2019s wide reach, this highlighted the stock to other investors and drove momentum. \n\nOne bearish thing to note (not in the article), from CNBC \u2018Trading Nation: \u201cOn CNBC\u2019s \"Trading Nation,\" Michael Binger of Gradient Investments said semiconductor stocks that have gained sharply in the recent period are likely to pull back.\u201d\nHowever my opinion as of Wednesday is that this has happened to much of the semi-sector Monday/Tuesday, but MU has remained largely unaffected thus far.\n\n*Micron\u2019s LPDDR5X DRAM is going to be used in the MediaTek Dimensity 9000:*\n\n**This is important news, I\u2019m going to cover this later in my DD.** This was also announced pre-market. \n*[\u201cMicron Technology, Inc. (MU) revealed that its low-power double data rate 5X (LPDDR5X) DRAM for MediaTek Inc.\u2019s new Dimensity 9000 5G flagship chipset for smartphones has been validated.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/micron-lpddr5x-dram-to-feature-in-mediatek-dimensity-9000)*\n \n*\u201dBuilt on its 1\u03b1 (1-alpha) node, the new chipset will help smartphones unlock applications powered by artificial intelligence and 5G innovation. Micron claims LPDDR5X to be the fastest and most advanced mobile memory available. It says that it has shipped the first batch of samples.\u201d*\n \n*\u201cMeanwhile, Micron disclosed that it was joining hands with leading smartphone manufacturers and chipset vendors to enable ecosystem innovation with LPDDR5X.*\n[*Micron outperformed the general market on Monday*](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-technology-inc-stock-rises-monday-outperforms-market-01637619013)\n\n[*Nasdaq recommended Micron as one of top 4 stock trades for Monday*](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-top-stock-trades-for-monday%3A-lcid-hood-mu-fl-2021-11-19)\n\n[**Furthermore MU was the 3nd (2nd according to other scrapers) most discussed stock on Wallstreetbets Monday**](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/11/24215526/gamestop-top-discussed-stock-on-wallstreetbets-heading-into-new-week-micron-tesla-and-th)\n\n**Why did MU pop again on Tuesday:**\n\n**Micron opened at 85.04, had a high of 87.71, a low of 84.33, closed at 85.41 (1.85% change), and had a volume of 31.64M**\n\nMicron again showed strong performance yesterday. Again, much of the semi sector was sliding/underperforming, yet Micron remained strong. \n\nThe primary reason for this was that [Mizuho](https://www.mizuhogroup.com/) upgraded Micron back to a buy (one month after it was downgraded). \n\n[Link to Marketwatch article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-upgraded-back-to-a-buy-at-mizuho-just-one-month-after-it-was-downgraded-11637672539?mod=mw_latestnews)\n\nMizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh again became bullish on Micron. He upgraded it to buy, after downgrading it to neutral on October 20th. He changed his price target to $95 from $75.\n\n*\u201cWhen Rakesh downgraded Micron last month, he cited expectations of a soft demand outlook for the first half of 2022 for PCs and notebooks, server and handset markets.*\n\n*\u201cHowever, our recent checks indicate the \u2018ACTUAL\u2019 demand is improving across all three markets,\u201d Rakesh wrote in a research note, with first-quarter PC/NB builds \u201conly\u201d flat to down 5% from the previous quarter, compared with expectations of a 10% to 15% decline and handsets flat versus expectations of down 10%. He also believes server demand could improve.\u201d*\n\n\n[From Barrons:](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-mu-western-digital-wdc-stocks-analyst-buy-51637675537)\n\u201cNew data indicated actual demand was improving across PCs, servers and handsets that \u201ccould support an improved pricing,\u201d prompting [Rakesh to raise the stock to Buy](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-mu-western-digital-wdc-stocks-analyst-buy-51637675537) and boost his price targets. The new target for Micron is $95, up from $75\u201d\n\n*\u201cRakesh estimates that first-quarter PC and netbook builds will only decrease between 0% and 5% quarter over quarter, up from previous estimates that they would fall between 10% and 15%. PC demand alone could be up as much as 5% year over year, a shift Rakesh said was surprising given Wall Street consensus that demand would be down between 2% and 3%.\u201d*\n\n*\u201dRequests for memory chips in China also could improve compared to previous estimates, as well as orders from server hosts like Amazon ( AMZN ) and Google (GOOGL). An additional boost could come from upcoming investments in the metaverse and virtual reality.\u201d*\n\n*\u201dMicron may be a new darling among analysts. Last week, Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse added Micron to his list of top stock picks, anticipating a return to earnings growth next year.\u201d*\n\n[**Micron was once again one of the top discussed stocks on Wallstreetbets on Tuesday, being in the fourth position.**](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/11/24243247/gamestop-remains-top-wallstreetbets-interest-zoom-video-micron-technology-and-these-are-)\n\n**Wednesday outlook:**\n\nMU is currently declining pre-market. Opening at 85.59, with a high (so far) of $86, and a (current) low of 84.62, where it is at right now as I write this segment (13:22PM GMT/08:22 EST/07:23 CST). There is no negative news, so I expect this is due to the current slide of the semi-segment and general market slightly affecting MU (whereas the past two days it has almost-always remained green despite the current market). However it is only down 0.90%, we will see what happens at open. I will update this segment then. I will also include any news that comes out today.\n\nUpdate: MU is still remaining strong. As of 10:25AM EST, it has so far peaked at 86.72, after opening at 84.65, the current low being 84.65 also. Volume so far is 6.81(M).

It aims to improve the data transfer on RAM chips used in mobile devices such as the DImensity 9000 (or other counterparts such as Samsung Exynos and Qualcomm Snapdragon). It is claimed that these Micron DRAM modules (produced with 1-alpha technology) consume the lowest power among mobile DRAMs.\n\n[**When sampled**](https://www.digitaltrends.com/features/lpddr5x-ram-vs-lpddr5-dram-dimensity-9000/) Micron\u2019s LPDDR5X solution achieved data transfer speeds of up to 7500Mbps, however this is behind the transfer rates supported by the new standard (8533Mbps). As Micron emphasized on the 8533 figure, my personal prediction is that it will soon bring out products achieving higher transfer speeds (or that it is maybe saving them for other manufacturers than MediaTek). LPDDR5 (highest rate) achieves 6400Mbps. \n\n*\u201cBased on these results, MediaTek concluded that LPDDR5X modules lead to 17% faster transfer speeds and 15% lower latency compared to the previous generation.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cMediaTek remarked the new RAM technology will allow increasingly higher levels of data processing, which are needed for the complex and heterogeneous processing units that are built into modern-day chipsets. These higher processing capabilities will be vital for the high-data requirements of the 5G era.\u201d*\n\n**The difference between Micron\u2019s and Samsung\u2019s LPDDR5X solutions can only be compared once the Snapdragon 888 benchmarks are released, or newer chips featuring the most recent RAM technology.**\n\n*Availability of Micron\u2019s new DRAM:*\n*\u201cMicron\u2019s Taiwan fabs have begun volume production of 1\u03b1 node DRAM, starting with DDR4 memory for compute customers and Crucial consumer PC DRAM products. Micron has also begun sampling LPDDR4 to mobile customers for qualification. The company will introduce additional new products based on this technology throughout calendar 2021.\u201d*\n\n**P/E Ratio:**\n\nMU\u2019s current P/E ratio (as of Wednesday 24th November pre-market) is 16.3x. The median P/E ratio for the US is 18x. I\u2019m sourcing from the below linked article for this section. \n\n*[\u201cRecent times have been advantageous for Micron Technology](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-piece-of-the-puzzle-missing-from-micron-technology-inc.s-nasdaq%3Amu-27-share-price-climb) as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to wane, which has kept the P/E from rising.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cMicron Technology's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the market.\u201d*\n\nLast year delivered a 117% gain to the company\u2019s bottom line. The EPS has fallen 57% in total from three years ago. Therefore the recent earnings growth may have been undesirable for the company.\n\n*\u201cTurning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 35% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 11% each year growth forecast for the broader market.\u201d*\n\nMicron\u2019s P/E is now in line with other companies. You can use P/E to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations. It\u2019s superior earnings outlook is not contributing to P/E as much as expected. When strong earnings outlook is seen with faster-than-market growth, potential risks are what may be placing pressure on the P/E ratio. \n\nThe risk of price drop looks to be subdued, but investors likely thing future earnings could see some volatility. \n\n**NAND Flash revenue growth for Q3 2021:**\n\n[Recent relevant article released today, I will be sourcing from this for this section.](https://evertiq.com/design/51010)\n\nHyperscaler and enterprise clients are continuing procurement in line with Q2, this is in order to deploy products based on new processor platforms. \n\nMajor smartphone brands are expected to expand their procurement activities during Q3, as they are preparing to release new flagship models. \n\n*\u201cAs such, clients in both server and smartphone industries made significant contributions to the revenue growth of the NAND Flash industry for 3Q21.\u201d* \n\nHowever, suppliers note that orders from PC OEM\u2019s are showing signs of decline. \n\n\u201c\u2018On the whole, the industry\u2019s quarterly total NAND Flash bit shipment increased by nearly 11% QoQ for 3Q21, and the overall NAND Flash ASP rose by nearly 4% QoQ for the same quarter. Thanks to rising prices and expanding shipments, the quarterly total NAND Flash revenue increased by 15% QoQ to a new record high of USD 18.8 billion in 3Q21.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cDemand from the data center segment remained strong, and clients continued to adopt Micron\u2019s 176L products. However, Micron\u2019s shipment share in the smartphone market lagged behind that of other NAND Flash suppliers. Furthermore, its PC OEM clients were starting to be affected by the uneven supply of semiconductor chips. In light of these factors, Micron\u2019s NAND Flash bit shipment increased by a modest 4% QoQ. On the other hand, the NAND Flash market remained in a severe shortage in 3Q21, thereby driving up Micron\u2019s ASP by about 5% QoQ. Hence, Micron\u2019s NAND Flash revenue for 3Q21 reached USD 1.97 billion, an 8.8% QoQ increase.\u201d*\n\n[*Sales ranking of Branded NAND Flash makers, Q3 2021 (in million USD)*](https://imgur.com/sbJyTmY)\n\n**NAND Flash revenue growth for Q4 2021:**\n\nThe impact of the component supply shortage has increased across numerous segments of the NAND flash market, as the capacity issues in the foundry market remains unresolved. \nCurrently, NAND Flash components are in higher available supply compared to other kinds of key components. \n\n*\u201cFor OEMs and ODMs, the differences between the NAND Flash inventory level and the inventory levels of other components have been growing over the past several months. Therefore, they have to scale back orders and reduce stock for NAND Flash. As inventory adjustments are happening, NAND Flash contract prices will start to drop and thus bring about an end to the several quarters of strong revenue growth enjoyed by suppliers.\u201d*\n\nI would note that this is actually possibly negative news for MU, but will only affect Q4 and perhaps after that. NAND is only a segment of Micron\u2019s business though. \n\n**Micron\u2019s CEO, an analysis of his performance**\n\n[\u201cMemory chip demand has been exploding since Sanjay Mehrotra was recruited as Micron CEO in 2017.\u201d](https://investorplace.com/2021/11/mu-stock-is-at-the-middle-of-an-upswing-not-the-end/)\n\nMehrotra previously founded SanDisk. He became available after Western Digital acquired SanDisk in 2016.\n\n[After Mehrotra joined Micron as CEO, strong performance was seen in 2017 and 2018.](https://investorplace.com/2018/05/micron-technology-inc-booming-despite-low-stock-price/). Micron\u2019s sales rose from $12 billion in 2016 to $20 billion in 2017 (fueled by data centres and smartphones). In 2017/2018, Mehrota astutely aimed production at solid state drives and graphics. One reason for this was to target the cloud boom, and their upgrade cycle to meet demands for AI applications (making memory important, and thereby putting Micron in a good position). He also aimed to balance between supply and demand that year, rather than the bear market that was indicated by current stock price. In 2017/2018, while expanding investment, Micron built up a cash reserve. It has $8 billion in cash (as of May 2018), and short term investments as of the most recent quarter at that time. Long term debt fell to $7.8 billion nd could be paid out of cash on hand. It\u2019s price to earnings ratio was 10 (as of May 2018), which would mean a 25% bump in stock price. \n\n*In March 2020* [Micron surprised \u2018analysts by earning $405 million, 36 cents per share, on revenue of $4.8 billion for the quarter ending in February.\u2019](https://investorplace.com/2020/03/micron-mu-stock-offers-hope-in-turbulent-market/) Certainly strong performance despite being at the start of the pandemic.\n\n*\u201dThe results sent MU stock up over 5% on March 26, although shares are down over 3% in mid-morning trading March 27.\u201d*\n\n\u201cShares rose sharply thanks to a [conservative outlook from CEO Sanjay Mehrotra](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-earnings-conservative-outlook-seen-as-prudent-but-rest-of-year-remains-a-big-question-2020-03-23), who has seen many booms and busts in his 30 years as a memory company executive.\u201d\n\n*\u201cLast week, Micron Chief Executive Sanjay Mehrotra said in a letter that the company took early precautions in January to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in its facilities in China and the rest of Asia and expanded those protections as the virus spread world-wide.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cWe have also carefully managed raw materials and our supply chain to maintain our manufacturing capabilities and production,\u201d Mehrotra said. \u201cOur global team has shown tremendous strength and solidarity, operating with excellence despite lockdowns and quarantines that challenged staffing, shipments and work schedules.\u201d*\n\nBecause memory chips are commodity products, MU stock is prone to sharp rises and falls. Until recently (as of March 2020) it was said to be riding a \u201csupercycle,\u201d with chip-based memory replacing spinning disks in devices, PCs and the cloud.\u2019\n\n*Analysis as of today 24th of November 2021:*\nMemory has been going through a \u2018super-cycle\u2019 for years now, this is due to SSD\u2019s/flash memory replacing standard HDD\u2019s in consumer devices and more recently in data centres. SSD\u2019s/flash memory are faster and more reliable. As the price has been coming down for SSD\u2019s/flash memory, the switch to these has accelerated. \n\nAnalysts may warn that this \u2018super-cycle\u2019 is peaking, however it is just [cooling down](https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202107140009). And as outlined in my previous DD, in 2023, 2024 and the future. We can actually expect memory demand to exponentially increase. \n\n[Chart showing price projections of various DRAM product categories for Q3](https://imgur.com/bPkMum5)\n\nThe current supercycle is expected to run [until 2023 (\u201cThe super cycle in global memory chips, where price strengthening is coupled with demand overwhelming supply, is expected to last until 2023\u201d)](https://m.pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2021&amp;no=489942), and could go well beyond that with new demand from [the Machine Internet](https://cplaneai.com/the-machine-internet-age/).

        "selftext": " Hello all,\n\nI'm  a 24 year old newbie just started to invest for about 3 months. I do not have a good income rn (\\~25k a year but starting in next spring I will have a raise and bump it to 50-70k.) but i just want to dip my toes in the water and start learning about investing. Was doing okay  (initial deposit was 3.5k) and was up about 5% until I find out WSB.  Made some retard plays (listened to those \"DD\" about CLOV, IRNT, CRSR)  and lost about 15% of my portfolio. After that I started to do a lot  more DD and here are my current position:\n\nTD account\n\n3 shares of AAPL @ 150\n\n3 shares of AMC @ 40\n\n1 share of AMD @ 105\n\n1 share of DIS @ 160\n\n15 shares of SOFI @ 19 and 2 option plays April 2022 strike 25 and 30 (bought that 6 weeks ago first and only option play)\n\n1 share of tsm @ 110\n\n1 share of unity @ 120\n\n1 share of V @ 210\n\n1 share of VOO @ 410\n\nWEBULL account\n\n1.5 share of AFRM @ 130\n\n0.12 share of GOOG @ 2680\n\n1 share of MSFT @ 283\n\n0.5 share of TSLA (Bought @ 700 and sold half @ 1150 \\~10 days ago, totally lucky play)\n\n0.1 share of AMZN @ 3250\n\n1.3 share of FB @ 330\n\n2.5 share of PYPL @ 235 (RIP)\n\n1 share of NVDA @ 200\n\nAs  you can see I have tons of different stocks all over the places, I'm up  about 8% overall even after those retard plays (been adding more  deposits overtime so total principle now is 5.5k) until recently SOFI  start tanking and today a lot of tech stocks tank because of the  treasury yields FUD.\n\nI'm glad that  I started to invest in a relatively young age, and I've been reading a  lot of articles and books to understand the market, but the more i know  the more I don't know. And my biggest problem is I keep looking at my  phone every 5 mins and it has been heavily influence my work life and  life in general negatively.\n\nNow here's my question;\n\nShould  i just put like 75% of my portfolio and a few ETFs so I can actually  enjoy life and not to worry about stock every 5 sec? I would be lying to  say I don't want to make big money quick but I've learn my lesson  knowing I'm not smart or experienced enough to swing trade (or have time  to do so.) I've been looking at putting 50% of my port in QQQ and VOO,  and 20% to SMH and then 20% with specific stocks that i like and 10%  cash. Any recommendation of what kinds of ETFs should I get base on the  stocks that I own rn? I'm still young so I'm fine with higher risk ETFs  plus I only have like 6k in my account so it's not that big of a deal.  But keep tracking on the market has drained my life and i need to get  out of it this swamp.\n\nAny help would be appreciated!\n\nP.S. I will keep putting 2-300 bucks a month in and 500 after I get a raise",

        "selftext": "just watched a video titled the most violent wallstreetbets loses. it was sad and scary. i've never spent any time here but this video made me want to share what i've been doing. i don't do options. i've kinda just been doing my own thing for a year now and have had success. it's the most basic shit, but it does work. i buy a dip, then i sell for a modest markup. genius right? i've experimented with it quite a bit and still try different things, but this is basically what i currently do. i use trading view screener. i configure it to show me the losers for the day. i only look at market cap over 10 billion and US stocks. at the end of the day, if it's down 2% or more, and i know the company, i setup a good till canceled limit order to buy for 2% less than its close price. sometimes i hit it, sometimes i don't. but i always enough orders queued up that i am regularly hitting something. after i hit something i queue up a good till canceled limit order for 8% more than my purchase price. sometimes it sells in a few days, sometimes it sells in a few weeks. how long it takes really doesn't concern me. eventually, it will sell. i don't bother calculating the change and always round down on the closing price and round up on selling price. this squeezes out a little more for me and most of my gains are around 9%. i mainly do this cause i don't want the extra clicks when calculating change. i've tweaked my strategy quite a bit, i started buying 5% dips and selling 5% markup then progressively tweaked my values. i started buying in $2000 chunks, then $5000, now $10,000 is my baseline, $20,000 if i REALLY like the company and would consider it a good long term hold. this comes back to only buying companies you know. companies that are engrained in our society. bank of america, nike, amazon, visa, starbucks, netflix. it's hard to lose betting on these guys. very early on i was hitting 30% monthly returns. i got a little over confident and started doing market orders on anything that was down 5% or more. that didn't work out well for me. all the stuff i'm sitting on in the red is almost all small cap or mid cap i never heard of. focusing on household name large cap has been way better. i've made 250K this year. i have no realized loses. i do have around 200K in unrealized loses, all small cap, but they do sell, eventually. just be patient. i never sell at a loss. i will sit on that shit until i die or they go bankrupt and then i'll get the deduction. spreading your money around in to dozens of stocks minimizes any potential loses or slow turn over. i have cycled through hundreds of stocks and have never had anything go to zero. play around with it, tweak it and refine it and make it your own. lately i've been thinking about trying market orders again but this time with only a 2-4% gain to see if i can capture smaller movements more often and cycle through my inventory quicker. attached a screenshot for reference. my quickest sale was 1 hour and my biggest gain was little under 14%. wishing you guys the best.",

        "selftext": "TLDR: This is not financial advice. I am not a cat. But I am a pussy diamond handing $HYLN options in line at the food bank. #BLESSED\n\n*Best read while listening to* [*Eminem - Without Me* ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVkUvmDQ3HY)\n\nThat's right, your favorite [**$HYLN leaps loss porn star**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p9covz/hyln_leaps_loss_fap_fap_fap/) is back!\n\nMods allow SPACs/deSPACs again + $HYLN over $1.5B MC = **REEEEEEEEEEEEE!**\n\nDespite the depressing downtrend of virtually all SPACs/deSPACs this year, I still believe that $HYLN has potential to be a multi-bagger over the next few years.  As you probably know, $HYLN is transforming the class 8 long haul space with **CNG/RNG fueled trucks** but also have a **roadmap to hydrogen units**. That\u2019s right, hydrogen too! Sort of like $NKLA and $HYZN but with fuel agnostic solutions (gravity is not a fuel source) and without fraud allegations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m8s41j340ly71.jpg?width=543&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc2297cf2e4b6b5fa169f9eae3d57e310704c395\n\n[*Source: INVESTOR PRESENTATION*](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759631/000121390020015311/ea123187ex99-3_tortoiseacq.htm)\n\nHowever, because the feasibility of hydrogen infrastructure reliance is at best a few years away, and fleets are looking to start the green transition now, $HYLN is pouncing to grab that first mover advantage and **leveraging the existing natural gas infrastructure today**. The current CNG/RNG option fuels the **HyperTruck ERX up to 1,000 miles** with a very short refueling time, no long down time charging batteries. No alt energy competitor, not electric based $TSLA, not hydrogen based $NKLA &amp; $HYZN or *insert your EV SPAC bags here* can match this range\u2026 not yet anyway. The long haul space is all about keeping trucks on the road as long as possible and as cheaply as possible, $HYLN does that. And that\u2019s why some of the largest fleets in the country, **Agility Logistics, American Natural Gas, Anheuser-Busch, GreenPath Logistics, NFI, Penske Truck Leasing, Ruan Transportation Management Systems, Ryder System, Inc., Schneider, Wegmans Food Markets, Werner Enterprises**, are all working with $HYLN.  These fleets are investing their time in the **\\[HyperTruck Innovation Council\\] (**[**https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210407005508/en/Hyliion-Forms-Hypertruck-Innovation-Council-to-Advance-Electrification-Solutions-for-Commercial-Transportation-Industry**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210407005508/en/Hyliion-Forms-Hypertruck-Innovation-Council-to-Advance-Electrification-Solutions-for-Commercial-Transportation-Industry) to ensure that $HYLN products are designed and developed with their constraints and needs in mind. These guys aren't wasting their time, they want and need to start the transition to greener fleets asap. If you know anything about the natural cycle of fleet management, fleets turn over every 4-6 years and then the trucks are sold in a secondary market. This means that if a fleet wants to be fully green in 4-6 years they need to start the rotation today. With that said, these fleets represent over **100K trucks** and converting just a fraction of these trucks each year is enough for $HYLN to reach its revenue forecasts, always a legitimate concern for pre-revenue investors.\n\n*So what about those sales, I don\u2019t see them?*\n\nPiss off, $HYLN is a pre-revenue company, we all know this. Even their own forecasts for 2021 are immaterial ($8M). But they start to ramp up significantly in 2022. Although they are likely to fall short of their 2021 targets, they have stated many times they **will be booking revenue in 2021**, can't say that for many of these pre-rev companies. Regardless, you should be **investing for the growth story** here not the current fundamentals. Missing those insignificant 2021 sales mean nothing under virtually any valuation model.  But if they drastically miss targets in 2-3 years then it becomes a real issue. So with that said, lets take a look at the forecasts from the investor presentation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b5esizh80ly71.jpg?width=559&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed12609ec5b7d0f6e2cfa83afc06fe55f8d28f7d\n\n[*Source: INVESTOR PRESENTATION*](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759631/000121390020015311/ea123187ex99-3_tortoiseacq.htm)\n\nWith these forecasts we can start to run valuation models, nerds bums r wet right now. For example, we can take their EBITDA projections to build out a valuation model that focuses on operating profitable, aka corporate tendies. Accounting 101, EBITDA is basically net income before adjusting for other items such as interest payments, taxes and depreciation/amortization. However, the crux of the EBITDA models are the assumptions, notably the EBITDA multiple and discount rate.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the EBITDA multiple, its not a exact science and to complicate things there really isn\u2019t any obvious direct competitor to pull comparable data. $HYLN is sort of a truck manufacturer and sort of a disruptive tech company. Data on US Class 8 truck sales shows that Freightliner (Daimler), Kenworth (PACCAR) and Peterbilt (PACCAR) are the three largest manufacturers, and account for roughly 2/3 of all sales. We will use theses as proxy manufacturers comps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3kc7zb5b0ly71.jpg?width=530&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50f8a6175f4fdc38011e60749efe4e0d4e3d34c1\n\n[Source: STATISTA](https://www.statista.com/statistics/245369/cloass-8-truck-sales-by-manfuacturer/)\n\nBut, as I mentioned, they are also sort of a disruptive tech company too. I don\u2019t want to compare them to $TSLA, they are in their own class. But its worth looking at $TSLA\u2019s EBITDA multiple to get some perspective of disruptive tech valuations. Below are the EBITDA multiples \u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wr0up07e0ly71.jpg?width=297&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25d75856dd5cfbd198da4485da4f8bebc562bb50\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a3aou27e0ly71.jpg?width=289&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94aeb05c69b27d98bb1658a30f1e8552efc0d685\n\n[*Source : FINBOX* ](https://finbox.com/OTCPK:DMLR.Y/explorer/ev_to_ebitda_ltm)\n\nWe can see that these EV/EBITDA multiples are fairly stable for both Daimler and PACCAR, but spike in 2020. This spike is, at least partially, due to the economic shock of the pandemic, EBITDA shrunk at a faster rate than enterprise value. Therefore, to be conservative, I\u2019ll use the median EV/EBITDA multiples from 2016 to 2020 to help remove that noise. These **median ratios are 11.3x and 10.8x**, pretty close to each other. On the other hand, $TSLA\u2019s multiples are very volatile, largely because it\u2019s has been a growth story (less EBTIDA during growth phase) and has experienced wild stock price swings, so I\u2019m not even going to provided that chart but, just for perspective, the LTM (Last Twelve Month) EBITDA multiple currently sits at **169.9x**.  $TSLA shorts r fuk\u2026\n\nSensitivity analysis with different multiples can help us assess enterprise value and stock price under different assumptions. I\u2019ll use a 10X multiple as a proxy for direct manufacturer (Daimler and PACCAR comps), 15X to add a little disruptive/growth story value and 30X to add even more. That being said, IMO, 15X seems to be a fair. And because $HYLN basically has no debt and the cash it has will be allocated to burn to bring products to market, I\u2019ll consider enterprise value = market cap for this analysis. This is an oversimplification but as you\u2019ve seen even the selection of multiples are up for interpretation so let\u2019s just keep it simple for the smooth brains.\n\nIn addition, I will be very conservative and use a discount rate of 25% which accounts for not only increasing rates, iNFlaTioN Is TRanSiTorY, but a significant risk premium as $HYLN tries to carve out a new market. For context, discount rates are generally in the range of 10-20%.\n\nThe first valuation model is the **BULL CASE** which assumes $HYLN actually meets their 2024 projections, this doesn\u2019t even consider the potential to surpass them. We can take their 2024 EBITDA, markup the terminal value with the multiple and discount back three years at 25%. This gives a stock price range of **$17.81 to $53.43 today**, depending on which multiple you believe is most comparable. Again, IMO the 15X is appropriate and results in a share price of $26.72 today, hence my JAN2022 20c, RIP.  Keep in mind this is only accounting for the first three years of growth and this is a growth story. If year 2025 and 2026 growth out paces the discount rate effect it would add more present value  (PV) to the market cap. But I\u2019m not going to enter the echo chamber and create my own bullish forecasts to 2026, a typical five year forecast. I decided to conservatively stick with these short term growth prospects effectively capping these valuations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8bj4meh0ly71.jpg?width=393&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03a8814280e23cebb768b5d2e4a8068ec41f705c\n\n*Ok ok, but those are $HYLN\u2019s own forecasts, come on man they are pumping the stock! REEEEEEE!*\n\nUgh, you\u2019re still reading this Vyvanse induced babble? Ok fine, so let\u2019s make a **BEAR CASE** that $HYLN only achieves 2/3 of their forecasted revenue. Holding all other assumptions constant, our range dips to **$11.88 to $35.64**, about 30% to 400% higher than the closing stock price Monday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0fj61epi0ly71.jpg?width=405&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f439f7b7273714400874871011d42fd1fb6b011e\n\n*Me no like math, me smooth brain!*\n\nCorrect and you smol pp too. Anyway, forecasts are nice but let\u2019s explore how they might achieve them. As mentioned, don\u2019t underestimate the value of having 100K trucks represented in the HyperTruck Innovation Council, expect some firm sales at some point. If $HYLN can prove their solution works, this council alone could fill the 19K ERX forecasts in 2024 as they naturally turn over their fleets. On top that, there are several publicly known non-binding reservation. For example, [**American Natural Gas**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201015005658/en/Hyliion-Announces-Natural-Gas-Fueling-Partnership-with-American-Natural-Gas) and [**Detmar Logistics**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210802005269/en/Detmar-Logistics-Reserves-300-Hyliion-Hypertruck-ERX%E2%84%A2-Units-Expanding-Fleet-Electrification-Collaboration)  both have locked in their early interest and are likely convert to firm sales. On that note, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to hear about more reservations at ER this week. Or, at the latest, end of year as $HYLN is currently on their [**Nationwide Hypertruck ERX roadshow**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211105005238/en/ADDING-MULTIMEDIA-Hyliion-Announces-Nationwide-Hypertruck-ERX-Marketing-Roadshow-Kickoff) marketing the ERX demo units first hand. However, I think the political connections at $HYLN is the real sleeper. Elaine Chao, the former Secretary of Transportation and wife of Mitch McConnell, current Senate Minority Leader, is on the $HYLN board. Politicians are greasy weasels by nature, don\u2019t be shocked when strings are pulled and back room deals are made to toss some contract scraps at $HYLN.**Connections = Contracts**. Even more evidence is that $HYLN was brought public by Tortoise Acquisition, who clearly played the long game and strategically planted Mitch as their turtle in the Senate. #FACTS\n\nSome things I am watching for at ER and beyond are obviously the aforementioned reservation and sales number, the stock isn\u2019t going anywhere without these. But even without those, share accumulation is likely to play a big role in the short term price action. Many of the bag holders have capitalized on the dip to average down. Additionally, institutions such as BlackRock significantly increased their holdings last quarter. With 13-F\u2019s coming out shortly, more institutional buying will be a very bullish signal. Looking at the charts, we see a quadruple bottom that was defended, this is a key range of accumulation. Just now we are starting to see a break out of the downward channel. If this upward movement continues it has space to run IMO. On every dip the rocket fueled up the tanks, and this bish is loaded for Jupiter. Additionally, $HYLN also has a reasonably high short interest, yahoo finance has it 20.6% as of Oct 14. That\u2019s about 9-10 days to cover those shorts on average volume. Therefore, if $HYLN releases new information at ER, Wegmans Demo day includes a sales announcement or the potential Rivian IPO madness bleeds into the EV sector this could snowball into a parabolic short term move.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rlcj5xvm0ly71.jpg?width=624&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85cbb91e1d3f9503a36482bf1e6f0bb2169c250b\n\nUpdated leaps position\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lj8t10wn0ly71.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9720afda93ab556ee367474bb3288fd913870414",
