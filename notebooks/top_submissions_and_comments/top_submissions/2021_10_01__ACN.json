        "selftext": "Safe-T Group (NASDAQ: SFET) Revenue Growth Hits New Record Amid Growing Enterprise And Consumer Cybersecurity Threats\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe world is facing another pandemic alongside COVID: cyber-attacks. In 2020, malware and ransomware exponentially surged by 358% and 435%, respectively, compared to 2019. The severe lack of existing cybersecurity measures combined with the COVID-induced work-from-home (WFM) environment has created a perfect storm for cyber thieves to attack vulnerabilities.\u00a0\n\nAccording to [Retarus.com](https://www.retarus.com/blog/en/alarming-cybersecurity-statistics-for-2021-and-the-future/), an average of $2.9 million is lost to cybercrime every minute. In 2020, the average data breach cost reached $3.86 million. Equally as concerning is the fact that the average time it took to identify and contain a breach in 2020 was an eye-popping 280 days. Overall, cybercrime activity is projected to cost $10.5 trillion annually by 2025 on a global scale.\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s cyber breach in August 2021 is the latest major hack to hit and marks the carrier\u2019s fourth such attack since 2015. The scope and investigation into the hack are still ongoing, but [T-Mobile](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/t-mobile-data-breach-more-than-50-million-people-now-affected/) says the cyberattack allowed hackers to obtain personal sensitive information from over 50 million customers. Information stolen included customer names, addresses, phone numbers, account PINs, dates of birth, and more.\u00a0\n\nIt has never been more urgent for enterprises, governments, and consumers to take cyber threats seriously and improve digital security measures. **Safe-T Group, Ltd**. \n\n[**SFET** \\+1.85%](https://benzinga.com/stock/sfet#NASDAQ) [**(Get Free Alerts for SFET)**](https://benzinga.com/profile/portfolio/?add_ticker=sfet) is one emerging cybersecurity [company](https://www.safe-t.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Safe-T-Group.pdf) that is benefitting from the heightened awareness surrounding cyber vulnerabilities.\n\n### Overview: Safe-T Group\n\nSafe-T Group is a global cybersecurity and privacy solutions provider to enterprises and consumers. The company [operates](https://www.safe-t.com/) three main business segments: enterprise cybersecurity, enterprise privacy solutions, and consumer-focused cybersecurity &amp; privacy solutions. Founded in 2013, the Israel-based company has relied on an aggressive growth business model, centered around organic growth of innovative solutions and strategic merger &amp; acquisition deals with complementary businesses and technologies.\n\n### Enterprise Cybersecurity\n\nSafe-T Group\u2019s enterprise cybersecurity solutions are focused on on-demand, software-defined perimeter solutions. This essentially allows enterprises to protect access to their sensitive data by creating a separate access layer from the authentication layer.\u00a0\n\nZoneZero\u00ae is a zero-trust network access (ZTNA) solution designed to help organizations to adopt more effective security, based on the \"never trust, always verify\" principle. ZoneZero\u00ae orchestrates the organization\u2019s access, identity, and MFA solutions, creating a Zero Trust Access fabric that both unifies and controls all access use cases and scenarios, simply and seamlessly.\n\nWith its fully transparent, simple deployment, Safe-T provides an innovative and unique network-centric ability to implement ZTNA within corporate networks.\u00a0 Working side-by-side and in conjunction with all access points (VPNs, firewalls), identity security solutions, and application services, seamless integration across all legacy infrastructure and authentication services is enabled.\n\nWhether in an office or WFH, Safe-T\u2019s enterprise cybersecurity solutions are a viable solution to secure network access for on-premise and hybrid cloud environments. The innovative technology is also the only secure access platform available that can integrate with existing virtual private network (VPN) platforms or replace existing infrastructure. This means that contractors working from home with or without a VPN, or an in-house worker can all have secured access and protection against cyber vulnerabilities. Unlike standard access solutions, Safe-T\u2019s enterprise cybersecurity solutions can control access based on the user\u2019s identity and role within the organization.\n\n### Enterprise Cybersecurity Sales &amp; Growth Strategy\n\nThe enterprise cybersecurity sales and growth strategy utilizes an indirect sales model that features engagement with global top-tier partners that have a strong background in the cybersecurity field and maintain large sales teams. Top-tier partners include distributors, resellers, integrators, Managed Security Service Providers (MSSP), and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) (white-label or branded) located around the world. Among the company's tier-1 partners and distributors are Fujitsu, Accenture, Edvance, DataGroupIT, and more.\n\nThe key benefits of utilizing this model are scalability, cost-effectiveness, sector expertise, and knowledge of their respective local market. Safe-T provides its top-tier partners with the ability to offer innovative cybersecurity solutions not available anywhere else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the full article and disclosures, visit:\n\nhttps://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/21/08/22676970/safe-t-group-nasdaq-sfet-revenue-growth-hits-new-record-amid-growing-enterprise-and-consumer-cybers",
