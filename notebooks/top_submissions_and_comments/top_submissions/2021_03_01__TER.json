I\u2019ll summarise below\n\n3 main reasons why I like this stock:\n\n* Overall semiconductor market future\n* Finances and balance sheet\n* Cathie Wood investment\n\n2 possible downsides:\n\n* Low future earnings forecasts\n* Recent price volatility\n\nFuture\n\nAlmost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:\n\n* The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold.\n* The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers.\n* Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc.\n* Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology\n* Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology\n* Automated manufacturing\n\nEven without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:\n\n* [Samsung\u2019s $17bn factory](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/319926-samsung-files-documents-to-build-new-17-billion-fab-in-the-united-states)\n* [TSM\u2019s $12bn plant](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/15/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-a-12-billion-chip-pl.aspx)\n* [Intel\u2019s $7bn plant, completed in 2020](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145990-intel-fab-42-now-ready-pump-leading-edge-products/)\n* [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)\n\nAll of this will require automation and testing.\n\nLong-term, it\u2019s very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:\n\n* 5G technology being rolled out worldwide\n* Space technology &amp; tourism growth\n* AI &amp; data technology\n\nThe biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.\n\nFurthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *\u201ceconomy opening up means a move away from tech\u201c* as it\u2019s not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.\n\nFinances\n\nEven during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.\n\nThey grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.\n\nEarnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*\n\nWhen taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.\n\nFrom a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.\n\nCathie Wood Investment\n\nCathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.\n\nExtra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.\n\nPossible Downsides\n\nSome analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.\n\nFurthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.\n\nSummary\n\nTeradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.",

        "selftext": "My fellow autists, degenerates, gambling addicts, and of course, my dear retards: It is I - u/pltr_gang_rise_up and I am here to share with you a true post in the spirits of WallStreetBets and would like to put on your radar - SOXL. \n\n**Backstory:**\n\n**Semiconductors,** as most are aware, are in short supply. There has been some movement by world leaders to improve supply chains in order to get the semiconductors to the place they need to be. Some car manufacturers have had to cut production in vehicles due to this ongoing issue. I believe this issue will be fixed in due time, but probably not in the immediate future. \n\n**What is SOXL?**\n\n**SOXL** is a Leveraged ETF that invests in the biggest semiconductor manufacturers in the world (INTC, AMD, QCOM, TSM, etc). \n\nBe careful, this is a \"Leveraged\" ETF - and therefore it's rather aggressive and aiming for high returns. Do some more research here if you want. Essentially it means, if the sector of semiconductors does well, the fund will do well. \n\n**Breakdown:**\n\nNow, they recently had a 15:1 split on their shares, which were trading at about $636 in February. This brought the public float to **99.40M.**\n\nWhen looking into a company, I like to start with what they own, followed by who owns them.\n\n**What they own:**\n\nHere is a breakdown of the assets that SOXL owns with their 1.46bn market cap:\n\nDreyfus Government Cash Management Institutional Shs\t11.00%\n\nFinancial Square Treasury Instruments Fund FST Shares\t9.39%\n\nBroadcom Inc.\t5.22%\n\nQualcomm Inc.\t4.96%\n\nIntel Corp.\t4.94%\n\nTexas Instruments Inc.\t4.88%\n\nNVIDIA \t4.67%\n\nMicron Technology Inc.\t2.81%\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. ADR\tTSM\t2.69%\n\nAnalog Devices Inc.\t2.54%\n\nApplied Materials Inc.\t2.51%\n\nLam Research Corp.\t2.50%\n\nKLA Corp.\t2.41%\n\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.\t2.40%\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc.\t2.37%\n\nASML Holding N.V.\t2.22%\n\nMicrochip Technology Inc.\t2.16%\n\nXilinx Inc.\t2.01%\t\n\nMarvell Technology Group Ltd.\t1.92%\n\nSkyworks Solutions Inc.\t1.53%\n\nTeradyne Inc.\t1.20%\n\nQorvo Inc.\t1.14%\n\nMonolithic Power Systems MPWR\t0.99%\n\nON Semiconductor Corp.\t0.81%\n\nEntegris Inc.\t0.78%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now, I'm not sure what the first two are, but that throws up a potential flag.** These two entities represent nearly 20% of the portfolio owned. It could be nothing more than some type of government investment in such a company, as it is critical right now. \n\n**Who owns them?:**\n\nLooks like mostly hedge funds. No one really of note other than Citadel and Susquehanna. \n\n**Short Interest:**\n\nNot a heavily shorted stock. About 3.4m shares are available to short with a ratio of about 25%.\n\n**Technicals** (got me excited):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7ndly6se1m61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=698eae9b1d4ff4726eac546d2a6a8f4bb753fbc6\n\nHere we have a bounce just under the (white) 200sma. On this 4h chart, the bottom represents the buy/sell volume over time. the middle represents where we're at in terms of a squeeze. You also can see heavy buy volume at the bottom followed by a potential turn up ahead in the next few days. TONS of buy volume since the beginning of the month. \n\nThe daily was also looking nice:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/id2j5879f1m61.png?width=452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23cbb6a2b7af021cadc9d35a9d2f8413c636cb90\n\nThere is an AIM on the indicator, meaning at this point the next logical step might be a shot to the upside in the next week. There was heavy call and put volume on the $37 strike, which seemed quite coincidental. Why that level? There were more calls than puts. The OI is still over 10k on the option. \n\nMy target is $42 by 3/19. But I encourage you to do your own analysis and come up with your own targets. I happen to think this is a good potential trade. I think in this case, the probability in my belief is to the upside.",

        "selftext": "Teradyne Inc, Ticker: **TER (+38% mentions)**\n\nMarket cap: $19.5Bn\n\nTeradyne Inc supplies automation test equipment for semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronic systems in the consumer electronic, automotive, industrial, communications and aerospace sector.\n\nEssentially, the chip powering the phone or laptop you are reading this from has most likely been tested by Teradyne.\n\nTeradynes biggest customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, Boeing, Texas Instruments, 3M, and IBM.\n\nDon\u2019t have time to read the whole thing? I\u2019ll summarise below\n\n3 main reasons why I like this stock:\n\n* Overall semiconductor market future\n* Finances and balance sheet\n* Cathie Wood investment\n\n2 possible downsides:\n\n* Low future earnings forecasts\n* Recent price volatility\n\n### Future\n\nAlmost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:\n\n* The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold.\n* The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers.\n* Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc.\n* Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology\n* Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology\n* Automated manufacturing\n\nEven without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:\n\n* [Samsung\u2019s $17bn factory](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/319926-samsung-files-documents-to-build-new-17-billion-fab-in-the-united-states)\n* [TSM\u2019s $12bn plant](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/15/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-a-12-billion-chip-pl.aspx)\n* [Intel\u2019s $7bn plant, completed in 2020](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145990-intel-fab-42-now-ready-pump-leading-edge-products/)\n* [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)\n\nAll of this will require automation and testing.\n\nLong-term, it\u2019s very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:\n\n* 5G technology being rolled out worldwide\n* Space technology &amp; tourism growth\n* AI &amp; data technology\n\nThe biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.\n\nFurthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *\u201ceconomy opening up means a move away from tech\u201c* as it\u2019s not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.\n\n### Finances\n\nEven during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.\n\nThey grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img et37l5sf9ln61...*\n\nEarnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*\n\nWhen taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.\n\nFrom a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.\n\n### Cathie Wood Investment\n\nCathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.\n\nExtra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.\n\n### Possible Downsides\n\nSome analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.\n\nFurthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Choppy price action for TER this year, dropping from all time highs of $148.](https://preview.redd.it/lxmx8hhh9ln61.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec2e87089db55b57a7494d10096876124ffd1b66)\n\n### Summary\n\nTeradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNone of this is financial advice, only my personal opinion. please do your own research before dealing into any stocks.",
