        "selftext": "Global datastream is exploding (clouds, sensors, internet,...) and these systems/devices can't hold this anymore. The world is looking for solutions. Because of the **numerous advantages of \"photons\" (light) in comparison with \"electrons\"**, photonic circuits (to \"use\" this photons) will be implemented in almost every electronic device (**datacom, 5G, LiDAR , medical devices, sensors, quantum computing, neurotrophic computing,...**) and thereby replacing the old, expensive and limiting electronic structures, in the near future (couple years from today).\n\n**Just like the internet, hydrogen, electric vehicles, green stocks,...the photonic circuit market is forecasted to take off.** Timing: we are now at the inflection point. The global market for Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) is projected to reach US$3.7 billion by the year 2027, trailing a post COVID-19 **CAGR of 22.7%** over the analysis 2020 through 2027.\n\nAfter years of development by a topclass highly experienced team, **POET Technologies (POETF)** now has the technology (the \"POET interposer platform\") to use photons in devices with outstanding performance, well covered by &gt;70 patents. POETs solution eliminates costly discrete component testing and packaging processes because it is produced with all the customer's custom componentry at wafer scale (nothing needs to be soldered, connected, positioned and so forth later on, after the chips have been sliced and diced out of their wafer). Each interposer is tested and verified while it is still within the wafer with its hundreds of siblings. Imagine the time a cost savings of being able to do that. Potential customers: facebook, broadcom, arista, nokia, alibaba, accelink, jabil, delta, hisense, huawei,... They also have **4 committed customers** (POET said they will announce more info soon), lots of requested **samples**, two **design wins** and a joint venture with **SANAN IC** for mass production soon. **Nasdaq** (in q4/q1) ticker \"POET\" is reserved. Their first market of interest is **datacom**. Price target: **9,56usd**, 12-18 months (Investment bank IBK Capital Corp). **DD/POET: reddit page.**\n\n**Other companies diving into photonics: Lightwave Logic, Intel, NeoPhotonics -**\\&gt; check them out as well. They have very good/brilliant tech, but, they all still have fundamental flaws that POET's optical interposer platform improves upon. Photonic devices depend on a high coupling of light. POET's waveguides are low (light) loss. Intel and Cisco's solutions are high loss in comparison. POET's solution can work with a wide variety of light, from visible to near infrared. Intel and Cisco's solutions can't. Intel and Cisco's solution have no micro-optics integration capability where as POET's platform does. Perhaps most importantly, Intel and Cisco's solution can't scale, where as POET's can. A **partnership** with for example LWLG (skyrocketed in june) is absolutely possible.\n\nA product (the POET interposer platform) that completely outperforms (e.g. most versatile, lowest noice, lowest costs, highest speed) the current industry standard in a huge new market in front of us, I personally think that's **very interesting, so I want to share this with everyone here** (I read here: \"don't hesitate to tell us about a ticker we should know about\"). Also, most people still don't know this is happening. I hope everyone can at least think about it. I hope we can have a **nice conversation** about this and share our thoughts. Questions can be asked. For people downvoting or nonbelievers, I want to hear **your opinion**. Thanks to everyone in advance. Not financial advice.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 1st, 2021.\n\n# **Markets could be challenged in the week ahead as the Fed prepares to reverse easy policy - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/29/markets-could-be-challenged-in-the-week-ahead-as-the-fed-prepares-to-reverse-easy-policy.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve is expected to take its first major step away from the easy policy it put in place to fight the pandemic, a milestone on the road back toward normal.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday is the big event for markets in the week ahead. The central bank is widely expected to announce that it will begin to unwind its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases and end the program entirely by the middle of next year.\n*****\n&gt; Economic data will also be important, with the October jobs report on Friday. There are dozens of earnings expected, including pharmaceuticals like Pfizer and Moderna, as well as a host of travel, energy, insurance, and tech companies.\n*****\n&gt; The Bank of England also meets Thursday, and it is expected to raise interest rates. The move comes after rate hikes by South Korea, Norway and others.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is part of a global move to remove accommodation, and the market drives right past that,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group CIO Peter Boockvar said. \u201cIn a way, the stock market is playing a game of chicken, with this inflation move and interest rates and the response from central banks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Inflation has been running at a 30-year high. Core PCE inflation \u2014 which is the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge \u2014jumped 3.6% in September on a year-over-year basis, the same as in August.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher on the week, with the S&amp;P 500 up about 1.1% as of Friday afternoon and up roughly 6.7% for the month of October. Both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 notched new highs in the past week. The widely watched 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.53% Friday afternoon.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere is an incredible level of complacency out there in this environment,\u201d Boockvar said.\n*****\n&gt; Other events the markets are monitoring include the gathering of world leaders at the G-20 in Italy and the United Nations climate summit COP26, beginning Sunday in Scotland.\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Wild week\u2019\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a wild week,\u201d Wells Fargo\u2019s Michael Schumacher said. He noted that the Fed\u2019s action will dominate the week, and the jobs report will be secondary.\n*****\n&gt; Wells Fargo economists expect 390,000 jobs were added in October and average hourly earnings grew by 0.4%, he noted. Payrolls were up just 194,000 in September. Schumacher said inflation is the biggest concern in the markets, so the wage data will be most closely watched.\n*****\n&gt; Schumacher said the market is widely expecting the Fed to announce it will reduce its bond purchases by $15 billion a month, starting either in November or December. The central bank implemented its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program in early 2020, as it slashed rates and introduced programs to buy a range of assets to help keep the markets liquid.\n*****\n&gt; Now, as the program is being wound down, it is what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell says about inflation that matters most because that will drive interest rate expectations.\n*****\n&gt; Yet, Powell is expected to stress that the Fed is not automatically going to raise interest rates once the bond purchases end in the middle of next year. Traders are pricing in as many as three interest rate hikes next year, but in the latest Fed forecast, only half of central bank officials agreed there should be even one.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe inflation commentary is a lot more important,\u201d Schumacher said. \u201cPowell has sounded concerned about expectations getting baked in.\u201d He noted that the 2-year yield, which most reflects the Fed, has risen more than 30 basis points since the last Fed meeting five weeks ago.\n*****\n&gt; Schumacher said market expectations for rate hikes may be overdone, and that he does not expect a move until the beginning of 2023. \u201cThe direction is right, but the speed is wrong,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Powell\u2019s comments will be closely watched for any adjustment in his thinking on inflation. The Fed had described the surge in rates as \u201ctransitory\u201d or temporary. The consumer price index has been running above 5%, and core CPI was at 4% in September.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe general feeling among central bankers and the major central banks is this inflation rate will come back down,\u201d TIAA Bank president of world markets Chris Gaffney said. \u201cNobody is using \u2018transitory\u2019 anymore, but they don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re going to have prolonged high inflation.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Gaffney said the weaker-than-expected 2% growth in third-quarter gross domestic product could help the Fed convince the markets that it intends to keep rates lower for longer.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs long as they stay accommodative, I think the recovery continues,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m fairly bullish for the markets going forward. We\u2019ll certainly see a lot more choppiness, but I still think the global economy, the U.S. economy particularly, is right now a great environment for corporations. We\u2019re seeing fairly positive earnings reports, and more importantly expectations for future earnings.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; There have been some high-profile misses, including both Apple and Amazon this past week. Both their stocks fell, weighing on the Nasdaq down Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEarnings overall have been good, but there\u2019s still a lot of profit margin challenges out there,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cThere\u2019s no better example than Apple and Amazon.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kID8drk.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kpeo12w.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/mgqDnIk.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/feNGOpc.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GDzFNzM.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/r8J2LuB.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qWy1mUR.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kGexB3t.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/K4NfO23.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TglfDZd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/2HOk4x5.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/vcv5Pne.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GgX6FOh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/PmzM56I.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/d5RZesR.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # November\u2019s First Trading Day: DJIA Up Over 1% Three Years in a Row\n\n&gt; Based upon data in the 2022 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac on page 90, the first trading day of November is the fourth best of all monthly first trading days since September 1997 based upon total DJIA point gained. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have all advanced 13 times over the last 21 years. Average performance on the day ranges from a low of 0.17% by S&amp;P 500 to 0.28% by NASDAQ over the 21-year time period.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0362ad93159683f932d60b790bfa9ac8/e57961a120ac1354-3a/s500x750/517dc1575ee1212443153f2b842289d3b9eda639.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Here Comes One of the Best Days of the Year (and the Best Week and Month)\n\n&gt; The calendar is about to do a lot of favors for the bulls, as late October and early November historically are quite strong.\n\n&gt; October 28 was the best day of the year, until it fell more than 3% last year, but this day is still one of the strongest days historically for stocks. Not to be outdone though, October 29 and November 2 and 3 are also some of the better days of the year. \u201cI\u2019d like to think it has something to do with my birthday being on October 28, but the truth is bulls should be aware that the coming days are historically some of the best of the year,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the single best day to buy at the close and hold for the next five trading days is today, October 27. Yes, these 5 days were lower last year by 0.6%, but you have to go back to the late 1960s to see the last time they were down two years in a row.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, November has been quite strong historically. In fact, since 1950, and the past 10 years, it is the best month of the year, while it ranks second over the past 20 years and during a post-election year. \u201cNovember is the best month of the year, but it doesn\u2019t seem to get nearly as much love as you\u2019d think,\u201d added Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe all assume December is the best month, but November is actually better and gets very little fanfare. Maybe it should be a month for the bulls, not for turkeys.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Year\u2019s Best 3-Month Span About To Start\n\n&gt; November, December and January constitute the year\u2019s seasonally strongest 3-month period for the S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones Industrials and the NASDAQ Composite. This seasonal strength is created by a combination of the annual, semiannual and quarterly operations of institutions and the habitual behavior of retail investors and consumers.\n\n&gt; The November-January 3-month span has produced a gain of 4.3% for the S&amp;P 500 &amp; DJIA since 1949. October-December runs a close second at 4.1% for S&amp;P and 3.9% for DJIA. Since 1971 NASDAQ has gained a whopping 6.3% November-January with December-February in second at 5.0% and October-December in third at4.4%.\n\n&gt; These charts also highlight the Best and Worst Months of the year with the Best running from October/November to April/May/June and the Worst from May/June/July to September/October. Stocks have been firming up since we issued our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal to subscribers on October 8 and look poised for a solid yearend rally that continues into early 2022.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e010745ce0513ef26c01ad558f3324d0/5de97b698922b56d-fc/s500x750/77e7204b6cd2e2850a23200d70c176145dea1f34.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/bd388d961bd47113bc428f68d2326639/5de97b698922b56d-6f/s500x750/f04c4e20d4d9d98fd0b02b7f8472b21dfd8fa543.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a218e808de4cf5062ba7fe2829c50222/5de97b698922b56d-58/s500x750/0adaf5599c04919e8fb8fca7e5a5129f414f0ccb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Short Term Breadth Takes Off\n\n&gt; One of the points noted about the recent moves for the S&amp;P 500 over the past few days have been on the outsized impacts of big gains or losses in names like Tesla (TSLA) or Facebook (FB). In spite of the impacts of those single names, the S&amp;P 500's return to record highs has happened on very strong breadth across sectors. Below, we show 10-day advance-decline line charts from our Sector Snapshot.\n\n&gt; The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average daily number of advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last ten trading days. It's a short-term breadth measure that traders use to measure how extended the market is at the moment. Very high readings suggest that the market might be overbought in the near term, and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low readings suggest the opposite -- that the market might be oversold in the near term, and upside mean reversion can be expected.\n\n&gt; For the broad S&amp;P 500, the 10-day AD line has hit the highest level since February 12th. Going back to 1990, the current reading stands in the 97th percentile. Looking at each sector, most lines are also in the upper decile of readings since 1990 and only two are not currently overbought: Communication Services and Consumer Staples. Meanwhile, some like Technology and Real Estate are a full two standard deviations above the historical norm. In fact, the Tech sector's line is the most elevated relative to its respective history of any sector with the current reading in the 98th percentile of all periods. The last time that the line was as elevated as now was in November of last year. No other sector has as long of a gap in time in which it has seen levels similar to the current reading. Most other sectors have seen higher readings as recently as August or September, though current levels are nonetheless elevated. The market has had quite the run over the last two weeks, and we'd expect some sort of cool-off period soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102621-AD-Lines.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # High Number of Record Highs\n\n&gt; Major US equity indices have returned to all-time highs in the second half of October with the S&amp;P 500 and Dow both hitting record levels today. Meanwhile, the NASDAQ Composite is roughly a quarter of one percent away and the closest to a new all-time high since the last one on September 7th. The Russell 2,000, on the other hand, is at the high end of the past several months' range, but it is still over 2% below its high from March 15th.\n\n&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 having been at new highs over the past few days, it has made 57 new all-time highs year to date. As shown in the top-left chart below, there have only been three other years in the past that have seen more record highs during the full course of the year: 2017 (62), 1964 (67), and 1995 (78). For the other major indices, the pace of record highs is less impressive but still strong. The Dow has made 38 new highs in 2021 which is more than triple the historical average. This year is on pace to see the highest number of record highs for the index since 2017 when it tied 1991 for the record of 71 closes at an all-time high. The NASDAQ Composite has also seen a solid number of highs at 36 which is well above the historical average of 19 per year historically. Given the index has been rangebound essentially all year, the Russell 2,000, conversely, has only seen 13 closing record highs. That is the same number as last year and it is actually below the average of 20 per year historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102621-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Steps Back\n\n&gt; The weekly sentiment survey from AAII saw a surge in optimism in recent weeks, but it took a step back this week even with the S&amp;P 500 at new highs. Bullish sentiment fell from a recent high of 46.9% down to 39.8% this week. Outside of last week, that is still the highest level since the first week of September.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Bulls.png))**\n\n&gt; While bullish sentiment saw a significant 7.1 percentage point drop, a relatively small share of those losses turned to the bearish camp. Bearish sentiment only rose 1.6 percentage points to 29.4%. That is still below levels from two weeks ago and is in line with the average from throughout the summer.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Bears.png))**\n\n&gt; The corresponding moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread to fall but bulls continue to outweigh bears by 10.4 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; As previously mentioned, the largest share of losses to bulls did not go to bears, but instead were picked up by those reporting neutral sentiment. That reading moved back above 30% this week gaining 5.3 percentage points. Again, that does not mark any sort of new high or low but instead brings sentiment back to similar levels seen only a month or two ago.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 29th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J1pI0oKgfc))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.31.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULZcEQ_jrGQ))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 1st, 2021.\n\n# **Markets could be challenged in the week ahead as the Fed prepares to reverse easy policy - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/29/markets-could-be-challenged-in-the-week-ahead-as-the-fed-prepares-to-reverse-easy-policy.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve is expected to take its first major step away from the easy policy it put in place to fight the pandemic, a milestone on the road back toward normal.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday is the big event for markets in the week ahead. The central bank is widely expected to announce that it will begin to unwind its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases and end the program entirely by the middle of next year.\n*****\n&gt; Economic data will also be important, with the October jobs report on Friday. There are dozens of earnings expected, including pharmaceuticals like Pfizer and Moderna, as well as a host of travel, energy, insurance, and tech companies.\n*****\n&gt; The Bank of England also meets Thursday, and it is expected to raise interest rates. The move comes after rate hikes by South Korea, Norway and others.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is part of a global move to remove accommodation, and the market drives right past that,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group CIO Peter Boockvar said. \u201cIn a way, the stock market is playing a game of chicken, with this inflation move and interest rates and the response from central banks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Inflation has been running at a 30-year high. Core PCE inflation \u2014 which is the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge \u2014jumped 3.6% in September on a year-over-year basis, the same as in August.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher on the week, with the S&amp;P 500 up about 1.1% as of Friday afternoon and up roughly 6.7% for the month of October. Both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 notched new highs in the past week. The widely watched 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.53% Friday afternoon.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere is an incredible level of complacency out there in this environment,\u201d Boockvar said.\n*****\n&gt; Other events the markets are monitoring include the gathering of world leaders at the G-20 in Italy and the United Nations climate summit COP26, beginning Sunday in Scotland.\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Wild week\u2019\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a wild week,\u201d Wells Fargo\u2019s Michael Schumacher said. He noted that the Fed\u2019s action will dominate the week, and the jobs report will be secondary.\n*****\n&gt; Wells Fargo economists expect 390,000 jobs were added in October and average hourly earnings grew by 0.4%, he noted. Payrolls were up just 194,000 in September. Schumacher said inflation is the biggest concern in the markets, so the wage data will be most closely watched.\n*****\n&gt; Schumacher said the market is widely expecting the Fed to announce it will reduce its bond purchases by $15 billion a month, starting either in November or December. The central bank implemented its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program in early 2020, as it slashed rates and introduced programs to buy a range of assets to help keep the markets liquid.\n*****\n&gt; Now, as the program is being wound down, it is what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell says about inflation that matters most because that will drive interest rate expectations.\n*****\n&gt; Yet, Powell is expected to stress that the Fed is not automatically going to raise interest rates once the bond purchases end in the middle of next year. Traders are pricing in as many as three interest rate hikes next year, but in the latest Fed forecast, only half of central bank officials agreed there should be even one.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe inflation commentary is a lot more important,\u201d Schumacher said. \u201cPowell has sounded concerned about expectations getting baked in.\u201d He noted that the 2-year yield, which most reflects the Fed, has risen more than 30 basis points since the last Fed meeting five weeks ago.\n*****\n&gt; Schumacher said market expectations for rate hikes may be overdone, and that he does not expect a move until the beginning of 2023. \u201cThe direction is right, but the speed is wrong,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Powell\u2019s comments will be closely watched for any adjustment in his thinking on inflation. The Fed had described the surge in rates as \u201ctransitory\u201d or temporary. The consumer price index has been running above 5%, and core CPI was at 4% in September.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe general feeling among central bankers and the major central banks is this inflation rate will come back down,\u201d TIAA Bank president of world markets Chris Gaffney said. \u201cNobody is using \u2018transitory\u2019 anymore, but they don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re going to have prolonged high inflation.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Gaffney said the weaker-than-expected 2% growth in third-quarter gross domestic product could help the Fed convince the markets that it intends to keep rates lower for longer.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs long as they stay accommodative, I think the recovery continues,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m fairly bullish for the markets going forward. We\u2019ll certainly see a lot more choppiness, but I still think the global economy, the U.S. economy particularly, is right now a great environment for corporations. We\u2019re seeing fairly positive earnings reports, and more importantly expectations for future earnings.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; There have been some high-profile misses, including both Apple and Amazon this past week. Both their stocks fell, weighing on the Nasdaq down Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEarnings overall have been good, but there\u2019s still a lot of profit margin challenges out there,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cThere\u2019s no better example than Apple and Amazon.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kID8drk.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kpeo12w.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/mgqDnIk.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/feNGOpc.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GDzFNzM.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/r8J2LuB.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qWy1mUR.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kGexB3t.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tBwoR2a.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TglfDZd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/2HOk4x5.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/vcv5Pne.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GgX6FOh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/PmzM56I.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/d5RZesR.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # November\u2019s First Trading Day: DJIA Up Over 1% Three Years in a Row\n\n&gt; Based upon data in the 2022 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac on page 90, the first trading day of November is the fourth best of all monthly first trading days since September 1997 based upon total DJIA point gained. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have all advanced 13 times over the last 21 years. Average performance on the day ranges from a low of 0.17% by S&amp;P 500 to 0.28% by NASDAQ over the 21-year time period.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0362ad93159683f932d60b790bfa9ac8/e57961a120ac1354-3a/s500x750/517dc1575ee1212443153f2b842289d3b9eda639.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Here Comes One of the Best Days of the Year (and the Best Week and Month)\n\n&gt; The calendar is about to do a lot of favors for the bulls, as late October and early November historically are quite strong.\n\n&gt; October 28 was the best day of the year, until it fell more than 3% last year, but this day is still one of the strongest days historically for stocks. Not to be outdone though, October 29 and November 2 and 3 are also some of the better days of the year. \u201cI\u2019d like to think it has something to do with my birthday being on October 28, but the truth is bulls should be aware that the coming days are historically some of the best of the year,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the single best day to buy at the close and hold for the next five trading days is today, October 27. Yes, these 5 days were lower last year by 0.6%, but you have to go back to the late 1960s to see the last time they were down two years in a row.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, November has been quite strong historically. In fact, since 1950, and the past 10 years, it is the best month of the year, while it ranks second over the past 20 years and during a post-election year. \u201cNovember is the best month of the year, but it doesn\u2019t seem to get nearly as much love as you\u2019d think,\u201d added Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe all assume December is the best month, but November is actually better and gets very little fanfare. Maybe it should be a month for the bulls, not for turkeys.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Year\u2019s Best 3-Month Span About To Start\n\n&gt; November, December and January constitute the year\u2019s seasonally strongest 3-month period for the S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones Industrials and the NASDAQ Composite. This seasonal strength is created by a combination of the annual, semiannual and quarterly operations of institutions and the habitual behavior of retail investors and consumers.\n\n&gt; The November-January 3-month span has produced a gain of 4.3% for the S&amp;P 500 &amp; DJIA since 1949. October-December runs a close second at 4.1% for S&amp;P and 3.9% for DJIA. Since 1971 NASDAQ has gained a whopping 6.3% November-January with December-February in second at 5.0% and October-December in third at4.4%.\n\n&gt; These charts also highlight the Best and Worst Months of the year with the Best running from October/November to April/May/June and the Worst from May/June/July to September/October. Stocks have been firming up since we issued our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal to subscribers on October 8 and look poised for a solid yearend rally that continues into early 2022.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e010745ce0513ef26c01ad558f3324d0/5de97b698922b56d-fc/s500x750/77e7204b6cd2e2850a23200d70c176145dea1f34.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/bd388d961bd47113bc428f68d2326639/5de97b698922b56d-6f/s500x750/f04c4e20d4d9d98fd0b02b7f8472b21dfd8fa543.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a218e808de4cf5062ba7fe2829c50222/5de97b698922b56d-58/s500x750/0adaf5599c04919e8fb8fca7e5a5129f414f0ccb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Short Term Breadth Takes Off\n\n&gt; One of the points noted about the recent moves for the S&amp;P 500 over the past few days have been on the outsized impacts of big gains or losses in names like Tesla (TSLA) or Facebook (FB). In spite of the impacts of those single names, the S&amp;P 500's return to record highs has happened on very strong breadth across sectors. Below, we show 10-day advance-decline line charts from our Sector Snapshot.\n\n&gt; The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average daily number of advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last ten trading days. It's a short-term breadth measure that traders use to measure how extended the market is at the moment. Very high readings suggest that the market might be overbought in the near term, and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low readings suggest the opposite -- that the market might be oversold in the near term, and upside mean reversion can be expected.\n\n&gt; For the broad S&amp;P 500, the 10-day AD line has hit the highest level since February 12th. Going back to 1990, the current reading stands in the 97th percentile. Looking at each sector, most lines are also in the upper decile of readings since 1990 and only two are not currently overbought: Communication Services and Consumer Staples. Meanwhile, some like Technology and Real Estate are a full two standard deviations above the historical norm. In fact, the Tech sector's line is the most elevated relative to its respective history of any sector with the current reading in the 98th percentile of all periods. The last time that the line was as elevated as now was in November of last year. No other sector has as long of a gap in time in which it has seen levels similar to the current reading. Most other sectors have seen higher readings as recently as August or September, though current levels are nonetheless elevated. The market has had quite the run over the last two weeks, and we'd expect some sort of cool-off period soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102621-AD-Lines.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # High Number of Record Highs\n\n&gt; Major US equity indices have returned to all-time highs in the second half of October with the S&amp;P 500 and Dow both hitting record levels today. Meanwhile, the NASDAQ Composite is roughly a quarter of one percent away and the closest to a new all-time high since the last one on September 7th. The Russell 2,000, on the other hand, is at the high end of the past several months' range, but it is still over 2% below its high from March 15th.\n\n&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 having been at new highs over the past few days, it has made 57 new all-time highs year to date. As shown in the top-left chart below, there have only been three other years in the past that have seen more record highs during the full course of the year: 2017 (62), 1964 (67), and 1995 (78). For the other major indices, the pace of record highs is less impressive but still strong. The Dow has made 38 new highs in 2021 which is more than triple the historical average. This year is on pace to see the highest number of record highs for the index since 2017 when it tied 1991 for the record of 71 closes at an all-time high. The NASDAQ Composite has also seen a solid number of highs at 36 which is well above the historical average of 19 per year historically. Given the index has been rangebound essentially all year, the Russell 2,000, conversely, has only seen 13 closing record highs. That is the same number as last year and it is actually below the average of 20 per year historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102621-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Steps Back\n\n&gt; The weekly sentiment survey from AAII saw a surge in optimism in recent weeks, but it took a step back this week even with the S&amp;P 500 at new highs. Bullish sentiment fell from a recent high of 46.9% down to 39.8% this week. Outside of last week, that is still the highest level since the first week of September.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Bulls.png))**\n\n&gt; While bullish sentiment saw a significant 7.1 percentage point drop, a relatively small share of those losses turned to the bearish camp. Bearish sentiment only rose 1.6 percentage points to 29.4%. That is still below levels from two weeks ago and is in line with the average from throughout the summer.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Bears.png))**\n\n&gt; The corresponding moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread to fall but bulls continue to outweigh bears by 10.4 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; As previously mentioned, the largest share of losses to bulls did not go to bears, but instead were picked up by those reporting neutral sentiment. That reading moved back above 30% this week gaining 5.3 percentage points. Again, that does not mark any sort of new high or low but instead brings sentiment back to similar levels seen only a month or two ago.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 29th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J1pI0oKgfc))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.31.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULZcEQ_jrGQ))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI work in tech at a cloud computing company and have been researching investment opportunities. I recently came across Nutanix which is a company I've heard of but didn't realize was public. Nutanix is the industry leader in hyperconvered infrastructure (HCI) which essentially makes them a competitor to vmware, dell, cisco, etc. in the on-prem virtualization space. I was doing some reading and it seems like their products are highly regarded in the industry. I also noticed they are growing hybrid cloud  subscription services that can help customers abstract their cloud computing workloads away (AWS, GCP, Azure, on-prem can all be run from a single pane). I don't know exactly where the stand in this industry but evidently we are at peak cloud and large companies are starting to move workloads back out of the cloud to save money.\n\nThis company used to sell hardware but has recently undergone a transition into a subscription services company. This transition was painful and led to nearly no stock growth over 4 years. However with new leadership it looks like the company is pulling off the transition and starting to grow again.\n\nThey currently operate at a loss but according to the new leadership will be cash-flow positive sometime in 2022. currently the company has \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.64 Billion annual revenue\n\nAs of this quarter 19% YoY revenue growth\n\n83% annual recurring revenue\n\n7.7 billion market cap\n\na price/sales ratio of 5.5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\na Price to sales ratio of 5.5 for a subscription software company with 19% YoY revenue growth seems undervalued to me. I don't think wallstreet has priced in the companies transition to subscription hardware. \n\nAnybody have any insights or comments on this company?",

        "selftext": "So many ppl lost money in all the tickers, cause we retails are divided by the hedgies, look what happen with GME and AMC.  We won because we are focus. I have cashed out all my earnings to all in on PSFE because the exact same scenario is happening. I all in in GME at 30 and it rose to 300. I've put my capital in AMC at 3 and it rose to 70. PSFE is the next GME, igaming revenue up 70%, transactional volume up 41%, no pipe is selling but stocks tank to 7 from 19.\n\nRecently I bought in affirm at 60, when it got shorted down from 100, good news happened and it rose 100%. We all want the next AMC and I am quite certain PSFE is the next. It monopolize Canada's igaming market by having a 100% share and 75% share in the US. All of the big betting players are a client of PSFE.\n\nNone of the pipe has sold here, bill foley with 30m shares, dan loeb with 41m shares. Blackrock just bought in at 8.3m shares at $12. This will explode soon.

These means the shareholders and board think its undervalued. Many of the buyers are stucked in at $12. I am in at $9 with 35k shares. Affirm has 2x since. I bought AMC at $12 sit to $5 and rose to $60.\n\nThis is not financial advice, do your own DD. But this just might be the next netflix. :)",

Paysafe is a leading supporter of online gaming and the deals recently announced are not priced into the stock.  If anyone should be supporting gambling it is us?\n\nIt\u2019s has a high potential of being bought\u2026\n\n\u201cThe Bottom Line\n\nSomeone is going to buy this company.\n\nProcessors are looking for growth and innovation. They\u2019re all focused on Square (NASDAQ:SQ), which has only grown more popular as it has gone into various banking and investment niches.\n\nGambling doesn\u2019t scare the payments industry. Casino contracts are highly prized. Processors don\u2019t hand gamblers money they don\u2019t have. When the gambler is out of money, they reject the transaction. Many casinos have special rules for gambler transactions aimed at keeping them, and the gamblers, out of trouble.\n\nThis means the downside risk of PaySafe stock is limited. There remain potential suitors for the company. The most likely is Fidelity National, which has a market cap of nearly $75 billion. But if Foley sees a better bid, he will certainly take it.\n\nThe debt means PaySafe\u2019s enterprise value is fair, not low. But you can buy it here.\u201d\n\nIt now has deals with Fubo, Montana Lottery Sportsbook, and many more on the way\u2026\n6 days ago:\n\n\u201cFuboTV Inc (NYSE: FUBO) is trading higher Thursday after the company's subsidiary, Fubo Gaming, announced a partnership with Paysafe (NYSE: PSFE).\nFubo Sportsbook will plug into Paysafe for credit and debit card payments. It is expected to launch in the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\n2 Days Ago:\n\n\u201cHOUSTON, October 04, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Paysafe (NYSE: PSFE), a leading specialized payments platform, today announced a new partnership with INTRALOT, a leading global gaming solutions supplier. INTRALOT\u2019s sports-betting platform has integrated with Paysafe to enable the Montana government-operated lottery to provide its online sportsbook patrons with a comprehensive suite of traditional and alternative payment methods via a single API.\u201d\n\nThe third and fourth quarter earnings are going to beat.  There are no supply chain issues with this company and gambling is through the roof.  I don\u2019t YOLO but I\u2019m considering it with this stock.  At only $7 and $5 Billion Market Cap this is one of the best deals.  \n\nMore institutional ownership then ever:\n\n\n\u201cThe number of bullish hedge fund positions improved by 9 lately. Paysafe Limited (NYSE:PSFE) was in 50 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of June. The all time high for this statistic was previously 41. This means the bullish number of hedge fund positions in this stock currently sits at its all time high. Our calculations also showed that PSFE isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q2 rankings).\u201d\n\nGet on the rocket at this price\u2026its not going to zero so very limited risk at this level.  Revenue increasing every quarter\u2026.just look at the charts.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they announce getting into BNPL as well since that is the hot industry.\n\nPositions:\n\n3000 Shares\n11/19/21 8C",

        "selftext": "Gentlemen, I hope you have been making the most of the opportunity my dear friend, Moscow Mitch has provided you. ie I **HOPE YOU BOUGHT THE DIP F%\\*%\\*#\\*@**\n\nWhile I still have your attention, I would like to introduce you to a company that me and some fellows have been bag holding (in the red) for a while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3jmjge40a5s71.png?width=1379&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc941bbcf643c78cefe803ee9ce4174b8f8e5889\n\n**Payoneer, the Paypal for** **~~Shithole~~** **Developing Countries**\n\n**Payoneer** is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qn847nz0a5s71.png?width=1759&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d05be8973c4bfefe00396c250fb92fe123c5f0ae\n\nThe ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network.\n\n\u00b7 Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape.\n\n\u00b7 A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to.\n\n\u00b7 Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cjzym5w1a5s71.png?width=1764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e77f88b654fe44aca54902b8a4f1d18bb7c519b9\n\nSo, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business\u2019 needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins.\n\nSay a consumer wants to rent an airbnb. They use a credit card (or other payment method) to pay airbnb, a payment gateway facilitates payment acceptance. The payment is then processed and Airbnb ends up with the money from the transaction. Airbnb has now gathered cash through its acquirers (e.g., Adyen, ACI). Airbnb now needs to distribute funds to its SMB sellers. Airbnb uses payoneer to disburse funds to sellers. From this example, you can see Payoneer isn't competing with companies like Adyen or other acquirers/ processors, even though they are processing payments.\n\nPayoneer signs up individual sellers, which allows the sellers to use payoneer across platforms (e.g., facebook marketplace and amazon). Hyperwallet (owned by PayPal) is one of their competitors, but Hyperwallet operates completely differently, they sign up users via the platform, but this means you can't use hyperwallet for your business on both amazon and fb marketplace without going through the onboarding process again. Given the trend towards SMB sellers operating across multiple marketplaces, this is a huge benefit for payoneer, and makes PayPal's offering a lot less competitive. It also means Payoneer owns the seller relationship in a way that PayPal doesn't do as effectively, and makes it easier for them to package other offerings (e.g., working capital). These other offerings provide a two-fold benefit - their customer relationships become stronger, so revenue is seen as more recurring and investors will pay a higher multiple; and they'll make more money per customer.\n\nMy view is that Payoneer should see an S-type growth curve, where they'll hit a critical mass of users and see exponential growth, like cashapp, or venmo. Their investor presentation projects 25% revenue growth over the next couple years, I think this is super conservative, especially considering that 25% growth rate doesn't account for the two travel related marketplaces that got screwed by covid. Once they hit that critical mass of users, they'll pop off, sales &amp; marketing expenses will drop, and they'll become profitable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xuonwi2a5s71.png?width=1556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b57e5a829bbcb5d58f51cbdc2e426ceca0ccd2a3\n\nThe company\u2019s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It\u2019s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zi2sl613a5s71.png?width=1664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e959a0115d4cbb201b531f77ae5276a31026a7d1\n\nWho are their customers and where are they know? 5 million businesses in 190 countries. Customers include Amazon, Wish, Lazada (owned by Alibaba) Shopee, and Ebay. Weird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too. This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypal\u2019s or banks are NOT willing to take the risk. Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r1kinxk3a5s71.png?width=1631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74cd5a7bdb3d3934ce730e1dd9aa9204ff72b259\n\n# Payoneer vs PayPal\n\nThe growth of Payoneer\u2019s global network included a move into India in April 2016, following a partnership with Pune-based IndusInd Bank and expressions of interest in its services from more than 10,000 freelancers and small businesses across the country. \n\n2018 PayPal study suggest that India\u2019s freelancers represent around one quarter of the world\u2019s gig workforce.\n\n**In August 2019, Payoneer announced a year-on-year increase of 400% in its customer base and a threefold increase in payment volumes processed in India.**\n\n*\u201cPayPal says to shut domestic payments business in India\u201d \\~ Reuters*\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc will wind down its domestic payments business in India from April 1,2021 the company said in a statement on Friday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcipi9b4a5s71.png?width=1743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3b20d766db9f0b8302c16582755758489bc479e\n\nB2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, \u201cscale\u201d and \u201cnetwork effects\u201d. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they\u2019re benefitting from these dynamics. Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.)\n\nVolume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ghmjbjt4a5s71.png?width=1721&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c9dcfa310f5e6a4bc90b66fbf9fc8b018377aa7\n\nThe benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer\u2019s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company\u2019s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z9x3x8b5a5s71.png?width=1797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=caa49b84156468b94a9f50b9a23ffb208340eba3\n\nWhat do I think the future holds for Payoneer? I actually think there are several exits for this company.\n\n**Growth:**\n\nNote that Payoneer currently doesn\u2019t do B2C, hence it may be quite common for retail to never even have heard of it, unless they are a business or in the gig economy. That is one of the problems for the stock, no one has heard of it (yet) because it works quietly behind the scenes. Given enough funding, who knows, Payoneer may well expand to B2C. Alibaba initially started as B2B as well but has since expanded to B2C (Taobao).\n\nWe just need Payoneer to be 5% of PayPal (ie. $15B market cap) in order for stock price to be in the $30-$40 range. ($6B market cap corresponds to around $13-$15 stock price.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/95silwp5a5s71.png?width=1748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f10a138995c52367baa00ed4a10e9287c5da04ee\n\n**Acquisition:**  \n Large international payments processer buys them. Could be Paypal, Square, Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company. Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed. Before you had 100,000 banks then it was 50,000 banks, then 10,000 banks and now like 5,000 banks but the top 10 banks make up a large % of the business/volume.\n\nWildcard: CRM business buys them. What many people do not realize is that CRM\u2019s have been changing the game. First it was to help you sell with marketing tools, then it is to improve communication within the team, then it will be storage, and legal transactions then it will be financial transaction. They are literally going to control the beginning to the end of the customer relationship and all of that data they possess is very valuable to help their customers grow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not financial advice, i am not a financial advisor. I have a long position with the warrants that i purchased in February and are therefore in the red.",

On top of that, Squares Total liabilities, D/E ratio, and Long Term Debt have all seen a sharp increase. Square is aggressively trying to expand by financing its debt. This alone makes me hesitant to invest. I am concerned with Square\u2019s ties to bitcoin. I labeled this as both a bullish and bearish case. Square invested a good chunk of money in bitcoin. That means their reliant on bitcoins performance. If bitcoin goes up, they go up. If bitcoin goes down, they do down. There is a lot of news and government intervention surrounding bitcoin which can either be positive or negative. I do believe the BNPL industry is a growing market, but with more competition entering the market, it will be hard for Square to capture market share. \n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice.

I put together a list of stocks to pick from (like 200-300 to pick from, ETFs and 10+ of each major market sector). We let them pick or play games to pick. The 1.5YO rolls dice most the time lol. We put in $10 every week to whatever they pick. 25% must be in ETFs for some stability. \n\nThey'll have access to the money once they're 18, accounts are still in our names just in case, and we don't expect to cash out enough to increase the capital gains taxes.

Things are looking bearish to me from a TA standpoint, but we'll see how things look closer to market open. I'll also be watching the mega caps closely, as if they show weakness, the whole market could follow. Growth slowdown remains a concern, as we saw Goldman Sachs cut their U.S. GDP growth forecast for both 2021 and next year.

SMA(9) is also relevant at 433.86. If we easily break down through those levels, we could see more red. Regardless, we should see more volatility today. If SPY sees strength, I'll be watching the resistance level around 438. DIA is trading a bit over 347 and could test the SMA(100) as resistance around that level. I'll also be watching price action around the 346 support level. QQQ\u00a0is trading a bit under 359 and looking bearish this morning. Currently gapping down below the SMA(100) and the SMA(9), it will likely test that 359 level as resistance. If it can't get back up, we could see red over the next few days. Gold and silver are each slightly down this morning, while crude oil is up over 3% and looks to continue its recent strength. Bitcoin is currently trading around 56,400, and we could see more consolidation up at this resistance level. Crypto-related stocks are up in premarket trading, trading in sympathy with Bitcoin. Airlines and cruise stocks are down a bit in premarket. It will be interesting if they hold up over support levels and maintain the new uptrend, or if we see more selling off. Meme stocks have been quiet recently, but it's always worth keeping an eye on them.\u00a0\n\nRemember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses).
