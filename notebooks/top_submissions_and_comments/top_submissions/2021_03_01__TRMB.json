        "selftext": " \n\n**Agriculture Aerial drones**\n\nFirst of all this isn\u2019t necessary financial DD just something to get people thinking who may not know about the Agriculture sector\n\nSo\u2026 Automation it Is coming into absolutely every single industry in some way or form, one thing often oven looked by people is the Agriculture sector. Farming these days isn\u2019t just about throwing some seeds into the ground and hoping for the best, its about Precision farming.\n\nThere\u2019s 3 main aspects of precision farming that\u2019s relevant to drones;\n\n* \u00b7 mapping/data\n* \u00b7 general spraying (think whole fields)\n* \u00b7 spot spraying (targeting ie weed patch in the middle of a field)\n\nBut im going to be more talking about why companies regarding general spraying are worth taking a look at while there relatively cheap. This is coming from the perspective of a farmer and is the general view in the UK agriculture community.\n\n**Breaking down spraying operating**\n\nSo its important to know the current costs of conventual vs drone spraying. With the FFA (USA) and the CAA (not fully rolled out but is slowly) (UK) allowing and starting to promote the use of drones for spraying its something that over the coming years will be a natural progression for farmers.\n\nThe applicants/ferts are NOT taken into account as they will be the same though out the board and vary from crop and location.\n\nWhat this table shows. Breaks down 3 options\n\n1. DJI AGRA T20 (yes I know I know not a publicly traded company but is good for a case study)\n\n* 2. A used sprayer\n* 3. A brand new John deere sprayer.\n\nThe fixed parameters that are relevant are;\n\n* \u00b7 Fuel \u00a30.50/L\n* \u00b7 Labour \u00a38\n* \u00b7 Drone hours halved (assumed they\u2019ll be working on a pre mapped basis may even be less hours)\n\n(apologies you'll have to zoom)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mrmu6wv1apk61.png?width=1463&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f6eaa46c2b50869d4bb34fc759d73f76ad6b615\n\nSo to break this down for a 900Ha (2223 acre) farm yearly the difference between even a used sprayer and a DJI drone is \u00a310,842 alone which is pretty much a return on the initial purchase in a year\u2026.\n\nNow for a farmer that\u2019s a lot, and if they can save that much money on operating alone then it\u2019s a natural progression and choice, especially with the lower cost a lot of famers have the view of \u201cits worth a go\u201d\n\n**Overall view of 98%ish farmers I\u2019ve spoken to**\n\n* \u00b7 Less/cheaper to maintain.\n* \u00b7 Relatedly disposable (cost- drone vs sprayer)\n* \u00b7 Manage multiple from an office (fleet operations/contracting) etc\n* \u00b7 Solar panels are becoming cheaper so almost no running cost\n* \u00b7 More versatile, can be used for crop monitoring/data collection (so don\u2019t need to leave the office!)\n* \u00b7 More effective work rate then humans\n\n**Companies I think are showing potential**\n\n\u00b7 **Actual drone manufactures**\n\n* o $DFLY - Draganfly inc\n* o $UAVS \u2013 AgEagle Arial systems\n* o $AVAV \u2013 AreoViroment inc\n\n\u00b7 **Component parts**\n\n* o $AMBA \u2013 Ambarella (yes I know they\u2019ve had there ups and downs)\n* o $TRMB \u2013 Trimble (not only in drone mapping but also becoming more used in conventional precision Ag)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLike I said not DD or technical analysis, but I think a lot of you who are maybe thinking about automation and are into longer term plays may have been interested in hearing from a farmers perspective but also the cost of operation drones VS conventional fleets.\n\nOverall drones more so on the spraying basis have a humongous potential, from an operating cost perspective alone it allows a more streamlined and cheaper operation. With the cost of the equipment alone even DJI\u2019s drone at 10k roughly which is deemed as the premium of the market is penny\u2019s in the world of agriculture equipment. Yes they have smaller capacity but with a higher work rate, cheaper operation its by the by.\n\nIf there are another people interested I can go into a more technical analysis of this all but unsure of how many people are interested in Agriculture here.\n\n**TLDR;**\n\nAgriculture spraying drones have a potential massive upside and future in the market based of the operating/purchase costs alone. Most farmers atlest In the UK are keen to transition from conventional spraying equipment to drones for a multitude of reasons.\n\n# This is not financial advice in the slightest, Just sharing my personal views on the potential of drones in the agriculture sector.",

        "selftext": "  \n\n**Agriculture Aerial drones** \n\nFirst of all this isn\u2019t necessary financial DD just something to get people thinking who may not know about the Agriculture sector\n\nSo\u2026 Automation it Is coming into absolutely every single industry in some way or form, one thing often oven looked by people is the Agriculture sector. Farming these days isn\u2019t just about throwing some seeds into the ground and hoping for the best, its about Precision farming. \n\nThere\u2019s 3 main aspects of precision farming that\u2019s relevant to drones;\n\n* \u00b7 mapping/data\n* \u00b7 general spraying (think whole fields) \n* \u00b7 spot spraying (targeting ie weed patch in the middle of a field)\n\nBut im going to be more talking about why companies regarding general spraying are worth taking a look at while there relatively cheap. This is coming from the perspective of a farmer and is the general view in the UK agriculture community.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Breaking down spraying operating**\n\nSo its important to know the current costs of conventual vs drone spraying. With the FFA (USA) and the CAA (not fully rolled out but is slowly) (UK) allowing and starting to promote the use of drones for spraying its something that over the coming years will be a natural progression for farmers.\n\nThe applicants/ferts are NOT taken into account as they will be the same though out the board and vary from crop and location.\n\nWhat this table shows. Breaks down 3 options \n\n* 1. DJI AGRA T20 (yes I know I know not a publicly traded company but is good for a case study)\n* 2. A used sprayer  \n* 3. A brand new John deere sprayer.\n\nThe fixed parameters that are relevant are;\n\n* \u00b7 Fuel \u00a30.50/L\n* \u00b7 Labour \u00a38\n* \u00b7 Drone hours halved (assumed they\u2019ll be working on a pre mapped basis may even be less hours)\n\n(apologies you'll have to zoom)\n\n*Processing img gxn12sic8pk61...*\n\nSo to break this down for a 900Ha (2223 acre) farm yearly the difference between even a used sprayer and a DJI drone is \u00a310,842 alone which is pretty much a return on the initial purchase in a year\u2026. \n\nNow for a farmer that\u2019s a lot, and if they can save that much money on operating alone then it\u2019s a natural progression and choice, especially with the lower cost a lot of famers have the view of \u201cits worth a go\u201d \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Overall view of 98%ish farmers I\u2019ve spoken to**\n\n* \u00b7 Less/cheaper to maintain.\n* \u00b7 Relatedly disposable (cost- drone vs sprayer)\n* \u00b7 Manage multiple from an office (fleet operations/contracting) etc \n* \u00b7 Solar panels are becoming cheaper so almost no running cost\n* \u00b7 More versatile, can be used for crop monitoring/data collection (so don\u2019t need to leave the office!)\n* \u00b7 More effective work rate then humans\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Companies I think are showing potential** \n\n\u00b7 **Actual drone manufactures**\n\n* o $DFLY - Draganfly inc\n* o $UAVS \u2013 AgEagle Arial systems \n* o $AVAV \u2013 AreoViroment inc\n\n\u00b7 **Component parts** \n\n* o $AMBA \u2013 Ambarella (yes I know they\u2019ve had there ups and downs)\n* o $TRMB \u2013 Trimble (not only in drone mapping but also becoming more used in conventional precision Ag)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLike I said not DD or technical analysis, but I think a lot of you who are maybe thinking about automation and are into longer term plays may have been interested in hearing from a farmers perspective but also the cost of operation drones VS conventional fleets.\n\nOverall drones more so on the spraying basis have a humongous potential, from an operating cost perspective alone it allows a more streamlined and cheaper operation. With the cost of the equipment alone even DJI\u2019s drone at 10k roughly which is deemed as the premium of the market is penny\u2019s in the world of agriculture equipment. Yes they have smaller capacity but with a higher work rate, cheaper operation its by the by. \n\nIf there are another people interested I can go into a more technical analysis of this all but unsure of how many people are interested in Agriculture here. \n\n**TLDR**  \n Agriculture spraying drones have a potential massive upside and future in the market based of the operating/purchase costs alone. Most farmers atlest In the UK are keen to transition from conventional spraying equipment to drones for a multitude of reasons. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not financial advice in the slightest, Just sharing my personal views on the potential of drones in the agriculture sector.",

        "selftext": "Stocks were mixed on Monday as Treasury yields rose amid stimulus optimism. The Dow Jones (DIA) gained close to 1% while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) is officially in correction territory, falling more than 10% from its recent highs. \n\nOver the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden\u2019s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire. \n\nThe prospect of a strong economic recovery post-pandemic, enabled by the rollout of vaccines and supportive fiscal and monetary policy, have simultaneously pushed estimates for growth higher while stoking fears of inflation. As a result, Treasury yields have turned sharply higher, hovering near 1.6%,  making bonds more attractive and capital more expensive to borrow. Rising yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies generate most of their revenue and earnings years down the road. The future value of that capital decreases in today\u2019s dollar value as the yield increases. As a result, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-flying stocks that led 2020 into stocks that will benefit from economic reopening. \n\nHighlights\nThe ARKK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which counts Tesla as its top holding by market value, has plunged by 22% over the past two weeks, as Tesla and other high-flying tech names like Square and Roku gave back some of their 2020 gains.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, March 12, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed on Friday, with technology stocks coming under pressure once again as Treasury yields resumed their march forward. The Dow extended gains from yesterday, hitting fresh intraday records. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) opened in the red but managed to climb throughout the session to finish modestly green.\n\nAfter months of negotiation, President Biden signed into law a new $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package after the bill passed in both houses of Congress by party-line votes. The bill includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The bill comes exactly one year following the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. \n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 10 basis points to reach a fresh, one year high at 1.628%. This marks a rise of around 50 basis points compared to levels from a month ago. Yields are rising in response to inflationary fears and expectations for explosive growth as the economy reopens.  Kit Juckes, Societe Generale macro strategist, wrote in a note to clients, \u201cThe pattern seems clear enough: The equity market is seeing a sector rotation but not a correction; the bond market is seeking a new equilibrium in the light of a vastly improved economic outlook in both the U.S. and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nRising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. \n\nIn vaccine news, shares of Novavax (NVAX) jumped 8% on Friday after a final[ analysis of the drugmaker's COVID-19 vaccine trial in the UK showed the inoculation was 96.4% effective ](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-confirms-high-levels-efficacy-against-original-and-0)against the original strain of the coronavirus. Analyses also showed the vaccine was 86.3% effective against the variant of the coronavirus circulating in the UK, and 55.4% effective against the variant circulating in South Africa.\n\nAfter AstraZeneca (AZN) and European officials asked the US to share their stockpile of AZN while the FDA conducts further trials to determine whether to grant the vaccine emergency use authorization. In other news, several countries have suspended distribution of AZN\u2019s vaccine following reports of blood clots. A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said at a briefing that an advisory committee was investigating reports of individuals falling ill or dying after developing blood clots in the post-vaccination period, but that no causal link had been established.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high at $58,000, extending the cryptocurrency\u2019s dizzying rally in the last 12 months.  \n* A Tesla Inc investor has sued Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and its board, saying many of his tweets violated a previous settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n* siphoned away by online platforms could get an assist from Congress under legislation that a House panel took up Friday. If passed, the legislation would grant news organizations a four-year exemption from antitrust laws to band together to negotiate compensation from online platforms that use their content, including Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google.\n* Ford Motor Co on Friday nominated two younger Ford family members to its board of directors. The board nominated Alexandra Ford English, the 33-year-old daughter of Executive Chairman Bill Ford, and Henry Ford III, the 40-year-old son of Edsel Ford, Bill's cousin who is retiring from the board in May\n* On Friday morning, Hindenburg Research published a negative research report about Lordstown Motors (ticker: RIDE). The report makes several claims, notably that not all of the preorders the company has claimed are real. This is the same firm that published a popular short report on EV-company Nikola (NKLA) months ago. \n* \\*\\***Please note that the current stock price was written in the morning and does not reflect intraday changes\\*\\***\n* AerCap (AER) target raised by Cowen from $54 to $75 at Outperform.
