        "selftext": "Hey guys, for those of you that are in crypto. How are you personally holding yours? I am conflicted between the ETFs and actual crypto. I know about the pros and cons, main pro of actual crypto being that you actually own it and it is secure and shit but it can't be in a TFSA. The ETFs can be in a TFSA but what if the private keys get stolen somehow or some shit? What are you guys personally doing? I have no clue what to do but leaning towards actual crypto because i am paranoid. In terms of actually giving a shit about crypto, I don't I'm just in it for the potential gains (only investing what I can afford to lose of course).",

        "selftext": "1. **Race to the bottom on fees will kill Coinbase**: Coinbase makes most of their revenue on trading fees. The problem is that fee revenue will slowly decline as more competition comes in that offers less fees to steal customers away. A new app called *Strike* offers Bitcoin trading at 0 fees (technically not 0, but less than a penny per transaction). Coinbase will eventually need to evolve it's business model to stay competitive with companies like Strike.\n2. **Morally questionable VC investing will lead to regulation**: Coinbase is doing some really slimy things with the tokens they list, and it will ultimately be their downfall. For those who are unaware, Coinbase has a VC arm called *Coinbase Ventures*. Basically, Coinbase buys up these early presales of these worthless tokens, brings these obscure tokens to market by listing them on their exchange and then dumps all them all on retail investors. Regulators will see this morally repugnant behavior and crack down on it. \n3. **Most of the tokens on Coinbase will likely be retrospectively classified as securities**: Gary Gensler has said that \"Every ICO is a Security\", which makes the majority of tokens listed on the platform securities, including the second largest coin, Ethereum. Classifying them as securities means that Coinbase must legally delist them. \n4. **Bitcoin ETF will steal the majority of volume away:** Grayscale has announced that they are looking to convert *all of* their funds into crypto ETFs, not just Bitcoin. Meaning, you will see every altcoin like Solana, Cardano Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc... all have their own ETF. So, at some point, you must ask, what's the point in using Coinbase if all of the coins are going to have their own ETF tickers? The answer is, unless you are willing to hold the keys of the tokens yourself, there isn't a point to using Coinbase or these other exchanges over the ETF.",

We deliver reliable launch services, spacecraft components, satellites and other spacecraft and on-orbit management solutions that make it faster, easier and more affordable to access space. We believe that space has defined some of humanity\u2019s greatest achievements and it continues to shape our future. We are motivated by the impact we can have on Earth by making it easier to get to space and to use it as a platform for innovation, exploration and infrastructure.\n\nUnprecedented commercial investment and government expenditures are driving rapid growth in the space economy. As one of only two commercial companies delivering regular access to orbit, our proven launch vehicle, spacecraft technology and global infrastructure uniquely position us to capture this growing market. Advances in technologies, materials and components have led to miniaturization of satellites and a significant reduction in cost, while at the same time the need for space applications such as communications, remote sensing, Earth observation, meteorology and navigation is increasing. We provide customers with frequent, reliable and cost-effective access to orbit for this new generation of small satellites with Electron, a fully carbon composite launch vehicle powered by 3D printed engines. Since our first Electron launch in 2017 through July 2021, we have delivered 105 satellites to space across 18 successful orbital missions for commercial and government customers, including the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the National Reconnaissance Office, and a number of domestic and international commercial spacecraft operators including Blacksky Holdings, Canon, Capella Space, Planet, OHB Group and Synspective. We have also had two failed launches, including our most recent launch on July 29, 2021. Since our most recent failed launch, we have completed an extensive internal fault tree analysis, implemented corrective actions and received authorization from the FAA to resume launches. Our next launch is currently expected to occur in October 2021. In 2020, Electron was the second most frequently launched rocket by companies operating in the United States and established us as the fourth most frequent launcher globally.\n\nRocket Lab\u2019s frequent launch cadence has been enabled through innovative manufacturing techniques for Electron, including 3D printing and automation, but production is only part of the formula for frequent and reliable launches. Our launch infrastructure is a key part of our success. We currently operate a private launch complex located in Mahia, New Zealand, which we refer to as Launch Complex 1. This launch complex is supported by a bi-lateral treaty between the United States and New Zealand governments that enables us to use U.S. launch and spacecraft technology for launches at Launch Complex 1 that otherwise would not be permitted for launches from foreign soil. This treaty provides us with a competitive advantage over other companies launching rockets from outside the U.S. that do not have the benefit of such a treaty. Additionally, by operating our own private launch complex, we do not have to share the launch complex with other launch providers and, subject to obtaining required regulatory clearances for launches, have complete control over launch schedule and availability. Launch Complex 1 serves as our high-volume launch complex, capable of supporting up to 120 missions every year. We also have access to use a dedicated launch pad at NASA\u2019s Wallops Flight Facility, at Wallops Island, Virginia, which we refer to as Launch Complex 2. We have built out all of the physical infrastructure that we need in order to use this launch complex and, upon certification of our flight termination system software by NASA, we will be able to begin scheduling launches from this launch complex. Rocket Lab\u2019s operations, including this launch complex as part of our overall business, have received the designation of Essential Critical Infrastructure for National Security from the U.S. Department of Defense, and can support 24-hour rapid call-up capability for defense needs and urgent constellation replenishment. We expect to be able to launch up to 12 missions per year from Launch Complex 2 once it becomes operational.\n\nBuilding on our strong foundation with Electron, we are now developing our Neutron launch vehicle, which will be an advanced 8-ton payload class launch vehicle tailored for large constellation deployments, interplanetary missions and human spaceflight. We expect constellation missions to make up an increasing percentage of small satellites launched, yet there is currently no commercial medium lift class launch vehicle to meet this demand. Neutron will be tailored to meet demand from this growing market.\n\nFrom launch services, Rocket Lab has expanded into space systems, delivering spacecraft as a service from low Earth orbit constellations to deep space and interplanetary missions for government and commercial customers. Our space services business utilizes our launch services, our family of Photon spacecraft and partnerships with global ground network service providers, as well as our own ground station network to provide customers a complete solution that encompasses spacecraft build, launch and on-orbit operation following launch.\n\n**Our Competitive Strengths**\n\nOur competitive strengths include:\n\n**Flight Heritage \u2013   First Mover Advantage:** Electron is the first small launch   vehicle to establish frequent and reliable access to space with 18 successful   orbital missions through July 2021. Successfully reaching orbit not just   once, but repeatedly delivering mission success across more than three years   of launches demonstrates a mature launch vehicle, sophisticated team and   robust manufacturing infrastructure and processes. We believe this gives us a   significant competitive advantage ahead of potential new competitors to   secure higher-value missions from our customer.\n\n**Unique   Technologies and Capabilities:** We have innovated around key   launch vehicle and spacecraft features and capabilities, including:\n\n* An all carbon   composite orbital launch vehicle, delivering substantial mass-savings while   maintaining strong structural integrity\n* A 3D printed,   electric-pump fed rocket engine that delivers high-performance while removing   the complexity associated with traditional gas turbine engines\n* A unique kick   stage that delivers satellites to precise and individual orbits increasing   deployment flexibility and cost effectiveness for our customers. The kick   stage can also be utilized as a fully- featured satellite, enabling hosted   payload opportunities for our customers and for our own constellation   applications.\n\n**Deep Vertical Integration:** We   have extensive vertically integrated design and manufacturing capabilities,   having developed world-class engineering and manufacturing teams across the   United States, New Zealand and Canada. This allows us to manage and control   almost every aspect of design, manufacturing and launch operations, enabling   rapid prototyping and streamlined production to deliver product to orbit   faster.\n\n**Additive   Manufacturing Capabilities:** We believe we were the first company to   3D print an orbital rocket engine, and as of July 2021 have flight heritage   with 220 engines launched to space. We leverage our unique 3D printing   capabilities beyond engines, to enable ultra-rapid design and testing of new   flight hardware and dramatically shorten our time-to-market.\n\n**Integrated Design   and Test Capabilities:** We own and operate our own propulsion   test infrastructure, allowing us the capacity and flexibility to accelerate   time-to-market and ensure quality and a high rate of mission success.\n\n**Private Launch   Complex:**   Rocket Lab operates its private orbital launch complex, Launch Complex 1 in   Mahia, New Zealand. This launch complex can support up to 120 launches every   year, which is significantly more than the current annual total number of   launches from all U.S. spaceports combined. By operating our own private   launch complex, we have eliminated the availability issues commonly faced by   other launch providers competing for a limited number of slots on shared   launch complexes that they do not control.\n\n**A complete   end-to-end space solution**: Providing services and data from space   has traditionally meant relying on multiple suppliers and mission partners.   By manufacturing and launching our own rockets, producing and operating our   own spacecraft, operating our own launch complexes, creating our own   spacecraft components and, through our partnerships, as well as our ground   station network, securing access to a global ground station network \u2013 Rocket   Lab has the keys to space. Having successfully proven all aspects of   accessing and using space, we are well positioned to move into delivering   space applications using our own established products and infrastructure.\n\n**Customers**\n\n***Launch Services.*** As of July 2021, we have launched and deployed 105 satellites for our customers, which includes government customers, such as the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA and other U.S. government agencies. We also provide launch services to major domestic and international commercial spacecraft operators. Our launch services have been used by more than 20 organizations. U.S. Government customers have accounted for approximately 36% of the revenues through June 30, 2021 with commercial, foreign governments and education customers accounting for the remaining approximately 64%.\n\n***Space Systems***\\*\\*.\\*\\* As of December 31, 2020, we have flight hardware and spacecraft that has flown on over 70 missions, many involving multiple spacecrafts per mission, including legacy missions enabled by Sinclair Interplanetary, which we acquired in April 2020.\n\n**Our Growth Strategy**\n\nWe are pursuing the following growth strategies:\n\n* Leverage our   market position as the first U.S. commercially operational dedicated small   launch provider with NASA Category 1 certification, 18 successful launches,   and 105 satellite deployed, to be entrusted with increasingly critical   payloads and rewarded with higher-valued launch services contracts.\n* Expand our   addressable launch market with the development of the Neutron launch vehicle,   which will enable significantly higher revenue per launch with its capability   to deploy larger spacecraft and greater numbers of spacecraft per launch as   compared to our Electron launch vehicle, and will also be capable of   supporting crewed flight and cargo resupply to the International Space   Station, which our Electron launch vehicle is not capable of supporting.\n* Apply world-class   manufacturing scaling and cost-reduction capabilities to the production of   our existing family of component subsystems for satellites and other   spacecraft to capture large constellation design win opportunities.\n* Expand our   portfolio of strategic components for satellites and other spacecraft by   commercializing solutions developed for our launch vehicles and family of   Photon spacecraft, including; avionics subsystems, radios, batteries, solar   panels and separation systems.\n* Leverage our   proven Photon spacecraft platform to provide streamlined hosted payload and   technology demonstration capabilities in low Earth orbit to commercial and   government customers without the need for customers to utilize a separately   designed and built third-party satellite bus to place the satellite in the   correct position.\n* Build upon   ongoing interplanetary Photon spacecraft development efforts as well as our   announced Neutron launch vehicle developments to expand our addressable   market for interplanetary scientific and commercial missions.\n* Leverage our cost   and frequency advantaged \u201caccess to space,\u201d enabled by our established launch   assets and proven capabilities, to further penetrate the available market for   on-orbit management of previously launched satellites, which we believe to be   over $900 million per year, in addition to expanding our own spacecraft   assets on orbit to deliver and monetize space data with end-customers.\n* Exploit our   in-house launch and space systems capabilities to provide data and services   to the market with our own satellites launched by our own rockets.\n\n**Product &amp; Services Overview**\n\nWe design and manufacture small and medium-class rockets, satellite spacecraft components, satellites and other spacecraft to support the space economy. Our launch services are used to place spacecraft into Earth orbit and escape trajectories, and utilize orbital launch vehicles that place payloads into a variety of planes/inclinations and altitude trajectories. Our satellite and other spacecraft components are the building blocks for spacecraft that are sold commercially, which includes reaction wheels, star trackers, magnetic torque rods and batteries with additional products in development to serve a wide variety of sub-system functions. Our family of Photon spacecraft is configurable for a range of low Earth orbit, medium Earth orbit, geosynchronous orbit and interplanetary missions.\n\n* **Launch Services**: We   currently provide reliable and responsive launch services on Electron for   small spacecraft up to 300 kg. We also have a Neutron launch vehicle in   development to provide efficient constellation launch services for payloads   up to 8,000 kg. Between these two launch vehicles, we expect to have the   capability of launching nearly all of the satellites that we expect to be   launched through 2029. We can support up to 120 launch opportunities every   year, from Launch Complex 1, which is our private launch complex in Mahia,   New Zealand, and, upon certification of our flight termination system   software by NASA, will be able to begin scheduling additional launches from   Launch Complex 2 at NASA\u2019s Wallops Flight Facility, at Wallops Island,   Virginia.\n* **Space Systems**: We   provide spacecraft solutions for government and commercial customers ranging   from complete spacecraft development, manufacture and operation in low Earth   orbit and deep space to selling individual spacecraft components for use by   customers in constructing their own spacecraft. With our space systems   solutions, customers no longer need to build their own spacecraft. They can   buy a launch, spacecraft, ground services and on-orbit management following   launch as a complete package, streamlining their path to orbit.\n\n***Launch Services***\n\nWe design, manufacture and launch orbital rockets to deploy payloads to low Earth orbit and interplanetary destinations.\n\nElectron is our orbital small launch vehicle that was designed from the ground up to accommodate a high launch rate business model to meet the growing and dynamic needs of our customers for small launch services. Combining the use of innovative manufacturing technologies including 3D printing and automation, Electron is optimized for rapid and frequent launch and has established itself as one of the most prolific and reliable launch vehicles in the market. Since its maiden launch in 2017, Electron has become the leading small spacecraft launch vehicle delivering 105 satellites to orbit for government and commercial customers across 18 successful orbital missions through July 2021. In 2020, Electron was the second most frequently launched rocket by companies operating in the United States and established Rocket Lab as the fourth most frequent launcher globally. Our launch services program has seen us develop many industry innovations, including 3D printed rocket engines, an electric-pump-fed rocket engine, fully carbon composite first stage fuel tanks, a private orbital launch complex, a rocket stage that converts into a spacecraft on orbit, and the ability to successfully recover a stage from space, providing a path to reusability.\n\nElectron provides tailored access to orbit for the high-growth small spacecraft market across dedicated and rideshare missions. It is capable of deploying satellites of up to 660 lbs (300 kg) to low Earth orbit across a wide range of orbital inclinations from 38 to 120 degrees. Electron is also capable of delivering spacecraft to deep space and interplanetary destinations, a capability which we will demonstrate in 2021 with the launch of a NASA mission to the Moon in support of the agency\u2019s Artemis program. Electron is a two-stage launch vehicle with a third kick stage, standing at 18 meters tall, with a diameter of 1.2 meters and a lift-off mass of approximately 14,000 kg. Electron\u2019s design includes innovative use of electrical systems and advanced carbon-composites for its structures and propellant tanks. Carbon-composite construction decreases mass by as much as 40 percent relative to other materials, contributing to Electron\u2019s mass-to-orbit performance. Our in-house assembly of Electron\u2019s composite tanks and structures improves cost efficiency and supports high rates of production. Electron\u2019s kick stage enables satellites to be placed in circular orbit after launch, which is necessary for satellites to maintain consistent altitude and is capable of engine restarts to deliver multiple payloads to a range of orbits, meeting precise orbit insertion requirements, and deorbiting itself to avoid contributing to orbital debris, also known as space junk.\n\nElectron is propelled by a total of ten Rutherford engines that we manufacture at our headquarters in Long Beach, California. The Rutherford engine is a 5,600-lbf engine fueled by liquid oxygen and kerosene fed by electric pumps and is based on a propulsion cycle that makes use of electric motors and high-performance lithium polymer batteries to drive liquid oxygen and kerosene fuel pumps. Electric pumps are lower complexity than the turbomachinery typically required for gas generator cycles, yet still achieve high efficiency. We believe our Rutherford engine is the first oxygen/hydrocarbon engine to use additive manufacturing for all primary components, including the regeneratively cooled thrust chamber, injector pumps and main valves.\n\nElectron is currently launched from our private launch complex in Mahia, New Zealand and, upon certification of our flight termination system software by NASA, we plan to begin launching Electron from our new launch complex at NASA\u2019s Wallops Flight Facility, at Wallops Island, Virginia. As of July 2021, Electron had successfully launched 18 times and deployed 105 satellites to orbit. We have also had two failed launches. Since our most recent failed launch in May 2021, we have completed an extensive internal fault tree analysis, implemented corrective actions and received authorization from the FAA to resume launches. Our next launch currently is expected to occur in October 2021.\n\nIn March 2021, we announced plans to develop our reusable-ready medium-capacity Neutron launch vehicle which will increase the payload capacity of our space launch vehicles to approximately 17,000 lbs (8,000 kg), for launches to low-Earth orbit and lighter payloads into higher orbits. Neutron will be tailored for commercial and U.S. government constellation launches and capable of human space flight and cargo and crew resupply to the International Space Station. Neutron will also provide a dedicated service to orbit for larger civil, defense and commercial payloads that need a level of schedule control and high-flight cadence not available on large and heavy lift rockets. Neutron is expected to have the capability of launching nearly all of the spacecraft that we expect to be launched through 2029, and we expect to be able to leverage Electron\u2019s flight heritage, various vehicle subsystems designs, launch complexes and ground station infrastructure.\n\nThe medium-lift Neutron will be a two-stage launch vehicle that stands 46 meters (150 feet) tall with a 5-meter (16.4 ft) diameter fairing and a lift capacity of up to 8,000 kg (8 metric tons) to low-Earth orbit, 2,000 kg to the Moon (2 metric tons), and 1,500 kg to Mars and Venus (1.5 metric tons). Neutron will feature a reusable first stage designed to land on an ocean platform, enabling a higher launch cadence and decreased launch costs for customers. Neutron launches are planned to take place from Virginia\u2019s Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport located at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility. We aim to leverage existing launch pad and integration infrastructure at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport, with the goal of lessening the incremental investments in a new pad and accelerating the timeline to first launch, expected in 2024.\n\n***Space Systems***\n\nOur space systems product and services offerings include the Photon family of spacecraft, a portfolio of market and technology leading satellite and other spacecraft components, spacecraft engineering and design services, and on-orbit constellation management services.\n\nThe Photon family of small spacecraft is configurable for a range of low Earth orbit, medium Earth orbit, geosynchronous orbit, and interplanetary missions. Photon is a versatile platform that can be adapted to meet a broad range of our customers\u2019 requirements. Photon can operate as the upper stage of Electron (the kick stage) during launch, then with a simple command it will transition to an operational satellite on orbit, eliminating the parasitic mass of deployed spacecraft and enabling full use of the fairing volume for payloads. Photon can also fly on other launch vehicles, such as our recently announced in-development Neutron launch vehicle, and as a secondary payload on rockets developed under the National Security Space Launch program of the U.S. Space Force. Our Photon family of spacecraft enable us to offer an end-to-end mission solution encompassing launch, spacecraft, ground services, and mission operations to provide customers with streamlined access to orbit with Rocket Lab as a single mission partner.\n\nOur family of Photon spacecraft can be used to conduct space-related scientific research, collect imagery and other remote-sensing data about the Earth, carry out lunar and other deep space planetary missions, and to demonstrate new space technologies. Our family of Photon spacecraft can also be used in combination with Electron to deploy individual spacecraft in different orbital locations and complete constellations in a single mission. Our spacecraft are intended for commercial, defense and civil government customers, including the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA, other U.S. government agencies, and governments worldwide. Our first Photon spacecraft was successfully launched and placed into service in August 2020 and a second operational Photon was successfully launched in March 2021. Photon has been selected by NASA in 2021 for the CAPSTONE mission, which is a pathfinder for the lunar Gateway initiative of the Artemis program, which involves a mini- space station NASA intends to use as a staging point for crewed lunar landings beginning as soon as 2024. Photon has also been selected for interplanetary missions to Mars and Venus.\n\n***Spacecraft Components***\n\nRocket Lab designs and manufactures a range of components for satellites and other spacecraft, including reaction wheels, star trackers, magnetic torque rods and batteries, and has additional products in development to serve a wide variety of sub-system functions. Rocket Lab entered this market with our acquisition of leading spacecraft components manufacturer Sinclair Interplanetary, which brought incremental vertically-integrated capabilities for our own spacecraft, and also enabled Rocket Lab to deliver high-volume manufacturing of critical spacecraft components at scale prices to the broader spacecraft merchant market.\n\nReaction wheels are motor-driven flywheels used to store angular momentum on a spacecraft. Many spacecrafts use three or four reaction wheels to provide agile 3-axis pointing control. Some configurations use a single wheel, called a \u201c**momentum wheel**,\u201d for stable Earth-pointing control. All Rocket Lab reaction wheels incorporate an onboard digital processor with speed and torque control loops. We make a large number of different wheel sizes. Wheels are sized by their maximum angular momentum measured in Newton-meters (Nm). Bigger spacecraft require bigger wheels, but determination of the correct size of wheel for a particular spacecraft requires detailed engineering analysis.\n\nStar trackers are optical sensors that determines the spacecraft\u2019s pointing direction and rotation rate by looking at the stars. Our star trackers are fully integrated units, where one box includes the lens, detector, processor, and all of the power supply and support circuits. A catalog of more than two million possible star triangles is loaded before launch, allowing the processor to determine the direction from any single image.\n\nMagnetic torque rods are long bars of special alloy steel, wound with coils of fine copper wire. When a current is passed through the wire, it becomes an electromagnet which generates a twisting force against the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Magnetic torque rods are used in low Earth orbit to remove angular momentum from reaction wheels, avoiding the requirement to expend irreplaceable propellant.\n\nBatteries include both the high-capacity high-voltage batteries used to power the pumps in the Rutherford rocket engine used by Electron and other batteries used for small spacecraft.\n\n**Spacecraft Engineering and Design Services and On-Orbit Constellation Management Services**\n\nOur space systems engineering team works with customers to develop, design and manufacture full spacecraft solutions from low Earth orbit to interplanetary spacecraft. We also offer constellation management services where we perform command and control operations and leverage our ground station infrastructure and partnerships to deliver data to spacecraft constellation operator customers following launch.\n\n**Space Applications**\n\nOur in-house launch and space systems capabilities provide significant competitive advantages for us to begin providing our own data and services from orbit. By leveraging our Electron and Neutron launch vehicles, our Photon family of spacecraft, our private launch complex and through partnerships with global ground network service providers, as well as our own ground station network, we are able to provide a complete, end-to-end solution. Rocket Lab is uniquely positioned to deploy its own satellite constellations to meet growing demand for space-based connectivity, Earth observation and other services. The space applications market represents significant untapped potential for value-added services including data management and analytics to support end customer insights.\n\n**Sales and Business Development and Mission Management**\n\nWe sell our launch services and space systems solutions through a unified global business development team that cross-sells across both launch and space systems and leverages shared technical, proposal writing, mission project management and administrative resources. This team is based primarily in the United States and focuses on government customers, such as the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA, other U.S. government agencies, as well as major domestic and international commercial satellite operators and satellite bus manufacturers. The business development team works closely with our engineering teams to develop optimal solutions for our customers. Given the well-defined and consolidated nature of our customer base, we are able to adequately address our market with a lean and focused team. This team also leads customer engagement in the procurement process, assisting with documentation related to the request for information or request for proposal process, as well as detailed customer-specific product configuration.\n\nMany of our business development team members have previously worked for government agencies and large institutional space and technology companies. They have in-depth knowledge and understanding of the industry and can draw on a vast network of contacts to support business development. With 18 successful orbital missions, 105 satellites deployed and a growing number of Rocket Lab-built spacecraft components operating on orbit, our team has a high-level of insight into customer requirements and evolving industry trends, putting us in a strong position to ensure our products and services meet customer needs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Engineering***\n\nWe have made significant investments in our engineering teams. Our team members have a broad range of expertise from a range of industries including; aerospace, automotive, and marine, and broader manufacturing and technology. Rocket Lab\u2019s high level of vertical integration means that these engineering teams design and provide manufacturing support for components, sub-systems, and assemblies across the full range of our launch vehicles, our Photon family of spacecraft, our satellite, and other spacecraft components and our spacecraft engineering and design services. They support the full product lifecycle from new product innovation to sustaining engineering, including payload lift capacity increases and other performance improvements, new product features such as booster reusability and cost reduction initiatives.\n\nOur engineering teams across New Zealand, the United States, and Canada address all key areas of launch vehicle build, payload integration, launch operations, ground segment communications, on orbit spacecraft operations management, and satellite and other spacecraft component design and manufacturing. Key areas of technical focus include composite structures, additive manufacturing, machining, avionics and power systems, propulsion assembly and test, spacecraft system design assembly and test, printed circuit-board design, optics integration, guidance and navigation, attitude direction and command and control, amongst other engineering focus areas.\n\nThese teams are supported by centralized planning and program management functions that guide significant projects across Rocket Lab for consistency and visibility. The company leverages sophisticated product lifecycle management software tools, computer-aided design systems and business processes to drive efficiency and better manage the entire product lifecycle, including design, source and build the products the enable our launch services and end-product deliveries.\n\n**Supply Chain**\n\nWe are highly vertically integrated, in that we design and manufacture many components and subsystems for our launch vehicles, Photon family of spacecraft, and satellite and other spacecraft components we sell into the merchant market. To support this level of vertical integration we have developed extensive supply chain operations and capabilities that are global in nature and enabled by sophisticated third-party enterprise resource planning systems and tools. These systems and tools are largely supported by an in-house team of enterprise information systems personnel.\n\nWe obtain raw materials, components, sub-systems and capital equipment, and other supplies from suppliers that we believe to be reputable and reliable. We have established and follow internal quality control processes to source suppliers, considering engineering validation, quality, cost, delivery and lead-time. We have a quality management team that is responsible for managing and ensuring that supplied components meet quality standards. While we largely source raw materials and other inputs and services from multiple sources, in some cases we also purchase various inputs and services from a sole source. In those sole source supplier situations, as we endeavor to diversify our supply chain, we manage this sole source risk through carrying increased buffer stock, particularly on long-lead items.\n\n**Manufacturing, Assembly and Launch Operations**\n\nRocket Lab conducts global operations in support of its research and development manufacturing, assembly and launch operations. We have our Rutherford engines and avionics manufacturing facilities in Long Beach, California, composite manufacturing, high-voltage battery systems, and launch vehicle integration and propulsion testing in Auckland, New Zealand and launch complexes in Mahia, New Zealand and Wallops Island, Virginia. We strive to instill a manufacturing culture of continuous improvement and leverage best practices in quality control and worker safety across our facilities and have achieved Category-1 certification by the NASA Launch Services Program. We possess differentiated in-house rapid prototyping capabilities to support both research and development initiatives and to accelerate time-to-market benefits for critical production ramps. These capabilities include computer numerical control machining stations, balancing machines and 3D printers and related expertise.\n\n**Intellectual Property**\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we held three issued U.S. patents and had nine U.S. patent applications pending. Our U.S. issued patents expire between 2032 and 2040. As of December 31, 2020, we held six registered trademarks in the United States, including the Rocket Lab mark, and also held 36 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology.",

Evans Christopher C. Geczy David K. Musto Adam V. Reed*  Submitted to the SEC  (May 25th, 2006)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Regulations allow market makers to short sell without borrowing stock, and the transactions of a major options market maker show that in most hard-to-borrow situations, it chooses not to borrow and instead fails to deliver stock to its buyers. Some of the value of failing passes through to option prices: when failing is cheaper than borrowing, the relation between borrowing costs and option prices is significantly weaker. The remaining value is profit to the market maker, and its ability to profit despite the usual competition between market makers appears to result from a cost advantage of larger market makers at failing.\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is important-  Read this:\n\n**(hUh WuT mEaN? :   It's basically saying shorts often chose not to deliver based off the Cost to Borrow price but still short. Everyone in retail thinks that when shorts are out of shares on Ortex or fintel, they can't drop the price. This is saying the opposite. They are saying at times, that they will just chose to Fail to Deliver on top of borrowing shorts. Sometimes both. Basically shorts and Maker Makers have built naked shorting and choosing to Fail to Deliver into their business models.   Sometimes, its more cost effective to just wait so they eat the FTD fine and then just cover when the stock is lower.   It's another layer they have of power. Then on top of that Market Makers have the ability to drop the price through Short Exempt status where they don't have to follow any of the rules that shorts do. )**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-520/4520-6.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-520/4520-6.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# ****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\n\n# \n\n# \n\n# Max Pain\n\n# \n\nLet me explain.

Market Makers do not want this to run because they would be left holding the bag and they have chosen not to properly hedge the call side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# This is similar to GameStop before they got the Volume.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was there with GameStop in Dec/Jan when the shorts thought they had control of the GME and then a surge of retail investors bought up the entire ITM options chains on the stock.

So it's cheaper for them to pin the price to max pain than allow the stock to run because they most likely don't have or might not have the ability to provide those shares. Which would cause more buying pressure because they would have to go to the market and buy more shares.....which puts more shares ITM which is what a Gamma Squeeze is.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou want to see the amount of FTD's spike hard??

Before reading, **please note that I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. These plays are extremely risky and you should consult a financial advisor or do your own research before making financial decisions.** \n\nQuick note: my track record is that I called out IRNT (I didn't discover it but I called it out before it happened) and RKLY. I have also been a part of and profited from many other squeezes, so I understand how squeezes work and am knowledgeable about them.\n\n# 1. The anatomy of a gamma squeeze\n\nI'll put it plain and simple, reddit absolutely sucks at finding and playing gamma squeezes. For every gain porn post you see, there are hundreds of bag holders (more on why that is later). In this section, I will explain the anatomy of a gamma squeeze and how to actually spot one. There are two components of a gamma squeeze: 1. unusually high call open interest for ATM and near the money call options on the closest expiry and 2. a technical setup that would allow for a breakout move in the near future. \n\nWhy are those the two keys? The first one should be obvious, as you need high call OI for a gamma squeeze to happen. The reason for this is because of market maker delta hedging. Market makers are constantly buying and selling shares based on the delta of the calls they sell. The reason for this is because they need to remain market neutral for conflict of interest purposes and portfolio strategy purposes (they are delta neutral, long theta, and short vega, which is why they make their money when IV decreases and theta eats away at option premium values). Gamma is the rate of change of delta. Gamma is the highest in the strike immediately above and the strike immediately below the current price. This means that when a stock makes a strong move upward, market makers have to buy the most shares to hedge due to these near the money options because their gamma increases delta at the highest rate. The point of a gamma squeeze is that when a stock with unusually high ATM and near the money call open interest makes an aggressively move upward, the option gamma rapidly increases delta for the huge amount of options, so market makers must buy tons of shares to remain delta neutral, which further pushes up the stock. Most of you probably already understand this concept as it has been widely talked about.\n\nWhat most people don't seem to understand is how to identify the second part of a gamma squeeze setup. Most people are good at identifying when a stock has unusually high call OI, but the second crucial aspect is a technical setup that would allow for a breakout move in the near future. This is important because a gamma squeeze can only happen if a stock's price increases thus increasing delta and forcing delta hedging. A stock could have a perfect gamma squeeze setup on the option chain but if it doesn't move upward, there will be no gamma squeeze because gamma won't increase delta. That's why the technical setup is so important. Just a note, but many gamma squeezes have happened due to good option OI stats and random good news pushing up the stock and causing a gamma squeeze. Since that is random and unpredictable, a technical setup is the next best thing because we can predict it with more certainty. \n\nThe technical setup part is pretty easy once you understand why it's necessary. You are usually looking for something like a bounce off an upcoming support, a wedge, triangle, or bull flag being formed, or some other consolidation setup where a bullish breakout is possible in the near future. Additionally, an upcoming catalyst or event could suffice. \n\n# 2. Why Reddit holds the bag and sucks at squeezes\n\nI am going to put it plain and simple again: Reddit/retail absolutely sucks at playing squeezes. First, most don't understand the second part of the gamma squeeze (the technical setup) and simply look for high call OI plays, which can be successful, but is far less probable than one with a technical setup. Second, for some reason that I still don't understand, reddit/retail refuses to enter squeeze plays until after they have already happened. In both my IRNT and RKLY posts, so many people said I was completely wrong and retarded (which is fair). However, when those plays squeezed the next day, some of those same people messaged me days later asking if the squeeze was still happening. This is why people hold the bag - they refuse to buy before the squeeze starts and then FOMO into plays that are already dead. Retail traders have it hard enough with all of the disadvantages facing us in financial markets, but FOMO retardation is an unacceptable cardinal sin.\n\nNext, everyone on reddit has ADHD. Someone made a post a few days ago about why reddit sucks at squeezing and noted that it takes weeks for short squeezes to happen and reddit keeps falling for pump and dumps because they can't stay in one play for more than a few days. I completely agree with this. With that being said, I'm going to assert that 99% of plays on reddit have been gamma squeezes or pump and dumps. The only plays that were short squeezes were AMC and GME and that's because they have cult followings who were willing to hold for months (these stocks also had gamma squeeze elements so it wasn't a pure short squeeze). With that being said, gamma squeezes are perfect for reddit because they don't take a long time to happen. If the call OI is there, it only takes a strong move upward for the squeeze to happen. With short squeezes, large institutions won't be margin called until they are down 100's of percent for weeks at a time.\n\n# 3. ATER's coming gamma squeeze and why it could be violent\n\nSo far I have explained to you the two necessities for gamma squeeze plays. I have also explained to you why gamma squeezes are good plays for ADHD redditors. Finally, I have explained to you why redditors often hold the bag even though they shouldn't be. With that being said, I am here to tell you of an opportunity that checks off both of the gamma squeeze boxes, hasn't taken off yet, and has strong name recognition among retail: ATER. \n\n**Option Chain and Gamma Analysis**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3htbafht4pr71.png?width=2294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36f4038281f0a8f09e861a49add518f9fa4e68e4\n\nFirst, we have the option chain. As you can see, $10 is an absolutely crucial strike as the OI is over 10,000. Additionally, there is a gamma ramp all the way up to the $20 strike (as evident by the insanely high OI in those strikes). The total OI for the $10 - $20 chain is over 75,000 total contracts (this would be equal to 7,500,000 if all contracts were exercised. Notice the gamma for the 10, 12,5, and 15 strikes are all above .065. This means that a $1 increase in the price of the stock would create a .10 increase in delta (for the $10 strike). A .10 increase would mean that 10 shares would need to be bought for the market maker to remain delta neutral, which means that a $1 move upward in the stock would force market makers to buy over 100,000 shares to remain delta neutral only for the $10 strike. You can imagine what happens as price keeps going up and gamma keeps increasing delta exponentially. The fact that call volume for those strikes starkly outweighs put volume is further bullish AND because market makers constantly (and often automatically through algorithms) delta hedge, a stark move upwards would cause market makers who were short puts to cover their short shares (used to delta hedge puts) thus causing further upward pressure. \n\nBelow I have used Thinkorswim's OnDemand feature to look back at the option chain for the closest strike before each of the previous moves up. \n\nFirst, this is the option chain on September 30 when the stock was about $9. This is just to compare it to now. As you can see, option OI has steadily been going up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u26g0tjo6pr71.png?width=2314&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ec258c128c0e9fd6230f2cc213b1af0ad97c099\n\nNext, the option chain for September 20, which is right after the first price jump and before the second one. The stock was trading at around $20. You can see that option OI was still pretty strong (though 25 days to expiry is kinda far out) but not nearly as strong as it is now. Despite this, the stock still made yet another move up to almost $20.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n92fo9407pr71.png?width=2306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=533ea72b558e02548e99eb0d2abeb6e7335d3f41\n\nFinally, we have the option chain from Sept 8 when the stock was trading at $8. This was before the giant squeeze up to $19 (the very first one). Notice a similar setup to now? High ATM and near the money call OI. The biggest difference? There's no gamma ramp here unlike what we have now. Overall option OI is also lower than what we currently have.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m1fto2s97pr71.png?width=2304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=974976a930440ef4841d8c683a139afc200e4ad6\n\nWhat these images should show you is that ATER's option chain has pretty definitive characteristics before each gamma squeeze and that the current setup is by far the strongest. \n\nFinally, I have the put/call ratio for today and overall. As you can see, calls are dominating puts.\n\n[Total](https://preview.redd.it/f93eshgi8pr71.png?width=1202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c0808a187954a3c5e8269b727a7c82567869802)\n\n[today](https://preview.redd.it/gyznkggi8pr71.png?width=2258&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41694177fe317565c701ef229e1fbdbf2b26f094)\n\n**Technical Setup**\n\nNow that you've seen the options chain setup, it's time for the technical setup. Remember the technical setup is crucial because it is what allows gamma to start to affect delta. Think of the technical setup as the push to get up on the gamma ramp. We are currently not on the gamma ramp, but the technical setup is what would push us up to it. \n\nBelow are the 5m, 90m, and 1D charts for ATER:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hjt2urbb9pr71.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=028fad76867a98502732fd5243beb007fde82296\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fs19cc8c9pr71.png?width=2162&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d00b085e993ab135f2f650d0b1f1d1b09321d177\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gvermqwjbpr71.png?width=2156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83f054ca3c1ba6f0e0aaee7d52dc213bc97f8a9f\n\nYou'll notice that the technical setup here is absolutely clear. The \\~$9.50 level is a very strong support. On the day chart and 90 min chart, you'll notice that the stock bounced off of it twice. The support even survived the recent market turmoil, which is a strong statement. Each time that the stock reaches the support level, volume dries up, which shows that it is again a very strong support. Finally, you can clearly see the triangle pattern emerging on both the 90m and 5m charts. Both of these charts show that the triangle is going to end in the next few days. Here is what a triangle pattern like this typically does.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/inju9k1x9pr71.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=915f8f96758b45bddf9bfca9c99c61b2a6483f68\n\nIf the triangle breaks out in a bullish way, then it means that the stock will go to AT LEAST $12 (without considering gamma). Once the stock reaches above $11, IMO, gamma will take over and send the stock up further to at least the $18 level and possibly above the previous two highs. Like I said, the technical setup is what pushes us up to allow gamma to take over, and this is a very strong technical setup. Since we keep respecting the 9.5 level, I would say it's very likely that we break out. I have been playing this stock for the past few weeks and IMO it is blatantly clear that this is a continuation of the previous jumps: bounce off of support, low volume on support, and strong call OI - I've seen it before and I'm currently seeing it now. That's why I'm saying this is an opportunity to get in on a squeeze play before it squeezes so you aren't holding the bag for the 5349239120 time. \n\n**Other stuff**\n\nI could go over the fact that the borrow fee on the stock is high, available shares are drying up, something about float, something about short interest, something with ortex signals, but I'm not going to do that because it's all just noise. This is not a short squeeze play. Most reddit plays are not short squeeze plays, so those stats do not matter even close to as much as the gamma setup and the technical setup. \n\nPlease see the note at the beginning about the risks involved with plays like this, doing your own research, etc.\n\n**This is not financial advice trade at your own risk.**",

Some of the value of failing passes through to option prices: when failing is cheaper than borrowing, the relation between borrowing costs and option prices is significantly weaker. The remaining value is profit to the market maker, and its ability to profit despite the usual competition between market makers appears to result from a cost advantage of larger market makers at failing.\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is important-  Read this:\n\n**(hUh WuT mEaN? :   It's basically saying shorts often chose not to deliver based off the Cost to Borrow price but still short. Everyone in retail thinks that when shorts are out of shares on Ortex or fintel, they can't drop the price. This is saying the opposite. They are saying at times, that they will just chose to Fail to Deliver on top of borrowing shorts. Sometimes both. Basically shorts and Maker Makers have built naked shorting and choosing to Fail to Deliver into their business models.   Sometimes, its more cost effective to just wait so they eat the FTD fine and then just cover when the stock is lower.   It's another layer they have of power.

Before reading, **please note that I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. These plays are extremely risky and you should consult a financial advisor or do your own research before making financial decisions.** \n\nQuick note: my track record is that I called out IRNT (I didn't discover it but I called it out before it happened) and RKLY. I have also been a part of and profited from many other squeezes, so I understand how squeezes work and am knowledgeable about them.\n\n# 1. The anatomy of a gamma squeeze\n\nI'll put it plain and simple, reddit absolutely sucks at finding and playing gamma squeezes. For every gain porn post you see, there are hundreds of bag holders (more on why that is later). In this section, I will explain the anatomy of a gamma squeeze and how to actually spot one. There are two components of a gamma squeeze: 1. unusually high call open interest for ATM and near the money call options on the closest expiry and 2. a technical setup that would allow for a breakout move in the near future. \n\nWhy are those the two keys? The first one should be obvious, as you need high call OI for a gamma squeeze to happen. The reason for this is because of market maker delta hedging. Market makers are constantly buying and selling shares based on the delta of the calls they sell. The reason for this is because they need to remain market neutral for conflict of interest purposes and portfolio strategy purposes (they are delta neutral, long theta, and short vega, which is why they make their money when IV decreases and theta eats away at option premium values). Gamma is the rate of change of delta. Gamma is the highest in the strike immediately above and the strike immediately below the current price. This means that when a stock makes a strong move upward, market makers have to buy the most shares to hedge due to these near the money options because their gamma increases delta at the highest rate. The point of a gamma squeeze is that when a stock with unusually high ATM and near the money call open interest makes an aggressively move upward, the option gamma rapidly increases delta for the huge amount of options, so market makers must buy tons of shares to remain delta neutral, which further pushes up the stock. Most of you probably already understand this concept as it has been widely talked about.\n\nWhat most people don't seem to understand is how to identify the second part of a gamma squeeze setup. Most people are good at identifying when a stock has unusually high call OI, but the second crucial aspect is a technical setup that would allow for a breakout move in the near future. This is important because a gamma squeeze can only happen if a stock's price increases thus increasing delta and forcing delta hedging. A stock could have a perfect gamma squeeze setup on the option chain but if it doesn't move upward, there will be no gamma squeeze because gamma won't increase delta. That's why the technical setup is so important. Just a note, but many gamma squeezes have happened due to good option OI stats and random good news pushing up the stock and causing a gamma squeeze. Since that is random and unpredictable, a technical setup is the next best thing because we can predict it with more certainty. \n\nThe technical setup part is pretty easy once you understand why it's necessary. You are usually looking for something like a bounce off an upcoming support, a wedge, triangle, or bull flag being formed, or some other consolidation setup where a bullish breakout is possible in the near future. Additionally, an upcoming catalyst or event could suffice. \n\n# 2. Why Reddit holds the bag and sucks at squeezes\n\nI am going to put it plain and simple again: Reddit/retail absolutely sucks at playing squeezes. First, most don't understand the second part of the gamma squeeze (the technical setup) and simply look for high call OI plays, which can be successful, but is far less probable than one with a technical setup. Second, for some reason that I still don't understand, reddit/retail refuses to enter squeeze plays until after they have already happened. In both my IRNT and RKLY posts, so many people said I was completely wrong and retarded (which is fair). However, when those plays squeezed the next day, some of those same people messaged me days later asking if the squeeze was still happening. This is why people hold the bag - they refuse to buy before the squeeze starts and then FOMO into plays that are already dead. Retail traders have it hard enough with all of the disadvantages facing us in financial markets, but FOMO retardation is an unacceptable cardinal sin.\n\nNext, everyone on reddit has ADHD. Someone made a post a few days ago about why reddit sucks at squeezing and noted that it takes weeks for short squeezes to happen and reddit keeps falling for pump and dumps because they can't stay in one play for more than a few days. I completely agree with this. With that being said, I'm going to assert that 99% of plays on reddit have been gamma squeezes or pump and dumps. The only plays that were short squeezes were AMC and GME and that's because they have cult followings who were willing to hold for months (these stocks also had gamma squeeze elements so it wasn't a pure short squeeze). With that being said, gamma squeezes are perfect for reddit because they don't take a long time to happen. If the call OI is there, it only takes a strong move upward for the squeeze to happen. With short squeezes, large institutions won't be margin called until they are down 100's of percent for weeks at a time.\n\n# 3. ATER's coming gamma squeeze and why it could be violent\n\nSo far I have explained to you the two necessities for gamma squeeze plays. I have also explained to you why gamma squeezes are good plays for ADHD redditors. Finally, I have explained to you why redditors often hold the bag even though they shouldn't be. With that being said, I am here to tell you of an opportunity that checks off both of the gamma squeeze boxes, hasn't taken off yet, and has strong name recognition among retail: ATER. \n\n**Option Chain and Gamma Analysis**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3htbafht4pr71.png?width=2294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36f4038281f0a8f09e861a49add518f9fa4e68e4\n\nFirst, we have the option chain. As you can see, $10 is an absolutely crucial strike as the OI is over 10,000. Additionally, there is a gamma ramp all the way up to the $20 strike (as evident by the insanely high OI in those strikes). The total OI for the $10 - $20 chain is over 75,000 total contracts (this would be equal to 7,500,000 if all contracts were exercised. Notice the gamma for the 10, 12,5, and 15 strikes are all above .065. This means that a $1 increase in the price of the stock would create a .10 increase in delta (for the $10 strike). A .10 increase would mean that 10 shares would need to be bought for the market maker to remain delta neutral, which means that a $1 move upward in the stock would force market makers to buy over 100,000 shares to remain delta neutral only for the $10 strike. You can imagine what happens as price keeps going up and gamma keeps increasing delta exponentially. The fact that call volume for those strikes starkly outweighs put volume is further bullish AND because market makers constantly (and often automatically through algorithms) delta hedge, a stark move upwards would cause market makers who were short puts to cover their short shares (used to delta hedge puts) thus causing further upward pressure. \n\nBelow I have used Thinkorswim's OnDemand feature to look back at the option chain for the closest strike before each of the previous moves up. \n\nFirst, this is the option chain on September 30 when the stock was about $9. This is just to compare it to now. As you can see, option OI has steadily been going up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u26g0tjo6pr71.png?width=2314&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ec258c128c0e9fd6230f2cc213b1af0ad97c099\n\nNext, the option chain for September 20, which is right after the first price jump and before the second one. The stock was trading at around $20. You can see that option OI was still pretty strong (though 25 days to expiry is kinda far out) but not nearly as strong as it is now. Despite this, the stock still made yet another move up to almost $20.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n92fo9407pr71.png?width=2306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=533ea72b558e02548e99eb0d2abeb6e7335d3f41\n\nFinally, we have the option chain from Sept 8 when the stock was trading at $8. This was before the giant squeeze up to $19 (the very first one). Notice a similar setup to now? High ATM and near the money call OI. The biggest difference? There's no gamma ramp here unlike what we have now. Overall option OI is also lower than what we currently have.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m1fto2s97pr71.png?width=2304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=974976a930440ef4841d8c683a139afc200e4ad6\n\nWhat these images should show you is that ATER's option chain has pretty definitive characteristics before each gamma squeeze and that the current setup is by far the strongest. \n\nFinally, I have the put/call ratio for today and overall. As you can see, calls are dominating puts.\n\n[Total](https://preview.redd.it/f93eshgi8pr71.png?width=1202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c0808a187954a3c5e8269b727a7c82567869802)\n\n[today](https://preview.redd.it/gyznkggi8pr71.png?width=2258&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41694177fe317565c701ef229e1fbdbf2b26f094)\n\n**Technical Setup**\n\nNow that you've seen the options chain setup, it's time for the technical setup. Remember the technical setup is crucial because it is what allows gamma to start to affect delta. Think of the technical setup as the push to get up on the gamma ramp. We are currently not on the gamma ramp, but the technical setup is what would push us up to it. \n\nBelow are the 5m, 90m, and 1D charts for ATER:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hjt2urbb9pr71.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=028fad76867a98502732fd5243beb007fde82296\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fs19cc8c9pr71.png?width=2162&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d00b085e993ab135f2f650d0b1f1d1b09321d177\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gvermqwjbpr71.png?width=2156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83f054ca3c1ba6f0e0aaee7d52dc213bc97f8a9f\n\nYou'll notice that the technical setup here is absolutely clear. The \\~$9.50 level is a very strong support. On the day chart and 90 min chart, you'll notice that the stock bounced off of it twice. The support even survived the recent market turmoil, which is a strong statement. Each time that the stock reaches the support level, volume dries up, which shows that it is again a very strong support. Finally, you can clearly see the triangle pattern emerging on both the 90m and 5m charts. Both of these charts show that the triangle is going to end in the next few days. Here is what a triangle pattern like this typically does.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/inju9k1x9pr71.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=915f8f96758b45bddf9bfca9c99c61b2a6483f68\n\nIf the triangle breaks out in a bullish way, then it means that the stock will go to AT LEAST $12 (without considering gamma). Once the stock reaches above $11, IMO, gamma will take over and send the stock up further to at least the $18 level and possibly above the previous two highs. Like I said, the technical setup is what pushes us up to allow gamma to take over, and this is a very strong technical setup. Since we keep respecting the 9.5 level, I would say it's very likely that we break out. I have been playing this stock for the past few weeks and IMO it is blatantly clear that this is a continuation of the previous jumps: bounce off of support, low volume on support, and strong call OI - I've seen it before and I'm currently seeing it now. That's why I'm saying this is an opportunity to get in on a squeeze play before it squeezes so you aren't holding the bag for the 5349239120 time. \n\n**Other stuff**\n\nI could go over the fact that the borrow fee on the stock is high, available shares are drying up, something about float, something about short interest, something with ortex signals, but I'm not going to do that because it's all just noise. This is not a short squeeze play. Most reddit plays are not short squeeze plays, so those stats do not matter even close to as much as the gamma setup and the technical setup. \n\nPlease see the note at the beginning about the risks involved with plays like this, doing your own research, etc.\n\n**This is not financial advice trade at your own risk.**",

Evans Christopher C. Geczy David K. Musto Adam V. Reed*  Submitted to the SEC  (May 25th, 2006)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Regulations allow market makers to short sell without borrowing stock, and the transactions of a major options market maker show that in most hard-to-borrow situations, it chooses not to borrow and instead fails to deliver stock to its buyers. Some of the value of failing passes through to option prices: when failing is cheaper than borrowing, the relation between borrowing costs and option prices is significantly weaker. The remaining value is profit to the market maker, and its ability to profit despite the usual competition between market makers appears to result from a cost advantage of larger market makers at failing.\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is important-  Read this:\n\n**(hUh WuT mEaN? :   It's basically saying shorts often chose not to deliver based off the Cost to Borrow price but still short. Everyone in retail thinks that when shorts are out of shares on Ortex or fintel, they can't drop the price. This is saying the opposite. They are saying at times, that they will just chose to Fail to Deliver on top of borrowing shorts. Sometimes both. Basically shorts and Maker Makers have built naked shorting and choosing to Fail to Deliver into their business models.   Sometimes, its more cost effective to just wait so they eat the FTD fine and then just cover when the stock is lower.   It's another layer they have of power. Then on top of that Market Makers have the ability to drop the price through Short Exempt status where they don't have to follow any of the rules that shorts do. )**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-520/4520-6.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-520/4520-6.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# ****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\n\n# \n\n# \n\n# Max Pain\n\n# \n\nLet me explain.

What they will do is run the price up high so bullish options traders thinking its going to moon so they start buying 12.5, 15, 20, 30 strikes. Then they will run the stock super low to draw in the bears getting them to buy 7.5 puts, 5 puts, etc.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen they pin the price to where it fucks over the max amount of options players.

ATER should have had a ton more buying pressure when we were pushing pushing up but it was easily pushed down with a small amount of short interest. That shows me a lot.  Market Makers do not want this to run because they would be left holding the bag and they have chosen not to properly hedge the call side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# This is similar to GameStop before they got the Volume.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was there with GameStop in Dec/Jan when the shorts thought they had control of the GME and then a surge of retail investors bought up the entire ITM options chains on the stock.  Honestly, it happened so fast last time I didn't realize how fucked those Market Makers were at the time.\n\n# \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ux0bi917fas71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1bd103fbdfebeea385d2f0e9e1822c479c3d0cd\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# ATER is literally fighting a market maker.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So lets go back to the FTD idea....Who has the most to lose if the price spikes for ATER to let's say $26 by Oct 15th??**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSay the shorts start covering their millions of shorted shares and now it's $26??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Who is fucked now?\n\n# \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**That's right the market maker who now has MILLIONS of shares to provide, if people execute their ITM calls that they didn't properly hedge against. So it's cheaper for them to pin the price to max pain than allow the stock to run because they most likely don't have or might not have the ability to provide those shares. Which would cause more buying pressure because they would have to go to the market and buy more shares.....which puts more shares ITM which is what a Gamma Squeeze is.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou want to see the amount of FTD's spike hard?? Then see what the numbers are for T+6 after that run up. There would be millions of FTD's that would occur instead of 700k.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# ATER gets super dangerous the more retail just buys and holds. The price target from Main Street is $15 to $20. Anything under that is a buy. ATER sitting at $7 bucks, that's some fucking good safe value for a stock with squeeze potential. ***ATER Shares are also completely locked up until Nov 1st.

Before reading, **please note that I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. These plays are extremely risky and you should consult a financial advisor or do your own research before making financial decisions.** \n\nQuick note: my track record is that I called out IRNT (I didn't discover it but I called it out before it happened) and RKLY. I have also been a part of and profited from many other squeezes, so I understand how squeezes work and am knowledgeable about them.\n\n# 1. The anatomy of a gamma squeeze\n\nI'll put it plain and simple, reddit absolutely sucks at finding and playing gamma squeezes. For every gain porn post you see, there are hundreds of bag holders (more on why that is later). In this section, I will explain the anatomy of a gamma squeeze and how to actually spot one. There are two components of a gamma squeeze: 1. unusually high call open interest for ATM and near the money call options on the closest expiry and 2. a technical setup that would allow for a breakout move in the near future. \n\nWhy are those the two keys? The first one should be obvious, as you need high call OI for a gamma squeeze to happen. The reason for this is because of market maker delta hedging. Market makers are constantly buying and selling shares based on the delta of the calls they sell. The reason for this is because they need to remain market neutral for conflict of interest purposes and portfolio strategy purposes (they are delta neutral, long theta, and short vega, which is why they make their money when IV decreases and theta eats away at option premium values). Gamma is the rate of change of delta. Gamma is the highest in the strike immediately above and the strike immediately below the current price. This means that when a stock makes a strong move upward, market makers have to buy the most shares to hedge due to these near the money options because their gamma increases delta at the highest rate. The point of a gamma squeeze is that when a stock with unusually high ATM and near the money call open interest makes an aggressively move upward, the option gamma rapidly increases delta for the huge amount of options, so market makers must buy tons of shares to remain delta neutral, which further pushes up the stock. Most of you probably already understand this concept as it has been widely talked about.\n\nWhat most people don't seem to understand is how to identify the second part of a gamma squeeze setup. Most people are good at identifying when a stock has unusually high call OI, but the second crucial aspect is a technical setup that would allow for a breakout move in the near future. This is important because a gamma squeeze can only happen if a stock's price increases thus increasing delta and forcing delta hedging. A stock could have a perfect gamma squeeze setup on the option chain but if it doesn't move upward, there will be no gamma squeeze because gamma won't increase delta. That's why the technical setup is so important. Just a note, but many gamma squeezes have happened due to good option OI stats and random good news pushing up the stock and causing a gamma squeeze. Since that is random and unpredictable, a technical setup is the next best thing because we can predict it with more certainty. \n\nThe technical setup part is pretty easy once you understand why it's necessary. You are usually looking for something like a bounce off an upcoming support, a wedge, triangle, or bull flag being formed, or some other consolidation setup where a bullish breakout is possible in the near future. Additionally, an upcoming catalyst or event could suffice. \n\n# 2. Why Reddit holds the bag and sucks at squeezes\n\nI am going to put it plain and simple again: Reddit/retail absolutely sucks at playing squeezes. First, most don't understand the second part of the gamma squeeze (the technical setup) and simply look for high call OI plays, which can be successful, but is far less probable than one with a technical setup. Second, for some reason that I still don't understand, reddit/retail refuses to enter squeeze plays until after they have already happened. In both my IRNT and RKLY posts, so many people said I was completely wrong and retarded (which is fair). However, when those plays squeezed the next day, some of those same people messaged me days later asking if the squeeze was still happening. This is why people hold the bag - they refuse to buy before the squeeze starts and then FOMO into plays that are already dead. Retail traders have it hard enough with all of the disadvantages facing us in financial markets, but FOMO retardation is an unacceptable cardinal sin.\n\nNext, everyone on reddit has ADHD. Someone made a post a few days ago about why reddit sucks at squeezing and noted that it takes weeks for short squeezes to happen and reddit keeps falling for pump and dumps because they can't stay in one play for more than a few days. I completely agree with this. With that being said, I'm going to assert that 99% of plays on reddit have been gamma squeezes or pump and dumps. The only plays that were short squeezes were AMC and GME and that's because they have cult followings who were willing to hold for months (these stocks also had gamma squeeze elements so it wasn't a pure short squeeze). With that being said, gamma squeezes are perfect for reddit because they don't take a long time to happen. If the call OI is there, it only takes a strong move upward for the squeeze to happen. With short squeezes, large institutions won't be margin called until they are down 100's of percent for weeks at a time.\n\n# 3. ATER's coming gamma squeeze and why it could be violent\n\nSo far I have explained to you the two necessities for gamma squeeze plays. I have also explained to you why gamma squeezes are good plays for ADHD redditors. Finally, I have explained to you why redditors often hold the bag even though they shouldn't be. With that being said, I am here to tell you of an opportunity that checks off both of the gamma squeeze boxes, hasn't taken off yet, and has strong name recognition among retail: ATER. \n\n**Option Chain and Gamma Analysis**\n\n*Processing img 3htbafht4pr71...*\n\nFirst, we have the option chain. As you can see, $10 is an absolutely crucial strike as the OI is over 10,000. Additionally, there is a gamma ramp all the way up to the $20 strike (as evident by the insanely high OI in those strikes). The total OI for the $10 - $20 chain is over 75,000 total contracts (this would be equal to 7,500,000 if all contracts were exercised. Notice the gamma for the 10, 12,5, and 15 strikes are all above .065. This means that a $1 increase in the price of the stock would create a .10 increase in delta (for the $10 strike). A .10 increase would mean that 10 shares would need to be bought for the market maker to remain delta neutral, which means that a $1 move upward in the stock would force market makers to buy over 100,000 shares to remain delta neutral only for the $10 strike. You can imagine what happens as price keeps going up and gamma keeps increasing delta exponentially. The fact that call volume for those strikes starkly outweighs put volume is further bullish AND because market makers constantly (and often automatically through algorithms) delta hedge, a stark move upwards would cause market makers who were short puts to cover their short shares (used to delta hedge puts) thus causing further upward pressure. \n\nBelow I have used Thinkorswim's OnDemand feature to look back at the option chain for the closest strike before each of the previous moves up. \n\nFirst, this is the option chain on September 30 when the stock was about $9. This is just to compare it to now. As you can see, option OI has steadily been going up.\n\n*Processing img u26g0tjo6pr71...*\n\nNext, the option chain for September 20, which is right after the first price jump and before the second one. The stock was trading at around $20. You can see that option OI was still pretty strong (though 25 days to expiry is kinda far out) but not nearly as strong as it is now. Despite this, the stock still made yet another move up to almost $20.\n\n*Processing img n92fo9407pr71...*\n\nFinally, we have the option chain from Sept 8 when the stock was trading at $8. This was before the giant squeeze up to $19 (the very first one). Notice a similar setup to now? High ATM and near the money call OI. The biggest difference? There's no gamma ramp here unlike what we have now. Overall option OI is also lower than what we currently have.\n\n*Processing img m1fto2s97pr71...*\n\nWhat these images should show you is that ATER's option chain has pretty definitive characteristics before each gamma squeeze and that the current setup is by far the strongest. \n\nFinally, I have the put/call ratio for today and overall. As you can see, calls are dominating puts.\n\n*Processing img f93eshgi8pr71...*\n\n*Processing img gyznkggi8pr71...*\n\n**Technical Setup**\n\nNow that you've seen the options chain setup, it's time for the technical setup. Remember the technical setup is crucial because it is what allows gamma to start to affect delta. Think of the technical setup as the push to get up on the gamma ramp. We are currently not on the gamma ramp, but the technical setup is what would push us up to it. \n\nBelow are the 5m, 90m, and 1D charts for ATER:\n\n*Processing img hjt2urbb9pr71...*\n\n*Processing img fs19cc8c9pr71...*\n\n*Processing img gvermqwjbpr71...*\n\nYou'll notice that the technical setup here is absolutely clear. The \\~$9.50 level is a very strong support. On the day chart and 90 min chart, you'll notice that the stock bounced off of it twice. The support even survived the recent market turmoil, which is a strong statement. Each time that the stock reaches the support level, volume dries up, which shows that it is again a very strong support. Finally, you can clearly see the triangle pattern emerging on both the 90m and 5m charts. Both of these charts show that the triangle is going to end in the next few days. Here is what a triangle pattern like this typically does.\n\n*Processing img inju9k1x9pr71...*\n\nIf the triangle breaks out in a bullish way, then it means that the stock will go to AT LEAST $12 (without considering gamma). Once the stock reaches above $11, IMO, gamma will take over and send the stock up further to at least the $18 level and possibly above the previous two highs. Like I said, the technical setup is what pushes us up to allow gamma to take over, and this is a very strong technical setup. Since we keep respecting the 9.5 level, I would say it's very likely that we break out. I have been playing this stock for the past few weeks and IMO it is blatantly clear that this is a continuation of the previous jumps: bounce off of support, low volume on support, and strong call OI - I've seen it before and I'm currently seeing it now. That's why I'm saying this is an opportunity to get in on a squeeze play before it squeezes so you aren't holding the bag for the 5349239120 time. \n\n**Other stuff**\n\nI could go over the fact that the borrow fee on the stock is high, available shares are drying up, something about float, something about short interest, something with ortex signals, but I'm not going to do that because it's all just noise. This is not a short squeeze play. Most reddit plays are not short squeeze plays, so those stats do not matter even close to as much as the gamma setup and the technical setup. \n\nPlease see the note at the beginning about the risks involved with plays like this, doing your own research, etc.",

We deliver reliable launch services, spacecraft components, satellites and other spacecraft and on-orbit management solutions that make it faster, easier and more affordable to access space. We believe that space has defined some of humanity\u2019s greatest achievements and it continues to shape our future. We are motivated by the impact we can have on Earth by making it easier to get to space and to use it as a platform for innovation, exploration and infrastructure.\n\nUnprecedented commercial investment and government expenditures are driving rapid growth in the space economy. As one of only two commercial companies delivering regular access to orbit, our proven launch vehicle, spacecraft technology and global infrastructure uniquely position us to capture this growing market. Advances in technologies, materials and components have led to miniaturization of satellites and a significant reduction in cost, while at the same time the need for space applications such as communications, remote sensing, Earth observation, meteorology and navigation is increasing. We provide customers with frequent, reliable and cost-effective access to orbit for this new generation of small satellites with Electron, a fully carbon composite launch vehicle powered by 3D printed engines. Since our first Electron launch in 2017 through July 2021, we have delivered 105 satellites to space across 18 successful orbital missions for commercial and government customers, including the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), and a number of domestic and international commercial spacecraft operators including Blacksky Holdings, Canon, Capella Space, Planet, OHB Group and Synspective. We have also had two failed launches, including our most recent launch on July 29, 2021. Since our most recent failed launch, we have completed an extensive internal fault tree analysis, implemented corrective actions and received authorization from the FAA to resume launches. Our next launch is currently expected to occur in October 2021. In 2020, Electron was the second most frequently launched rocket by companies operating in the United States and established us as the fourth most frequent launcher globally.\n\nRocket Lab\u2019s frequent launch cadence has been enabled through innovative manufacturing techniques for Electron, including 3D printing and automation, but production is only part of the formula for frequent and reliable launches. Our launch infrastructure is a key part of our success. We currently operate a private launch complex located in Mahia, New Zealand, which we refer to as Launch Complex 1. This launch complex is supported by a bi-lateral treaty between the United States and New Zealand governments that enables us to use U.S. launch and spacecraft technology for launches at Launch Complex 1 that otherwise would not be permitted for launches from foreign soil. This treaty provides us with a competitive advantage over other companies launching rockets from outside the U.S. that do not have the benefit of such a treaty. Additionally, by operating our own private launch complex, we do not have to share the launch complex with other launch providers and, subject to obtaining required regulatory clearances for launches, have complete control over launch schedule and availability. Launch Complex 1 serves as our high-volume launch complex, capable of supporting up to 120 missions every year. We also have access to use a dedicated launch pad at NASA\u2019s Wallops Flight Facility, at Wallops Island, Virginia, which we refer to as Launch Complex 2. We have built out all of the physical infrastructure that we need in order to use this launch complex and, upon certification of our flight termination system software by NASA, we will be able to begin scheduling launches from this launch complex. Rocket Lab\u2019s operations, including this launch complex as part of our overall business, have received the designation of Essential Critical Infrastructure for National Security from the U.S. Department of Defense, and can support 24-hour rapid call-up capability for defense needs and urgent constellation replenishment. We expect to be able to launch up to 12 missions per year from Launch Complex 2 once it becomes operational.\n\nBuilding on our strong foundation with Electron, we are now developing our Neutron launch vehicle, which will be an advanced 8-ton payload class launch vehicle tailored for large constellation deployments, interplanetary missions and human spaceflight. We expect constellation missions to make up an increasing percentage of small satellites launched, yet there is currently no commercial medium lift class launch vehicle to meet this demand. Neutron will be tailored to meet demand from this growing market.\n\nFrom launch services, Rocket Lab has expanded into space systems, delivering spacecraft as a service from low Earth orbit constellations to deep space and interplanetary missions for government and commercial customers. Our space services business utilizes our launch services, our family of Photon spacecraft and partnerships with global ground network service providers, as well as our own ground station network to provide customers a complete solution that encompasses spacecraft build, launch and on-orbit operation following launch.\n\n**Our Competitive Strengths**\n\nOur competitive strengths include:\n\n**Flight Heritage \u2013   First Mover Advantage:** Electron is the first small launch   vehicle to establish frequent and reliable access to space with 18 successful   orbital missions through July 2021. Successfully reaching orbit not just   once, but repeatedly delivering mission success across more than three years   of launches demonstrates a mature launch vehicle, sophisticated team and   robust manufacturing infrastructure and processes. We believe this gives us a   significant competitive advantage ahead of potential new competitors to   secure higher-value missions from our customer.\n\n**Unique   Technologies and Capabilities:** We have innovated around key   launch vehicle and spacecraft features and capabilities, including:\n\n* An all carbon   composite orbital launch vehicle, delivering substantial mass-savings while   maintaining strong structural integrity\n* A 3D printed,   electric-pump fed rocket engine that delivers high-performance while removing   the complexity associated with traditional gas turbine engines\n* A unique kick   stage that delivers satellites to precise and individual orbits increasing   deployment flexibility and cost effectiveness for our customers. The kick   stage can also be utilized as a fully- featured satellite, enabling hosted   payload opportunities for our customers and for our own constellation   applications.\n\n**Deep Vertical Integration:** We   have extensive vertically integrated design and manufacturing capabilities,   having developed world-class engineering and manufacturing teams across the   United States, New Zealand and Canada. This allows us to manage and control   almost every aspect of design, manufacturing and launch operations, enabling   rapid prototyping and streamlined production to deliver product to orbit   faster.\n\n**Additive   Manufacturing Capabilities:** We believe we were the first company to   3D print an orbital rocket engine, and as of July 2021 have flight heritage   with 220 engines launched to space. We leverage our unique 3D printing   capabilities beyond engines, to enable ultra-rapid design and testing of new   flight hardware and dramatically shorten our time-to-market.\n\n**Integrated Design   and Test Capabilities:** We own and operate our own propulsion   test infrastructure, allowing us the capacity and flexibility to accelerate   time-to-market and ensure quality and a high rate of mission success.\n\n**Private Launch   Complex:**   Rocket Lab operates its private orbital launch complex, Launch Complex 1 in   Mahia, New Zealand. This launch complex can support up to 120 launches every   year, which is significantly more than the current annual total number of   launches from all U.S. spaceports combined. By operating our own private   launch complex, we have eliminated the availability issues commonly faced by   other launch providers competing for a limited number of slots on shared   launch complexes that they do not control.\n\n**A complete   end-to-end space solution**: Providing services and data from space   has traditionally meant relying on multiple suppliers and mission partners.   By manufacturing and launching our own rockets, producing and operating our   own spacecraft, operating our own launch complexes, creating our own   spacecraft components and, through our partnerships, as well as our ground   station network, securing access to a global ground station network \u2013 Rocket   Lab has the keys to space. Having successfully proven all aspects of   accessing and using space, we are well positioned to move into delivering   space applications using our own established products and infrastructure.\n\n**Customers**\n\n***Launch Services.*** As of July 2021, we have launched and deployed 105 satellites for our customers, which includes government customers, such as the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA and other U.S. government agencies. We also provide launch services to major domestic and international commercial spacecraft operators. Our launch services have been used by more than 20 organizations. U.S. Government customers have accounted for approximately 36% of the revenues through June 30, 2021 with commercial, foreign governments and education customers accounting for the remaining approximately 64%.\n\n***Space Systems*****.** As of December 31, 2020, we have flight hardware and spacecraft that has flown on over 70 missions, many involving multiple spacecrafts per mission, including legacy missions enabled by Sinclair Interplanetary, which we acquired in April 2020.\n\n**Our Growth Strategy**\n\nWe are pursuing the following growth strategies:\n\n* Leverage our   market position as the first U.S. commercially operational dedicated small   launch provider with NASA Category 1 certification, 18 successful launches,   and 105 satellite deployed, to be entrusted with increasingly critical   payloads and rewarded with higher-valued launch services contracts.\n* Expand our   addressable launch market with the development of the Neutron launch vehicle,   which will enable significantly higher revenue per launch with its capability   to deploy larger spacecraft and greater numbers of spacecraft per launch as   compared to our Electron launch vehicle, and will also be capable of   supporting crewed flight and cargo resupply to the International Space   Station, which our Electron launch vehicle is not capable of supporting.\n* Apply world-class   manufacturing scaling and cost-reduction capabilities to the production of   our existing family of component subsystems for satellites and other   spacecraft to capture large constellation design win opportunities.\n* Expand our   portfolio of strategic components for satellites and other spacecraft by   commercializing solutions developed for our launch vehicles and family of   Photon spacecraft, including; avionics subsystems, radios, batteries, solar   panels and separation systems.\n* Leverage our   proven Photon spacecraft platform to provide streamlined hosted payload and   technology demonstration capabilities in low Earth orbit to commercial and   government customers without the need for customers to utilize a separately   designed and built third-party satellite bus to place the satellite in the   correct position.\n* Build upon   ongoing interplanetary Photon spacecraft development efforts as well as our   announced Neutron launch vehicle developments to expand our addressable   market for interplanetary scientific and commercial missions.\n* Leverage our cost   and frequency advantaged \u201caccess to space,\u201d enabled by our established launch   assets and proven capabilities, to further penetrate the available market for   on-orbit management of previously launched satellites, which we believe to be   over $900 million per year, in addition to expanding our own spacecraft   assets on orbit to deliver and monetize space data with end-customers.\n* Exploit our   in-house launch and space systems capabilities to provide data and services   to the market with our own satellites launched by our own rockets.\n\n**Product &amp; Services Overview**\n\nWe design and manufacture small and medium-class rockets, satellite spacecraft components, satellites and other spacecraft to support the space economy. Our launch services are used to place spacecraft into Earth orbit and escape trajectories, and utilize orbital launch vehicles that place payloads into a variety of planes/inclinations and altitude trajectories. Our satellite and other spacecraft components are the building blocks for spacecraft that are sold commercially, which includes reaction wheels, star trackers, magnetic torque rods and batteries with additional products in development to serve a wide variety of sub-system functions. Our family of Photon spacecraft is configurable for a range of low Earth orbit, medium Earth orbit, geosynchronous orbit and interplanetary missions.\n\n* **Launch Services**: We   currently provide reliable and responsive launch services on Electron for   small spacecraft up to 300 kg. We also have a Neutron launch vehicle in   development to provide efficient constellation launch services for payloads   up to 8,000 kg. Between these two launch vehicles, we expect to have the   capability of launching nearly all of the satellites that we expect to be   launched through 2029. We can support up to 120 launch opportunities every   year, from Launch Complex 1, which is our private launch complex in Mahia,   New Zealand, and, upon certification of our flight termination system   software by NASA, will be able to begin scheduling additional launches from   Launch Complex 2 at NASA\u2019s Wallops Flight Facility, at Wallops Island,   Virginia.\n* **Space Systems**: We   provide spacecraft solutions for government and commercial customers ranging   from complete spacecraft development, manufacture and operation in low Earth   orbit and deep space to selling individual spacecraft components for use by   customers in constructing their own spacecraft. With our space systems   solutions, customers no longer need to build their own spacecraft. They can   buy a launch, spacecraft, ground services and on-orbit management following   launch as a complete package, streamlining their path to orbit.\n\n  \n\n***Launch Services***\n\nWe design, manufacture and launch orbital rockets to deploy payloads to low Earth orbit and interplanetary destinations.\n\nElectron is our orbital small launch vehicle that was designed from the ground up to accommodate a high launch rate business model to meet the growing and dynamic needs of our customers for small launch services. Combining the use of innovative manufacturing technologies including 3D printing and automation, Electron is optimized for rapid and frequent launch and has established itself as one of the most prolific and reliable launch vehicles in the market. Since its maiden launch in 2017, Electron has become the leading small spacecraft launch vehicle delivering 105 satellites to orbit for government and commercial customers across 18 successful orbital missions through July 2021. In 2020, Electron was the second most frequently launched rocket by companies operating in the United States and established Rocket Lab as the fourth most frequent launcher globally. Our launch services program has seen us develop many industry innovations, including 3D printed rocket engines, an electric-pump-fed rocket engine, fully carbon composite first stage fuel tanks, a private orbital launch complex, a rocket stage that converts into a spacecraft on orbit, and the ability to successfully recover a stage from space, providing a path to reusability.\n\nElectron provides tailored access to orbit for the high-growth small spacecraft market across dedicated and rideshare missions. It is capable of deploying satellites of up to 660 lbs (300 kg) to low Earth orbit across a wide range of orbital inclinations from 38 to 120 degrees. Electron is also capable of delivering spacecraft to deep space and interplanetary destinations, a capability which we will demonstrate in 2021 with the launch of a NASA mission to the Moon in support of the agency\u2019s Artemis program. Electron is a two-stage launch vehicle with a third kick stage, standing at 18 meters tall, with a diameter of 1.2 meters and a lift-off mass of approximately 14,000 kg. Electron\u2019s design includes innovative use of electrical systems and advanced carbon-composites for its structures and propellant tanks. Carbon-composite construction decreases mass by as much as 40 percent relative to other materials, contributing to Electron\u2019s mass-to-orbit performance. Our in-house assembly of Electron\u2019s composite tanks and structures improves cost efficiency and supports high rates of production. Electron\u2019s kick stage enables satellites to be placed in circular orbit after launch, which is necessary for satellites to maintain consistent altitude and is capable of engine restarts to deliver multiple payloads to a range of orbits, meeting precise orbit insertion requirements, and deorbiting itself to avoid contributing to orbital debris, also known as space junk.\n\nElectron is propelled by a total of ten Rutherford engines that we manufacture at our headquarters in Long Beach, California. The Rutherford engine is a 5,600-lbf engine fueled by liquid oxygen and kerosene fed by electric pumps and is based on a propulsion cycle that makes use of electric motors and high-performance lithium polymer batteries to drive liquid oxygen and kerosene fuel pumps. Electric pumps are lower complexity than the turbomachinery typically required for gas generator cycles, yet still achieve high efficiency. We believe our Rutherford engine is the first oxygen/hydrocarbon engine to use additive manufacturing for all primary components, including the regeneratively cooled thrust chamber, injector pumps and main valves.\n\nElectron is currently launched from our private launch complex in Mahia, New Zealand and, upon certification of our flight termination system software by NASA, we plan to begin launching Electron from our new launch complex at NASA\u2019s Wallops Flight Facility, at Wallops Island, Virginia. As of July 2021, Electron had successfully launched 18 times and deployed 105 satellites to orbit. We have also had two failed launches. Since our most recent failed launch in May 2021, we have completed an extensive internal fault tree analysis, implemented corrective actions and received authorization from the FAA to resume launches. Our next launch currently is expected to occur in October 2021.\n\nIn March 2021, we announced plans to develop our reusable-ready medium-capacity Neutron launch vehicle which will increase the payload capacity of our space launch vehicles to approximately 17,000 lbs (8,000 kg), for launches to low-Earth orbit and lighter payloads into higher orbits. Neutron will be tailored for commercial and U.S. government constellation launches and capable of human space flight and cargo and crew resupply to the International Space Station. Neutron will also provide a dedicated service to orbit for larger civil, defense and commercial payloads that need a level of schedule control and high-flight cadence not available on large and heavy lift rockets. Neutron is expected to have the capability of launching nearly all of the spacecraft that we expect to be launched through 2029, and we expect to be able to leverage Electron\u2019s flight heritage, various vehicle subsystems designs, launch complexes and ground station infrastructure.\n\nThe medium-lift Neutron will be a two-stage launch vehicle that stands 46 meters (150 feet) tall with a 5-meter (16.4 ft) diameter fairing and a lift capacity of up to 8,000 kg (8 metric tons) to low-Earth orbit, 2,000 kg to the Moon (2 metric tons), and 1,500 kg to Mars and Venus (1.5 metric tons). Neutron will feature a reusable first stage designed to land on an ocean platform, enabling a higher launch cadence and decreased launch costs for customers. Neutron launches are planned to take place from Virginia\u2019s Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport located at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility. We aim to leverage existing launch pad and integration infrastructure at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport, with the goal of lessening the incremental investments in a new pad and accelerating the timeline to first launch, expected in 2024. \n\n***Space Systems***\n\nOur space systems product and services offerings include the Photon family of spacecraft, a portfolio of market and technology leading satellite and other spacecraft components, spacecraft engineering and design services, and on-orbit constellation management services.\n\nThe Photon family of small spacecraft is configurable for a range of low Earth orbit, medium Earth orbit, geosynchronous orbit, and interplanetary missions. Photon is a versatile platform that can be adapted to meet a broad range of our customers\u2019 requirements. Photon can operate as the upper stage of Electron (the kick stage) during launch, then with a simple command it will transition to an operational satellite on orbit, eliminating the parasitic mass of deployed spacecraft and enabling full use of the fairing volume for payloads. Photon can also fly on other launch vehicles, such as our recently announced in-development Neutron launch vehicle, and as a secondary payload on rockets developed under the National Security Space Launch program of the U.S. Space Force. Our Photon family of spacecraft enable us to offer an end-to-end mission solution encompassing launch, spacecraft, ground services, and mission operations to provide customers with streamlined access to orbit with Rocket Lab as a single mission partner.\n\nOur family of Photon spacecraft can be used to conduct space-related scientific research, collect imagery and other remote-sensing data about the Earth, carry out lunar and other deep space planetary missions, and to demonstrate new space technologies. Our family of Photon spacecraft can also be used in combination with Electron to deploy individual spacecraft in different orbital locations and complete constellations in a single mission. Our spacecraft are intended for commercial, defense and civil government customers, including the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA, other U.S. government agencies, and governments worldwide. Our first Photon spacecraft was successfully launched and placed into service in August 2020 and a second operational Photon was successfully launched in March 2021. Photon has been selected by NASA in 2021 for the CAPSTONE mission, which is a pathfinder for the lunar Gateway initiative of the Artemis program, which involves a mini- space station NASA intends to use as a staging point for crewed lunar landings beginning as soon as 2024. Photon has also been selected for interplanetary missions to Mars and Venus.\n\n***Spacecraft Components***\n\nRocket Lab designs and manufactures a range of components for satellites and other spacecraft, including reaction wheels, star trackers, magnetic torque rods and batteries, and has additional products in development to serve a wide variety of sub-system functions. Rocket Lab entered this market with our acquisition of leading spacecraft components manufacturer Sinclair Interplanetary, which brought incremental vertically-integrated capabilities for our own spacecraft, and also enabled Rocket Lab to deliver high-volume manufacturing of critical spacecraft components at scale prices to the broader spacecraft merchant market.\n\nReaction wheels are motor-driven flywheels used to store angular momentum on a spacecraft. Many spacecrafts use three or four reaction wheels to provide agile 3-axis pointing control. Some configurations use a single wheel, called a \u201c**momentum wheel**,\u201d for stable Earth-pointing control. All Rocket Lab reaction wheels incorporate an onboard digital processor with speed and torque control loops. We make a large number of different wheel sizes. Wheels are sized by their maximum angular momentum measured in Newton-meters (Nm). Bigger spacecraft require bigger wheels, but determination of the correct size of wheel for a particular spacecraft requires detailed engineering analysis.\n\nStar trackers are optical sensors that determines the spacecraft\u2019s pointing direction and rotation rate by looking at the stars. Our star trackers are fully integrated units, where one box includes the lens, detector, processor, and all of the power supply and support circuits. A catalog of more than two million possible star triangles is loaded before launch, allowing the processor to determine the direction from any single image.\n\nMagnetic torque rods are long bars of special alloy steel, wound with coils of fine copper wire. When a current is passed through the wire, it becomes an electromagnet which generates a twisting force against the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Magnetic torque rods are used in low Earth orbit to remove angular momentum from reaction wheels, avoiding the requirement to expend irreplaceable propellant.\n\nBatteries include both the high-capacity high-voltage batteries used to power the pumps in the Rutherford rocket engine used by Electron and other batteries used for small spacecraft.\n\n**Spacecraft Engineering and Design Services and On-Orbit Constellation Management Services**\n\nOur space systems engineering team works with customers to develop, design and manufacture full spacecraft solutions from low Earth orbit to interplanetary spacecraft. We also offer constellation management services where we perform command and control operations and leverage our ground station infrastructure and partnerships to deliver data to spacecraft constellation operator customers following launch.\n\n**Space Applications**\n\nOur in-house launch and space systems capabilities provide significant competitive advantages for us to begin providing our own data and services from orbit. By leveraging our Electron and Neutron launch vehicles, our Photon family of spacecraft, our private launch complex and through partnerships with global ground network service providers, as well as our own ground station network, we are able to provide a complete, end-to-end solution. Rocket Lab is uniquely positioned to deploy its own satellite constellations to meet growing demand for space-based connectivity, Earth observation and other services. The space applications market represents significant untapped potential for value-added services including data management and analytics to support end customer insights.\n\n**Sales and Business Development and Mission Management**\n\nWe sell our launch services and space systems solutions through a unified global business development team that cross-sells across both launch and space systems and leverages shared technical, proposal writing, mission project management and administrative resources. This team is based primarily in the United States and focuses on government customers, such as the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA, other U.S. government agencies, as well as major domestic and international commercial satellite operators and satellite bus manufacturers. The business development team works closely with our engineering teams to develop optimal solutions for our customers. Given the well-defined and consolidated nature of our customer base, we are able to adequately address our market with a lean and focused team. This team also leads customer engagement in the procurement process, assisting with documentation related to the request for information or request for proposal process, as well as detailed customer-specific product configuration.\n\nMany of our business development team members have previously worked for government agencies and large institutional space and technology companies. They have in-depth knowledge and understanding of the industry and can draw on a vast network of contacts to support business development. With 18 successful orbital missions, 105 satellites deployed and a growing number of Rocket Lab-built spacecraft components operating on orbit, our team has a high-level of insight into customer requirements and evolving industry trends, putting us in a strong position to ensure our products and services meet customer needs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Engineering***\n\nWe have made significant investments in our engineering teams. Our team members have a broad range of expertise from a range of industries including; aerospace, automotive, and marine, and broader manufacturing and technology. Rocket Lab\u2019s high level of vertical integration means that these engineering teams design and provide manufacturing support for components, sub-systems, and assemblies across the full range of our launch vehicles, our Photon family of spacecraft, our satellite, and other spacecraft components and our spacecraft engineering and design services. They support the full product lifecycle from new product innovation to sustaining engineering, including payload lift capacity increases and other performance improvements, new product features such as booster reusability and cost reduction initiatives.\n\nOur engineering teams across New Zealand, the United States, and Canada address all key areas of launch vehicle build, payload integration, launch operations, ground segment communications, on orbit spacecraft operations management, and satellite and other spacecraft component design and manufacturing. Key areas of technical focus include composite structures, additive manufacturing, machining, avionics and power systems, propulsion assembly and test, spacecraft system design assembly and test, printed circuit-board design, optics integration, guidance and navigation, attitude direction and command and control, amongst other engineering focus areas.\n\nThese teams are supported by centralized planning and program management functions that guide significant projects across Rocket Lab for consistency and visibility. The company leverages sophisticated product lifecycle management software tools, computer-aided design systems and business processes to drive efficiency and better manage the entire product lifecycle, including design, source and build the products the enable our launch services and end-product deliveries.\n\n**Supply Chain**\n\nWe are highly vertically integrated, in that we design and manufacture many components and subsystems for our launch vehicles, Photon family of spacecraft, and satellite and other spacecraft components we sell into the merchant market. To support this level of vertical integration we have developed extensive supply chain operations and capabilities that are global in nature and enabled by sophisticated third-party enterprise resource planning systems and tools. These systems and tools are largely supported by an in-house team of enterprise information systems personnel.\n\nWe obtain raw materials, components, sub-systems and capital equipment, and other supplies from suppliers that we believe to be reputable and reliable. We have established and follow internal quality control processes to source suppliers, considering engineering validation, quality, cost, delivery and lead-time. We have a quality management team that is responsible for managing and ensuring that supplied components meet quality standards. While we largely source raw materials and other inputs and services from multiple sources, in some cases we also purchase various inputs and services from a sole source. In those sole source supplier situations, as we endeavor to diversify our supply chain, we manage this sole source risk through carrying increased buffer stock, particularly on long-lead items.\n\n**Manufacturing, Assembly and Launch Operations**\n\nRocket Lab conducts global operations in support of its research and development manufacturing, assembly and launch operations. We have our Rutherford engines and avionics manufacturing facilities in Long Beach, California, composite manufacturing, high-voltage battery systems, and launch vehicle integration and propulsion testing in Auckland, New Zealand and launch complexes in Mahia, New Zealand and Wallops Island, Virginia. We strive to instill a manufacturing culture of continuous improvement and leverage best practices in quality control and worker safety across our facilities and have achieved Category-1 certification by the NASA Launch Services Program. We possess differentiated in-house rapid prototyping capabilities to support both research and development initiatives and to accelerate time-to-market benefits for critical production ramps. These capabilities include computer numerical control machining stations, balancing machines and 3D printers and related expertise.\n\n**Intellectual Property**\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we held three issued U.S. patents and had nine U.S. patent applications pending. Our U.S. issued patents expire between 2032 and 2040. As of December 31, 2020, we held six registered trademarks in the United States, including the Rocket Lab mark, and also held 36 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology.",
