On the other hand, the Dow Jones (DIA) was driven slightly lower due to weakness in financial and energy stocks while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, broke its winning streak to close 0.41% lower. Market participants continue to digest the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual Jackson Hole Symposium and a key speech by Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday. Looking ahead, market participants await a busy week for new economic data, with the August Jobs Report due out on Thursday.\n\nDespite hawkish statements by other Federal Reserve members in the July meeting minus, in his speech Powell remained highly accommodative, suggesting he was more inclined to wait to see further progress in the economy before tapering QE, especially in light of surging infections due to the Delta variant. Powell said, \u201cAt the FOMC's recent July meeting, I was of the view, as were most participants, that if the economy evolved broadly as anticipated, it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year. The intervening month has brought more progress in the form of a strong employment report for July, but also the further spread of the Delta variant. We will be carefully assessing incoming data and the evolving risks. Even after our asset purchases end, our elevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue.\u201d\n\nPowell once again urged caution since the economic recovery in the market is still undergoing, saying effects from an ill-timed policy shift would \u201carrive after the need has passed\u201d and \u201ccould be particularly harmful. Here is the full quote, \u201cThe main influence of monetary policy on inflation can come after a lag of a year or more. If a central bank tightens policy in response to factors that turn out to be temporary, the main policy effects are likely to arrive after the need has passed. The ill-timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic activity and pushes inflation lower than desired. Today, with substantial slack remaining in the labor market and the pandemic continuing, such a mistake could be particularly harmful. We know that extended periods of unemployment can mean lasting harm to workers and to the productive capacity of the economy.\u201d\n\nRegarding inflation, Powell once again reiterated the need for caution but suggested he was prepared to act if incoming data deems it appropriate. He said, \u201cCentral banks have always faced the problem of distinguishing transitory inflation spikes from more troublesome developments, and it is sometimes difficult to do so with confidence in real time. At such times, there is no substitute for a careful focus on incoming data and evolving risks. If sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal. Incoming data should provide more evidence that some of the supply\u2013demand imbalances are improving, and more evidence of a continued moderation in inflation, particularly in goods and services prices that have been most affected by the pandemic. We also expect to see continued strong job creation. And we will be learning more about the Delta variant's effects.\u201d\n\nHere is the full transcript from the speech, I encourage everyone to read it fully. It\u2019s not very long and is extremely insightful to see exactly what the main monetary policy maker thinks of the current state of the economy\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm)\n\nRegarding Powell\u2019s speech, BTIG Chief Equity and Derivatives Strategist Julian Emanuel said, \u201cPowell \"did three things very, very right, and obviously the markets are celebrating that. First was keeping the speech succinct. Second thing he did risht is, he sent the rest of the Fed governors out over the prior four weeks to basically tell us all that the taper was coming. He merely had to reiterate, and reiterate softly, that message, which he did very effectively. The third thing is he really tackled inflation head on. He knew that\u2019s been the preoccupation of the markets for these last couple of months. While he didn\u2019t give any new real evidence as to why he views inflation as transitory, he did cite the ongoing moderation in commodity prices and the view that past history would indicate that inflation is likely to be temporary.\u201d \n\nLooking ahead, market participants are set to receive more data on the strength of the labor market recovery this week, with the Labor Department's August jobs report due out on Friday. Consensus economists are looking to see that 750,000 payrolls came back during the month, representing an eighth straight month of gains but a slight pullback from July's 943,000.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of buy-now-pay-later company Affirm (AFRM) gapped up more than 40% after announcing partnership with Amazon (AMZN) that will let customers buy items of $50 or more in installments. \n* Shares of travel and leisure stocks slid after the European Union issued a new recommendation to restrict nonessential travel from the US due to surging coronavirus Delta cases.

Originally, barring any COVID resurgence, McDonald\u2019s planned to fully reopen indoor dining by Labor Day (Sept 6)\n* Apple (AAPL) announced changes to its App Store regulations that will allow software developers to tell customers how to pay for services outside of Apple\u2019s ecosystem, part of a proposed settlement of a class-action lawsuit. The shift will make it easier for some apps to steer customers toward other forms of payment, rather than using the App Store, where Apple charges a commission of up to 30%.\n* ESPN, which is owned by Disney (DIS), is reportedly seeking to license its brand to major sports-betting companies for at least $3 billions over several years, according to sources familiar with the matter as reported by the Wall Street Journal. On offer is the right for a suitor to use the ESPN name for branding purposes and potentially rename its sportsbook after ESPN. The sports-media giant has held talks with players that own major sportsbooks, including casino operator Caesars Entertainment (CZR)[ ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CZR?mod=chiclets)and DraftKings (DKNG) the sources said. ESPN has existing marketing partnerships with both companies already. This is huge for the sports-betting industry, will be closely following this story.\n* Amazon-backed (AMZN) electric vehicle maker Rivian is reportedly seeking a $70-$80 billion valuation in its upcoming IPO. The company has an agreement to produce electric vans for Amazon and a pickup truck for consumers.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, August 13, 2021**\n\nStocks rose modestly in another very choppy session, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) narrowly eking out fresh intraday record highs. The Nasdaq (QQQ) remain just a tick below its previous all-time high. Market participants continue to digest corporate earnings data and new economic reports.\n\nYesterday\u2019s Weekly Unemployment report showed a third straight drop in filings, an encouraging sign that the recovery in the labor market continues. The report showed new unemployment claims coming in at 375,000, in-line with analyst estimates. Continuing claims came in at 2.866 million, better than the 2.9 million expected and 2.980 million the week prior. \n\nThe Labor Department reported Wednesday that its consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.4% in July from a year earlier, in line with June\u2019s figure and matching the largest jump since August 2008. The government said CPI increased 0.5% on a month-over-month basis, matching a consensus forecast from economists surveyed by Dow Jones.\n\nCore CPI which excludes energy and food, rose by 0.3% last month, shy of a forecasted 0.4% increase and well below June\u2019s rise of 0.9%. The core figure is up 4.3% over the last year, a slight deceleration from June\u2019s 4.5%. Economists often consider core CPI to be a more reliable indicator since it\u2019s insulated from the frequent swings in petroleum and food prices. It\u2019s encouraging to see prices slowly moderate as the economic recovery continues to mature and pent-up consumer demand is increasingly released. \n\nOn the other hand, the producer price index (PPI) came in higher than expected. The producer price index for final demand increased at a 7.8% pace for the 12 months ended July, according to the Labor Department. The July print was faster than the 7.3% pace recorded in June and ahead of the 7.3% rate expected. Prices rose 1% in July, matching the increase in June and higher than the 0.6% increase expected. \n\nEarlier in the week, the US Senate passed the $1 trillion infrastructure deal in a surprisingly bipartisan manner. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads and bridges, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation\u2019s broadband infrastrucutre. The vote, 69-30, was uncommonly bipartisan given the seeming contention the Republicans had for the initial drafts of the infrastructure bill. President Biden said, \u201cThis historic investment in infrastructure is what I believe you, the American people, want, what you\u2019ve been asking for for a long, long time.\u201d Mitch McConnell, who earlier in the year publicly declared \u201c100% of my focus is on stopping this new administration\u201d said of the deal, \u201cI was proud to support today\u2019s historic  bipartisan infrastructure and prove that both sides of the political aisle can still come together around common-sense solutions.\u201d The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads and bridges, bolster public transportation, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation\u2019s broadband and 5G infrastrucutre. Here is a full list of what is included: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc have asked the U.S. government for approval to operate a new undersea data cable between the Philippines and California after China Mobile agreed to exit the plan, a government agency said Friday. The companies told the Federal Communications Commission they intend to start commercial operation by late 2022 and said the new data connection will \"provide significant new capacity on routes where capacity demand continues to increase substantially each year.\"\n* Shares of Disney (DIS) gapped up 5% premarket before losing steam throughout the session to close roughly 1% higher\n* Tesla (TSLA) battery supplier CATL said it plans to sell $9 billion in stock to help boost manufacturing capacity. \n* So far, 91% of S&amp;P 500 components have reported actual second-quarter earnings, with 87% of these having topped Wall Street's estimates, according to data from FactSet. Assuming this proportion holds through the end of earnings season, it would mark the greatest share of earnings beats ever recorded in FactSet data spanning back to 2008. \n* Shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) fell once again after founder Sir Richard Branson disclosed that he sold more than 10 million shares for about $300 million. His remaining stake is 46 million shares, roughly $1.2 billion.\n* Prices for [U.S. imports increased](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-import-price-increases-slow-125204156.html) at a slower than expected rate in July, signaling that supply chain constraints may have begun to ease as the economic recovery continued. \n* Import prices rose 0.3% in July compared to June, Commerce Department data showed on Friday. This was well below the 0.6% rise expected, and slowed notably from June's 1.0% monthly increase. \n* \\*\\***Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Airbnb (ABNB) with four price target increases following earnings.
