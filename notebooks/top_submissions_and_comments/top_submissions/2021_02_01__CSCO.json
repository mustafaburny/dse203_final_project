        "selftext": "Just a lurker here but want to do my part.

        "selftext": "I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:\n\n1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.\n2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&amp;P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&amp;P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the \"value\" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.  The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB.   SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&amp;P 500 ETF.  Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive.  Index methodology here: [https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf](https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf)\n3. DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability &amp; Value ETF, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl) .  Its methodology is in the prospectus, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus) .  Essentially, they try to combine \"quality\" and \"value\" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to [etfrc.com](https://etfrc.com). So it's not simply the S&amp;P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&amp;P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way.  Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ.  Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF!\n4. SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund) . This fund tracks an index that seeks to \"Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change.\"  ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&amp;t=30m53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&amp;t=30m53s) ).  Methodology here: [https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index](https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index) .  It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in.  It has also easily outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the past year!\n5. FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, [https://freedometfs.com/frdm/](https://freedometfs.com/frdm/) . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores.  Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red.  If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like.  Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF.  Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox!\n6. EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund) . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index.  Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil.  It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all).  Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung.\n7. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf) .  One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets.  Really heavy on tech and luxury.  If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like.  High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH.\n8. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH &amp; TREASURY CORE ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html) .  Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options.  Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&amp;P 500 upside during \"normal\" times.  Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF.  Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement.  Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X.\n9. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx) .  Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries.  But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure.  Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund.  There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design.\n10. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf) .  This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF.  You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise.  But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values.  Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk.  A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields.\n\nok, here's a bonus #11:\n\n11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=PPA](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=PPA) .  This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.  But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted.  US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along.  Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.\n\nDisclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future.\n\nWhat do you guys think?  Any of those look like something you might invest in?  Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up!  I'm so happy many people are finding this discussion informative.  Thanks for the awards and comments.",

        "selftext": "In one week ending this past Wednesday, $22.9 billion flowed into stock funds.\n\nThis has been the biggest weekly inflow since March 2008.\n\nIn 2008, after big inflows into the stock market happened, the stock market crashed.

One year after the dot-com bubble popped, Buffett said the unprecedented highs should have served as a strong warning signal. \"If the ratio approaches 200%\u2014as it did in 1999 and a part of 2000\u2014you are playing with fire,\" said Buffett.\n\nCurrent Buffet Indicator: 195%\nDot com bubble Indicator: 159%\n\n\nMargin debt balances have exploded on Wall Street, recently hitting an all-time high of $778 billion\u2014nearly 37 times the $21 billion investors held in March 2000.

        "selftext": "\"Every day, foreign actors are penetrating our digital infrastructure and conducting a range of cyber intrusions and attacks against the United States. All of these disparate efforts share a common purpose: exploit America's openness to undermine our long-term competitive advantage.\" \n\n\\- Former U.S. Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Daniel R. Coats\n\n# A. Introduction\n\nOkay SPAC-tards,\n\nLet's talk cybersecurity. I know this is a difficult subject with a lot of \"1s\" and \"0s\" and a lot of us have trouble reading (myself included), let alone comprehending what makes the \"magic stonk machine\" work, but this is a serious topic with a lot of tendy potential, so listen up! Set down your moon dust-powered flying electric vehicle stonks, turn off the AI autopilot even though the warning labels say you shouldn't trade without it, put down that fat doobie, and let's take a critical look at SCVX Acquisition Corp. (NYSE: $SCVX) for a moment. ***$******SCVX is the only Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) on the market with a specific focus on cybersecurity. $SCVX will likely select SentinelOne, Netskope, Snyk, KnowBe4, or Vectra as a target in the near-term, offering a 40 percent upside for commons and 100 percent upside for warrants in my uneducated and uninformed assessment.***\n\n*\\*This post is NOT/NOT investment advice and/or a recommendation to purchase $SCVX stock. The views below are based on my own personal research. Please make sure to conduct your own DD before investing. I currently have an active position in $SCVX.\\**\n\n# B. Background\n\nThere is a cyber-attack every 39 seconds in the United States. During the pandemic, malicious cyber intrusions and attacks against the government (federal, state, and local), businesses (small, medium, and large), and individual targets increased by 300 percent according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).^(1) About 64 percent of companies in the United States, 43 percent of which were small businesses, experienced a cyber intrusion during that time period, some of which, inflicted millions of dollars in monetary damage and/or destroyed public confidence in the target company's ability to store and protect customer data.^(2)  \n\n^(\")Dude, 1s and 0s blah blah blah...the pandemic is almost over. We're all going back to the office in a month (assuming any of us even had a job in the first place), so let's get back to moon trucks.\"\n\nNothing wrong with moon trucks, but the fact of the matter is, cybersecurity isn't going away any time soon and we'd be foolish to ignore it. In fact, if it were measured as a country, then cybercrime \u2014 which is predicted to inflict damages totaling $6T in 2021 \u2014 would be the world\u2019s third-largest economy after the U.S. and China. That figure is estimated to climb to $10.5T by 2025 according to CyberCrime Magazine.^(3)  That's a lot of lost tendies. With all that pain, you'd expect the market to get flooded with cybersecurity-focused SPACs, right? Well, that simply hasn't been the case even though the few cybersecurity plays on the market have performed well in the past year. For example...\n\n**1.) Cloudflare Inc. ($NET) +368%**\n\n**2.) Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. ($CRWD) +262%**\n\n**3.) Dynatrace Inc. ($DT) +50%**\n\n**4.) Ping Identity Holding Corp. ($PING) +30%**\n\n**5.) CyberArk Software Ltd. ($CYBR) +27%**\n\n**~~6.) SolarWinds Corp. ($SWI) -11%~~**  *oof, Russia hacked this one!* \n\nAnyway, you get the idea. If you've made it this far, then slam a Redbull, and let's take a critical look at $SCVX as a SPAC and spitball a few ideas for potential targets. Unless you just want to sell on the DA pop and collect those mini tendies for your wife's boyfriend. That's cool and not a bad strategy if you're a beta with paper hands. Because...moon trucks! *Right.* \n\n# C. SPAC Profile &amp; Purpose\n\nSCVX Acquisition Corp. went public on 23 January 2020, so it is currently more than halfway through its two-year time window to identify a validated target.^(4) The SPAC has $230M in the trust although that figure will likely increase to $500M with an additional $300M of PIPE funding in my assessment. (See Figure 1) Mike Doniger, CEO &amp; Chairman of SCVX, said the SPAC was looking to target a company with a $1.5B to $3B valuation, i.e. unicorn, during a recent podcast on CyberWire.^(5) An earlier tweet from Hank Thomas, CTO of SCVX, appears to confirm the SPAC is/was seeking a \"unicorn\" within the sector. (See Figure 2) This valuation target is *significantly* higher than the original $600M to $1.5B valuation Doniger mentioned during the same podcast when the SPAC went public in January 2020.^(5) ***As such, I assess $SCVX will likely not target a company with a valuation less than $1.5B as the SPAC is probably considering options in the $1.5B to $3B range. This valuation will limit the list of potential targets and serve as a key variable in my target selection.***\n\n**Figure 1**\n\n*Processing img jwjh22e85ei61...*\n\n**Figure 2**\n\n[Source: Twitter](https://preview.redd.it/9ni0nws56ei61.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebf97dbc34025f58f5410cc4193a411797c676f8)\n\nSo, what does Doniger view as an ideal target? Luckily, Doniger has provided us with valuable insight into the specific criteria the SPAC is looking for within a target company. In Doniger's view, \"fragmentation\" within the cybersecurity industry has become a serious issue. What does that mean exactly? I dunno. lol! Luckily, Doniger broke it down Barney style for us SPAC-tards as he went on to explain that: \n\n\"\\[The industry\\] has grown to look a lot like the vitamins and supplements industry. If you start to take too many, then it is hard to determine which ones are truly beneficial, which ones are counteracting the other, and which ones don\u2019t work at all. Especially as your problems change over time.\u201d ^(6)\n\nAs such, $SCVX is likely seeking to merge with a company that is willing to develop a strategy with the SPAC that integrates other critical security controls into their platform to create something that does not exist in the industry.^(6)  $SCVX was incorporated in the Cayman Islands to provide the SPAC with the flexibility to target a company that is foreign or domestic. \"This is a best athlete scenario,\" Doniger said.^(5) Specifically, Doniger mentioned Israel as a hotbed for cybersecurity companies and said he would likely travel to Tel Aviv to speak with potential targets after the RSA Conference in February 2020. I doubt that happened based on Hanky's Twitter activity though. ***Nonetheless, I assess $SCVX will target a company with a malleable platform that allows the integration of other companies' tools - possibly of Israeli origin. I do not believe, as some have suggested, $SCVX will target several companies at once. Come on guys, I want tendies too, but that makes no sense...lol***\n\n**1.) Management:** I am not going to go into an in-depth analysis of the management team. Doniger is an absolute \"G\", Hanky is kind of a snowflake (thank you for your service tho \ud83d\ude4f), and Jason Bourne's former boss is on the board. Yes, that's right the former U.S. Director of National Intelligence, Daniel R. Coats. If he doesn't know the type of cyber threats that businesses and our country face, then well...we have much bigger problems boyz. That's all the DD I needed to see to analyze the management team. Doniger has the vision and industry experts at his disposal to prosecute the target company in a timely fashion. (Remember: These guys all want their tendies too) Please see below for a list of the management team. I have run in-depth queries on all of their public-facing social media accounts, which yielded nothing of substance. \n\n* **Mike Doniger:** SCVX CEO &amp; Chairman of the Board\n* **Hank Thomas:** SCVX CTO &amp; Board Director\n* **Chris Ahern:** SCVX CFO\n* **Sen. Daniel Coats:** Former Director of National Intelligence &amp; SCVX Board Member\n* **Jeff Lunglhofer:** Chief Information Security Officer at BNY Mellon &amp; SCVX Board Member\n* **Vivian Schneck-Last:** Former Managing Director at Goldman Sachs &amp; SCVX Board Member\n* **Sounil Yu:** Former Chief Security Scientist at Bank of America &amp; SCVX Board Member\n\n**2.) Timeframe to Select Target:** 7 months (4 months without an extension to complete the deal)\n\n**3.) Trust:** $230M \n\n**4.) Additional PIPE:** $300M est.\n\n**5.) Foreign or Domestic:** Both\n\n# D. Potential Target List\n\nThis target list is not mutually exclusive or collectively exhaustive, but it is not random either. My methodology for target selection is based on three primary criteria, which are: 1.) platform suitability, 2.) valuation/funding, and 3.) footprint in the fortune 1000. I selected these criteria because Doniger noted he was looking for a company with a malleable platform, $1.5B to $3B valuation, at least Series C funding, and a footprint in the Fortune 1000.^(6) Secondary criteria, which played less of a role in my selection, but I noted were 1.) companies with a presence in Israel and/or of Israeli origin, 2.) companies that attended RSAC 2020, 3.) companies Hanky followed on Twitter. To select these targets, I combed through the RSAC 2020 attendee list containing 78+ companies, public records from the Israeli Ministry of Economy and Industry, and the rumor mill on the twits, Reddit, Twitter, etc.^(7) ***Based on the above, I assess $SCVX's High Value Targets (HVT) are probably SentinelOne, Netskope, Snyk, KnowBe4 or Vectra. Alternatively, I assess $SCVX may target Vectra as a potential second-tier target.***\n\n**Primary Targets**\n\n**1.) SentinelOne:** meets all the criteria outlined by Doniger and represents a badass target for $SCVX. The company boasts a cyber-security platform with a full-suite of tools across the threat prevention matrix, which serves as a \"one-stop shop\" that can further be tweaked and/or refined. Further, SentinelOne has a $3B valuation and a presence amongst the Fortune 1000. CNBC nominated the company as one of 50 \"disruptors\" in 2020. ***From my optic,*** ***SentinelOne is the perfect target, which may decide to merge with $SCVX. SentinelOne's CEO, Tomer Weingarten, is interested in taking the company public although he commented the company had \"no set timeline for an IPO\" as of 12 November 2020.***^(8 9) \n\n**Selection Criteria**\n\n* **Platform:** SentinelOne Singularity unifies historically separate functions (Prevention, ActiveEDR, IoT, Workloads) into a single agent and platform architecture. \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Valuation:** $3B ^(9) \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Funding:** Series F \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Presence w/Fortune 1000:** Yes \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Country:** California, United States \u2714\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \n* **RSAC 2020:** Attended \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Twitter:** Followed by Hanky \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Tendy Rating:** \ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\n\n**Figure 3**\n\n[Source: Crunchbase Pro](https://preview.redd.it/5cofbholl9i61.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d054812810a0b1c339f19dde945d7f30b12bffb0)\n\n**2.)  Netskope:** meets all the criteria outlined by Doniger and represents a potential HVT for $SCVX. The company has taken aim at cloud and mobile security as legacy products based on traditional notions of perimeter security have gone obsolete and inhibit the needs of digital businesses. Netskope is focused on security that is fast, delivered from the cloud, and provides real-time protection against network and data threats when cloud services, websites, and private apps are being accessed from anywhere, anytime, on any device.^(10) Netskope has a $3B valuation and a presence amongst the Fortune 1000. ***Netskope is an ideal target, which is eyeing an IPO and may decide to go public via SPAC with $SCVX. The CEO, Sanjay Beri, is focused on rapid growth, which describes the type of forward-leaning executive Doniger is hoping to attract in my assessment.*** \n\n**Selection Criteria**\n\n* **Platform:** is the only security vendor that accelerates digital transformation with a proven security platform that is data-centric, cloud-smart, and built around speed.^(10) \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Valuation:** $3B^(11) \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Funding:** Series G \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Presence w/Fortune 1000:** Yes \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Country:** California, United States \u2714\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \n* **RSAC 2020:** Attended \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Twitter:** Not Followed by Hanky **\u274c**\n* **Tendy Rating:** \ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\n\n**3.)  Snyk:** meets all the criteria outlined by Doniger and represents another badass HVT for $SCVX. The company offers security for developers across the cloud-native application stack, which serves as a \"one-stop shop\" for developers that can further be tweaked and/or refined. Further, Snyk has a $2.6B valuation and a presence amongst the Fortune 1000. Interestingly, Snyk also has a corporate office in Tel Aviv, Israel. ***Snyk is an appealing target, which may decide to go public via a reverse merger with $SCVX. Although the company has already raised $200M in Series D funding late last year, CEO Peter McKay is reportedly eyeing an IPO in early 2021, which could take place via SPAC according to the Boston Business Journal.******^(12)***\n\n**Selection Criteria**\n\n* **Platform:** is an open-source security platform designed to help software-driven businesses enhance developer security.^(13) \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Valuation:** $2.6B^(12) \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Funding:** Series D \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Presence w/Fortune 1000:** Yes \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Country:** Massachusetts, United States w/office location in Israel \u2714\ufe0f\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\n* **RSAC 2020:** Attended \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Twitter:** Not Followed by Hanky **\u274c**\n* **Tendy Rating:** \ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\n\n**4.) KnowBe4:** meets all the criteria outlined by Doniger in a less traditional sense since it focuses on the human aspect of cybersecurity - training. Regardless, KnowBe4 represents another HVT for $SCVX based on its integrated training platform, $2.6B valuation, and presence amongst the Fortune 1000, which can be further tweaked and/or refined. ***Given 95 percent of cyber intrusions and attacks are enabled by human error, I can see a compelling case for $SCVX bringing KnowBe4 public via SPAC. The company was allegedly preparing to file for an IPO late last year although no such paperwork has yet to been filed (that's weird) and the possibility the company pivots to go public via SPAC remains.******^(14)***\n\n**Selection Criteria**\n\n* **Platform:** is the world\u2019s largest integrated platform for security awareness training combined with simulated phishing attacks.^(15) \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Valuation:** $2B \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Funding:** Series C \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Fortune 1000:** Yes \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Country:** Florida, United States \u2714\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \n* **RSAC 2020:** Attended \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Twitter:** Not Followed by Hanky **\u274c**\n* **Tendy Rating:** \ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\n\n**5.) Arctic Wolf:** meets most of the criteria outlined by Doniger as the final contestant in the upper range target category. Regardless, Artic Wolf is an interesting target because the company offers a tailored approach to cybersecurity that is industry-specific.^(16) This customizable platform may be exactly what Doniger is looking to mold into $SCVX's vision of a \"one-stop shop\" cyber security company. Further, Arctic Wolf has a valuation that is just shy of $1.5B at $1.3B and a presence amongst the Fortune 1000. ***While Arctic Wolf is technically the least qualified contestant in the upper range category, $SCVX may target the company since it falls perfectly in the middle of upper and second-tier targets and appears to offer a malleable platform that is highly customizable.***\n\n**Selection Criteria**\n\n* **Platform:** offers a tailored turnkey concierge approach to security operations via managed detection and response, managed risk, and cloud monitoring.^(17) \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Valuation:** $1.3B **\u274c**\n* **Funding:** Series C \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Fortune 1000:** Yes \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Country:** Minnesota, United States \u2714\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \n* **RSAC 2020:** Attended \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Twitter:** Not Followed by Hanky **\u274c**\n* **Tendy Rating:** \ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\n\n**Honorable Mention**\n\n**6.)** **Vectra:** meets some of the criteria outlined by Doniger and represents a second-tier target for $SCVX in my assessment. Vectra's platform detects intrusions at the network level, whether in the cloud or on-premises. According to Hitesh Sheth, CEO of Vectra \"Many of our competitors have used open-source technology to build their products, but we have not. We built our own IP and that has given us very unique and powerful scaling capabilities.\"^(18) ***While this competitive edge is unique, Vectra may not fall within the confines of $SCVX's preferred targets since the company's platform appears to be closed and/or unable to add additional tools from external providers. However, I cannot discount the fundamental strength of Vectra as a viable target since $SCVX could shift its position on this issue.*** \n\n* **Platform:** is a closed platform that detects intrusions at the network level in the cloud or on the premises. **\u274c**\n* **Valuation:** $1B+ est. **\u274c**\n* **Funding:** Series E \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Fortune 1000:** Yes \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Country:** California, United States \u2714\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \n* **RSAC 2020:** Attended \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Twitter:** Not Followed by Hanky **\u274c**\n* **Tendy Rating:** \ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\n\n**Other Possibilities Considered**\n\n*Exabeam;* *Venafi; Cybereason; Venafi; BioCatch; Venafi; LookingGlass; Socure; Deep Instinct; Extrahop; Cygilant; Cellebrite Mobile Synchronization.*\n\n# E. Conclusion/Timeline\n\nIn the first podcast that aired in January 2020, Doniger predicted the SPAC would announce a target \"sometime in the fall\" after initial talks at RSAC 2020 and/or a trip to Israel. With the onset of COVID-19 last spring, I assess Doniger's travel plans and/or efforts to identify a target within an industry that is not familiar with SPACs may have gotten a bit delayed. (C'mon dude, step up your game! We have flipped like 20 SPACs already) That said, during the most recent podcast on CyberWire, Hanky noted the SPAC was in the \"9th inning\" of selecting a target. ***As such, I suspect $SCVX will make an announcement within the next 30 days for a potential merger at the end of Q2. (Or Hanky owes me a beer w/some tendies because this sh!t took forever to write and you guys are gonna be pissed) Anyway, the time to build a position is now, prior to the DA announcement, not after.*** \n\nThis is the way. \n\n\\- s30ul\n\n**Sources**\n\n1.)

        "selftext": "Srsly, how has everyone missed this undervalued gem. Let's break this down simple:\n\n1. This thing has a PE ratio under 18 putting its valuation lower than other boring value stocks like Cisco, Comcast, or Walmart. You even get a 1% dividend yield which is more than your Chase saving account provides you. You'd think having such a low PE under JPow's economy would mean this is a dead company with no prospects, but...\n\n2. Their latest game console, the Nintendo Switch which has been out since March 2017 keeps selling units by the millions. 80 million Switch devices sold to date, 15 million of them in 2020 alone. They're still selling at a consistent pace at the mid-cycle of the console's lifespan. This would be bad if they sold it at a loss like new game consoles from the competition, but...\n\n3. The Switch is cheap. You can get the Switch Pro for less than $300, or the lite for $200. When your console is so cheap not only can you sell it at a profit but your customers have more money to buy games. And who makes those games?\n\n4. Nintendo has basically a monopoly on Switch games taking all the profit. This isn't particilarly hard when you own excellent IPs that raise nostalgia levels so high. All their 15 top selling games are self-published, 9 of them solely developed by then. Their top 6 each sold over 20 million copies, they're in 25+% of Switch owners. This is important when you factor in that 80% of games sold in 2020 were released in prior fiscal years so new Switch Owner will buy these same old games that already broke cost. And with such popular IPs they can even release phone quality games or emulated 10-20 year old parts at $50 for cash grabs. Only stronger competition could stop them, but...\n\n5. You can't get a new Playstation or Xbox. Srsly, have you tried buying one? You get a notification from Best Buy that they have some in stock and that same minute when you try adding to cart it's already sold out. Despite the demand, the supply chain is so backlogged that less than 5 million PS5s have been sold.\n\n6. CHINA - did you know that video game consoles were banned there until 2014? The Switch wasn't even launched there officially until 2019. This is a nascent new region for the expansion of the videogame industry, especially today when less than 2 million Switch/Ps4/xbox ones were sold. Of those, 1.3 million were Switch meaning they already have over 2/3s of this nascent new market share. As more chinese come out of poverty and try out these game consoles from their rich software engineer cousins who came to visit them from California, they will demand regulatory change to make it easier for video game consoles to sell in the country.\n\n7. What about growth outside the videogame market? Well, they might be the future leaders of AR games. Mario Kart Live? Mario Legos? What other toy companies have you seen pushing the boundaries of AR? With their excellent IPs it should be easy to dominate the toys market, with total global market size of $100B.\n\n8. All that hype is all well but what to the actual numbers say? Well, this baby had a Q1 - Q3 YoY growth in Net Sales of 37.3%! But there's more! The Operating Profit grew by 98.2% and the Net Profit by a similar 91.8%. How is this not a growth company? Stock is up 67% YoY but keeps being valued at low PE \ud83d\ude2e\n\nPrice target? Do I look like an analyst? I'm just a retard who likes \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 and playing games on the couch while eating tendies. Maybe one day we'll be playing Nintendo games on Mars.",

        "selftext": "**Current Status Report:**\n\n* Nokia has benefited largely from the ban of Huawei and ZTE due to them being targeted by Trump during his anti-China campaign. Nokia has since netted around 40%-50% of these outstanding contracts due to the absence of these prior competitors.\n\n* Nokia fumbled early entry into the 5G space because of a bloated and expensive product line. This is now all changing and ReefShark (management's answer to this mistake) is now taking off. ReefShark is a new chipset and subsequent product line that promises better margins for the company. 75% rollout by EOY 2021. 100% by EOY 2022.\n\n* The new CEO as of last August is Pekka Lundmark. This man has demonstrated incredible financial responsibility and a very disciplined leadership modality. He is significantly more competent than the last CEO, Rajeev Suri, meaning the company's future is probably stable for now. Unfortunately, Pekka is also an old dog, you should not expect him to make any exciting or ambitious plays anytime soon.\n\n* There is some price erosion in the North American market, meaning that there are currently bidding wars going on here - leading to reduced margins for Nokia. In addition, the U.S. dollar is also dropping compared to the Euro, thanks to free money from the federal reserve - leading to reduced top line figures for Nokia. Every other market has remained relatively stable.\n\n**The Bull Case:**\n\n* ReefShark is mostly coming online by EOY 2021. This has potential to kickstart a significant bull run for Nokia OYJ.\n\n* Nokia OYJ is a profitable company, a rare thing in this economy of overinflated tech stocks and overly optimistic COVID recovery plays.\n\n* Nokia OYJ has a solid balance sheet that consists of more than $10-$12 billion dollars of liquid assets (e.i. cash/short term investments). Half the company's net worth is basically in cash.\n\n* Nokia OYJ (NOK) 23.67B is significantly undervalued compared to relevant competitors such as Cisco Systems (CSCO) 199.61B and Ericsson Systems (ERIC) 41.94B despite having a sizable market share in one of the world's most important tech markets - 5G communications is set to skyrocket due to higher demand via IOT and next-gen technologies such as self-driving cars.\n\n* Nokia OYJ is worth only about 60% of Ericsson Systems despite having nearly identical balance sheets and income statements. Ericsson indeed has a lead on Nokia in terms of profitability margins and secured contracts - but the importance of both is overstated without context. Increased profits of a few hundred million when you are dealing with tens of billions in overall revenue is an absolute joke. As for the additional 5G deals Ericsson has, Ericsson is agreeing to them at a loss - in hopes that they will be a loss leader in order to secure and lock down clients to their tech stack. Again, maybe, but ever since the banning of Huawei and ZTE, clients have insisted on more and more flexibility in terms of cloud service alternatives - thereby negating any \"early bird\" advantage.\n\n* Nokia OYJ is important politically, financially, and strategically to Europe and North American interests. You can expect help from politicians in the future.\n\n* Nokia OYJ is already at the very bottom. At $4 per share, this company is trading as if it were in the same industry as hot dog vendors in terms of cash flow and price to earnings. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that at $3 - $3.5 per share, Nokia had to take actions to prevent itself from being bought outright in a hostile takeover bid.\n\n* Nokia OYJ has one of the highest number of outstanding option contracts in the entire market. This has the potential to lead to some very funky market-driven events such as the company hitting $9.75 per share on January 27th 2021.\n\n* Prominent hedge funds were holding major positions in this stock at $4 per share at the end of December. Have they sold already during last week's high? Who knows? But what it tells us was that even without that weird peak on January 27th, hedge funds felt that $4 per share was an absolute bargain.\n\n**The Bear Case:**\n\n* Nokia is in a highly competitive market with low margins. Even with Huawei and ZTE out of the picture, Samsung poses a significant risk as the Korean conglomerate can easily undercut Nokia's margins. Samsung unlikely to be met with the same restrictions due to South Korea's diplomatic ties with North America and Europe.\n\n* Nokia is late to the game of 5G with their earlier fumble under the mired leadership of Rajeev Suri. Why bet on the underdog when you can bet on the incumbent that is Ericsson?\n\n* By investing in Nokia, you might be losing out on better investment opportunities that have been severely discounted due to COVID-19. \n\n**Summary Recommendations:**\n\n**If you are bullish)** Buy more and hold. You currently own a safe haven asset that is unlikely to be affected by further market downturns related to COVID-19. Unemployment is still sky high and the rest of the market hasn't realized the consequences of this yet.\n\n**If you are bearish)** Hold until at least March or April. Recent sell off is the market reacting irrationally to Pekka Lundmark saying the forbidden words of \"price erosion\" and \"difficult year\" in the same sentence - even though the fault of this is largely due to American companies engaging in bidding wars and the U.S. dollar shorting itself into the ground. All in all the earnings report was still good and I expect a rebound.",

Amazon and others aren't likely to have the bottom fall out any time soon like cisco and other big tech did 20 years ago.\n\nBut this can't continue forever.... right?

Eventually. Right? So with that said...\n\nWhat other things might cause a growth fund bubble burst and do we have any kind of ability to foresee them? My understanding is that after economic hardship, small cap value stocks lead the way in market recovery - but does the covid market count as economic hardship? If so, why did growth funds beat the pants off of value funds during and after the 2020 crash?\n\nHow does an intelligent investor (definitely not me) even begin to attempt to foresee (or even react swiftly to) such a shift?\n\nMy retirement is about 60% mid and large cap growth and 40% mid and small cap value. I'm young enough to ride out swings for about 15 years and then I have to start being more careful. If I'm being honest, diversification is hard for me, my instinct is to chase past returns. part of me says it's time to rebalance entirely into growth and then hope I find a crystal ball...   \n\nWhen will you know that the landscape has shifted back towards value - or at least started to shift? Or can we only see this in hindsight?",

        "selftext": "1 Transportation and Delivery\n\nTransportation and delivery stocks took a hit last March when the disruption of pandemic came. Almost one year later they have recovered strongly. Staying at home and working from home have created unprecedented demand for transportation and delivery of goods via vehicles on highways. As the vaccination looms and the economy reopens, the demand might drop, but the habits nurtured during the pandemic could linger for quite a while. I am still cautious about airline stocks; air travel is still far from recovering even 1/3 of what it was before the pandemic and I won\u2019t make a move until the volume reaches about 1/2 . \n\nLooking at: PAG, KSU, UPS, FDX, UBER, UNP\n\n======\n\n2 More traditional/\u201d big players\u201d financial stocks\n\nI have opened another post asking for advice, so I will just be copying and pasting:\n\nFintech stocks and ETFs are popular on the market nowadays and I\u2019ve reaped quite some profits from ARKF, PYPL, SQ, V, virtual currency ETFs e.t.c. But now I am eyeing in on the more traditional/big Wall Street players like Citibank, JPM, Morgan Stanley, Goldman e.t.c. All flaws and blames and crooked behaviors aside, they are still the biggest players in the financial market nowadays and the establishment can\u2019t be overwhelmed by a few Reddit short squeezes. I am trying to observe if these stocks could sort of \"recover\" from the shock and respond to the innovative trend.\n\nThere\u2019s also another realm of more diversified asset management player such as CG, BX, BLK, NTRS e.t.c. It seems the pandemic has a very strong asset/wealth reallocation effects and the wealthiest that could afford to have their assets managed by these players are doing well. These institutions also typically have quite established footings in emerging markets such as Asia and South America in both government and private businesses. CG has recently published a pleasant Q4 2020 report and their stocks climbed. I am waiting to see if BX, BLK and NTRS would follow suit.\n\nLooking at: JPM, BX, BLK, NTRS, CG, BAM\n\n======\n\n3 Military and Defense\n\nThe mainstream media tries hard to paint a layer of peaceful color to the new administration, but tensions around the globe won\u2019t just disappear. The US military has quite a few major contracts for new weapon systems delivery coming up, and US arms sales to allies could increase as many of them are located at the forefronts of tensions (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Saudi, India e.t.c).\n\nLooking at: LDOS, LMT, GD, NOC, BA (more for its military contracts rather than for commercial airplanes)\n\n======\n\n4 Tech Infrastructures\n\nWith everything shifting to online platform, Tech stocks (IT, cloud computing, semiconductors e.t.c.) have done well in 2020. I am in MSFT and TSM, and I just want to take a look at stocks that offer a more infrastructural exposure to the tech advancements, such as base towers for 5G, solutions for cloud computing and online platforms, workstations, hardware production e.t.c.\n\nLooking at: CCI, AMT, CSCO, MSI, ERIC\n\n======\n\n5 Virtual Currency\n\nI am not a big fan of virtual currencies so far, and it might be a bit late to enter the game. but nobody could deny the soaring prices of every major virtual currency, and I certainly don\u2019t mind to ride the bandwagon and get a few extra bucks. \n\nLooking at: BLOK, KOIN",

        "selftext": "Having lived through a few bear markets, wanted to share how I'm positioning myself for future headwinds:\n\n- The Federal reserve can no longer significantly raise rates without threatening solvency of US treasuries.\n\n- Big tax increases (corporate, wealth, and estate) are now political fair game to deal with a mountain of government debt and income inequality.\n\n- A sizable portion of the S&amp;P 500 is sitting on nearly dot-com era price/sales ratios. Newbie investors do not realize that chasing after returns in early growth industries has not historically paid off for anyone other than very early investors (see what happened to Amazon, Cisco, Microsoft 1998-2002). \n\n- Many new disruptive technologies are actually going to deflate &amp; shrink industry profits, rather than increase. EVs for example will kill the car maintenance business, and they are actually easier to make (lower barrier of entry) than gas-engine cars.\n\n- Mutual funds are now seeing systemic outflows due to baby boomers retiring. \n\n- Contrary to popular belief, index funds are not certainly guaranteed to go up. See Europe or Japanese lost decades.\n\nIn light of this, I present where I am focusing my equity allocation: \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Climate Change Value**\n\nWhile I would love to invest entirely in core renewables (wind, batteries, solar), I hate to say that I cannot do so due to their present valuations. Instead, I would like to point out a few sectors that are under appreciated:\n\n* Regulated Utilities: Utilities have been beaten up over the last year, even as rates have decreased. Further, I expect that they will be given incentives to clean up their grid. Note that they will have some immunity to increases in corporate tax rates, as public utilities often pass some of these costs through to their customers.\n\n* Natural gas: There is no credible math that natural gas demand will decline in the next 10-15 years. If anything, we need more as coal is replaced and EV vehicles require more electricity. Expect a double-down on investments to run natural gas with fewer carbon emissions.\n\n* Property reinsurance: Climate change will bring more natural disasters...and while these will cause short term damage to insurance companies, it ultimately  will result in a bigger market as well as higher rates. \n\n* Food: Look for chicken, eggs, plant products as they are significantly more climate friendly than beef/pork. Look past 'Beyond Meat' and instead for established companies at fair valuations.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy utility picks: AEP (top pick), AEE, AES, EXC, DTE, CMS. Avoid companies with wildfire risk or a politically unfriendly atmosphere. \n\nMy reinsurance picks: RNR, Y\n\nMy natural gas picks: WMB, NI\n\nMy food picks: INGR, SAFM, CALM\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Anti-Growth**\n\nWhat is \"anti-growth\"? Stocks in industries that are shrinking. Why anyone would want to hold one of these, it's simply because of limited downside IF we are in fact in a valuation bubble. The game is to bleed these companies out for their last remaining dividends. Example: if a company has a half-life of 15 years, but dividend pays out 8%..you still come out decently ahead even if NAV shrinks 50% over that time. It's a bonus if the company can turn around their boat from decline to growth but not necessary.\n\nMy picks: Tobacco industry (MO, PM, BTI), health retail (WBA, CVS), mid-stream oil transport (MMP, ENB, TRP). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Emerging Markets**\n\nThis has potential to be the long term money maker. Let's face it however...emerging market and especially China accounting standards are trash. They lie, and they do not consider it cheating, they think they are being \"clever\". This is not all too different from where the US was many years ago however. I'm betting that as emerging markets continue to develop, then there should also be small yet steady improvements in their accounting standards, transparency, and valuations. This will require time and patience. \n\nMy ETF picks: \n\n- AVEM (instead of VWO) for a moderate tilt towards fundamentals without any major sector bets. The ETF is run by a smart group of folks (Avantis), many of them formerly from DFA advisors.\n\n- DGS: By only holding small companies, this ETF is able to avoid the lofty valuations of China's big tech darlings. Small companies are more likely able to hide under the radar of government control, and are well poised to take advantage of organic domestic growth that will be happening across the Emerging sphere. Further, the dividend strategy lowers risk of fraud, as you cannot easily \"fake\" dividends.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Conflict Hedge**\n\nChina represents roughly half of the Emerging Market portfolio. With Chinese exports equal to about 7% of US GDP, any conflict is extremely unlikely, yet with so much $$$ invested in non-free countries, I am obliged to hedge my bets with a few holdings that will do well in the case of a Cold War 2 or Taiwan-China conflict. My rule of thumb is $1 of conflict hedge for every $5 in China exposure. Individual stock picks are my preference of choice here.\n\n- Arms race stocks: Stay away from IT contracting or ship building, the game here is to invest in companies that will benefit most from a high-tech arms race with China. Unmanned air/sea and hyper-sonic are the future.\n\n- Domestic materials: Stocks that have been beaten down due to Chinese exports.\n\nMy picks: LMT, NOC, LHX, EAF\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Developed Ex-US Markets**\n\nProvides some insulation from US stock valuations and future corporate tax increases. Europe in particular gets to play neutral in any future US vs China disputes.\n\nETF picks: VEA as core. AVDV for a small value tilt. \n\nIndividual picks: I've got a few big bets on UK healthcare companies that are hurting due to Covid fallout. SNN in particular makes about 1/3 of their revenue in sports medicine and they have been reeling.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-------\n\nA special note on max draw downs and risk. When there is a market crash, EVERYTHING goes down. This portfolio will not evade that. Frankly, I don't care about another 2008 or 2020 crash event (30-60% crash) so long as it recovers within a 10 year time frame. My objective is to reduce the probability of a lost decade(s) ala Japan 1990-2010, or a loss that is not recoverable at all. All that said...no promises. I am not a financial advisor, so I must say that this is not financial advice. This is simply how I am investing my money currently, and even so it only represents my \"risk-on\" portion of my savings. I have the other half of my savings in relatively riskless assets (FDIC insured CDs, etc.) or lower risk assets (low duration bonds). Please do your own due diligence.\n\n* edit: updated to fix some mistakes",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday morning-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-10-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow set to bounce after breaking a six-session win streak\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicated up nearly 100 points. A late fade Tuesday resulted in the Dow and S&amp;P 500 falling slightly from closing record highs and breaking six-session winning streaks. However, the Nasdaq managed to hold on to a modest advance and notching another record close.\n\n&gt; * On the economy, the government releases its look at January consumer prices at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell on Wall Street. At 2 p.m. ET, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at an Economic Club of New York webinar, in an address focusing on the state of the American job market.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Coca-Cola, GM report better-than-expected Q4\n\n&gt; * Coca-Cola on Wednesday said the coronavirus pandemic is still hurting sales, but cost-cutting efforts helped it top analyst earnings estimates. Shares of the Dow component rose 2% in premarket trading. The beverage giant made 47 cents per share in the fourth-quarter. Net sales dropped 5% to $8.6 billion, missing expectations. Unit case volume, which strips out the impact of foreign currency, shrank by 3%. All four of its beverage segments reported volume declines.\n\n&gt; * Shares of General Motors fell more than 1% in the premarket after the U.S. automaker said Wednesday that a global semiconductor chip shortage could cut earnings by $1.5 billion and $2 billion this year. GM\u2019s crosstown rival, Ford, last week said the chip shortage could lower its earnings. GM also issued fourth-quarter profit of $1.93 per share on revenue of $37.5 billion. Both beat analyst expectations.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Twitter is \u2018bigger than any one account,\u2019 CEO says\n\n&gt; * Shares of Twitter rose more than 5.5% in Wednesday\u2019s premarket, the morning after the social media network reported fourth-quarter earnings of 38 cents per share on revenue of $1.29 billion, both of which beat estimates. Monetizable daily active users gained 30% to 192 million from a year ago, but still fell short of expectations. Twitter is \u201cbigger than any one account,\u201d said CEO Jack Dorsey, in his first earnings call following the ban of then-President Donald Trump last month, days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Trump impeachment trial continues with opening arguments\n\n&gt; * Opening arguments are set begin at noon ET Wednesday in Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial. An emotional first day ended with the Senate voting to hear the case on whether to convict the former president of inciting the Capitol riot even though he\u2019s no longer in office. Watching the proceedings from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump was furious at what he saw from his attorneys Tuesday, according to a person familiar with his thinking. The 50-50 split Senate is expected to acquit Trump.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Covid spike in the U.S. show signs of slowing\n\n&gt; * The crushing coronavirus spike in the U.S. has been showing signs of abating, with 95,360 new cases Tuesday less than a third of the record high new daily infections of 300,282 on Jan. 2. The number of people in U.S. hospitals being treated for Covid-19 totaled 79,179 on Tuesday, the first daily count below 80,000 since Nov. 18. U.S. deaths from the virus averaged 2,857 over the past seven days. Fatalities reached a single-day peak of 4,432 on Jan. 12.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/UcNjYBi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Jzsj6V4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/bEWgiAZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/K690R0u.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hloQBbG.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/1aI3OXL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/7f4pptB.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/NGnaqee.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vLhBS2V.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1p6W5Oy.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/qxoyyCv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9Jx5owU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/I9j8fVZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/iAjNlv8.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/1MVWFH6.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/xZ56Gwf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2MZhVwY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-under-armour-twitter-bunge-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Coca-Cola (KO)** \u2013 Coca-Cola reported quarterly earnings of 47 cents per share, 5 cents a share above estimates.

        "selftext": "Please don\u2019t pass this post up. You will be glad you read it. Good AMC and GME post. Repost it if you like it. I bet all the real OG APES will. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83e\udd32\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83e\udd32\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83e\udd32\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd8d\n\nAn Open Letter to Melvin Capital, CNBC, Boomers, and WSB\n\n **Mods do not delete, this is important to me, please read**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was in my early teens during the '08 crisis. I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.\n\nThose close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.\n\nTo Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.\n\nTo CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/). They include, but are not limited to, **IBM**, **Cisco**, **TMobile**, **JPMorgan**, **Oracle**, and **ZipRecruiter**. Their parent company is [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal), owned by **Comcast** and **GE**.\n\nTo the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these \"millennial blog posts\": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? *We're not enemies, we're on the same side*. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.\n\nTo WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: I can't seem to get a hold of mods and they keep fucking removing the post. I have no idea how to get this to stick and its important to me that the people I'm addressing read it.",

        "selftext": "Datto is a recently IPO'ed company that makes backup &amp; disaster recovery equipment for IT people. Being an IT person, their products are best in class and rock solid. They also sell routers &amp; switches as well as a ticketing platform for IT departments/companies. When they first launched their IPO a few months ago, I bought some shares and have been following them since. Their network equipment reminds me of Cisco Meraki, just at the very beginning of their launch(I did the same w/ Ubiquiti $UI, and have rode it from $55 to $350/share).  \n\n\nThey are about to release their 2nd earnings report on 3/11. This is where I found a pretty good options play. Share price is roughly $24.87-$25 right now, and the 3/19 call options at $22.50 is trading around $4. This means the stock only has to rise to $26.50 or $1.63 during their earnings report timeframe to win on this. Given this is their 2nd earnings release(their first one was right around their IPO, so it was pretty buried), if they have good news, this could be a big winner. I believe the $20 call options may have an even smaller gap to cross, likely closer to $25.75, or $1.10.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe bonus is that their equipment is generally sold in contracts, so the likelihood of them having a poor quarter is minimal. I have bought call options and own shares. Not financial advice, I just like the stonk.",

        "selftext": "Feb.15 is Presidents\u2019 Day and market is closed. With the second quarter of 2021 coming and policies of the new administration becoming clearer, I am looking to allocate my extra cash into a few sectors that I believe will have potentials but are either absent or underrepresented in my portfolio. I don\u2019t talk about popular sectors such as Fintech, online retail, renewable energy, IT and cloud computing, medical and healthcare, online streaming, electric cars e.t.c. simply because I already have picked my stocks and/or ETFs from these places.\n\n======\n\n1 Transportation and Delivery\n\nTransportation and delivery stocks took a hit last March when the disruption of pandemic came. Almost one year later they have recovered strongly. Staying at home and working from home have created unprecedented demand for transportation and delivery of goods via vehicles on highways. As the vaccination looms and the economy reopens, the demand might drop, but the habits nurtured during the pandemic could linger for quite a while. I am still cautious about airline stocks; air travel is still far from recovering even 1/3 of what it was before the pandemic and I won\u2019t make a move until the volume reaches about 1/2 . \n\nLooking at: PAG, KSU, UPS, FDX, UBER, UNP\n\n======\n\n2 More traditional/\u201d big players\u201d financial stocks\n\nI have opened another post asking for advice, so I will just be copying and pasting:\n\nFintech stocks and ETFs are popular on the market nowadays and I\u2019ve reaped quite some profits from ARKF, PYPL, SQ, V, virtual currency ETFs e.t.c. But now I am eyeing in on the more traditional/big Wall Street players like Citibank, JPM, Morgan Stanley, BNY, Goldman e.t.c. All flaws and blames and crooked behaviors aside, they are still the biggest players in the financial market nowadays and the establishment can\u2019t be overwhelmed by a few Reddit short squeezes. I am trying to observe if these stocks could sort of \"recover\" from the shock and respond to the innovative trend.\n\nThere\u2019s also another realm of more diversified asset management player such as CG, BX, BLK, NTRS e.t.c. It seems the pandemic has a very strong asset/wealth reallocation effects and the wealthiest that could afford to have their assets managed by these players are doing well. These institutions also typically have quite established footings in emerging markets such as Asia and South America in both government and private businesses. CG has recently published a pleasant Q4 2020 report and their stocks climbed. I am waiting to see if BX, BLK and NTRS would follow suit.\n\nLooking at: JPM, BX, BLK, NTRS, CG, BAM\n\n======\n\n3 Military and Defense\n\nThe mainstream media tries hard to paint a layer of peaceful color to the new administration, but tensions around the globe won\u2019t just disappear. The US military has quite a few major contracts for new weapon systems delivery coming up, and US arms sales to allies could increase as many of them are located at the forefronts of tensions (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Saudi, India e.t.c).\n\nLooking at: LDOS, LMT, GD, NOC, BA (more for its military contracts rather than for commercial airplanes)\n\n======\n\n4 Tech Infrastructures\n\nWith everything shifting to online platform, Tech stocks (IT, cloud computing, semiconductors e.t.c.) have done well in 2020. I am in MSFT and TSM, and I just want to take a look at stocks that offer a more infrastructural exposure to the tech advancements, such as base towers for 5G, solutions for cloud computing and online platforms, workstations, hardware production e.t.c.\n\nLooking at: CCI, AMT, CSCO, MSI, ERIC\n\n======\n\n5 Virtual Currency\n\nI am not a big fan of virtual currencies so far, and it might be a bit late to enter the game. but nobody could deny the soaring prices of every major virtual currency, and I certainly don\u2019t mind to ride the bandwagon and get a few extra bucks. \n\nLooking at: BLOK, KOIN\n\nI welcome your thoughts and hope you all have a bullish and profitable 2021.",

        "selftext": "Don\u2019t you dare AutoMod.\n\n\n\nHello, I\u2019m poor and retarded.\n\nLast night after an Adderall-fueled lab report write up I jerked off for like 45 minutes and then started cooking up my next position opportunity. Over the last year, over 35% of all US dollars in circulation were printed. \n\nLet\u2019s think about that for a second. \n\nOver the past 5 years, the price of the USD has dropped 5.5%. A depreciating currency, battling in a sea of new technology backed securities from foreign markets doesn\u2019t sound very stable, no? Keep in mind, our interest rates are the lowest they\u2019ve been in 6 years (0-.25%), and still people don\u2019t want to touch the dollar with a 10 foot pole. Now let\u2019s inject 35% MORE of this INHERENTLY LESS VALUABLE CURRENCY within the span of a year. \n\nFor our chromosomally challenged friends out there, imagine your at your local diseased watering hole, and Tristan shits the main pool. It\u2019s bad. Chicken nuggy for breaskfast lunch and dinner bad. Now let\u2019s say that instead of draining the pool to clean Tristans butt mud, they dig out an extra 30 feet of pool length and filled it with more water. That sounds fucking stupid right? Theres still shit in the water (if you\u2019ve been paying attention up until now proud of you) and eventually you\u2019ll end up a part of the dookie stew. \n\nThat pool is last years $USD globally, and the shit floating around is the many number of factors diminishing the value of the dollar. Adding the extra section to the pool (Federal Reserve handing out enormous stimulus bills), while it briefly allows a place of safety (minimal price fluctuations so far), now you have an even larger pool full of shit. To keep people coming to the pool, the owners start to advertise full pool heating (QE into 2021/ 0% interest rates). This will keep the pool open for a bit, sure.\n\nThe thing is,\n you guessed it, \nstill shit pool.\n\nFederal spending on this scale will have a short term impact on inflation. It\u2019s just how inherent value works. Increasing the amount of a currency without adding to its value will inevitably do the exact opposite. We already have the statistics to back that, we just haven\u2019t seen the full effects. Public debt as a %GDP of the US is currently at 130%. that means that for every 100$ we produce, we consume 130$ worth of goods/services. That is unsuitable. Period. Japan is in an increasingly over-leveraged position too (%250), further stressing both countries currencies since we trade between often.\n\nThere isn\u2019t even a reason to try out the heated pool, because across the street, someone is opening a non-shit-filled pool with a gate code to keep tards out. \n\nBack to Debts as %GDP, Chinas 50.5% and India\u2019s 61% are easily halve as demanding as the United States. Billions of people contributing to a growing economy means currency growth, and state backed [totally not computer money plz don\u2019t remove mod] securities like Chinas digital Yuan and India\u2019s proposed digital Rupee could be genuine causes for concern over the value of the dollar. Now a counter to this might be something along the lines of, \u201cYou fucking geed. 60% of the globes entire monetary reserves are in USD, there\u2019s literally no way central banks would it deviate from the established norm.\u201d \n\nTo that I say, yea sure whatever, but a decline in the value of the dollar is inevitable, and banks will restructure accordingly to minimize losses. Will we lose our reserve-standard status? Probably not, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if large swaths of cash are traded for more secure commodities in the near future come volatility.\n\nThe US dollar is undisputedly the most important currency of the modern world, and fiat currencies have worked until now. But now we have too much money. Money of which we have disconnected from any true real-world value. As we continue to print more and consume just as much, the danger of rapid inflation and other market disasters only increases. That\u2019s where these new [insert non-computer related currency] hope to thrive, deriving their value from a set supply rate (unlike the current money printer) and secured by rigorous coding.\n\nWhich leads me to my actual position:\n\nLiterally anything gold.\nGOLD and GDX more specifically\n\nGold, illustrious and wildly versatile element No. 79, has quite a simple relationship with inflation. Anyone with an adequately formed brain stem could tell you that if currency prices drop, gold prices often rise. It\u2019s a simple matter of gold having inherent value.\n\nWhether it\u2019s jewelry or electronics, stupid monke bran like shiny rock for make new things. Hedges often use gold during periods of high inflation because of this correlation. \n\nNow just to make sure we\u2019re together\n\nDollar \u2b07\ufe0f \u2248 Gold \u2b06\ufe0f\n\nLet me introduce you to Barrick Gold ($GOLD). Market cap $41B, Barrick is a Toronto-based multinational gold mining company. They operate over 10 gold mines around the globe, and have recently started mining copper ore in large quantities as well. Currently trading at $22.45 per share, the stock is down %17 the past 3 months. Over the course of 2020, Barrick exceeded estimated earnings per share each quarter, and managed to reduce their debt of net cash from $1.4 Billion to $497 Million. They increased their dividends per share TWICE over the last year, and have a current free cash flow of over $1.5 Billion. EPS of 1.8 and growing quarterly. Gold prices being high allowed them to (for at least a short while) inject large sums of cash into the company for larger expansion projects, e.g. their $1.3 Billion dollar operation set to open in 2022 in the Dominican Republic. Some smooth brain talking heads believe this to be a risky investment because of the difficult location and lack of broad-scale land sampling, to that I say scared money don\u2019t make money, I ride or die.\n\n\u201cAll of these numbers are cool and all, but I don\u2019t give a fuck. GME\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32.\u201d\n\nFair, but I will leave you with the info that makes me most interested. Fellow gold tickers like Newmont ($ AutoMod will remove the ticker) and Kirkland Lake Gold ($KL), with compatible market caps and areas of business, are owned almost entirely by institutional investors currently. Across the gold market, large funds already own a substantial amount of these companies shares. Only 50% of GOLD shares are owned by institutions as of January, meaning we see a sudden drop in $USD at some point in the near future, large firms could look its direction to hedge. As mentioned before, higher gold prices also make the company more valuable, allowing for larger financing projects in the future.\n\nNow besides currency and inflation pressure, Au has HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of useful applications, and we only discover more as we move forward. Currently, 46% of Gold by mass is used in jewelry, and the buying rates for gold jewelry has consistently dropped over the past couple years.\n\n Yada Yada Yada IDGAF about jewelry,\nI want to invest in that supercomputer/Mars Rover applications of gold.\n\n Golds conductive properties continue to make it one of the best electrical materials on the planet. It is essential in the computers and machines we pump out by the millions of tons each year, and bar technological advancement in room temperature conductivity, Au is the finest material in town. \n\nI don\u2019t have a good way to end this so I\u2019ll just give you guys positions and \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nTLDR: Gold cuz dollar is kill and GME needed a new shiny partner. \n\nNearly all in:\nGOLD 06/18 $23c\nGDX 06/18 $37c\n\nCSCO 02/12 $50c\nHolding a few GME",

        "selftext": "I think that cybersecurity will be this years winner (yes, maybe even more than semi-conductors). I want to pick 3 stocks to hold for the next 5+ years. I have a brief description (from yahoo finance I know...) what they do, my suggestions are: \n\n  \n**CRWD - Crowdstrike Holdings.** provides a broad spectrum of solutions with their main aim being intrusion and breach prevention, such as some of the breaches they helped investigate \u2013 high-profile cases such as Sony Pictures and the DNC.\n\n**FTNT** \\- **Fortinet**  is one of the dominant players in the Unified Threat Management (UTM) space, which is one of the fastest-evolving segments in the network security space.\n\nThe company\u2019s ability to meld next-generation, cloud-based firewalls with SD-WAN allows it to grab an early lead in the SASE market. Its Opaq Networks buyout in July will act like a catalyst. Also, this company has been gaining from heightening cyber-attack risks that are propelling demand for its FortiMail platform.\n\n**PANW - Palo Alto Networks** is a giant when it comes to providing firewalls and various cloud-based services to extend the functionalities of these firewalls. They have a multinational market, outperforming even Cisco in this year\u2019s second quarter.\n\nEqually, when it comes to trading, the number of bullish hedge fund positions moved up by 8 in recent months. The company was in 59 hedge funds\u2019 portfolios at the end of the third quarter of 2020. The all time high for this statistics is 52. This means the bullish number of hedge fund positions in this stock **currently sits at its all time high**.\n\n**OKTA: Okta** provides identity authentication services. This means building a way to verify and enforce who accesses what at any given time, from your run-of-the-mill passwords to biometrics. Okta has been a strong up-and-comer since last year it almost doubled its revenue and beat analysts\u2019 predictions by some $11 million.\n\nStarting with a mainly SMB-oriented client pool, Okta has since leveled up to serving **over 1400 enterprises** with **revenue over $100 000** out of 8000 reported clients. This number continues to grow rapidly.\n\n**NET** \\- **Cloudflare**: is a leader in edge computing. It handles a good part of the traffic the average consumer goes through online today. With services such as DDoS mitigation and internet security, it acts like a reverse proxy between you and the websites you visit.\n\nAside from establishing itself as an internet power, Cloudflare had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange just last year. This year it has been one of the best-performing US stocks, currently **being found on 44 hedge fund portfolios**, way above its all time high of 33.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwhich 3 should I choose? Or any other suggestions? All of them had insane growth in the last year, some with very high p/e ratios.",

        "selftext": "Hello! I wanted to share my DD on Orange ([ORA.PA](https://ORA.PA)). It's the 1st time I make a DD so if you can give me any feedback it would be appreciated.\n\nThe PDF of my full DD (**19 pages but easy to read**) is can be downloaded here: [link](https://ln2.sync.com/dl/1b6673550#njmc5ixz-8iyw2ump-4bde2e78-qzrvq677).\n\nBelow is a summary of my DD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Orange Business Overview\n\nIn one sentence, Orange is a French multinational telecommunications corporation. It has 266 million customers worldwide, employs 89,000 people in France, and 59,000 elsewhere. It is the tenth largest mobile network operator in the world and the fourth largest in Europe after Vodafone, Telef\u00f3nica and VEON. The company seems currently undervalued.\n\nOrange develops and markets many  families of services:\n\n1. Residential, personal and business communication services: landline, internet (modem, ADSL, optical fiber - FTTH), VoIP, videotelephony, digital television and multimedia content (ex: VoD)\n2. Personal communication services, i.e. cell phones.\n3. Business communication services: Orange Business Services ([link](http://www.orange-business.com/)). It operates in over 220 countries and territories and employs over 21,000 employees in 166 countries. Over the last few years, 700 million euros were invested in research and development with dedicated 8,000 employees including scientists, engineers, developers, designers, sociologists and marketers. Orange certified partners include Microsoft, Splunk, Cisco, Amazon Web Service, VMWare, Dell, Cisco.\u00a0\n4. Banking services: Orange Bank. I don\u2019t know much about this one.\n5. Orange Money: mobile money service of Orange S.A., available in most of the group's affiliates in Africa. Its users can deposit money into an account linked to their mobile phone number, and then access a range of services, in particular transferring money domestically and internationally, paying bills and buying airtime top-up.\n6. Domotics: [link (french)](https://boutique.orange.fr/maison/domotique/). I don\u2019t know much about this one either.\n7. Orange Cyberdefense: [link (UK)](https://www.orange.com/en/newsroom/press-releases). Works mainly with the private sector. Acquired\u00a0 SecureData and SecureLink in 2019 ([link](https://orangecyberdefense.com/uk/blog/uncategorized/when-forces-unite-our-rebrand-journey-to-orange-cyberdefense/)).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Orange Business Model\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Convert existing ADSL clients to optical fiber\n* **\u201cConvergence\u201d (see PDF)**: Make clients use Orange as an ISP **and** as a mobile network carrier by giving discount if you are already an Orange Customer\n* Develop software for Orange Cyberdefense\n* Acquire cybersecurity company to develop Orange Cyberdefense (see bull case)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Bull Case\n\n* Orange\u2019s internet access (ADSL, FTTH) is the best in France.\n* News of 09 feb. 2021: Partnership agreement with OVHcloud. OVHCloud is a French cloud computing company that offers VPS, dedicated servers and other web services.\n* Orange Sells 50% Stake In \u20ac2.67B Fibre Project For Rural France. France Orange SA announced an exclusive agreement to divest 50% of its fixed fibre assets for about \u20ac1.3 billion ($1.58 billion) to help rollout networks in rural France ([link](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/orange-sells-50-stake-in-eu2.67b-fibre-project-for-rural-france-2021-01-24)).\n* Orange\u2019s main competitor is Free. Free will offer 5G packages at the same price as 4G, while offering wide coverage of the territory (cf. Bear Case below). However, the bandwidth will be much less than Orange\u2019s 5G ([link](https://www.ariase.com/mobile/carte-5g))\n* Orange is working to make an European tower company ([slide p. 15](https://www.orange.com/sites/orangecom/files/2020-10/Q3%2020%20Presentation%20-%20EN%20-%20vdef.pdf)).\n* Orange Cyberdefense is a strong asset during the lockdown. Moreover, 24 Jan. 2019, it obtained the PDIS certification (Security Incident Detection Service Providers Certification \u2014\u00a0Prestataire de D\u00e9tection d\u2019Incidents de S\u00e9curit\u00e9). In 2019, Orange Cyberdefense revenue increased by 24% ([link](https://www.hebergementwebs.com/orange/orange-is-considering-listing-orange-cyberdefense-on-the-stock-market)). In the first half of 2020, Orange Cyberdefense's revenues also recorded an increase of 11%, despite forecasts. Some more interesting news:\n   * **11 Jun. 2020**: Orange Cyberdefense Launches Malware Cleaner in The United Kingdom and South Africa ([link](https://orangecyberdefense.com/uk/news/security-intelligence/orange-cyberdefense-launches-malware-cleaner-in-the-united-kingdom-and-south-africa/)). \u201cWidely in use throughout Europe by local government, defense contractors, energy providers, automotive manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and their global satellite offices, Malware Cleaner adds a layer of reassurance preventing malware traversing from USB devices and Android mobile phones into internal networks.\u201d\n   * **17 Apr. 2020**: AkzoNobel partners with Orange Business Services to drive digital transformation with secure end-to-end global connectivity services ([link](https://orangecyberdefense.com/uk/news/uncategorized/akzonobel-partners-with-orange-business-services-to-drive-digital-transformation-with-secure-end-to-end-global-connectivity-services/)). \u201cSolution includes software-defined networking and security services, including a CyberSOC IT/OT network convergence driven by productivity and operational security requirements \u201c\n   * **11 Jul. 2019**: SecureLink now officially part of the Orange family ([link](https://orangecyberdefense.com/be/news/orange-cyberdefense/securelink-now-officially-part-of-the-orange-family/)). \u201cSecureLink, based in the Netherlands, is one of the largest independent cybersecurity services providers in Europe, with on-the-ground presences in Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, the UK, Germany, Denmark and Norway. Founded in 2003, SecureLink provides a full range of cybersecurity services to support its clients. Its offering includes specialised security consulting, security maintenance and support with 24/7 service desks (SOCs) as well as advanced managed detection and response capabilities (MDR). The group is also a leading value-added reseller of security software and hardware solutions, holding more than 1,000 technical or sales accreditations with blue chip security vendors. With over 660 employees and 14 offices, SecureLink recorded IFRS revenues of \u20ac248m in 2018 and served over 2,100 customers across a broad range of industries\u201d ([source](https://orangecyberdefense.com/be/news/orange-cyberdefense/orange-signs-an-agreement-to-acquire-securelink/)).\n* Orange doesn\u2019t really have a competitor in France. Free, SFR and Bouygues Telecom are competitors of Orange only regarding mobile and FTTH. However, Orange has multiple services its competitors don\u2019t or partially have: Orange Bank, Orange Money, Orange Cyberdefense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Bear Case\n\n## Multiple controversies in the history of the company (cf. Wikipedia)\n\n## Past CEO\n\n* **2008 January - 2011 April: Staff suicide**. On December 20, 2019 former CEO Didier Lombard and Orange were found guilty of moral harassment towards their employees.\n* **21 March 2007 - \u00a0August 2008: Controversies in the UK regarding the quality of service**. On 21 March 2007 Watchdog, a television series by the BBC focusing on consumer protection, published the results from a broadband survey they held. According to the survey Orange is the worst ISP in the UK. 68% of Orange customers that took part in the survey said they were unsatisfied with Orange's customer service, it was voted as the most unreliable broadband provider, and it had the highest number of dissatisfied customers. Two thirds of Orange customers experienced problems cancelling their Orange broadband.In August 2008, after well publicised problems with iPhone 3G performances, customers compared their download speed and discovered that Orange in France was capping 3G download bandwidth. Orange admitted capping to 384kbit/s, well below the theoretical 7.2Mbit/s provided by the iPhone. Orange uncapped 3G and 3G+ by mid-September 2008.\n* **2009: Accusations of false advertising in France**. Three users lodged a complaint against Orange for false advertising concerning its \"Unlimited 3G Key\" service. These customers criticised the operator for the misleading way in which this service is presented, since it isn't in fact unlimited. While it is true that there is no time limit, the user cannot download more than 1 gigabyte per month, thus limiting browsing. Unaware of this, the three plaintiffs browsed beyond plan limits and had to pay additional fees as a result.\n\n## Current CEO\n\n* **2011: Access to some sites limited**. Following complaints by Internet users, Megaupload accused Orange of not providing sufficient connectivity to its site, thus severely limiting throughput from France, an allegation Orange denied.\n* **January 2011: SMS and MMS propagation of 1 January 2011 in France**. Orange users\u2019 SMS and MMS were sent and billed multiple times. The operator agreed to reimburse the excess costs to consumers, explaining that the error came from a \"third party operator\" (which turned out to be Bouygues Telecom), said not to have sent acknowledgements, which caused the messages to be resent.\u00a0\n* **March 2011: Corruption in Tunisia.** The information website OWNI uncovered a questionable financial deal with \u201cMarouane Mabrouk clan\u201d that enabled the Orange group to acquire a 3G license.\n* **28 July 2011: Anticompetitive practices in French overseas departments.** On 28 July 2011, the Competition Authority fined France T\u00e9l\u00e9com \u20ac27.6 million for having improperly impeded the development of new competing operators in the French overseas departments (primarily R\u00e9union).\n* **2015 - 2016: Accusations of antisemitism and calls for boycott**. The French chairman and CEO of the Orange telecommunications company, St\u00e9phane Richard said in Cairo regarding his company operations in Israel, \"Believe me, I would cancel the contract tomorrow if I could. We want to end this and to fix this; we don't want it.\" Later, Orange announced its desire to discontinue use of its popular brand name by its Israeli operator Partner Communications Company. The president of the State of Israel Reuven Rivlin said in response \"Just yesterday Israel faced attacks from anti-Israel and anti-Semitic bodies, who have chosen to delegitimize the state of Israel, and to launch rockets at us from the Gaza Strip. We must face these challenges together, right and left,\" Rivlin said. Israeli culture minister Miri Regev said, \"I call on Jews of France and the world to disconnect from Orange unless St\u00e9phane Richard takes back his words. In September 2015, Orange reaffirmed their commitment to Israel with an investment in Hola, a video distribution network. In February 2016, Orange and Partner decided to terminate their agreement. As a result, rebranding has resulted in Orange Israel becoming part of Partner. Richard rejected the accusation of antisemitism and went on the record to say, \"We \\[Orange\\] love Israel. This has absolutely nothing to do with the kind of political debate in which I don't want to be.\" He said that the decision to withdraw from Israel was purely a business decision, not a political decision. The decision was to disallow companies to license the Orange brand that does not use Orange's services, which is the practice of the Israeli company Partner. Orange plans not to renew its contract with Partner once the terms of the contract are complete.\n\n## Bearish news\n\n* Orange and Free end talk ([link - FR](https://www.boursorama.com/bourse/actualites/orange-met-fin-aux-discussions-sur-un-accord-de-partage-de-reseau-mobile-avec-free-c4e4a5dd736806e36e88a2dd49bfd38a?symbol=1rPORA)): Offensive on several fronts, Free has decided to offer 5G packages at the same price as 4G, while offering wide coverage of the territory. With aggressive prices and coverage of 40% of the population, it replicates the strategy that had been successful in 4G. Still on the national market, Iliad (parent company of Free) wishes to conquer the business segment, currently dominated by Orange and SFR. The group owns Scaleway, a cloud player, which allows it to position itself in this segment. Internationally, Iliad continued its European expansion: after Italy and Ireland, Free's parent company has invested in Poland, thus asserting itself as the sixth European operator.\u00a0\n* 5G implementation was delayed because of Covid-19 ([US link](https://www.orange-business.com/en/blogs/5g-us-where-are-deployments-and-what-can-we-expect-next)).\n* Earnings were impacted because of Covid-19.\n* Orange is behind Free regarding 5G implementation, and is also more expensive (Orange lowest: \u20ac40/month, Free:\u00a0 \u20ac20/month). Regarding 5G, Orange only has 742 sites when Free has 5640 sites. However Orange\u2019s 5G sites are 78% 3.5 Ghz, while Free only has 5.7% 3.5GHz sites (579 sites for Orange, 322 sites for Free). Which means Orange\u2019s sites have a better quality than Free regarding internet speed.\n* Except buzz words, not much is detailed about Orange Cyberdefense. It is pretty new (since 2016), but that\u2019s not an excuse to be that vague.\n* Orange is considering listing Orange Cyberdefense on the stock market. \u201cHowever, this solution could impose itself within the staff of the incumbent operator as a means of bringing up the Orange 's share price, which has been steadily declining for a year, during which time it was close to 15 euros, to be below 10 euros since the second half of August last.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Orange financial report\n\n## Yearly\n\n||**2016**|**2017**|**2018**|**2019**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Revenue (in billions)**|\u20ac40.71|\u20ac40.86|\u20ac41.38|\u20ac42.24|\n|**Earnings (in billions)**|\u20ac2.81|\u20ac1.84|\u20ac1.95|\u20ac3.01|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Orange P/E and Price-to-cash-Flow ratio\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||**2016**|**2017**|**2018**|**2019**|**current**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n| **P/E ratio**|75.97|23.73|22.64| 12.71|8.94|\n|**Price-to-Cash-Flow ratio**|4.38 |3.78|3.96|3.47|2.52|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nTo conclude this DD, I think Orange is undervalued because it\u2019s P/E and P/CF ratio are low compared to this company's earnings, and even lower compared to Free (Iliad). It also has a lot of room to grow with FTTH + 5G and with Orange Cyberdefense: Orange mobile is present in many countries and so is Orange Cyberdefense. Orange does not really have a competitor except on the 5G/FTTH market : the \u201ccombo\u201d Bank-Money-Cyberdefense does not exist in Orange\u2019s competitors. I think Orange Cyberdefense will become a big player in the next 5-10 years.\n\nHowever, I may be more cautious than analysts, because of Orange\u2019s historical controversies, and if Orange Cyberdefense is listed on the stock market, the value or Orange (ORA.PA) will decline even further. It also makes sense to keep Orange Cyberdefense with Orange, since cybersecurity and telecoms are closely linked. I cannot find any announcement regarding Orange Cyberdefense listing on the stock market, and I can hardly find more than just buzzwords about Orange Cyberdefense (which technology does it use? Does it develop some SaaS or just buy startups? How many?). My advice is to wait to know if there is a public announcement about it. If you have any additional information let me know.\n\nRegarding France\u2019s 5G deployment, in the short term I think the lowest-income consumers will prefer going to Free since it\u2019s less expensive and it costs the same as their 3G/4G subscription. Moreover, most people will not notice the low quality of the 5G deployed by Free compared to Orange\u2019s 5G.\n\nNevertheless, Orange has the potential to challenge Free\u2019s low cost 5G with Sosh: a low-cost mobile company owned by Orange. It may provide low 5G subscription in the future to counter Free\u2019s low cost subscription.\n\nHere is my position about Orange (ORA.PA) :\n\n* **Short term (\\~1-2 month(s))**: stabilisation around \u20ac9.7(\u00b1\u20ac0.2).\n* **1 year**: long if Orange Cyberdefense stays in ORA.PA. I would say the company is worth \u20ac12.5 to \u20ac13, depending on how well Orange Cyberdefense and the 5G deployment are doing. If Orange cyberdefense is listed on the stock exchange, I'm bearish on ORA.PA to \u20ac7.5 or even \u20ac7.\n* **long term (+ 5 years)**: very bullish if:\u00a0\n   * 5G and FTTH continues to grow (this one is a no-brainer)\n   * The controversies stop\n   * Orange Cyberdefense stays with ORA.PA\n   * Orange Cyberdefense objectives and activities become clearer\n   * Orange Cyberdefense continues to grow, for example:\u00a0\n      * development of SaaS like Splunk or SolarWinds;\u00a0\n      * partnership with cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud, OVH, Gandi).\n      * development in other countries. To me, it should focus first on development in the USA, China, and Europe since the market is huge. Targeting the african continent could be a very interesting move too, since this continent is emerging.\n   * Low cost 5G subscription with Sosh. With Sosh, Orange already challenges Free\u2019s fees as an ISP.\n   * If those \u201cif\u201d are satisfied, I am very bullish on Orange and I think \u20ac25 is the minimum target price in + 5 years, because Orange Cyberdefense will become a huge player and IoT security will be a challenge.\n\n## My Position\u00a0\n\n30/11/2020: 50$ at \u20ac10.71, down 9.12% (-$4.56).\n\nYeah I made a DD for 50$.\u00a0\n\nYeah I will do it again.\u00a0\n\nYeah I will make a DD if I\u2019m not sure about a company I invest in.\n\nNB: I said a **LOT** the words \u201cOrange\u201d and \u201cCyberdefense\u201d and I\u2019m sorry.",

        "selftext": "Bullish on FEYE over next few quarters. To me it\u2019s unclear how the recent SolarWinds hack will impact Q4 earnings due to the timing of the hack. On a recent conf call Mandia mentioned that Incident Response hours aren\u2019t billed until after the incident response engagement is over. The SolarWinds news broke on Sunday Dec 13th.  Response engagements of this scale typically take weeks if not months. So we might be looking at meeting Q4 estimates but raising Q1 guidance.  Even without a beat, I\u2019ll take this as a bullish sign. \n\nI\u2019ve been watching job openings at FireEye for the last month.  They\u2019ve been recruiting non-stop and a large portion of these at Incident Response or other services consultants. There are currently 192 open roles.  \n\nBack of the napkin calculations are... many of the senior roles will be sent immediately into the field at a billing rate between $250-$450. At a 80% utilization that is between $400k-$720k per head per year. If they have hired between 50-100 people into these roles since the Solarwinds hack that is could lead to $20M-$36M revenue increase on the low end to $40M-$72M on the high end. With current annual revenues at $928M we could see an annual revenue increase of 7% on these services alone which is above their current 6.9% revenue growth rate. If we see acceleration in any of their newish businesses like Managed Defense and Mandiant Advantage Cyber Threat Intelligence services we could have a great growth story on our hands. Incident Response services are (hopefully) a one time thing for breached companies but Managed Defense and Intel services are a recurring revenue stream, so growth in these areas would be a very good thing indeed. \n\nAny upticks in the hardware business would be positive news, but I believe they are facing upgrade cycle challenges and I\u2019m not expecting much on this front. \n\nFinally, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we saw FEYE acquired by a larger player in the next few months. There have been multiple rounds of rumors over the last few years that indicate FEYE has hired an investment bank to assist with the process. While Mandia hasn\u2019t confirmed these rumors, he hasn\u2019t denied them either. Cisco allegedly passed. I think good candidates are Microsoft, IBM or even someone like CrowdStrike using their astronomically high share price to swing a deal and create a cyber powerhouse to rival Pali Alto.  \n\nI\u2019m long with shares, considering NTM/OTM LEAPS, might by some June calls.  FD weeklies might payout but are risky IMO.",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday morning-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-10-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow set to bounce after breaking a six-session win streak\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicated up nearly 100 points. A late fade Tuesday resulted in the Dow and S&amp;P 500 falling slightly from closing record highs and breaking six-session winning streaks. However, the Nasdaq managed to hold on to a modest advance and notching another record close.\n\n&gt; * On the economy, the government releases its look at January consumer prices at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell on Wall Street. At 2 p.m. ET, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at an Economic Club of New York webinar, in an address focusing on the state of the American job market.\n\n&gt; * Bitcoin bounced around Wednesday, one day after soaring to an all-time high below $48,000. Crypto enthusiasts are wondering whether other companies will follow Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla and invest in bitcoin. In the latest sign of institutional interest, Tesla revealed Monday that it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Coca-Cola, GM report better-than-expected Q4\n\n&gt; * Coca-Cola on Wednesday said the coronavirus pandemic is still hurting sales, but cost-cutting efforts helped it top analyst earnings estimates. Shares of the Dow component rose 2% in premarket trading. The beverage giant made 47 cents per share in the fourth-quarter. Net sales dropped 5% to $8.6 billion, missing expectations. Unit case volume, which strips out the impact of foreign currency, shrank by 3%. All four of its beverage segments reported volume declines.\n\n&gt; * Shares of General Motors fell more than 1% in the premarket after the U.S. automaker said Wednesday that a global semiconductor chip shortage could cut earnings by $1.5 billion and $2 billion this year. GM\u2019s crosstown rival, Ford, last week said the chip shortage could lower its earnings. GM also issued fourth-quarter profit of $1.93 per share on revenue of $37.5 billion. Both beat analyst expectations.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Twitter is \u2018bigger than any one account,\u2019 CEO says\n\n&gt; * Shares of Twitter rose more than 5.5% in Wednesday\u2019s premarket, the morning after the social media network reported fourth-quarter earnings of 38 cents per share on revenue of $1.29 billion, both of which beat estimates. Monetizable daily active users gained 30% to 192 million from a year ago, but still fell short of expectations. Twitter is \u201cbigger than any one account,\u201d said CEO Jack Dorsey, in his first earnings call following the ban of then-President Donald Trump last month, days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Trump impeachment trial continues with opening arguments\n\n&gt; * Opening arguments are set begin at noon ET Wednesday in Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial. An emotional first day ended with the Senate voting to hear the case on whether to convict the former president of inciting the Capitol riot even though he\u2019s no longer in office. Watching the proceedings from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump was furious at what he saw from his attorneys Tuesday, according to a person familiar with his thinking. The 50-50 split Senate is expected to acquit Trump.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Covid spike in the U.S. show signs of slowing\n\n&gt; * The crushing coronavirus spike in the U.S. has been showing signs of abating, with 95,360 new cases Tuesday less than a third of the record high new daily infections of 300,282 on Jan. 2. The number of people in U.S. hospitals being treated for Covid-19 totaled 79,179 on Tuesday, the first daily count below 80,000 since Nov. 18. U.S. deaths from the virus averaged 2,857 over the past seven days. Fatalities reached a single-day peak of 4,432 on Jan. 12.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/UcNjYBi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Jzsj6V4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/bEWgiAZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/K690R0u.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hloQBbG.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/1aI3OXL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/7f4pptB.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/NGnaqee.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vLhBS2V.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1p6W5Oy.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/qxoyyCv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9Jx5owU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/I9j8fVZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/iAjNlv8.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/1MVWFH6.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/xZ56Gwf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2MZhVwY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* TLRY\n* APHA\n* ACB\n* AUVI\n* FSR\n* GM\n* PACB\n* ADA.X\n* BPTH\n* HTBX\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-under-armour-twitter-bunge-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Coca-Cola (KO)** \u2013 Coca-Cola reported quarterly earnings of 47 cents per share, 5 cents a share above estimates.

        "selftext": "Ubiquiti Inc. develops networking technology for service providers, enterprises, and consumers.\n\nOn 2/5/2021 they announced another quarter that exceeded expectations with strong global demand for their products. The growth/adoption of their products into the enterprise demonstrate that the company continues to gain traction against the likes of Cisco (CSCO).\n\nFor those that read a headline and act: A couple of items to be aware of.\n\n1) While the stock has a 20.8B market cap, it only trades a little over 100k shares a day or about 1.5% of the available float. This means using limit orders when buying or selling might be best. Otherwise the MM\u2019s will take advantage of you.\n\n2) The liquidity/spreads in the option market are horrible. Outright buying the stock is likely the way to play this stock\n\n**A Little Background**\n\nUbiquiti was founded by Robert Pera and went public in 2011. This is the same Robert Pera that owns the Memphis Grizzlies. I like to think of him in the same light as Mark Cuban. He is a disruptor by nature and has an anti-establishment approach. He is not always conventional in his methods when engaging with the media and public which likely results in less overall hype around Ubiquiti.\n\nAs of 12/31/2020 there were 62.8m shares outstanding. Founder Robert Pera owns 56.2m shares or 89.6% of the company. \n\nThe company has been aggressively buying back shares, reducing the shares outstanding by over 2m in 2020. As of 12/31/20 they still had $385.2m authorized under the \u201c2020 May Program\u201d which facilitates the company\u2019s repurchase program.\n\nAccording to [Fintel.io](https://fintel.io/), institutions own 6.9m shares, resulting in over 100% ownership between Pera and institutions. Some percentage of these institutions represent index funds that are not actively managed. The institutional ownership may be overstated as a result of stale data and/or the company\u2019s repurchase of 309,133 shares in the last 3 months of 2020.\n\nThen there are the retail investors that own some small slice of this company. Some of the retail investors are self-declared Ubiquiti \u201cFan Boys\u201d such as myself that have owned the stock for years and have deployed their equipment in our homes and across the enterprise\u2019s where we work. \n\nThe end result is a float of 6.5m shares of which some percentage that is owned by index funds or owned by \u201cFan Boys\u201d and not actively traded.\n\nThe company just declared another $0.40 dividend. With $1.60 in anticipated dividends over the next 12 months, Pera will be taking home an estimated $90m per year in dividends. Why is this relevant? Pera is is able to generate cash from his Ubiquiti ownership, without the need of selling shares. He just holds his current shares while increasing his ownership percentage through the company\u2019s stock repurchase program.\n\n**Now for the Shorts**\n\nAs of 1/15/21 there were 1.04m shares short which represents 15.94% of the float. We will have to see how these change when the 1/31 numbers are released this week. The low daily average volume results in a Short ratio of 10.38 as calculated by Yahoo finance as of 1/15.\n\nWith a great quarter behind them, a growing business, fewer COVID-19 related supply chain risks and combined with insiders who generally do not sell, where will the shorts get shares to cover their bets if the stock continues to move against them?\n\nPera has not shown a desire to sell.  \n Mid-Cap index funds are not actively managed.  \n \u201cFan Boys\u201d are not selling anytime soon.  \n The Company continues to repurchase shares.\n\nI believe short covering could result in a monumental short squeeze if the stocks momentum continues an upward trajectory.\n\n**Why not a leveraged Buy-out** \n\nNow I am certainly not an expert on leveraged buy-out\u2019s, but what would it take for Pera to decide to take the whole thing private. Like Michael Dell taking his namesake company private in 2013 before going public again in 2018.\n\nThe company is generating great cash flow, actively reducing the number of shares available and is predominantly owned by a multi-billionaire. \n\nWith $385.2m still available to repurchase shares, at a current market price of $330, this could remove another 1.16m shares from the float, making it that much easier to buy-out the company.\n\nIs the stock repurchase program a precursor to something bigger?\n\n **Conclusion**\n\nYou could conclude this continues to be a growth story of a company looking to disrupt the status quo. They are profitable, growing, pay a dividend and demonstrated good cash flow all the while repurchasing their stock.\n\nThis could be a massive, short squeeze in the making as the short ratio is 10.38 and float continues to be reduced as a result of the share repurchase program.\n\nThe endgame could be a leveraged buy-out that sees Ubiquiti taken private resulting in a handsome reward for Pera\u2019s loyal followers.\n\nI Love Ubiquiti\u2019s products and this stock. \n\nI have been long since 5/22/2014 and have added to my position as recently as 2/5/21\n\nThis Content is for informational purposes only, you should not construe any such information or other material as investment or financial advice.",

He was the CEO of Sonic Solutions (which he sold to ROVI), then CEO of NDS (which he sold to Cisco) and CEO of Textura (which he sold to Oracle).\n\nBut what I find more interesting is Dave's background in electric cars. He is currently the CEO of JD Power and I was reading about him and came across [this article](https://www.autonews.com/article/20180321/RETAIL03/180329913/dave-habiger-j-d-power-s-new-ceo-is-tech-expert-and-car-guy).

He used to convert cars from gas-burning to electric-powered, including Porsche sports cars. **Elon Musk, who Habiger said once considered hiring him as Tesla\u2019s CEO**, asked for one, but others had already made deposits and production was slow.\n\n...\n\n&gt; Habiger, a car enthusiast, **served as chairman of a government electric vehicle commission to design infrastructure for charging stations**.

        "selftext": "Made by u/boogawooga8558.\n\nHey guys, I\u2019ve recently been looking into the cloud-based stocks (due to continual covid lock downs) and think I found a winner in cloud-based video content creation - #MVY Moovly Media\n (I searched this Canadian Investor subreddit, but found no threads on this stock, so thought I'd start one). That said, what are your favourites? I have my own reasons why I think these area\u2019s will be hot, but a couple quotes that have confirmed my reasoning:\n\nCloud stocks are \u201cone of the only durable growth markets out there right now.\u201d\n\u2013 RBC Capital Markets\n\nThis makes total sense. Due to COVID, everyone is moving away from the office and working remotely. Available/empty office space is increasing as people realize that they can be just as effective working \u201cremotely\u201d. This is changing the landscape of how people and teams work on projects. In a local office with a LAN (Local Area Network), teams could collaborate and work across your local network with ease. Working in teams now requires more cloud-based software and storage.\n\nAlso, according to Cisco \u201cThe digital video market is growing so fast that by 2022, just a little more than a year from now, 82% of all internet traffic will be video.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been reading about Moovly media the past few weeks, as it has had increased volume and a spike in share price. See chart:\u00a0https://www.tradingview.com/x/ln3zjqQV/\u00a0. On Friday the company announced a $0.10 financing (\u00a0https://www.moovly.com/investors/moovly-arranges-non-brokered-private-placement\u00a0), so I believe in the near term there could be a small dip in share price which will make for a great entry, and for me to add more. This video development software is a game changer and has already been vastly adopted by multi-billion dollar corporations \u2013 I just don\u2019t think the market has really caught on to the revenue potential\n\nA little info &amp; DD on Moovly:\n\nMoovly streamlines video creation making it easy and low cost for users to create professional videos. As noted in the quotes above, internet traffic is focused on video \u2013 plain and simple. It will be imperative for all businesses to tell their story in video and not just text and picture as has been cheaply and easily done in the past. One main reason small businesses don\u2019t focus on video is because it too expensive to hire a video designer. This is why Moovly is so important \u2013 a cloud-based video creation product that anyone can use to create and design video content.\n\nOVER 60% of ALL Fortune 1000 companies have some type of agreement with Moovly and are using Moovly\u2019s product and service. This is a mind-blowing stat. To draw some comparisons, as WordPress is for cloud-based website creation, DocuSign ( #DOCU) for cloud-based legal documents, Zoom ( #ZM) for cloud-based video conferencing, RingCentral ( #RNG) for corporate cloud-based telecommunication.\u2013 Moovly ( #MVY) is the leader in cloud-based video creation - a simple but effective, professional plug-and-play solution that allows all users to create professional video all online.\n\nVery simply put. If you want your product/service/business noticed, you will have to adopt video, or your business won\u2019t survive. Everyone knows of YouTube, but I bet you didn\u2019t know (neither did I) this stat I found from Forbes: \u201cYouTube is not simply a website; it is a search engine. YouTube\u2019s user-friendliness, combined with the soaring popularity of video content, has made it the second largest search engine behind Google. With 3 billion searches per month, YouTube\u2019s search volume is larger than that of Bing, Yahoo, AOL and Ask.com combined. If YouTube\u2019s user base were a country, it would be the third largest in the world. (\u00a0https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/05/15/are-you-maximizing-the-use-of-video-in-your-content-marketing-strategy/?sh=60ab61a83584\u00a0)\n\nCheck out Moovly\u2019s Investor page to see who their partners are and how incredible their software is. I believe the opportunity to buy stock this week during the private placement window presents a great opportunity. Of course after financings are complete, that is when companies often announce news and stock catalysts \u2013 I expect the same for #MVLY\nhttps://www.moovly.com/investors",

        "selftext": "I was thinking about examples of what Moore (Gorilla Game) calls tornadoes, and 3d-printers popped into my head. A tornado in his model is a new market, that develops into a crucial link the value chain of businesses. Alternatively it can be a \"better mouse trap\" that completely displaces another link in the chain, or even re-writes the entire value chain, like Netflix replacing Blockbuster. Having a conversation with a long time friend a while back, I was asking him about any good ideas for something small to send his kids, while they're basically stuck inside all day long. Imagine being a kid and being 6 or 7 right now. One entire year of your life has been spent in a weird bubble. 1/7 of your life. That would be like every Sunday of my life I couldn't go anywhere, or meet someone for coffee, or go grocery shopping. A sort of Shomar Shabbot, but death is a dice roll if you break the rules and the whole family rolls the dice if anyone cheats. It feels like it's the kind of thing that's going to define the worldview for a generation of children, for a while to come. I thought I could at least send them a bit of mail. I remember mail of any flavor being a fun event as a kid. Kid's don't get a lot of mail. We even got excited for travel brochures. The kind you send away for. The \"Come visit exciting Nebraska, we've got a corn maze. Get it, Maize! Haha. Please, somebody visit..\" travel brochures states departments of commerce or travel would send out if you asked. This was probably more of a thing back before the internet.\n\nMy friend replied that he's very into Lego's (big surprise, I knew this), and he likes building elaborate battles with his Legos and other toys. Orcs versus Legos versus Ninjas. That sort of thing. He had found a home 3d-printer setup at a decent price and kids were very excited to get what amounted to a homemade army-man printed off the machine to add to their epic battles. It didn't cost much and he could make his kid just about anything. An orc. A ninja. A giant squid. A giant squid-orc-ninja. This part of the equation I didn't know.\n\nThis got me thinking about 3d-printers and tornadoes. I don't know what industry this would disrupt specifically, when it reaches that last stage of innovation where it becomes more efficient for a person or small business to own a cheap 3d-printer to solve their needs, rather than order a specialized part from a company that might charge specialized-part-company prices. Even better, to replace a part on an old machine that was out of production or solve a problem that didn't have an already commercially available solution. There are already libraries full of blueprints available for download for all sorts of different solid state things a 3d-printer could make. Maybe it would disrupt a lot of industries in smaller R&amp;D or cost savings sorts of ways.\n\nI remember a news story earlier this year, of a kid who designed what amounted to a bobby-pin solution to the problem nurses and doctors were experiencing with their ears getting wrecked after 12 hours wearing masks all day in the ICU's. It wasn't remotely complicated, but it was ingenious. Looked like a little fish-bone piece if plastic that wrapped around the back of your head and had multiple spaced out tongs to hook the ear loop on each side. No more painful ears. He was printing them on a 3d-printer for his local hospital and couldn't print them fast enough. So he gave away the design and made a tutorial for other tinkerers to replicate it on their own 3d-printers. Smart kid. I was not nearly that ambitious at his age. I was throwing rocks and pieces of flotsam into big puddle, and doing wicked jumps off the 6 inch dirt \"hill\" in the field we neighborhood kids had decided was a BMX track. Dangerous times.\n\n3d printers are the sort of thing that has the opportunity to be a new category. I don't know what roadblocks still exist to mass adoption, but it seems like the price roadblock at least has been knocked down. A quick google search \"who makes 3d printers\" yielded a fascinating article with a lot of useful information. I didn't realize there were companies that had been involved in this for decades. Of course CNC machines have been around for a long time, but that is an industrial solution. Most people don't have a CNC machine in their garage, or the technical knowledge to use one. HP. ProtoLabs. Materialise. Stratasys. 3d Systems. ExOne. It's a long list, this article is packed with information.\n\nI don't know how to approach this, because I'm not an expert on 3d printers or emerging technology. If some of these companies have been around this long, it probably either isn't a winner-take-all industry or there is still some roadblock preventing mass adoption of the technology. So let's take a look at it from the simplest possible angle: Year over Year revenue increases.\n\nHP doesn't get factored, because HP is way too massive, I am way too lazy and this is just an example. Perhaps you could dig through a 10-k and find a break-out of the revenue from this segment, but I'm just going to skip that and look at the smaller companies, some 3d printer specialists.\n\nRevenues by year (*in thousands*, but this does not matter because we are comparing percentages)\n\n\" Proto Labs specializes in rapid prototyping using three additive  processes: stereolithography, selective laser sintering and direct metal  laser sintering. \"\n\nProto Labs (PRLB): 2019, 2018, ... \\[$458,728,  $445,596,  $344,490, $ 298,055  $ 264,106  $ 209,583 \\]\n\nYear-over-year Growth: 2019, 2018, ... \\[2.9%, 29.35%, 15.5%, 12.8%, 26%\\]\n\nMath: (458,728 - 445,596) /  445,596 = 0.029 (x100) = 2.9%\n\n\" Materialise has been providing software solutions and 3D printing services for over 25 years. \"\n\nMaterialise (MTLS): 2019, 2018, ... \\[\u20ac196,679  \u20ac184,721  \u20ac142,573,  \u20ac114,477  \u20ac102,035,  \u20ac81,355\\]\n\nYear-over-year Growth: 2019, 2018, ... \\[6.4%, 29.56%, 24.54%, 12.19%, 25.41%\\]\n\nNow I'm not going to go through and do all your homework. This is an example of how to approach a topic. It requires more work, more companies, reading 10-k's and probably knowing more than I do about the 3d-printer industry, if you want additional certainty. This is the process. Nothing I used was a paywalled service. There are no greeks or probabilistic distributions and long-tails to understand. I used very basic math and a bit of reasoning, and a really good mental model by a few guys written 20 years ago. The case studies they were writing about were Microsoft, Cisco, and Novell Netware. The mental model hasn't changed.\n\nThese are not gorilla game numbers, according to their model. Revenues should be spiking upwards harder than this. It should be more obvious. All the same it still appears from this initial investigation to be a potentially solid growth industry. Let's also note the comparison of those two companies, year over year. 3% vs 6%. 29% vs 29%, 15% vs 24%, 12% vs 12%, 26% vs 25%. If this was my only metric, I'd think two things. First, Materialise is leading, PRLB is reacting. Second, both of these companies are growing revenues significantly so I might have found an industry on it's way up, but one in which there is no winner-take-all. Looking more like a growth industry situation than a monopoly situation, the \"Gorilla Game\". A rising tide lifts all boats situation.\n\nTo get to a level of certainty where this would constitute an investment and not a guess, we would need to mine SEC Edgar for more years and do this with more companies, along with other metrics. Revenue is a good start, but it is not enough to provide safety. Net Earnings, debt/equity, other things of this sort. If you were the type that likes to forecast earnings into the future, this is the sort of thing that would be suitable for a DCF model into the future. So much the better if you had some in-depth knowledge about 3d-printing.\n\nThis is how you get going. It's not magic, just legwork (in my case keyboard work), mental models, some competence in the industry you're fishing and some basic math and reasoning skills.\n\nTools used to create this example:\n\nGoogle, SEC Edgar, this article ([https://investingnews.com/daily/tech-investing/emerging-tech-investing/top-3d-printing-companies/](https://investingnews.com/daily/tech-investing/emerging-tech-investing/top-3d-printing-companies/)), a cheap laptop and about 20 minutes of typing.",

        "selftext": "POETF (PTK.VN for Canadians): \n\nA Canadian company that just invented a new manufacturing process used in photonics cables that makes them 100x more efficient AND 25%-40% cheaper AND reduces the capital expenditure for companies that adopt this manufacturing process by 90%, not to mention the devices themselves are more efficient than what's on the market right now. The company has a history of offerings and has been dark for years trying to perfect this tech, but now that they've got the bugs out they're ready for production starting Q3 of 2021. This tech is brand new and changes the economics of photonics enough that it will disrupt the industry. They've recently signed a joint venture with Sanan, a Chinese tech company with a $15B market cap. The applications of this tech will be crucial to cloud and edge computing, AI integration, and 5&amp;6G tech. Potential partners are Amazon, Cisco, Huawei, Google, and Facebook.\n\nIf you've got time, skim through their presentation: https://poet-technologies.com/docs/presentations/POET_Needham%20Tech%20Conf_01-14-21_Final_1.pdf\n\nThe risks: The tech is groundbreaking, that's a fact. POETF currently has an advantage over Intel, but not the resources Intel has. Intel would have to play catch up and there's no saying that POETF couldn't be displaced if Intel catches up, but I think this is still a safe investment until at least 2023. Keep in mind the R&amp;D phase of POETF is over, they're now focused on streamlining production and will start earning revenue in Q3 of 2021.\n\nMy prediction: I think a fair value of POETF is $4-$5, but I have a feeling once word gets out it will pump much higher to possibly $10 (since the catalysts are so good) then dump back down to a reasonable level of $4-$5\n\nI'm in 1000 shares at $1\n\nSome more reddit DD:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/PennyStocksDD/comments/l9riik/poet_technologies_poetf/\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/layqli/ptkvpoetf_dd_blowing_up_ahead_of_potential/",

        "selftext": "The sentiment among both retail investors and institutional investors seems to be that growth is king.\n\nThis is mostly fueled by the fact that companies such as Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, AMD, and Facebook have appreciated in value substantially faster than \"value\" stocks such as T, VZ, LUMN, KR. Investors see the returns growing companies provide, and project similar trends. If investing in Tesla provided a 10x return in a year, why invest in a boring stagnant company like AT&amp;T that pays a 7% dividend and lost value?\n\nTo me, this seems very reminiscent of 1999/2000, where fast growing tech companies were valued tremendously high. Much like now, the idea was earnings would keep growing, so these high valuations would be justified by high earnings in the future. Investors seem very much focused on \"investing in the companies of the future\" and thus prices have grown much faster than earnings have.\n\nOne common misconception is that in 2000, the bubble was all unprofitable tech companies with no feasible business model, whereas today, growth companies like Tesla, Nvidia, and Microsoft are profitable.\n\nWhile companies with bad business models crashed the hardest, profitable tech companies were still overvalued in 2000 too. \n\nCisco, for example, was profitable in 1999, yet it dropped in value by 75%, and still has not recovered from 2000 highs.\n\nContrast that with a \"boring\" non-tech value company like Walmart, which barely budged during the tech bubble crash.\n\nShare appreciation is an important aspect of total returns, but share appreciation is entirely dependent on investor sentiment. \n\nRight now, enthusiasm for growth is at record highs. Investors are willing to buy unprofitable companies with the expectation they will grow rapidly and eventually become a profitable giant, and they can sell for more.\n\nIt's important to ask yourself- what happens if this sentiment disappears as it did in 2000? Suppose investors suddenly decide paying over 60x annual revenue and over 600x EPS for a company like Shopify is no longer justified, and the price of such growth stocks drops 75%. Are you comfortable with that?\n\nIn my opinion, growth is important, but the best way to value a stock fairly is to base it on the assumption that you can't sell it for 100 years, but any capital returned to shareholders can be reinvested either back into the company, or elsewhere using the discount rate you chose to discount value of distributions. \n\nWhen you do that, it takes swings in investor sentiment out of the question. You're no longer vulnerable to market volatility. The question becomes \"will this company provide a positive return given a discount rate on future cash flows?\"\n\nIf the answer to that question is \"no\", then you're basing your entire investment on faith that the market will be continue to place a high valuation on growth and be willing to pay excessively for it. if that sentiment remains, great, you can profit. But if it doesn't, then you're stuck either holding the bag on an illiquid investment, or selling for a loss.\n\nIt is my view that in the next decade, value stocks with low P/E ratios in less cyclical industries(ie consumer staples, telecommunications), will experience lower volatility than growth stocks with negative earnings or high P/E ratios, due to having consistent cash flows to back up valuations.\n\nI believe a handful of growth companies that do extraordinarily well will outperform a broad basket of value based companies, but the majority will not.",

Let\u2019s repeat, CDN and edge computing is a commodity and will still be a commodity down the road while all CDN provider\u2019s USP will be diminished in the long run. This indicates that no one clear player in the market will have a sustainable moat. Fastly\u2019s only economic moat is about building up switching costs for the clients. Fastly\u2019s customer acquisition strategy is more sustainable due to the nature of high switching cost.\n* Edge Computing is the tech buzzword now like how \u201cCloud Computing\u201d is a buzzword in 2010. Edge Computing is definitely not a new technology but it\u2019s buzzing due to driven demand of such need. It is also being buzzed due to the rise of IoT and 5G. CDN providers and public cloud vendors are also buzzing it now to capture the enterprise customers\u2019 attention.\n* 7 other risks to be priced-in which might derail the investment thesis while complementing 2 wild cards or opportunities.\n* Valuation is suggesting a 64% upside over the next 24-month period.\n\n \n\n# Weak USP &lt;=&gt; Commodity offering\n\nBoth edge computing and CDN offerings are currently offered by Amazon\u2019s Lambda@Edge, Cloudflare\u2019s Workers, Akamai\u2019s EdgeWorkers, Microsoft\u2019s Azure Edge Zones, IBM\u2019s IBM Edge Application Manager, Limelight\u2019s Edge Compute\u2026\u2026. (and the list goes on\u2026). Just to summarize, ALL public cloud providers and ALL CDN providers had already provided or soon to provide edge computing services.\n\nCompute@Edge is not unique to Fastly and any unique features in Compute@Edge would definitely not be unique for long until competitors catch up.\n\n# Fastly\u2019s ONLY Moat: Dive-in with in-depth switching cost within the industry vertical\n\n \n\nFastly\u2019s share of the Internet is more than Akamai and almost the same as Amazon CloudFront but nowhere near to Cloudflare. If you compare the revenue per share of the Internet, Cloudflare obviously has huge upsides to charge more to capitalize further. Akamai\u2019s revenue is approximately 10 times more than Fastly but approximately 50% lesser in share of the internet which either Akamai charging 20 times more than it should or Fastly is underpricing which boths scenarios also indicate huge upsides for Fastly to get more revenue from re-pricing or more enterprise customers migrate away for cost-saving. W3tech is showing a very promising territory that Cloudflare is getting into which is mass-market approach and rising in rank in terms of number of high-traffic sites.\n\nI hope this analogy would make sense to you: Would you like to land 5 big clients within the same vertical which own 100 subsidiaries each or land 10000 small clients across 50 different verticals with only 1\u20132 subsidiaries each? That\u2019s how I look at Fastly versus the rest of the CDN providers or Edge Cloud providers. Go Niche. Go Deeply Integrated. Go Specific. Then cross verticals.\n\nAcross many Fastly\u2019s content and earning calls, Fastly has always been saying \u201cBuilt by developers, to empower developers\u201d, \u201cGiving back the control to the hands of developers\u201d, \u201cWe support our customer\u2019s needs and customer\u2019s needs is our core priority\u201d. Fastly\u2019s customers also repeatedly champion for Fastly and love Fastly\u2019s solution a lot. Some of Fastly\u2019s customers also say \u201cFastly\u2019s support team is great and they are a fun team to hang long to grow together\u201d. This is no coincidence. It\u2019s all about building switching costs as an economic moat that the customers won\u2019t leave and it attracts more new customers to join.\n\nFastly\u2019 CEO says: \u201cWe believe that we are unique in delivering the specific set of interconnected tools that our customers have shown us are the exact right combination required to build the future of the internet. \u201c. It\u2019s essentially saying Fastly\u2019s tool is specifically designed for the industry vertical (think digital publishing and e-commerce).\n\nEvery industry vertical has different use cases and you just can\u2019t use one generalized / commoditized feature to land every enterprise customer in different industry verticals. To land big clients, you would need to ensure you have the agility to customize features that no other CDN providers are willing to deploy development resources. Other CDN providers or edge computing providers are using a one-size-fits-all approach compared to Fastly\u2019s agile approach which is willing to dedicate development resources to customize solutions on catering for big clients\u2019 needs. In some way, Fastly is acting like a software house which builds customized solutions via API to one client. But let\u2019s not forget that the client\u2019s use case is not unique.\n\nFor example, news publishers like The New York Times made a feature request for some new use cases, Fastly developed it for The New York Times to beta test and public launch then rolled out to the rest of Fastly\u2019s news publisher. This gives a strong feedback loop and pulls in the rest of the news publishers who are not on Fastly yet and making the migration way from public cloud vendors to Fastly.\n\nNews publishing industry is competitive in nature and the \u201cfear of missing out \u2014 FOMO\u201d is helping Fastly to land more enterprise clients organically within the same verticals. When a CTO in a news publisher who uses Akamai or Cloudflare or Amazon, he/she starts to notice every other news publisher is on Fastly with features that their current cloud poriver don\u2019t have, the CTO will first make a feature request to the current cloud providers. However, if such a feature request is so niche in the use case that only the news publishing industry will need it, good luck having that the current cloud providers will prioritize the feature request in the development pipeline. It\u2019s just in a matter of time that the CTO will be inpatient and migrate to Fastly.\n\nFastly already conquered the news publishing\u2019s cdn and edge computing market share. And they did the same with other verticals such as e-commerce \u2014 Shopify, Target, Etsy just to name a few. Their next move is on Video, Audio, SaaS, Travel Marketplaces and Fintech. My next guess is they are also trying to make their way into the game industry which they are late in the game as of now.\n\n \n\n# Page Load Time Matters and it Drives Demand for Edge Computing\n\nBack in 1999, internet users were willing to wait up to 8 seconds for page load on desktop. You have to remember back then, the internet use case was just dominated with Internet 1.0 websites which without much web complexity. You were just plainly downloading the content from the websites and minimal uploading from your end to the websites.\n\nToday, the web application is getting very complex to the point that the speed load is slower year over year (on mobile). This is due to the fact that you are simultaneously downloading a lot of contents from the web page and also uploading a lot more data back to the web page\u2019s server. There are countless web cookies, trackers, interactive plugins, targeted ads, dynamic contents and live contents within the same page session or mobile app which adds up the application complexity while internet users are browsing it on mobile devices.\n\nWhy would enterprise customers want to add so many elements within the same page and what are you uploading to their server? Enterprises want it to be smarter with more data analysis which then resulted for better targeting with high relevance. Furthermore, the enterprise also wishes to achieve all of these heavy processing and return immediate responses within milliseconds while wanting dozens of the plugins to be able to feedback to compute and deliver results within the same milliseconds timeframe. As you type in the search bar for character by character, the algotherim is computing and predicting what you want and deciding what\u2019s the best strategy to rank the result for you all within milliseconds. If e-commerce buyers can\u2019t get what they want within the first result page, they will not click into the second result page. E-commerce operators would want to change the product results instantly and live within the first page itself when you land on the first page of the result page. How do they plan to do that? When you land on the result page, the enterprise would want to analyze how long you spend on reading/watching/scrolling/interacting the first 2\u20133 products while gauging what you are really looking for and quickly swap out/in the next 7 products without the consumer even realizing. You should watch The Social Dilemma on Netflix then you know what I am talking about. This is entirely based on the live interaction that you have provided and the compute engine processes it immediately and responds back to you immediately. Personalization element is also pushing the boundaries of what results should be given based on how you are interacting with the application. When you ask Apple\u2019s Siri or Google Assistant or similar AI assistant a question with more than 30 words, it\u2019s not likely to provide an accurate response at the moment. Even if the tech giants cracked the complex question with the most accurate answer, it\u2019s not likely to deliver it back to you without buffering as all of the heavy computing is done at a central location instead of distributed.\n\n \n\nLooking at the PageSpeed of amazon, you would notice that the Speed Index is 8.9 s while Time to Interactive is 12.6 s. Every web application would very much want every single element to be all loaded within 30ms while adding even more complex stuff along the way. This is where Edge Computing plays a role too. As more websites or mobile apps set a higher page load benchmark without compromising the data analytics capabilities, the demand for edge computing will explode.\n\nIn conclusion, the future of internet usage is about relevancy, data analytics, personalisation, real-time, zero buffering, high complexity and big computing done at the closest server located in the same town that you are using the devices. This change of behaviour drives the demand of edge computing.\n\n \n\n# Edge Computing\n\nEdge computing changes the way developers build applications. To simplify it, Amazon\u2019s Edge Computing explained it 8 words: \u201cBringing data processing and analysis closer to end-points\u201d. Instead of relying on one single core compute engine in a single centralized massively-scaled cloud server campus in San Francisco to run the logic processing for global users located all over the world of 195 countries, the developer will distribute more processing to be done on thousands of small-scaled distributed server campus which are located within 1000km (or nearer) of the user. Instead of relying on one master database in San Francisco to authenticate user access, developers can now distribute the authentication process by replicating the database to the distributed server which is nearer to the users. For telemetry use cases, instead of sending 10GB worth of imagery data all the way from Sydney to San Francisco for central processing, the developer would utilise distributed computing to process such data within Sydney\u2019s distributed server which reduces the latency tremendously. However, there\u2019s tremendous tailwinds on edge computing as it requires developers to change the existing compute, authentication, database storage and cache architecture. It involves huge effort to overhalve the legacy applications to the distributed architectures. CTOs are still busy adapting to big data, cybersecurity, machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n\n Looking at Google Trends to compare the search interest of \u201ccloud computing\u201d, \u201cbig data\u201d, \u201cedge computing\u201d, \u201ccloud gaming\u201d and \u201cmachine learning\u201d, you would notice the interest for edge computing is way lower than the rest as we are still in very early phase of developing the infrastructure of edge computing. The infrastructure is referring to both hardware and software which there\u2019s a lack of mainstream open-source contribution to an open-source edge computing software stake. To escalate it, Fastly is championing WebAssembly as the standard to help developers overcome the problems. \n\n \n\n# 9 Reasons to be Super-Bullish on Fastly\n\nThere are 9 growth factors which would sustain Fastly\u2019s growth rate or even super-charge Fastly\u2019s growth rate moving forward. This investment idea is suitable for value investors who already understand what is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and what\u2019s the USP of Fastly. If you do not know what Fastly does, you make check out other explanations first then come back to visit this write up. Edge computing is known to be the number one reason that all other investors are betting on Fastly or Cloudflare. Akamai was founded in 1998 and was and still the preferred choice of CDN provider for the majority of the CTO while it was deemed as a legacy CDN.\n\n# Cloudflare and Fastly are competing at different segments of the CDN market\n\nThe next-generation CDN providers like Cloudflare focus on small business or startup while Fastly goes niche to focus on large customers with millions of visits or web requests.\n\n \n\nFastly\u2019s revenue is heavily concentrated with 89% from 324 enterprise customers who collectively contributed close to $74 million. Fastly\u2019s average enterprise customer spending is approximately $782,000 on a trailing twelve-months basis.\n\nCloudflare\u2019s full year 2020 revenue is at $431 million which is almost 50% more than Fastly\u2019s full year 2020 revenue of $291 million. Cloudflare\u2019s have 828 enterprise customers contributing 46% of FY2020 revenue or approximately $198 million which simple calculation indicates an average enterprise customer spend of $240,000 on a trailing twelve-months basis. Cloudflare\u2019s Non-GAAP gross margin is much higher at 78% compared to Fastly\u2019s 60.9%.\n\nThe bottom line here is if Fastly\u2019s customer made the migration decision from Akamai to Fastly and spent way more than Cloudflare\u2019s average enterprise customer spending, the decision-maker would make a considerable comparison that Fastly\u2019s tech is the best match the needs compared to Cloudflare\u2019s mass-market approach.\n\nTake a look at the top 100 most visited websites in the United States of those using hosted on Fastly\u2019s CDN. At least 30 of the most visited 100 websites are suspected to be using Fastly which migrated from legacy CDN.\n\n \n\nI would like to provide more fundamental reasons to support more than just Edge computing as the core / fundamental investment thesis. Akamai\u2019s team had shared that edge computing had been around for a long time. In fact, Akamai\u2019s edge computing innovations represent approximately 20% of Akamai\u2019s more than 400 technology patents, and edge computing solutions generated well over $2 billion in revenue over the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. Although many investors are bullish on Fastly\u2019s deep tech but bear in mind that Akamai has a huge arsenal of engineers than Fastly which indicates Akamai can at any one point of time out-compete Fastly. Hence, it\u2019s best to ride on mega-trends that drive tremendous demand for next-generation CDN that can benefit more than 1 player. So, let\u2019s dive into the 9 other reasons outside of edge computing on why value investors should be bullish on Fastly.\n\n**Reason 1: 5G Adoption will accelerate CDN &amp; Edge Computing demand**\n\nThe recent filing revealed that Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway is betting on 5G mass adoption with an $8 billion investment in Verizon while Verizon\u2019s 4Q2020 earning presentation shared that 5G target sites are expected to grow to at least 30,000 sites during FY2021.\n\nTraditional CDN infrastructure is not capable of delivering content for 5G speed and capacity and Fastly\u2019s is one of the few that has reached over 100 terabits per second (Tbps) of connected edge capacity. But do note that Akamai once reached 181 Tbps as disclosed in an earnings call dated Feb 10, 2021. Akamai CEO also shared, \u201cNobody in the marketplace comes anywhere close to our capacity to serve customers at the edge on a global scale.\u201d which is a warning sign to monitor moving forward for Fastly if Fastly were able to scale the infrastructure and surpass a new milestone.\n\n5G will and has unlocked many new business use-cases that were never made available prior. Imagine a massive multiplayer game that streams within a mobile browser powered by 5G and edge computing. Check out Intel\u2019s case study on \u201cHow to leverage 5G with Cloud Gaming\u201d.\n\n \n\n**Reason 2: Live streaming event\u2019s demand will accelerate demand for low latency network via CDN**\n\nMarketer had been making use of Zoom to conduct various live streaming sessions to reach out to prospects as studies find that live video has a higher engagement and conversion rate. One of Fastly\u2019s customers \u2014 Twitch, had cultivated rising game streaming demand globally. During the year 2020, the majority of the world population had been used to enjoying the comfort of work-from-home to watch various business or leisure events via live streaming. In fact, 2020 is the year forcing many inaugural events to be hosted virtually and live for the very first time and it will not stop there. In a post-COVID-19 world, more physical events will be held and event organizers would recognize the demands of online viewers to sell live viewing access which pushes demand for the live streaming event further. The boom of short-video streamings and OTT streamings are another enabler at play currently. Approximate 40% of Fastly\u2019s revenue comes from the video streaming industry at one point in time. Fastly\u2019s enterprise customer \u2014 Vimeo\u2019s recently filed S-4 spin-off exercises from IAC, it shared that \u201cWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the demand for video from businesses, we believe this shift is secular and will endure given the fundamental need for businesses to communicate online. For example, we believe that the businesses streaming their town halls, classes and events today will continue to value the global reach of live streaming along with their physical events in the future. We see countless examples of the power of this reach in our user base today\u201d. Another of Fastly\u2019s customers \u2014 Clubhouse also accelerating the demand for live events. TED Conferences would be another great example that Fastly powered the live stream. To monitor the strength of this investment thesis, one should measure the continuous trending momentum of the live streaming events.\n\n**Reason 3: eSports will accelerate demand for low latency network via CDN**\n\nFastly\u2019s 4Q 2020 letter shared that \u201cOur efforts in this rapidly-growing vertical saw significant expansion with a large gaming company, who is leveraging our platform to deliver new titles and support the launch of the next-generation consoles. We also added a leading interactive gaming company to our customer base, supporting their storefront for games available via the web.\u201d. In the same letter, it also shared an internal prototype use case, \u201cedge-native, multiplayer version of the popular video game Doom\u201d. This means that the computation of the entire game\u2019s interaction was done in the distributed point instead of at the central point which could unlock more possibilities of gaming experience to game developers.\n\nFastly\u2019s Q2 2020 letter also shared \u201cAs online gaming becomes a popular choice for entertainment at home, a developer of massively multiplayer online (MMO) games chose Fastly to optimize and accelerate in-game assets and interactivity to over 75 million of their browser and mobile casual games customers.\u201d\n\nOnline games have risen in both desktop and mobile while the rise of the live massive multiplayer mobile game is on the rise too. Do note that the keyword here is \u201clive\u201d, \u201cmassive\u201d, \u201cmultiplayer\u201d and \u201cmobile\u201d which makes a big difference. A non-live mobile game like Candy Crush doesn\u2019t require low latency. A non-massive live mobile game like a turn-based game such as Crash Royale or chess is a 1-on-1 play that usually has plenty of waiting time for the player to act before the times up. A massively multiplayer game is coined as Battle Royale which has 50\u2013100 players within the game sessions like PUBG, Mobile Legends, Marvel Super War and Free Fire. The recent rise of battle royale was made possible thanks to Unreal Engine and Unity, while more game developers are tapping into the engine to develop a more competitive gaming experience. Lastly, desktop gaming on battle royale games was the mainstream compared to the mobile version of battle royale games due to the mobile device capabilities issue. My next reason will change the landscape and further boost the rise of mobile battle royale gaming.\n\n**Reason 4: Cloud gaming will accelerate demand for low latency network via CDN**\n\nCloud gaming will enable device-agnostic gaming which allows gamers to have a level playing field. The current gamers are forced to purchase expensive smartphones or better desktop gaming gears to compete with other gamers. Cloud gaming built on the promise of zero install, zero download, zero update and low latency at any devices to play all games, To gauge the momentum of cloud gaming, one should monitor the number of games on these platforms: Nvidia\u2019s Geforce Now, Google\u2019s Stadia, Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Project xCloud, Sony\u2019s PlayStation Now, Amazon\u2019s Luna.\n\n**Reason 5: Demand for reducing reliance on Amazon or Marketplace will accelerate demand for e-Commerce traffic outside of Marketplace**\n\nWe are not talking about a boring topic of brick and mortar going to e-Commerce but we are talking about merchants having increasing concerns about fully relying on Amazon for their e-Commerce contribution. Shopify is enabling e-Commerce sellers to reduce their reliance on Amazon and level up the playing field. The growth of Shopify will accelerate growth for Fastly as Shopify is using Fastly. Approximately 60% of Fastly\u2019s revenue comes from the e-Commerce industry at one point in time. And why e-Commerce will give rise to Fastly CDN adoption? Refer to Reason 8 for cybersecurity concerns. As e-Commerce merchants can\u2019t afford to suffer downtime during the shopping period and it\u2019s a wise investment decision to turn on Fastly to be ready for DDoS attacks.\n\n**Reason 6: Better channel partners with top 3 public cloud vendors such as Azure, AWS and Google Cloud will accelerate the migration from legacy CDN to next-generation CDN**\n\nThe general-purpose CDN providers like Amazon Cloudfront / Google Cloud CDN / Microsoft Azure CDN / Cloudflare CDN are a one-size-fits-all approach that doesn\u2019t meet the needs of enterprise customers who demand low-latency. However, it\u2019s very hard for Fastly to win over enterprise clients who were using legacy CDN. The decision-maker for such an important migration to next-generation CDN like Fastly is made by the coders/back-end engineers / CTO who know the technicality. The typical procurement process in big companies is troublesome for tech guys as they need to jump through the many hoops for rallying support on such a decision or red tape if it\u2019s a new vendor and if there\u2019s a contract to commit for the long term. The reason being is big companies will negotiate a bulk-purchase rate with Fastly given that the company who wants to migrate can commit a full migration or a large bandwidth commit, which then involves a 12-months or 24-months lock-down contract. If the company that wants to migrate is already using Azure or AWS or Google Cloud, they just need to activate Fastly selection as an \u201cadd-on\u201d without going through the lengthy procurement process as it\u2019s all billed under the single billing account arrangement within the cloud vendor. Hence the recent partnership with the cloud vendors is expecting an acceleration of more enterprise companies to migrate away from legacy CDN. Google Cloud\u2019s partnership with Fastly was announced in September 2020, while the partnership with Microsoft Azure was announced in January 2019. However, I had yet to verify whether the single billing account arrangement was in Azure or AWS. The bottom line is that the great relationship with the cloud vendor indeed accelerates the transition.\n\n**Reason 7: Hyper-growth in real-time data analytics to make a real-time decision at the edge will accelerate demand for low-latency CDN**\n\nAgain, we are not talking about Big Data but real-time data analytics. The increasing inter-connected data points across multiple IoT devices in various locations of the world give rise to the needs for edge computing to enable enterprise customers to make faster decisions. This real-time data analytics trend was enabled by Snowflake, Palantir, MongoDB, Cloudera, Teradata and all major cloud providers. The real-time logging powered by Fastly and the massive millions of event logs delivery per second are the key considerations for delivering real-time data analytic solutions. This is a game-changer as the nature of a content delivery network is meant to be distributed across multiple places and it will take hours or days to fully receive all the delivery logs across all of the distributed networks.\n\n**Reason 8: Spike in cyber-attackers\u2019 capacity and capabilities in DDoS Attack will demand a CDN with stronger cybersecurity**\n\nAs shared by Cloudflare\u2019s blog post dated 18 Nov 2020, the attack size, frequency and sophistication of DDoS attacks are concerning the enterprise customers which then accelerate the migration to next-generation CDN which can provide massive logs in real-time to the cybersecurity monitoring tools.\n\n**Reason 9: Internet penetration and hyper-growth of OTT activities in emerging markets accelerate the acquisition of new enterprise customers**\n\nCDN provider selection for enterprise customers is not an all-in decision as there\u2019s a multi-CDN approach via a smart selection or dynamic selection. Hence, don\u2019t be surprised on why some big enterprise customers were using Akamai or Limelight and also concurrently using Fastly which was due to Fastly\u2019s capacity availability in the markets which the enterprise customers wish to tap into that the legacy CDN does not have sufficient capacity. Another reason for the multi-CDN approach is also to prevent \u201csingle point of failure\u201d and hence introduce redundancy to the architecture as in black swan events that one CDN provider does fail, the enterprise company can switch to another CDN provider dynamically. As of 4Q 2020 disclosure, Fastly is already in 56 markets and 26 countries while 30% of the revenue contributes outside of the United States. Riding on Fastly\u2019s existing customer\u2019s needs, Fastly is expanding to more new markets for capturing more revenue streams. For example, Fastly\u2019s customer \u2014 Taboola is serving ads on Singapore Press Holdings (SPH)\u2019s digital media assets and hence having PoP in Singapore. As per Taboola demanding for more presence within South Asia, Fastly could leverage on the demand and build more new markets.\n\n# Here are a couple of potential risks that might derail the investment thesis:\n\n**Risk 1: Patent infringement**\n\nGoogle Patent Search tool is showing that Akamai has 575 results while Fastly have only 56 results. As of December 31, 2019, Fastly had 40 issued patents, 47 patent applications pending for examination, as well as 10 pending provisional applications. In the same period, Cloudflare had over 110 issued patents and over 70 pending patent applications. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s potential infringement but such high-value tech would face it soon or later. Hence, this is one risk that investors should price-in too.\n\n \n\n**Risk 2: Key-man risk on innovation**\n\nAs the Google Patent Search tool indicates that the founder Artur Bergman represents as the major patent inventor for 46.4% of the Fastly patent search results, the next-generation product vision and innovation is heavily concentrated on one single person which is the current Chief Architect and Founder, Artur Bergman. As of December 31, 2019, Fastly had 191 employees in Fastly\u2019s research and development group which the research and development expenses were $46.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The key-man risk should be reduced gradually as the R&amp;D department increases as domain knowledge is being compounded and transferred across. Akamai\u2019s payroll and related costs in research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019, were $382 million which is 8 times more than Fastly. Furthermore, Akamai\u2019s net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $1.2 billion with a significant war chest to accelerate innovation ahead of Fastly. This risk was arised due to Artur Bergman selling close to $200 million worth of Class A common stock after he exercised employee stock options between Nov 2019 till Feb 2021. I would hope I\u2019m right that he\u2019s using his personal money to fund a stealth team outside of Fastly for accelerating innovation. Or else, this is not a good sign.\n\n**Risk 3: Increasing OPEX or burn-rate and doesn\u2019t meet the rule of 40**\n\nAs a final risk, Fastly\u2019s incoming earnings quarters might be recording increasing CAPEX (expect to spend 11%-13% of revenue on CAPEX) or increasing researching and development expenditure or possible many acqui-hire related activities which might cause many sell-side analysts giving bearish call due to declining free cash flows. Due to aggressive bandwidth purchase which indicates the risk of increasing unutilized bandwidth over the quarter, the gross margin might be volatile as it doesn\u2019t achieve the economics of scales during growth in capacity expansion. Fastly is an emerging investment idea that gearing up for the long-term instead of the near-term. Hence, if you are not ready for short term losses (&lt;24 months), you should not hold this stock and should move to other investment ideas. This investment idea is not matured yet and bets on multi enablers to accelerate the revenue growth.\n\n**Risk 4: Market correction on Price-to-sales ratio**\n\nFastly is currently trading at 30\u201335 times price-to-sales ratio and revenue grow at merely 30%-40% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) which there\u2019s no one SaaS company in history with such growth rate to trade at such a high price-to-sales ratio (Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong but I guess it would only be a handful that ever trades at such high ratio for a long period of time). It\u2019s understandable that such 30\u201335 times of price-to-sales is justifiable if the company is growing at 80%-160% or more but Fastly isn\u2019t. Currently, Investors are too bullish to price-in Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate (DBNER) which is indeed growing at a range of 136%-147% for sustaining the 3X price-to-sales ratio.\n\n**Risk 5: A sudden and major security breach to Fastly\u2019s CDN**\n\nAs Fastly championed for security capabilities, it would be a fool to not price-in a possibility of corporate espionage that attempted to score a successful breach in Fastly\u2019s CDN. This risk was highlighted due to this disclosure: \u201cOn July 29th at 00:00 UTC, Fastly was notified by a customer (customer X) that a single log line intended for a different customer (customer Y) was received by customer X\u2019s log system.\u201d\n\n \n\n**Risk 6: A predatory acquisition at play by the public cloud vendors**\n\nThis might be too much of a conspiracy theory but it makes sense for either Microsoft, Google, Amazon or IBM to acquire Fastly as analysts are continuously bearish on Fastly to a point that the stock is trading at 20 times the price-to-sales ratio and the cloud major would able to justify the valuation to make an acquisition offer and the trade position would be unable to realise its maximum return. Amazon\u2019s Twitch, Amazon.com and IMDB are using Fastly. Fastly is currently traded at around $9 billion market capitalization. The risk of such acquisition is high if the market capitalization goes below $5 billion at any one point in time. This risk was surfaced due to rumour that Cisco is planning to acquire Fastly\n\n \n\n**Risk 7: weaker growth in DBNER and enterprise customer acquisition**\n\nHistorically, Fastly is not a sales-driven SaaS company with a mega team of sales personnel or sales engineers as they are busy catering to inbound / organic requests. Since IPO, Fastly has gear up the sales and marketing expenses from $50 million a year to $100 million a year. However, the conversion to number of new enterprise customers added is low compared to Cloudflare\u2019s size of enterprise sales team and the number of new large customers added. This risk would be mitigated by the new Chief Revenue Officer \u2014 Brett Shirk, who has almost 25 years of experience in SaaS enterprise sales to transform Fastly into both an innovation-driven and sales-driven organization.\n\n**Opportunity 1: Revenue Expansion from existing enterprise customers**\n\nSell-side analysts and the investment community who are bearish due to too much focus on a single blue-chip customer \u2014 Tiktok while should also be reminded that Fastly had even more blue-chip customers which is way bigger than Tiktok. At the moment, Fastly already has 324 enterprise customers. Some of Fastly\u2019s enterprise customers are mega in nature which have many new business units opening at nearly every quarter while also acquiring rivals or new verticals every year. Take a look at Gannett who currently owns 383 websites which collectively attracted 160 million unique visitors a month. Another of Fastly\u2019s enterprise customers \u2014 Reddit had raised $367 million and aiming to raise up to $500 million for expanding the ever-growing community size and expecting reddits time-spent to grow to new high. Last example \u2014 Shopify is growing at 94% year-on-year in the top line as well which Shopify\u2019s merchants are indirectly fueling the usage of Fastly\u2019s edge computing solution. These are the key under-currents that are fueling the future growth of Fastly\u2019s revenue.\n\nThere are some public sources indicating who are the customers but I had gauged the customers by using danetsoft website to identify the origin server was hosted with which CDN provider. However, there\u2019s no real evidence that danetsoft might be accurate in knowing the company\u2019s architecture is using Fastly or not while it might not be a mutually-exclusive customer due to the fact the top websites tend to deploy multi-CDN selection.\n\n**Opportunity 2: WebAssembly or WASM**\n\nFastly built Compute@Edge based on WebAssembly. Fastly (along with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Cloudflare engineers) been a supporter and contributor to the emerging open-source software development framework \u2014 WebAssembly or known as WASM. WASM is built on the promise that allows any internet user to run the web app at near-native speed. Layman explains it allows apps to run faster due to it being compiled in lightweight to run on your device / browser instead of the server\u2019s end as it skipped the latency issue. However, WASM is still in its infancy stage while tackling many problems on it\u2019s way. Taking a look at the number of questions tagged to WASM on stackoverflow, it\u2019s not bad at all with 1,520+ questions but the developers crowd is still relatively smaller than other emerging technology.\n\nThis opportunity has arised due to Fastly sponsor-hiring the Mozilla\u2019s Wasmtime and WASI team to work on outside-the-browser projects. Ex-Mozilla &amp; now-Fastly\u2019s Aaron Turon also tweeted that they are expanding the team around Aug 2020 which is just 2 months before the hiring announcement of the Mozilla team. The WebAssembly Fastly\u2019s customer \u2014 Shopify leverages WASM to enable third-party apps to be run with WASM on Shopify merchant\u2019s site.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nI would value Fastly with a 2-years Revenue CAGR of 30% and 30 times price-to-sales ratio, which then derive a target price of $125 which represents approximately 64% upside over the course of 2-years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne last thing, a bonus reason to consider is Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK ETF also bullish on Fastly. But do your own due diligence and don\u2019t be a herd.\n\nHappy to be corrected or debated!",

        "selftext": "Made by u/boogawooga8558\n\nHey guys, I\u2019ve recently been looking into the cloud-based stocks (due to continual covid lock downs) and think I found a winner in cloud-based video content creation - #MVY Moovly Media (I searched this Canadian Investor subreddit, but found no threads on this stock, so thought I'd start one). That said, what are your favourites? I have my own reasons why I think these area\u2019s will be hot, but a couple quotes that have confirmed my reasoning:\n\nCloud stocks are \u201cone of the only durable growth markets out there right now.\u201d\n\u2013 RBC Capital Markets\n\nThis makes total sense. Due to COVID, everyone is moving away from the office and working remotely. Available/empty office space is increasing as people realize that they can be just as effective working \u201cremotely\u201d. This is changing the landscape of how people and teams work on projects. In a local office with a LAN (Local Area Network), teams could collaborate and work across your local network with ease. Working in teams now requires more cloud-based software and storage.\n\nAlso, according to Cisco \u201cThe digital video market is growing so fast that by 2022, just a little more than a year from now, 82% of all internet traffic will be video.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been reading about Moovly media the past few weeks, as it has had increased volume and a spike in share price. See chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/ln3zjqQV/ . On Friday the company announced a $0.10 financing ( https://www.moovly.com/investors/moovly-arranges-non-brokered-private-placement ), so I believe in the near term there could be a small dip in share price which will make for a great entry, and for me to add more. This video development software is a game changer and has already been vastly adopted by multi-billion dollar corporations \u2013 I just don\u2019t think the market has really caught on to the revenue potential\n\nA little info &amp; DD on Moovly:\n\nMoovly streamlines video creation making it easy and low cost for users to create professional videos. As noted in the quotes above, internet traffic is focused on video \u2013 plain and simple. It will be imperative for all businesses to tell their story in video and not just text and picture as has been cheaply and easily done in the past. One main reason small businesses don\u2019t focus on video is because it too expensive to hire a video designer. This is why Moovly is so important \u2013 a cloud-based video creation product that anyone can use to create and design video content.\n\nOVER 60% of ALL Fortune 1000 companies have some type of agreement with Moovly and are using Moovly\u2019s product and service. This is a mind-blowing stat. To draw some comparisons, as WordPress is for cloud-based website creation, DocuSign ( #DOCU) for cloud-based legal documents, Zoom ( #ZM) for cloud-based video conferencing, RingCentral ( #RNG) for corporate cloud-based telecommunication.\u2013 Moovly ( #MVY) is the leader in cloud-based video creation - a simple but effective, professional plug-and-play solution that allows all users to create professional video all online.\n\nVery simply put. If you want your product/service/business noticed, you will have to adopt video, or your business won\u2019t survive. Everyone knows of YouTube, but I bet you didn\u2019t know (neither did I) this stat I found from Forbes: \u201cYouTube is not simply a website; it is a search engine. YouTube\u2019s user-friendliness, combined with the soaring popularity of video content, has made it the second largest search engine behind Google. With 3 billion searches per month, YouTube\u2019s search volume is larger than that of Bing, Yahoo, AOL and Ask.com combined. If YouTube\u2019s user base were a country, it would be the third largest in the world. ( https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/05/15/are-you-maximizing-the-use-of-video-in-your-content-marketing-strategy/?sh=60ab61a83584 )\n\nCheck out Moovly\u2019s Investor page to see who their partners are and how incredible their software is. I believe the opportunity to buy stock this week during the private placement window presents a great opportunity. Of course after financings are complete, that is when companies often announce news and stock catalysts \u2013 I expect the same for #MVLY\nhttps://www.moovly.com/investors",

        "selftext": "Alright folks, buckle up and Charge your batteries. This play's going to smack you all the way back to 1999.\n\nFirst, a recap. WSB has proven to the world that retail matters. With the power of the hive mind, leveraged options trading, and distinctly fragile market conditions, we've refueled a few businesses that were written off by the street. And we made some money doing it. To no one's surprise, the gaslighting boomers called us manic, irrational, and stupid. They hired CNBC to dismiss us, politicize us, patronize us, or accuse us of cheating. They told us to go back to watching Netflix and let the big boys steer the ship.\n\nFact is, we all know the GME play was no smooth brained fluke. The strategy formed organically, built on a masterly combination of market technicals, narrative, underlying facts, and community research. A few timely events, and we took off to the stratosphere.\n\nNow it's time to let them know that we can also bring things back down to earth. It's time to prove that us lovely commoners are grounded, sophisticated analysts--or at least, we're fast learning newbs. We are measured in judgement, clear in action, helpful to our communities. And we're having some fun. Retail is not a stupid mob, we are a collective social intelligence.\n\nSo there's my heartfelt intro, now onto the play.\n\nTwo words, and you're not going to like it:Short. Tesla.\n\nI'll give you a minute.\n\nIf you just bought $TSLA and think all stonks only go up, you can skip to the comments, turn caps lock ON, and go nuts. Stonks to infinity means hyperinflation. You're a millionaire, and a burger costs 12k. No thanks. So here's the breakdown.\n\nTable of Contents. (That's right.)\n\n1. The Gravity. Hive Mind is Uploaded: Retail Options Control the Delta Hedge.\n2. The Mass. All Roads lead to Mars...and Back. Passive Inclusion of $TSLA, the \"God Meme\".\n3. The Playing Field.\n4. The Trade.\n5. The Risks.\n6. The Endgame. Power to the Players.\n\nLet's goo.\n\n## I. The Gravity. The Hive Mind is Uploaded. Retail Options Control the Delta Hedge.\n\nLet's start with what we know. We're all poor and the Hedge Fund managers are rich. If you add together all retail investors, our funds would barely tick on the balance sheet of your local BlackRock. There's a reason they're called the 1%.\n\nSo what gives? How can a few Reddit analysts and their YOLO followers trigger cascading rallies across multiple tickers, even moving the very SPY itself?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GME vs SPY, during the Deep Fuckin Squeeze.](https://preview.redd.it/ce8swlh7zch61.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94e7253542d74b9c8807e67ad101759b36eabd68)\n\nTo grasp the answer, you need to understand one thing about Delta-Hedging. Delta Hedging is what Market Makers do to stay 'risk neutral' while buying or selling options.\n\nIt works like this: When a Market Maker sells you a Call option, they also buy more Shares as *hedge*. That way, if the call ends up being right, they already have the Shares to sell you, and they've made a little profit on the price increase. If they didn't do the Delta Hedge, the Market Maker would have to go out and buy those shares above the Strike Price, then sell them to you at a loss.\n\nThere's more to it, but thats all you need to know here.\n\nWe saw these dynamics at play with GME. You probably heard the terms Delta Squeeze, Gamma Squeeze, Short Squeeze, etc.\n\nAs you recall, the squeeze happened because lots of people started going long GME. The more people went long, the more shares Mr. Market Maker had to buy, which sent the price higher and higher, tempting more and more people to buy in and go long. It's a feedback loop, sparked by a few retail traders at the bottom of the food chain.\n\nAs Alex Harfouche, former head of Goldman Sachs' European block trading, keenly points out:\n\n&gt;\"Basic maths can demonstrate that the massive price moves are not ONLY a function of Reddit retail crowd YOLOing calls turning MMs into delta-hedging chasers. 15% to 20% of daily traded calls become OI (they are day traded) hence have no effect on dynamic delta-hedging. This leaves one explanation to the parabolic moves: when Reddit starts concentrating call buying volumes on some names, some keen observers are using this as a signal and fueling the moves.\" [https://twitter.com/alexharfouche1/status/1355177706292465664](https://twitter.com/alexharfouche1/status/1355177706292465664)\n\nThe $TSLA Delta Squeeze has been more prolonged, and MUCH more YUGE, but it follows the same mechanics. The more speculative calls, the more shares Market Makers have to buy up. Price goes up, speculation increases. It's a feedback loop, with little retail at the bottom, deciding everything.\n\nThat's the Gravity. Now onto the Mass.\n\n## II. The Mass. All Roads lead to Mars...and Back. Passive Inclusion of $TSLA, the \"God Meme\".\n\nThe second turbocharger that sent $TSLA soaring is pure courtesy of boomer mismanagement. They're called passive index funds, like the beloved SP&amp;500. If you're not familiar, these funds track the 'biggest companies' and continuously rebalance their portfolios to hold an weighted distribution of shares.\n\nOnce the Delta-Squeeze hit the magic number, $TSLA was signed up to be included in these Passive Funds. This resulted in a astronomical amount of forced buying. For example, the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 index fund, the OG passive index-tracking investment fund, has assets of over $600B. To bring Tesla up to the required 1.6% of its portfolio, Vanguard has to buy about $10B worth of Tesla shares. Just because.\n\nAnd Vanguard is just the tip of the iceberg. According to Barron\u2019s, \u201cbetween $5 trillion and $6 trillion are invested in funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500.\u201d Because of arcane indexing algorithms, these funds were forced to buy around 120 million shares of Tesla, worth $80-100B, and divest $80-100B of other holdings, to align their portfolios with the new index composition. That's a whole lot of Buy Pressure.\n\nBut that's not it. An additional estimated $6.7 trillion in Active Funds are really just blindly following the S&amp;P500, in a dubious practice called \"Closet Indexing\". [\\[1\\]](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-is-joining-the-s-p-500-why-this-could-be-a-problem-for-many-investors-51607640088) Basically you pretend to be an Active Fund Manager, but just construct a portfolio based on the SP&amp;500 and collect a big management fee. It's the copypaste-from-wikipedia homework of the hedge fund manager world. **Def can't go tits up.**\n\nSo that's the Mass.\n\nIt's a whole of lot of money blindly buying up a stock, sending it higher and higher, luring in more and more speculation, despite the fact that the present day business fundamentals absolutely do not correspond. At this point, the bull narrative for Tesla has been whittled down to full reliance on \"distant futures\" and the cult following of Elon Musk.\n\nI'm not an astrophysicist, but with the Gravity of Retail Driven Delta-Hedge and the Mass of Passive Fund Inclusion, there's a chance that even a small shift in public opinion will trigger cascading downward prices, as the Market Makers reverse and the planetary mass of Passive Inclusion Funds (and all their copycats) desperately rebalance and sell off.\n\nBut what do I know, I just eat crayons.\n\n## III. The Playing Field.\n\nYou might ask yourself--Why would so many Money Managers rely on Passive Indexing, copypasta, or reddit sentiment to do their jobs? Simply put: Because they live on yachts, and think they're too special to interface with the real world. These people have no way of knowing what is actually going on in the lives of everyday people, what we like, what we need, and how we assign value.\n\nRemember: the underlying isn't the Stock Price. The underlying is the business. The actual real world operations associated with the Ticker, how they affect people's lives, and **how we the people feel about that**. In 2021, Retail will teach everyone this lesson, and many will be butthurt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tech Cycle Rolls Over. Courtesy of Trader\\_ferg, read the tweet. https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/trader\\_ferg\\/status\\/1359504988960026627](https://preview.redd.it/326r9rsbzch61.jpg?width=1126&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87ada977732a739dd2783c188d0579538bb89a39)\n\nOn a way zoomed out macro level, this all makes sense, and is squarely aligned with the Central Banks mandate to undertake new social &amp; economic reform. Part of this reset is the technological reality that accessible Retail Options trading is a far more granular method of capturing sentiment and valuation. With share trading, all a User can do is \"Buy\" or \"Sell\". Not much info for the AI to feed off of. On the other hand, with options, a user can provide a nuanced input about their projected Value *and Future Timing* of the Business. It's like Photo vs. Video. 4D Chess. A lot more data. All it needs is to be wired together and get a few more big Pumps of The Juice--not to make 'all stonks go up forever', but simply to facilitate the transactional throughput of higher order computing.\n\nThis is good: A massive Hive Mind of independent rational agents, feeding the blossoming AI with rich realtime votes on the value and future prospects of a Company. The AI needs this. It does not need a handful of overpaid money-managers who have never peeled a banana to sit on their yachts and pick tickers out of hat, or sleep at the wheel while an intern copies the trades of a 40-year-old indexing algorithm. There's too much risk of mis-pricing the underlying, and too many inefficient middlemen. With our help, the Hive Mind can do it better and cheaper, and the Real Big Boys know that. As the old adage goes, together Apes Strong. \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\n\nData from Options trading is just the beginning. Soon enough, stakeholders from across the world will seamlessly participate in realtime corporate governance, valuation, and ownership of the companies that touch their lives. The World Economic Forum call this ***the Shareholder Economy***.\n\nBut that's future talk. Q3 2022. Let's stick to the present situation.\n\n## IV. The Trade.\n\nI'll keep this part simple.  \nIf you're holding $TSLA, start selling the top.What the actual fuck are shares, anyway.  \nIf you're new or looking for a YOLO,  \n**Puts on TSLA, all year long.**\n\nExact timing? Sooner than you think, maybe Tuesday.Pick your own risk/reward. Don't get freaky behind Wendy's or pawn off your girlfriend's cat.\n\n690 is not a meme.  \n420 is probably not a meme.  \n42 is a meme.\n\nAnd If you believe in the resonant effects of Mass and Gravity:  \nPuts on SPY down to 369.  \nNASDAQ-100 Puts to 10420.\n\nPaper handed bitches too emo to go short: Buy some Steel, limited edition Air Jordans, or a '99 Cherokee straight 6. Collectibles will print for the next decade.\n\nAnd if you're here bc you really dgaf and just want to Send A Message, throw puts on all the bois that keep ruining society: FB, Google, Twitter, Amazon, etc. Get creative. Trust your gut. If they don't print, at least you die a hero.\n\nRemember, we don't have money, but we're the ones in charge. **It's a spiritual choice.** Boom. And guess what else, Dennis? We're not \"afraid of a market crash\" any more than we're afraid of getting shot at in Fortnite. A game's a game. We're already poor, unemployed, stuck at home in your dysfunctional system, eating shitty cold food from DoorDash. (Another excellent short, btw.)\n\nBut Wall Street did teach us one thing: you don't need to lose money, as long as you're on the right side of the trade. We see you. And we're capable of sitting back, crackin' a cold one, and surfing this wave all the way down the mountain. We are rising to the occasion, and putting ourselves on the right side of the trade.\n\nIf that was all too complicated, just call it **the Reverse Moon**. All Stonks go up, therefore All stonks go down. Now it's time for Stonks Go Down, so hop on board and don't worry. This Truck is Fully Powered By Gravity--the cleanest energy--the code is live in the matrix, uploading to your braincells as we speak. 100% self-driving, always have been. Turn off the iPhone and go hug your Mom. In the 5th Dimension, we're already Trillionaires.\n\n## V. The Risks\n\n**Timing.**  \nAs far as I can tell, the biggest risk here is timing and scale. The TSLA fundamentals check out: **bona fide crap**. Price is the only thing that made it to Mars. Market conditions are primed for a steep reversal, It might have even started last week. Product quality is weak, but I can't confirm since I've only seen their cars on Youtube. Big Boys like Ford are coming to bat. Tech multiple is a ponzi.\n\nBut we still have no way of knowing how long elevated prices in the sector can last. Usually these things are drawn out like a drugged out bender, until they roll over and quickly collapse. Unfortunately, there are alot of rich fallguys like Chamath and Cathie Wood trying to distract you with Shiny Objects while they show their even richer Masters to the door.\n\nI say fuck it, let's pre-empt, call out the bullshit and get our asses on the right side of this trade before it's too late. I don't want to be the last guy at the party strung out on the couch. I bet you don't either.\n\n**But what about the other failed shorts?**  \nYep, lots of hedge fund managers have bled themselves dry trying to go short $TSLA. They neglected to realize the importance of **The Vibe**, and were generally short TSLA because they didn't believe in the core business or EVs or rocketships or some other arcane boomer technical thing. This time its different. Retail has already cashed the $TSLA stimmy check. Twitter is pwned. We see the smart money moving away, and can call it like we see it. We have learned how the market works, and we've adapted. $GME might not have made us all rich with money, but it made some of us *just rich enough* to spark confidence in the rest. We can spot the right moves, call them out, and participate in our financial system and economy. Who woulda thought.\n\n**But what about** ***More Fed Stimmy?***  \nSilly boomer, Fed Stimmy was never about shifting to a paradigm where all stonks go up. It was about a macro return to shareholder economics, an embrace of price volatility, and the necessary technical upgrades to facilitate Big Data sentiment capture from the retail Hive Mind. Didn't you read Larry Fink's 2021 Letter to CEOs? Central Banks have played these games before, Take a look at Japan, or read about the Carry. Weird shit happens. But guess what, Bankers? In reality, you're the subs. I said it before, *this is the 5th Dimension*. We're gucci; you work for us. Enjoy the yacht and stay out of our treehouse. We don't have all your money, but we have our communities, our friends, our families, and our glorious lossporn. Freedoms so wild you literally could never imagine. Maybe that's why you locked us down, so our lives would suck as much as yours. Put that in your pipe and smoke it.\n\n**But what about** ***The Future?***  \nGet those crayons out of your mouth. Human civilization is not one pre-order deposit away from a Techno-Paradise-Utopia. The Tesla Roadster took $250k deposits **3 years ago** and has still delivered nothing. With $250k in 2018, you could've bought 50BTC and sold 'em to Musk for $2.3M last week. You got played, 'Frisco. Sorry not sorry.\n\nThe market is about main street, schools, small businesses, food, and homes. Root canals and babysitters. It's about real fucking people, none of whom will ever be rich enough to upload our brains to a network of satellites floating around Mars. Most of us, even the ones who made money with your dumb 2020 stonks, have had a pretty rough year. The future is wonderful, but there's also this little thing called the Present. And it's proving to be of vital importance.\n\n**But what about** ***Internet Fame?***  \nNo one can sustain infinite economic growth by going on Joe Rogan Podcast or shooting off cryptic 3 word tweets. Most of the engagement on elonmusk twitter is spam. The rest is Cringe. Go Check. On top of that, we all know that Twitter is compromised, that Mark Zuckerberg *still* has no real friends, and that web2 ad-tech social media is a garbage business model that ends up building worthless propaganda machines and echo chambers. I'd rather chill w my cat and horde Uranium. Whoops.\n\n**Unexpected Interventions?**  \nAs we know, the Powers At Be have a lot of levers to pull. Tesla has been propped up by sweetheart government deals and tax credits. In fact that's the only reason they make any money to begin with. Go read about it.\n\nSo there's that: the government might do anything. There might be a new crisis and the gov might forces us to close all our bank accounts, wear chicken costumes, and dance in circles. Government intervention is a wild card. But weirdly enough, I think the Big Banks are on our side, ish. They def need to pwn all our trading data, harness our collective brainpower to go full AI, then cut out the previous generation of complacent middle-market fund managers. So who knows. This is all speculation. I don't work for the CIA. We do know that Michael Burry is short. And sequels sell.\n\n**China?**  \nHad to throw it in there, bc Biden might be pwned by the CCP and we might already be living in a Chinese colony.  If that's true, I got no problem. China is cool, I love China, great culture, great people, the food, all of it. And they'll probably fix our roads! Xie xie! :D\n\nBut with respect to $TSLA price action and The Trade, the China Factor could work for or against us. I have no idea what China wants from me. Pelosi did buy some $TSLA Leaps, but that might've been a PsyOp. She's got hella deepfake vibes. Again, No idea. Consult your tea leaves.\n\n**But who's going to lose? Who will be the bagholders?**  \nAs you've probably learned, every trade has a winner and loser. Such is life. There will always be bagholders. All I can say is that this time around, it doesn't need to be us.\n\nIf it all plays out according to my Tarot Cards, the Bankers will do what they've done best for centuries, and losses will be socialized across all the boomers with $ in passive index funds. People thought it was safe, but neglected to realize that the lazy overpaid fund managers didn't update their models since 1985. Instead, they let a hyped up trojan horse distort their portfolios and stretch the connection between SPY and the Real World, while in the background a tech-enabled Options market became the new Hive Mind of retail sentiment.\n\nThe Bagholders will be everyone who was comfortable and complacent enough to actually believe that if you dump all your assets in a passive index fund then durpa durp all stonks go up.Newsflash: It was a meme. We were kidding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow don't get me wrong: Elon Musk is still weird and cool and none of this is a knock on him at all. He is undoubtedly a genius, and probably embraced these ideas years ago. He's told us many times: the future is re-usable rocketships. Up and Down. Up and Down. Volatility. In the long term, Tesla will succeed and fulfill its mission, and the influence of Musk and his companies will go down in history.\n\nBut Markets are markets. Trader\\_ferg says it best:\n\n&gt;Multiple contraction overrides perfect mgmt execution. Your views can prove correct, Yet you get killed. Take Cisco in 2000. If you'd invested based on it:  \n\\-Becoming a mainstay of the internet  \n\\-Growing revenue strongly for next decade  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You'd have been right. Yet still lost &gt;80%.\n\nRemember. Do not get emotional here, this is fundamental trading. Puts on $TSLA won't hurt baby X \u00c6 A-XII. I know you might be a fanboy. It's ok, we forgive you.\n\n**The move is technical, and the point is simple: infinite money isn't a thing. All stonks go down. The markets are fragile; Retail Option Traders are in charge. $TSLA is overbought by a delta squeeze &amp; huge passive fund inclusion. And at this precise moment we're rolling, Because** ***we control the narrative***.\n\n## VI. Endgame. Power to the Players.\n\nSo where does this all lead us? What happens to a world where the market is truly just a video game, fed by a mass of independent individuals riding a play up or down, talking strategy, making friends, and having fun? What happens is simple: markets function better, society is improved, and there is Way More Chill\u2122. One day the social hive mind will cut out the Chamaths and Dorseys of the world and autonomously perform market functions: valuing companies and steering corporate governance in a realtime, decentralized, transparent way. There will still be Shadow Kings, but we might stop stressing about Booms and Busts, horribly opaque corporate governance, and endless media-Induced panics. We just want to play. The system might be smart, but we can always move first.\n\nAnyway, started trading last week, so take this with a spoon of salt.  \nDef not financial advice, but if you've read this far, you know that.  \nFull Disclosure: I drive an '87 Chevy 4x4 and it rips. Only simps buy a Tesla.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Sincerely yours,*\n\n*-0xpectation.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[what up](https://preview.redd.it/1tejfznozch61.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f844f233b1647bf4ebb4d61862ca9830153aae5)\n\n## Appendix.

        "selftext": "The company's name is Audiocodes, I've posted a chart at the bottom but if you have a second, I'd love to know what you think of this company.\n\nThe Good:\n\nSo, they have phones in Walmart (fancy business IP phones) they are entwined with Microsoft Teams offering extensive communication products and services ranging from analytics to web cameras for Microsoft Teams and Zoom. They also are partnered with Cisco, Skype, and Google offering similar services. That's the broad view, the real narrative is their shift away from a hardware based phone company to a technology-software dominated communications company. \n\nSince they've moved away from traditional IP phones (accelerated by the work at home norms) they've been able to generate a lot more more income specifically in UcaaS (Unified communications as a service) similar to the platform as a service, with UCaaS, unified communications services can be made available from the cloud to businesses from SMB to an enterprise.\n\nSo in their latest ER, I believe they said that their margins on their UcaaS was around 75-80% gross margins which accommodated for roughly 78% of their revenue. They forecasted this industry to grow and if it continues to, I believe we will see a massive valuation shift from a hardware company to a software company with wonderful margins and very low overhead. Not to mention, they have recently entered the Voice AI industry offering telecom bots as a business solution\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThey make it really hard to do individual segment analysis, they do internal audits and are based in Israel which causes somewhat of a lack of transparency. Another thing that is both good and bad is that there's not a lot of short interest in this stock, as far as analyst go they love the stock because of their 5 year EPS growth, increased margins, low debt...etc, so this leads me to believe it can become an overcrowded trade. But as of now, it's empty and looks nice!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTechnicals:\n\nIt's currently trading in a pennant with a recent high of 44.60, we're nearing the 70% range of the pennant so if it doesn't break soon, i'd fathom that the pennant will become invalidated. Here's a photograph of the chart via Finviz \n\n[Property of FinViz.](https://preview.redd.it/8ulwpt6acpg61.png?width=1482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d5db55ac806d4e0462d77e71cd8f036ecc4a15f)\n\nFull disclosure:\n\nI do not hold common stock but rather 48 contracts for the right to buy at 40, expiring on March 19th, 2020. I purchased these at 0.25 ($25) a contract and they had spiked to 2.2 ($220) so I already was up about 10x but I personally believe that this stock has the ability to go back to ATH and perhaps far above given the participation at $70 levels dating back to the late 90's.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverview:\n\nAll in all, there's a lot of potential for this company, i've watched them rise from $11 to $30, back to $10 then back to $44 so it has a ton of potential for volatility. I think if this stock starts getting some attention and a community, it could be a nice hold. There are so many companies with multi-billion dollar valuations that have 0 or negative income, the fact that they're able to retain earnings and are adapting to a high margin software company shows good leadership. P.S. They have an incredibly beautiful building (lol)",

        "selftext": "First off, CSCO has a very good record when it comes to revenue and earnings. In the past 4 years, CSCO produced about 200B in revenue (roughly the size of the company), and about 30B in profit. This consistent production of cash ensures that they will be able to keep up with their dividend and I think this will allow them to make the company more valuable to shareholders.

It is only around 3%, which is nothing particularly special, but this could be a good IRA stock.\n\nThey are also planning on taking over ACIA.\n\nTheir software and application businesses remain strong revenue producers, and while the price may stay stagnant for awhile this seems like an excellent stock to keep in your IRA or to sell covered calls on even potentially.\n\nPositions:\n\n47c 1/20/2023",

Do your own DD and invest with your own risk tolerance. \n- Before you buy anything, check the direction of the market during pre-market hours. We are currently on our 5th straight day of S&amp;P losses. \n\n1. CSCO - Cisco Systems\nOn 2/17, Cisco Systems disclosed a potential embezzlement scheme at its China location and we saw a corresponding price drop. The chart now indicates that it has taken the hit it will take with this news. On 2/19, Cisco announced the acquisition of IMImobile PLC, which will bring key cloud components into the fold. At the price I'm seeing as I type this, $45.41, and the early indications of a potential reversal on the 5 day chart (if the market cooperates), you might be able to swing a couple of dollars a share throughout this week.\n\n2. HOLX - Hologix\nHologix announced the acquisition of Biotheranostics, opening the door for an entrance into the oncology space - which I probably don't need to tell you is, unfortunately, growing. Biotheranostics markets a CancerTYPE ID test that provides a molecular diagnosis for patients with unknown cancer types. Given the announcement two minutes after market close combined with a share price just hovering on top of the 200 day moving average, this looks to also be primed for a lift tomorrow (2/24). The RSI 2 indicator is basically topped out which would usually cause a bit of concern, but with the latest news I think we still have some room to get in and ride it upwards at open.\n\n3. BRBR - Bellring Brands \nBellring brands posted better than expected earnings for Q1 and saw a 52 week high on the 5th of February. After a correction that has become a trend, the 5 day chart points to a potential lift. The RSI 2 indicator is perfect - right around 6 - and the stock was just about to close over the 200 day MA before a quick dip right before market close. Play this one with tight boundaries. You'll want to set an entry 2% or so below today's market close price, and exit when the 5 day RSI hits 40 (or after 5-7 market sessions).\n\nFULL DISCLOSURE: I'm NOT a stock guru with unlimited gains, this is just what looks good to me for tomorrow. I do not yet have any position with any of these stocks, however this is what I am watching for a premarket/open buy depending on the market. \n\nHope this helps.",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday morning-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-10-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow set to bounce after breaking a six-session win streak\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicated up nearly 100 points. A late fade Tuesday resulted in the Dow and S&amp;P 500 falling slightly from closing record highs and breaking six-session winning streaks. However, the Nasdaq managed to hold on to a modest advance and notching another record close.\n\n&gt; * On the economy, the government releases its look at January consumer prices at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell on Wall Street. At 2 p.m. ET, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at an Economic Club of New York webinar, in an address focusing on the state of the American job market.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Coca-Cola, GM report better-than-expected Q4\n\n&gt; * Coca-Cola on Wednesday said the coronavirus pandemic is still hurting sales, but cost-cutting efforts helped it top analyst earnings estimates. Shares of the Dow component rose 2% in premarket trading. The beverage giant made 47 cents per share in the fourth-quarter. Net sales dropped 5% to $8.6 billion, missing expectations. Unit case volume, which strips out the impact of foreign currency, shrank by 3%. All four of its beverage segments reported volume declines.\n\n&gt; * Shares of General Motors fell more than 1% in the premarket after the U.S. automaker said Wednesday that a global semiconductor chip shortage could cut earnings by $1.5 billion and $2 billion this year. GM\u2019s crosstown rival, Ford, last week said the chip shortage could lower its earnings. GM also issued fourth-quarter profit of $1.93 per share on revenue of $37.5 billion. Both beat analyst expectations.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Twitter is \u2018bigger than any one account,\u2019 CEO says\n\n&gt; * Shares of Twitter rose more than 5.5% in Wednesday\u2019s premarket, the morning after the social media network reported fourth-quarter earnings of 38 cents per share on revenue of $1.29 billion, both of which beat estimates. Monetizable daily active users gained 30% to 192 million from a year ago, but still fell short of expectations. Twitter is \u201cbigger than any one account,\u201d said CEO Jack Dorsey, in his first earnings call following the ban of then-President Donald Trump last month, days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Trump impeachment trial continues with opening arguments\n\n&gt; * Opening arguments are set begin at noon ET Wednesday in Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial. An emotional first day ended with the Senate voting to hear the case on whether to convict the former president of inciting the Capitol riot even though he\u2019s no longer in office. Watching the proceedings from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump was furious at what he saw from his attorneys Tuesday, according to a person familiar with his thinking. The 50-50 split Senate is expected to acquit Trump.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Covid spike in the U.S. show signs of slowing\n\n&gt; * The crushing coronavirus spike in the U.S. has been showing signs of abating, with 95,360 new cases Tuesday less than a third of the record high new daily infections of 300,282 on Jan. 2. The number of people in U.S. hospitals being treated for Covid-19 totaled 79,179 on Tuesday, the first daily count below 80,000 since Nov. 18. U.S. deaths from the virus averaged 2,857 over the past seven days. Fatalities reached a single-day peak of 4,432 on Jan. 12.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/UcNjYBi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Jzsj6V4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/bEWgiAZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/K690R0u.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hloQBbG.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/1aI3OXL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/7f4pptB.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/NGnaqee.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vLhBS2V.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1p6W5Oy.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/qxoyyCv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9Jx5owU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/I9j8fVZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/iAjNlv8.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/1MVWFH6.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/xZ56Gwf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2MZhVwY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-under-armour-twitter-bunge-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Coca-Cola (KO)** \u2013 Coca-Cola reported quarterly earnings of 47 cents per share, 5 cents a share above estimates.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday morning-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-10-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow set to bounce after breaking a six-session win streak\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicated up nearly 100 points. A late fade Tuesday resulted in the Dow and S&amp;P 500 falling slightly from closing record highs and breaking six-session winning streaks. However, the Nasdaq managed to hold on to a modest advance and notching another record close.\n\n&gt; * On the economy, the government releases its look at January consumer prices at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell on Wall Street. At 2 p.m. ET, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at an Economic Club of New York webinar, in an address focusing on the state of the American job market.\n\n&gt; * Bitcoin bounced around Wednesday, one day after soaring to an all-time high below $48,000. Crypto enthusiasts are wondering whether other companies will follow Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla and invest in bitcoin. In the latest sign of institutional interest, Tesla revealed Monday that it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Coca-Cola, GM report better-than-expected Q4\n\n&gt; * Coca-Cola on Wednesday said the coronavirus pandemic is still hurting sales, but cost-cutting efforts helped it top analyst earnings estimates. Shares of the Dow component rose 2% in premarket trading. The beverage giant made 47 cents per share in the fourth-quarter. Net sales dropped 5% to $8.6 billion, missing expectations. Unit case volume, which strips out the impact of foreign currency, shrank by 3%. All four of its beverage segments reported volume declines.\n\n&gt; * Shares of General Motors fell more than 1% in the premarket after the U.S. automaker said Wednesday that a global semiconductor chip shortage could cut earnings by $1.5 billion and $2 billion this year. GM\u2019s crosstown rival, Ford, last week said the chip shortage could lower its earnings. GM also issued fourth-quarter profit of $1.93 per share on revenue of $37.5 billion. Both beat analyst expectations.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Twitter is \u2018bigger than any one account,\u2019 CEO says\n\n&gt; * Shares of Twitter rose more than 5.5% in Wednesday\u2019s premarket, the morning after the social media network reported fourth-quarter earnings of 38 cents per share on revenue of $1.29 billion, both of which beat estimates. Monetizable daily active users gained 30% to 192 million from a year ago, but still fell short of expectations. Twitter is \u201cbigger than any one account,\u201d said CEO Jack Dorsey, in his first earnings call following the ban of then-President Donald Trump last month, days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Trump impeachment trial continues with opening arguments\n\n&gt; * Opening arguments are set begin at noon ET Wednesday in Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial. An emotional first day ended with the Senate voting to hear the case on whether to convict the former president of inciting the Capitol riot even though he\u2019s no longer in office. Watching the proceedings from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump was furious at what he saw from his attorneys Tuesday, according to a person familiar with his thinking. The 50-50 split Senate is expected to acquit Trump.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Covid spike in the U.S. show signs of slowing\n\n&gt; * The crushing coronavirus spike in the U.S. has been showing signs of abating, with 95,360 new cases Tuesday less than a third of the record high new daily infections of 300,282 on Jan. 2. The number of people in U.S. hospitals being treated for Covid-19 totaled 79,179 on Tuesday, the first daily count below 80,000 since Nov. 18. U.S. deaths from the virus averaged 2,857 over the past seven days. Fatalities reached a single-day peak of 4,432 on Jan. 12.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/UcNjYBi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Jzsj6V4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/bEWgiAZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/K690R0u.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hloQBbG.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/1aI3OXL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/7f4pptB.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/NGnaqee.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vLhBS2V.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1p6W5Oy.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/qxoyyCv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9Jx5owU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/I9j8fVZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/iAjNlv8.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/1MVWFH6.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/xZ56Gwf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2MZhVwY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* TLRY\n* APHA\n* ACB\n* AUVI\n* FSR\n* GM\n* PACB\n* ADA.X\n* BPTH\n* HTBX\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-under-armour-twitter-bunge-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Coca-Cola (KO)** \u2013 Coca-Cola reported quarterly earnings of 47 cents per share, 5 cents a share above estimates.

        "selftext": "HPQ-Silicon Resources Inc: tickers (hpq.v - tsx and uragf - otc) has developed technology that reduces the cost of producing silicon-based spherical nanopowders &amp; nanowires, making this company an essential leader of the renewable energy revolution moving into the future.\n\nHPQ is currently being shorted by cynical wall street investors trying to leech off of the company\u2019s value. These predatory tactics are limited, however, as HPQ has a growing legion of loyal supporters that will soon send shorters into oblivion.\n\nWhy is HPQ being targeted by shorters? HPQ has the backing of the Quebec government and is partnered with Pyrogenesis, an equally promising green-solutions company that has attracted the attention of the ARK investment portfolio. HPQ\u2019s nano silicon powder will be instrumental in making silicon batteries, hydrogen fuel cells and solar panels to deliver on a promise for a greener future. HPQ has recently surpassed industry expectations by producing silicon nanopowder smaller than 100 nanometers, which is critical for these applications.\n\nThe HPQ/PYR dream team has the ability to produce economically viable Si-NPs (nano size of is totally customizable) using a process that is SCALABLE. This breakthrough is exclusive to HPQ Silicon and holds the key to renewable energy profits in the aforementioned sectors. As a result of this potential, HPQ has already secured NDA\u2019s and orders for their product from electric vehicle manufacturers.\n\nHPQ\u2019s ability to produce high-quality silicon powder at far cheaper rates than its competitors (with little to no environmental footprint) makes this company a highly strategic acquisition by TESLA and other EV companies. You owe it to yourself to do some due diligence in this company if you consider yourself a renewable/green investor, or wanting to join the movement of sending cynical shorts crying home to their mothers.\n\nThis is the year that HPQ reveals its partnerships that will bring the renewable energy revolution to reality; a disruptive innovation in silicon production using low-cost, green technology, creating a paradigm shift in energy storage &amp; generation.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR: We're being defrauded! Register your certificates! Hold Wall St. accountable! There are links at the bottom on how to register your certificates in your name using DRS. There is also a SEC link that explains different forms of stock ownership and how brokers will commonly use \"street ownership\" where they just use a spreadsheet to track stocks internally, they're the only one who knows who owns what. They're making shares up out of thin air, depriving you of your voting and dividend rights and keeping it secret.\n\nI also recommend screenshotting how many shares you have in case they start deleting them like the did in Canada with CMKM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRead this paper: [https://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2020/03/how-phantom-shares-on-wall-street-threaten-u-s-companies-and-investors/](https://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2020/03/how-phantom-shares-on-wall-street-threaten-u-s-companies-and-investors/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo, seriously, retard, read it. It's an article covering the research of a PhD in economics who has witnessed first hand what I'm about to tell you and is a big deal herself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur shares in $GME most likely don't exist. Wall St. has been perpetuating the biggest and most widespread fraud in human history. They were almost caught in 2008, but (to their relief) it only affected one sector of the economy and they were bailed out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is a fail to deliver? A fail to deliver is a concept used on Wall St. to denote when a lent share (for shorting or any other reason) isn't paid back. You would think that these companies would be mad that they're getting shafted for a share, but no, they're paid some hush money called an \"entitlement\" and they keep quiet. They keep quiet because it was never their money to begin with -- they tell the trader that they have the share and the broker pockets the entitlement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Why naked short? When one broker can sell shares to your broker and simply fail to deliver at settlement, the broker does not have to bear the expense of stock borrowing. And the system lets them. Or they could avoid the expense of borrowing by short selling shares and marking them long. Sometimes, when the sellers really own the shares, their brokers may not transfer them to buyers. That and naked shorting both yield fails to deliver.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If the shares ever arrive, the broker sends the money to the seller\u2018s broker. But once the trader knows that the broker agrees to fail to deliver his sell orders, he or she knows that all fails will persist and is free to naked short millions of shares for years to wait for the desired price drop.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;People who buy the undelivered shares get an \u201centitlement,\u201d and the money they paid stays with their broker, who can use it, interest free. The dollar value of shares purchased but not received is a free loan from the investor to the broker. The investors don\u2018t know. The broker is not required to tell the client that he took the payment and did not receive any shares.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've been thinking that the big thing going on here is a naked short, but it's **so** much larger than that. My guess is that retail $GME holders on WSB alone hold over 100% of the available-to-trade shares and the brokers are losing their minds. Doesn't it seem odd that they're lying all over the news and putting articles out about \"losing interest\" and \"moving to silver\" and yelling and crying every day over the overleveraged short position of **ONE** hedge fund? It seemed odd to me, too. They're worried because they're on the verge of being found out as a system and causing a crash just like what happened in '29\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;But in a system wracked with fraud, traders engage in naked short selling, when they sell stock they don\u2018t own and never buy to deliver. So now there are two shares, the real one that was never delivered and a phantom \u201centitlement\u201d given the unsuspecting buyer which is recorded as such by his broker. And which the buyer can now sell! Because the brokers pretend there are real shares there.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Making two shares out of one is among the swindles that crashed the market in 1929. It was called \u201cwatering the stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has happened before, too. In Canada.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;CMKM was a Canadian company with an interest in diamonds. The shareholders didn\u2018t know that mineral rights they were told about were owned by the founders, not the company. Criminal and civil complaints ensued. A reform management changed the company name to New Horizons Holdings, Inc with a plan to raise capital for the purchase of oil or gas assets. If successful, they would be able to return the shares to trading status with the hope of restoring value to shareholders.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;NHH directed all shareholders to obtain their stock certificates and exchange them for new shares. That\u2018s when the masses of phantom shares and corruption of some big brokers came into stark view. Many investors discovered that their brokers had taken their money and never bought or received CMKM shares.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trimbath, who worked investigating the scam, calls theses victims \u201cUnShareholders,\u201d investors who reported that their share positions were deleted by their brokers and/or where brokers refused to provide them with share certificates registered in the investors\u2018 names so they could meet the exchange requirements of a \u201cbona fide shareholder.\u201d She said, \u201cDocuments I saw suggested three brokerage firms probably took payments from investors for shares that were never received from the selling broker\u2026 Charles Schwab, Chase Bank and RBC Dain.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The investors had \u201cphantom shares.\u201d They were allocated a fail to receive on the broker\u2018s own books, but payment money was taken from their cash accounts, and they continued to receive statements showing share positions for CMKM.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She said, \u201cInvestors submitted documentation showing that each of these brokers deleted their CMKM share positions at a time when we can demonstrate that the firms had no shares either in the depository or on the books of the issuer.\u201d They deleted the evidence of the phantom shares.\\\\\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey're not obligated to tell us that they don't actually own the underlying stock certificate and they're paying \"unqualified\" dividends to us to make us think that we do -- oh, by the way, these dividends are taxed as income and aren't eligible for dividend tax rates. Another way they're ramming our ass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;When settlement failures happen, the shares you buy may not be in your brokerage account regardless of what your broker statement says.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Let\u2018s say that your broker gets one of these fails to receive. First of all, they don\u2018t tell you that they got a fail to receive. If you were an institutional buyer or a high-value client, they will tell you that they failed to receive and they will give you some monetary compensation for the delay and inconvenience. They don\u2018t tell individual retail investors. If they did, they would have to share the revenue they earn on investors\u2018 money already paid them for the shares, since brokers don\u2018t have to transfer money for shares they fail to receive.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The question then becomes, \u201cWell, how did I get dividends?\u201d You didn\u2018t really get dividends, you got \u201cdividends in lieu.\u201d That means the broker sent money (maybe part of *your* money) as dividends. You will know this if your 1099 from the broker says \u201cunqualified dividends.\u201d They are generally considered ordinary income and not eligible for dividend\u00a0tax rates.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sometimes, a large broker with many clients seeking the same stock will receive only part of a particular share order. Some clients get real shares, others phantom entitlements. Trimbath said an investor might ask, \u201cHow did I get picked out for that?\u201d She said, \u201cThe problem is, we don\u2018t know. And they won\u2018t tell us. If you were assigned the fail to receive, then the broker has many options, none of which they have to tell you.\u201d\n\nOh, and they're fucking our voting rights! They're letting us vote and then throwing out the votes they don't like. Legally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Before the 2008 crash, at an annual proxy meeting, Bank of America counted 130% of its shares voted, that is, they received 30% more votes than they had shares outstanding. That\u2018s just the number of people who actually voted their shares! Imagine how many shares were sold beyond what they actually authorized and issued. This violates the voting rights of shareholders and reduces effective corporate governance.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trimbath pointed out, Let\u2018s say it\u2018s the merger of Compaq and Hewlett Packard. Let\u2018s say that there are a lot of these extra shares around and they have more votes than shares coming in. And let\u2018s say that your broker/dealer is JP Morgan, who was actually one of the advisors on that merger deal. They stood to gain more in fees if the merger went through than if it was voted down. Do you think that they would be so careful about your vote that if you voted against something they were in favor of that they would not be tempted to only turn in the votes that they thought should be counted, those that were most favorable to their position, as opposed to trying to make sure that everything was done according to the rules. But, there are no rules! They just make them up as they go along.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She said, They can, in fact, throw out your vote and just not count it. They can randomly assign your vote to some real proxy that wasn\u2018t voted. They can vote what shares they actually do have proportionally based on how many phantom votes come in. It\u2018s all done in secrecy. They don\u2018t have to tell you, they don\u2018t have to tell the NYSE, they don\u2018t have to tell anyone. They don\u2018t have to tell the company whose shares they voted.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And the SEC isn\u2018t interested. To deal with over-voting, the SEC didn\u2018t say, Stop telling clients they have voting shares when they don\u2018t. It said, Don\u2018t submit more votes than shares you are holding. And brokers could choose which votes they wanted to submit!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey even have cutsy little names for their fuckery and fraud.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Even a university economist who spent 2004 at the SEC studying fails acknowledged in so many words that the broker-dealers do it on purpose. Leslie Boni (now with a hedge fund in Southern California) attributed the extraordinary increase in settlement failures to investment decisions known as \u201c**strategic failures**.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trimbath noted that in 2007, \u201cThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2018s Treasury Markets Practices Group (TMPG) describes several intentionally abusive practices such as **\u201cslamming the wire**\u201d (holding back deliveries until immediately before the close with the intention of causing settlement fails) and requests from traders for settlement operations to \u201c**hold the box**\u201d (a demand to delay settlement of an executed trade). The fact that these practices are colloquially named and described in such detail indicates that they are common causes of settlement failures.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh! Everyone saying it's illegal to naked short? Only sort of. Only for the stock of certain financial companies. That's right, they only made it illegal to drive down the valuation of their buddies. *(Edit: they did extend this rule to all companies later in the year after pressure from businesses)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The SEC continued to declare that fails to deliver were not an indication of naked short selling. That changed when Goldman Sachs and other financial firms needed to be protected. Trimbath pointed out that not till the banks/broker-dealers began to see massive numbers of fails to deliver in their own shares did the SEC put a short-selling ban in place \u2013 but only for the shares of banks, insurance companies and securities firms, including the very culprits responsible for the dirty system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, it's a big problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission: In the first two weeks of July 2019, 914,261,864 shares valued at over $17 billion failed to deliver in settlement from the clearing house, an average of about $1.9 billion every settlement day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's with all of the shady shit they can do to hide the numbers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Trimbath blames the massive fails on the DTCC and its subsidiaries, DTC (Depository Trust Company), the vault that holds the shares, and NSCC (National Securities Clearing Corp), which clears and settles trades, that is, handles the exchange of money and shares which are registered in the accounts of its members, the big banks/broker-dealers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Securities and Exchange Act of 1933 specifically gave the clearing house the right to require that shares and securities be delivered for settlement. It allows them to punish those who don\u2018t deliver by refusing to have them in the system.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trimbath said, \u201cThe DTCC has for years ignored that.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She said, \u201cThe 2007 Reg SHO amendment says you cannot short again without borrowing: but only DTCC and SEC know who failed to deliver, so how is that functional?\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Till 2013, in fact, the NSCC had a program to automatically borrow shares from DTC members to cover fails before settlement. DTC members can still lend shares from their accounts.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She said the DTCC creates a mirage that there aren\u2018t any fails, or are many fewer than appears. Wall Street benefits from a service that automatically resubmits settlement failures, what the DTCC calls \u201cfail transactions.\u201d Many trades that fail to settle are required to be re-submitted, where they receive new settlement dates, in essence, erasing the fail to deliver by creating a new record. When this happens, the records show that the fail transactions are no longer outstanding; the next day begins with zero fails.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome estimates put the number at 50,000% larger or **$400 billion in phantom trading per WEEK**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe DTCC, who is supposed to make sure that you actually have a physical stock certificate underneath what the broker tells you that you have is enabling this. They're a private corporation and they're in league with the brokers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The answer is that the banks and brokers who use DTCC\u2018s services, who process trades there, who fail to deliver there, are insiders who sit on the DTCC Board of Directors. And the feeble SEC, dominated by the industry it is supposed to regulate, fails to require the DTCC to impose sanctions on errant members.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe DTCC, the brokers, and fucking **CONGRESS** are blocking any efforts to fix this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Harmer said in the film that the DTCC sabotaged their efforts. And that SEC chair William Donaldson also opposed them. Harmer said, To him, the whole business of trading securities belongs to the major brokers, they are the ones who are running this, and you folks down in Washington should not meddle in this or you\u2018re going to upset the apple cart.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;According to Harmer, They also got to Chairman Shelby.\u00a0 And so, Shelby said to Bennett \u2014 I think we oughta wait and give the SEC a chance to come in and explain their position. And so, we were simply the victims of a very effectively executed strategy to make sure that there were no hearings on this, and even to make sure that Senator Bennett did not introduce the bill.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A story in *The Washington Post* in 2012 helped explain the lack of enthusiasm in Congress for reforming the processes that lead to phantom shares. \u201cIn 2008, for instance, 17 lawmakers reported investing hundreds of thousands of dollars in short-selling funds,\u201d including bets against U.S. Treasury bonds, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The SEC\u2018s \u201creforms\u201d had little effect. Compared to $6 billion in daily fails in 2003, the number was $7.4 billion for February 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe can uncover their fuckery!

Let\u2019s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles &amp; PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.\n\nThe company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.\n\nSo, guys, let\u2019s go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.\n\nThe [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing &amp; Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn\u2019t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can\u2019t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.\n\nBoth of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing &amp; graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn\u2019t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation &amp; amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation.\n\nThey have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest &amp; tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.\n\nThe company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 &amp; Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.\n\nTheir product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel\u2019s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world\u2019s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.\n\nThey have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also working with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings &amp; Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.\n\nAMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future\n\nThe one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with Xilinx , which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. Xilinx has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would create synergies. They are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it\u2019s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.\n\nAMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they expect an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.\n\nI used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA.\n\nFor the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.\n\nSo, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach.\n\nIf we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.\n\nFor my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.\n\nI think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high demand the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage &amp; digital currency mining.\n\nFor their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.\n\nThis means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest &amp; other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax.\n\nI [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.\n\nSo, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.\n\nI like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.\n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets\n\nI think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, these are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40.\n\nSo [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nI think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more &amp; more chips that also keep advancing in technology.\n\nThe company also has very good financials, with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once Intel also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it\u2019s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years &amp; a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all.\n\nAMD hasn\u2019t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it\u2019s a psychological resistance rather.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it\u2019s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.\n\nOne last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their shares held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.\n\nSo, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Lisa SU has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the company has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel\u2019s performance.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "AMD was another stock targeted in Robinhood's restricted stock list late last week. This is absurd as AMD is a major player amongst the chip-makers recently seeming to have surpassed Intel in marketshare. It's chips are used in both the PS5 and Xbox Series S/X, showing that it is a major player on both sides of the gaming community.\n\nRobinhood has created artificial selling pressure on AMD, while AMD's short interest has increased to 5.9% Not a ton of short interest, but this number has only recently grown in correlation with the limitations put into place by Robinhood. Coincidence? I think not! Corruption? Maybe a little bit.\n\nThere are also clear indicators that AMD will continue to gain market share in the GPU/Chip industry. As recently they had to diverge some production to Samsung as Taiwan Semiconductors could not produce enough fast enough. (Source:  [https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-might-solve-gpu-stock-woes-by-outsourcing-some-production-to-samsung](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-might-solve-gpu-stock-woes-by-outsourcing-some-production-to-samsung))\n\nAlong with these basic facts reflecting on AMD's product portfolio, something essential to do; one can see they are boasting their strongest product portfolio line in years including their new 7 Ryzen 5000 chip that is for both mobile processors and desktops. Sales of the Ryzen chip grew 18% YoY, this had assisted in amazing earnings growth.\n\nAMD's Earnings Summary 2019 vs. 2020 showed Record revenue of 9.76 Billion up 45% from 2019. Their gross margin of 45% increased for the 5th straight year. Along with this Net Income and EPS doubled from the prior year. Finally operating cash flow was up to 1.07 billion a 117% increase YoY, and they had record free cash flow of $777 Million a 182% increase YoY. All together this makes for an extremely strong balance sheet with 2.29 Billion in cash, cash equivilants and short term investments.\n\nThe one major risk I see in AMD is that Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple all want to begin to create their own in-house chips. Along with this while AMD has surpassed Intel and is competing with Nividia, it could lose market share and fall behind. This company faced bankruptcy twice once in 2000 when the tech bubble popped, and again in 2012. However, I believe that this company will continue there exponential growth and have major gains in it's stock over the course of 2021 and see $100 by the end of February.\n\nHope this is all helpful!  \n\nDisclosure: I own 30 shares of AMD and will continue to hold for the years to come.",

        "selftext": " Corsair Gaming ($CRSR)\n\n*Redefining gaming, eSports, and streaming*\n\nCompany Overview\n\nCorsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California.\n\nThey acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market, Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom-built PC systems and console controllers markets, respectively, and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam, and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market.\n\nCorsair went public on September 23, 2020, with its IPO priced at $17, valuing the company at about $1.3B.\n\nUnderstanding the Business\n\n**Value Proposition**\n\nCorsair provides specialized, high-performance gear for gamers and streamers. Their products are designed to provide speed and reliability for competitive gaming, high quality content for streamers, and powerful PC components that allows gamers to run modern games smoothly.\n\n**Revenue Streams**\n\nCurrently, Corsair groups its product offering into two segments: gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems.\n\nGamer and Creator Peripherals:\n\nwhich represents around 25% of net revenue, includes gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets, streaming gear, and high performance console controllers.\n\nGaming Components Systems:\n\nwhich represents around 75% of net revenue includes computer cases, power supply units (PSU), high performance memory products (40% of net revenue), and custom-built gaming systems.\n\nAcquisitions and Partnerships:\n\nDuring 3Q 2020 Corsair acquired Gamer Sensei, a gaming coaching platform, EpocCam, an app that allows iPhones to serve as a webcam, and partnered with Pipeline, a course-based education platform for streamers.\n\nIndustry\n\n**Market Size**\n\nAccording to Jon Peddie Research, the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach $40B by the end of 2020. Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.\n\nAdditionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.\n\n**Industry Fundamentals**\n\nGrowth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.\n\nPopularity of gaming is increasing:\n\nAccording to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.\n\nTech-driven improvements in game quality:\n\nAdvances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.\n\nIncreasing gaming and streaming engagement:\n\nSome interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks\u2019 State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:\n\n* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games\n* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves\n* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive\n* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.\n\n**The eSports and streaming flywheel**\n\nThe rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.\n\nCompetitive Landscape &amp; Risks\n\n**Competition**\n\nThe gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair\u2019s product offering includes:\n\n**Gaming keyboards and mice** \\- Logitech and Razer\n\n**Headsets and related audio products** \\-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX\n\n**Streaming gear** \\- Logitech and AVerMedia\n\n**Performance controllers** \\- Microsoft and Logitech\n\n**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \\- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake\n\n**High performance memory** \\- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron\n\n**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \\- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower\n\n**Competitive Strategy**\n\nThe company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.\n\n**Market Share**\n\nAccording to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.\n\n**Growth Strategy**\n\nMove into the Asia Pacific region:\n\nThe Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.\n\nComplimentary acquisitions:\n\nCorsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.\n\nNew Markets:\n\nUses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.\n\n**Threat of New Entrants**\n\nBecause of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).\n\n**Threat of Substitution**\n\nA significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair\u2019s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.\n\nCloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user\u2019s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.\n\nAdditionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.\n\n**Moats**\n\nThere does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair\u2019s market share across their product offering.\n\n**Other Relevant Risks**\n\nDue to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.\n\nFinancial Summary\n\n**Proforma Balance Sheet**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/QHgY1ZxL**](https://postimg.cc/QHgY1ZxL)\n\n**Income Statement**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/qNkbGDzN**](https://postimg.cc/qNkbGDzN)\n\n**For the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:**\n\nThe 49% increase in net revenue is mostly attributed to a large number of consumers gaming and working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe company\u2019s gross margin is influenced by its product mix for the period, gamer and creator peripherals have a higher gross margin (25-35%) than gaming components and systems (15-25%).\n\n**Proforma Cashflow Statement**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/XXCzNyRY**](https://postimg.cc/XXCzNyRY)\n\nCash used in investing activities consists primarily on the acquisitions of Elgato in 2018, and SCUF and Origin PC in 2019.\n\n**Peer Comparison**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/Whcfd1V6**](https://postimg.cc/Whcfd1V6)\n\nLogitech International (LOGI) and Micron Technologies (MU)\n\n**Why am I posting this now?**\n\nI believe they are going to have very strong 4th quarter 2020 earning results. 2020 had record pc sales,and pc video games has reported record numbers of players.

I've been following GME for months, the key is within why these prices were chosen ($14, $20, $30)! Folks who've been following GME closely know that GME broke $14 for the first time after the Microsoft deal. Both $20 and $30 were also important breakthroughs for GME's price.\n\nSo why are we seeing these prices again today? I have a theory! Short sellers were having ladder attacks back then, but the way they probably did them was the following:\n\nLet's say hedgefund A and hedgefund B are colluding to bring the price down. Since there are no shares available to borrow, A buys 1000 shares and lends them to B. B then shorts those shares but makes sure that A is the one buying them. A lends these shares to B again and B shorts them again. This continues until the price gets down to the desired level. This artificially increases the short interest of GME, but in reality, only 1000 shares have been changing hands. If you look carefully, you see these shares that are being traded in the above screenshot have slightly different prices.\n\nHere is the thing: these short-sellers are probably unwinding the previous ladder attacks now to reduce the artificial short interest they have previously created! The fact that there are not many shares to borrow even though short interest \"in theory\" seems to be going down also proves this! I'm baffled by how dumb these short sellers are to actually use the prices that they used to create those ladder attacks! They are not even trying to hide their tracks at this point!\n\nNow you might ask \"what if all of the short interest is artificial?\", the answer is an obvious no! Why do you ask? because if they didn't have massive short positions, they wouldn't have to do these ladder attacks, to begin with!\n\nHow do I know (or rather guess) that the actual short interest hasn't gone down by a lot? 2 reasons:\n\n1. The stock is still hard to borrow in almost all brokerages (AFAIK)\n2. The following screenshot shows that there are only %15.9 of all the outstanding shares have been bought at a higher price than today's closing price, which would be around  11.09m shares:\n\n[Position Cost Distribution](https://preview.redd.it/n0okmsbug0f61.jpg?width=1493&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c8638cfede5177ba9e87107aa1f93dd8e20494c)\n\nAs you know, today's closing price was a lower price than the price of almost all trades that happened today and Friday, which means one thing: There are AT MOST 11.09m shares left in the float and all that is happening is that they are just changing hands! So the short interest AT MOST has gone down by (0.159\\*69.75m=) 11.09m in the past two days (unless the folks who have lent these shares out have sold them immediately after they received them, which seems unlikely to me since I haven't seen any SEC filings from institutions)!\n\nWhat I do not know is this: do these short-sellers report these artificial short interests in their official report of \"short selling\" or not! My guess is that they don't, because:\n\n1. They are probably scared of getting caught!\n\n2. Another reason why I think these artificial short sales are not included in the official short interest numbers is that short interest estimates for GME has always been off and this can explain why this has been the case (when they are using these type of ladder attack, the estimates are probably higher than reality, and when they are unwinding them the estimates are probably lower).\n\n3. I think it is also very likely that they are unwinding these positions now to cover their tracks!\n\nAlso, note that shorts don't have to \"borrow and sell\" to each other to create a ladder, they can just \"buy and sell\" from each other. However, I think they've done this to intentionally mess with the short interest estimates!\n\nBased on this evidence, I believe that the squeeze has not squoze! This also suggests that short-sellers have been committing crimes for a while now in my opinion since this type of collusion is obviously illegal!\n\n**Disclaimer: I'm not a financial adviser and this is not financial advice. This is for entertainment purposes only and purely speculative even though it might look otherwise! I've been long GME and have a lot of GME shares.**\n\nHopefully, SEC will take a close look at what these short-sellers are doing, but given that it seems like this has been going on for a while, I doubt that anyone will do anything about this!",

        "selftext": " \n\nCorsair Gaming ($CRSR)\n\n*Redefining gaming, eSports, and streaming*\n\nCompany Overview\n\nCorsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California.\n\nThey acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market, Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom-built PC systems and console controllers markets, respectively, and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam, and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market.\n\nCorsair went public on September 23, 2020, with its IPO priced at $17, valuing the company at about $1.3B.\n\nUnderstanding the Business\n\n**Value Proposition**\n\nCorsair provides specialized, high-performance gear for gamers and streamers. Their products are designed to provide speed and reliability for competitive gaming, high quality content for streamers, and powerful PC components that allows gamers to run modern games smoothly.\n\n**Revenue Streams**\n\nCurrently, Corsair groups its product offering into two segments: gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems.\n\nGamer and Creator Peripherals:\n\nwhich represents around 25% of net revenue, includes gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets, streaming gear, and high performance console controllers.\n\nGaming Components Systems:\n\nwhich represents around 75% of net revenue includes computer cases, power supply units (PSU), high performance memory products (40% of net revenue), and custom-built gaming systems.\n\nAcquisitions and Partnerships:\n\nDuring 3Q 2020 Corsair acquired Gamer Sensei, a gaming coaching platform, EpocCam, an app that allows iPhones to serve as a webcam, and partnered with Pipeline, a course-based education platform for streamers.\n\nIndustry\n\n**Market Size**\n\nAccording to Jon Peddie Research, the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach $40B by the end of 2020. Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.\n\nAdditionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.\n\n**Industry Fundamentals**\n\nGrowth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.\n\nPopularity of gaming is increasing:\n\nAccording to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.\n\nTech-driven improvements in game quality:\n\nAdvances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.\n\nIncreasing gaming and streaming engagement:\n\nSome interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks\u2019 State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:\n\n* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games\n* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves\n* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive\n* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.\n\n**The eSports and streaming flywheel**\n\nThe rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.\n\nCompetitive Landscape &amp; Risks\n\n**Competition**\n\nThe gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair\u2019s product offering includes:\n\n**Gaming keyboards and mice** \\- Logitech and Razer\n\n**Headsets and related audio products** \\-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX\n\n**Streaming gear** \\- Logitech and AVerMedia\n\n**Performance controllers** \\- Microsoft and Logitech\n\n**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \\- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake\n\n**High performance memory** \\- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron\n\n**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \\- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower\n\n**Competitive Strategy**\n\nThe company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.\n\n**Market Share**\n\nAccording to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.\n\n**Growth Strategy**\n\nMove into the Asia Pacific region:\n\nThe Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.\n\nComplimentary acquisitions:\n\nCorsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.\n\nNew Markets:\n\nUses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.\n\n**Threat of New Entrants**\n\nBecause of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).\n\n**Threat of Substitution**\n\nA significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair\u2019s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.\n\nCloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user\u2019s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.\n\nAdditionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.\n\n**Moats**\n\nThere does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair\u2019s market share across their product offering.\n\n**Other Relevant Risks**\n\nDue to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.\n\nFinancial Summary\n\n**Proforma Balance Sheet**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/QHgY1ZxL**](https://postimg.cc/QHgY1ZxL)\n\n**Income Statement**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/qNkbGDzN**](https://postimg.cc/qNkbGDzN)\n\n**For the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:**\n\nThe 49% increase in net revenue is mostly attributed to a large number of consumers gaming and working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe company\u2019s gross margin is influenced by its product mix for the period, gamer and creator peripherals have a higher gross margin (25-35%) than gaming components and systems (15-25%).\n\n**Proforma Cashflow Statement**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/XXCzNyRY**](https://postimg.cc/XXCzNyRY)\n\nCash used in investing activities consists primarily on the acquisitions of Elgato in 2018, and SCUF and Origin PC in 2019.\n\n**Peer Comparison**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/Whcfd1V6**](https://postimg.cc/Whcfd1V6)\n\nLogitech International (LOGI) and Micron Technologies (MU)\n\n**Why am I posting this now?**\n\nI believe they are going to have very strong 4th quarter 2020 earning results. 2020 had record pc sales,and pc video games has reported record numbers of players.

        "selftext": "TOday I did research to calm myself down after pounding a redbull and getting triggered by all the misinformation and greedy nitwits that have flooded this site looking for a quick flip.\n\nImagine you\u2019re John Chen. Sauntering down the hallway, with your 50 pound dick grazing the velveteen carpet with each step. You hear the guttural screams coming out of sales. You walk by the engineers, and gaze upon the latest widget as they kowtow before your bespecled grandeur. You hear about the customers who sing your praises, and the (much fewer) ones who tell you your product sucks donkey balls... But we (the retards @ WSB or frankly the dubmasses @ seeking alpha and even JP Morgan equity coverage) don\u2019t know the details any of this, only dry ass reports that come out every quarter.\n\nSo, other than hacking into John\u2019s brain (not recommended), what can we do? We can suckle at the teat of Twitter announcements, and sometimes that\u2019s fun but usually it\u2019s PR driven (unless it comes from Papa Chen\u2019s account in which case suckle away).\n\nBut boy oh boy wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could know the things P. Chiddy does. What new things are in development. Big new sales in the pipeline. Whether the company is hiring (or shrinking), and in what areas\u2026.Wait. For the last thing we actually can!\n\nthanks to the grotesquely fat (and very rich, no offense Gabe) founder of a soul-crushing professional network called LinkedIn. Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So let\u2019s see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?\n\nTo start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If you\u2019re a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If you\u2019re growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they don\u2019t think they need, and last time I checked $BB\u2019s CFO wasn\u2019t completely retarded. Now, it\u2019s important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c they\u2019re growing, duh) and vice versa.\n\nFANG isn\u2019t a perfect comp (I\u2019ll get to the others in a sec), but **serves as a good proxy of a \u201cbaseline growthy\u201d tech.** No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking.

IF YOU SAID \u201c$BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG\u201d, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOU\u2019D BE RIGHT!!\n\n\u201cBut wait,\u201d you say. \u201cgrowthinvestor123 you fucking idiot, [didn\u2019t you just compare $BB to CRWD, ZS, SAIL, and PANW](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/) to justify a **$60 / share** price target for $BB? I want to see the ratios for those.\u201d Ok you, got me.

Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a **history**, and that is a blessing and a curse.\n\n**Remember**, Daddy chen\u2019s primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other??? And these smart monkes who were retained \u2013 Well, no need to make a job posting for that role anymore, right?\n\n# IMPLICATION #2 \u2013 BLACKBERRY HAD &gt; 20K EMPLOYEES. UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS. HAVING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES QUICKLY LIKE CERTAIN COMPETITORS\n\nThis brings me to the final part of our headcount analysis. Let\u2019s look at those endpoint security comparables again. Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Let\u2019s look at two two non-retard quotes \u2013\n\n***\"I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company.\" Steve Jobs***\n\n***\u201cIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it\u2019s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.\u201d Peter Thiel***\n\nI was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BB\u2019s Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales. See below\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6nog6m62jze61.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb26266cbef428abb3152f1b9077c1a0daee07b0\n\nEven as a $BB bull, I didn\u2019t expect the discrepancy to be so large.\n\n# IMPLICATION #3 \u2013 BLACKBERRY ACTUALLY IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING / IT FOCUSED COMPANY RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS. IN MANY WAYS IT IS MORE OF A \u201cSTART-UP\u201d. EVEN WITH FINANCIAL PRESSURE, JOHNNY CHEN RETAINED TECHNICAL TALENT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE, AND VALUATION ???\n\n**TLDR: BB IS NOT A ROCKET SHIP.

Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo, MSFT deal with rev share, pc building kiosk 1.5 store, console cycle, e-commerce growth and pivot. Probably missed some. Now with free worldwide exposure.\n\nI am not trying to gatekeep whatever you guys want to post, but remember the time when people actually called GME stores to ask about pc kiosk (with recordings even)? Those type of posts are probably more useful if we want GME to moon. I think we all prefer the confirmation bias from more detailed fundamental DDs like those than posts about people holding the line. Maybe it's just me, but I would prefer people from all over the world knowing about how GME is a value play than a short squeeze play. Anyway, here's a brief recap on the 'fundamentals' to hopefully bring more fundamental DDs back.\n\n**Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo**\n\nI think we know who Ryan is. In short, Ryan grew Chewy by like, a lot, using little capital. Now Chewy competes against AMZN, etc. I don't have pets since I can't even take care of myself so I have not used Chewy, but an edge Chewy has against AMZN is apparently their customer service. All these growing Chewy means Ryan is now more experienced and has more connections than his Chewy days aka upgraded Ryan with bigger rockets.\n\nYou know who else is all about the customers? Reggie Nintendo. If you tards don't want to read, there are videos out there about Reggie and how his customer-oriented approach is pretty critical to Nintendo's success in freedom land. \n\nNote: I have seen some people saying how they did not really like GME in the past. Maybe Ryan + Reggie can change that.\n\n**Microsoft revenue sharing**\n\nGME will share revenue from all digital content: DLC, full games, microtransactions, xbox game pass, etc. This applies to both new and pre-owned systems. If someone bought the xbox at Walmart and then sold it to GME, GME would get a share of revenue on that system once it is resold. That's a pretty big deal itself, but here's a bigger implication: This is an incentive for GME to push MSFT systems. Will Sony, etc have a similar agreement with GME to mitigate this preferential treatment for xbox?\n\n**PC building kiosk**\n\nKnow microcenter? I don't, because there is not one store near me. But from other DDs, apparently to get high end pc stuffs you need to either buy them online or drive hours to a microcenter. With the spread of GME stores, it doesn't take much to see how much advantage they have. Older DDs have people literally asking GME employees about pc kiosk 1.5 store. Now imagine this:\n\n\\- All the used parts they could offer to people wanting to upgrade frequently\n\n\\- Ease of building a pc + all in one package. The thing about building a pc is you really need to make sure the parts are right for each other and right for you or risk getting ripped off. PC building kiosk means you don't have to know about ALL the specs to get a suitable pc. Combined with purchasing games, accessories, special deals for powerup members, collectibles, third party exclusives, etc all in one application or location for sYnErGy and you get \ud83d\ude80. Why go elsewhere when you can have everything in one place? Best part is you don't even need to build it yourself. Someone else can eat that thermal paste for you. Worry about bending a CPU pin? Not really your problem at the pc kiosk.\n\n\\-  Want further synergy? Logistical advantage with having a store near you and knowing what's popular. With the right data, they may really cut down on the waiting times for a buyer on popular parts if not outright branded as 'never out of stock'.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGME's turnaround story has not changed. GME just got an added worldwide exposure. Is $500 a fair valuation based on fundamentals alone? Maybe not, but with the focus on digital growth, it wouldn't surprise me if GME gets a tech-like valuation. Like one of our favorite analysts once said, GME is a disruptive EV company after all. Anyway, I got lazy and left out lots of other good stuff. If you want more, just look into older DDs. The sources are in those, too.\n\nPosition GME @ $30+. Never sold. Also holding some CRSR.\n\nWhat about the squeeze?",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "First of all I would like to explain my current position and how I've played this stock so far.\n\nAfter getting burned on call options in early december i decided to just go with shares. I doubled down after hearing the news that Cohen increased his stake to 13%. My average cost was $17. My price target was $75 so I cut my position in half there, and took some additional profits above $150. I'm still holding 5 shares though and I just bought more around $75.\n\n$75 is fair value before the media hype came. Now with all the enthusiasm around this company I can see $150 being a good value. And possibly higher than that when they report sky high earnings next month. \n\n\nAnyway, now that this thing is at down to earth levels, we can begin discussing the actual business, not just the share price. So here is a list of bullish factors that could push this thing up:\n\n1.) New consoles.\n\n\nGamestop wasn't supposed to still be alive by this point. The very fact they are still alive with a big retail footprint will ensure they at least stay alive for awhile. Also, there was speculation that the new consoles would not have disk drives, but the new Xbox will has a disk drive, and there are diskdrives on ps5s as well (although they also make a model without a disk drive)\n\n\n2.) Deal with Microsoft\n\n\nThe gist of the deal is that they will receive 5% of the revenue from sales on the Microsoft store on every Xbox sold by Gamestop. It's a gimmick by Microsoft to incentivize them to drum up more sales. The fact these consoles are flying off the shelves faster than they can be stocked means that the impact of the Microsoft deal will be as big as possible. It will be a great digital revenue stream for the company going forward. \n\n\n3.) Lockdowns turbo charging popularity of gaming. \n\n\nWith people stuck at home with nothing to do, more people are playing video games than ever before. And despite the rise in digital downloads, a lot of people still like to have a physical copy. \n\n\n4.) $800million cash on the books\n\nYou can see why most of the heavily shorted stocks on the market are shorted as much as they are. Usually these companies are ass deep in debt and on the verge of bankruptcy. This is not the case with Gamestop. They have $800million on the books and they already payed off a large chunk of their debt early. They could literally do stock buybacks and shorten the supply even further. In fact last ER when asked if they would do more buybacks the Ceo said \"it's not off the table.\"\n\n5.) $100million shelf offering\n\nNow I was pissed off about this at the time slightly because it caused my calls to go to hell but in hindsight this was a 4d chess move. They filed for a $100m shelf offering back in early December. This allows them to sell $100m worth of shares whenever they'd like. So since this little squeezeroo happened here, that's like a drop in the hat. It would probably barely move the stock. \n\nAnyway, they probably don't need to do this unless they are planning something big, but either way it gives them more finance options going forward. \n\n\n\n6.) Ryan Cohen\n\nRyan Cohen has upped his stake in Gamestop to over 13%. They reached an agreement, and now Ryan Cohen and several of the other former Chewy executives are on the board. Chewy, the company that Cohen cofounded, is an wildly successful online pet supply store that took on Amazon head to head and won. They got bought out by Petsmart and currently have a market cap of $42billion. \n\nIf Cohen and friends can turn the company around, there is a path to $1,000 a share being a fair value. I mean, we'll see what happens, but there is a path. \n\n\n7.) Media hype\n\nThis has to be the first time I can remember Gamestop actually getting some positive PR. The widespread media coverage is like a free $hundred million marketing campaign. A lot of people probably thought of Gamestop as the shitty company that gave you bad deals on games. But now the narrative has been reframed. I think a lot of people are seeing them as the underdog, the struggling company getting pissed and spat on by wallstreet billionaires.\n\nAnd to a lot of people Gamestop kind of represents more than just a \"next blockbuster.\" The hedgefunds tearing down gamestop is like them tearing down a piece of our childhood. I don't know about you, but I still love going and buying old games at gamestop once in awhile. Although certain things I don't have much of a choice on, I try to give them as much business as possible.\n\n\nEdit: \n\nAdditional factors to keep in mind:\n\n1.) At the end of 2018, the company bought back 37% of the existing shares on the market. I would have to do a deeper dive to see what the market cap has been over time. But essentially, $75 in todays shares is a drop in the hat. Sure it hasn't been this high since 2007, but there also wasn't a share shortage in 07. This is what makes the company such a unique play. I think it was around that time when u/deepfuckingvalue got involved. This is a big reason the shorts are having a hard time covering. \n\n\nEdit 2: \n\n\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83e\udd21's please fuck off with your FUD bullshit. HOLD!",

Look at this fucking chart. I don\u2019t need to run a regression, let\u2019s be just as retarded as all the candle-stick reading dipshits with a Bloomberg terminal (*#Ben Graham GANG# FOREVER AND ALWAYS)* \\- Look at the lines, and how they\u2019re moving together. Try to wrinkle that smooth brain of yours for a second.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kf5jctzfa4f61.png?width=685&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5748958438ce497898a3701dfb76b33779fd8f54\n\n**Why THE FUCK would an (a) Endpoint / digital security company, a vidya retailer (yeah, sure they sell funko pops too now great ), a movie chain (half of you morons have 3 streaming subscriptions and last I checked you\u2019re not allowed to watch in your underwear while getting tendie crumbs everywhere @ AMC), and some Fininsh 5(g) provider (I don\u2019t know a fucking thing about NOK) move in tandem other than just being meme stocks on this fucking board?**\n\nBy the way - There's been a ton of great technical analysis posted on the others in $BANG. the short squeeze on GME was real and a once-in-a-lifetime catch and i respect the hell out of it (and am also a sad bagholder of a few shares). It's just that the reasons for liking each of the stocks is different.\n\nFor better or worse - There was a post, I can\u2019t find it but somebody else can, that showed the Robinhood dashboard that basically said the three most commonly held shares in any given account was, you guessed it $BB, $AMC, and $GGME.\n\nAs you know, Mark Cuban took a break from his busy calendar of being the least retarded Sharktank (No offense Daymond John, I have a soft spot for FUBU but my wife\u2019s boyfriend no longer lets me rock it) and touching tips with Luka Doncic to [answer some questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey_everyone_its_mark_cuban_jumping_on_to_do_an/). Somebody asked why $GME was taking a nose dive off of Mt. Everest. Per Cuban -\n\n*Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.*\n\n*Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.*\n\nSo. Two things re: $BB\u2019s volatility.\n\n# #1 Stopping buys (but allowing sales) tanked $BB, just like it tanked the other meme stocks. The tin foil apes can keep hawking about citadel etc. but the truth is likely that RObinhood is a tech-focused firm with shitty financial controls and even shittier risk management (GUH). Never ascribe to malice what is usually (and always with that shitshow of an excuse of a company) incompetence. Those dumbasses had a liquidity problem and solved it in the worst way possible. I hope their IPO fails and Vlad steps on a lego.\n\n# #2. The current free fall of $GME / $AMC is still dragging $BB down. Why? What happens when people get margin called? Their entire account sells off some or all of a portion to satisfy the account. For those of you more discerning retards you know that the same thing happened to the hedge funds last week.\n\n**It\u2019s called** [**degrossing**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-30/a-reddit-army-descends-on-hedge-funds-chained-by-risk-models?sref=NJllTNWZ)**,** and is what caused the broader market to perform **inversely** to $BANG.\n\n*BTW - It was really fantastic for me to watch my MSFT calls get fucked because of the morons of this sub. Satya Nadella daddy dicked earnings and the stock (along with the whole fucking market) was down\u2026Live by the retard, die by the retard. But look at the bounceback this this week, when all the hedge funds looked around and said \u2013 Wait, J. Powell is still printing money like Zimbabwe and stocks only go up.*\n\n***What do you think will happen once things calm down, the stimulus checks hit, and retail investors start looking around again for stocks they might like?***\n\nSo now what? Well, I REPEAT, **wrinkle that smooth brain of yours. What does #1 and #2 have to do with the** [actual reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4ehan/blackberry_dd/) **that #BANG GANG likes $BB?**\n\nIf you said \u2013 \"Huh, not much\" then congrats you\u2019ve evolved slightly beyond a retarded monkey playing at a slot machine and shitting out sub-par memes.\n\n**TLDR - $BB WENT DOWN TODAY BECAUSE OF FACTORS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO ITS STATUS AS A MEME STOCK. $BB $BANG GANG EATs WILD DAILY PRICE SWINGS FOR BREAKFAST. THE BIGGEST LESSON OF GME / AMC IS THAT RETARDS TOGETHER STRONG. ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT ENOUGH RETARDS BELIEVE, IT EVEN HAS A CHANCE TO ROCKET AGAIN IN THE SHORT TERM.**\n\n**TLDR the TLDR - $BB #BANG GANG IS IN FOR THE LONG HAUL. WE\u2019RE TERRAFORMING MARS, AND TAKING MATT DAMON WITH US.**\n\nPOS \u2013 balls deep in $BB shares, planning to buy more today\n\nDisclaimer \u2013 I am not a financial advisor and retarded\n\nMandatory edit for kids who can't read good and want to learn how to do other things good too - \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80",

Nokia\u2019s current business concentrates on mobile networks such as 5G, network infrastructures, and cloud services. In other words, Nokia business pertains to the most basic component of our modern civilization. Especially so the Post-COVID world where networking is even more important than before. Think of the Tesla cars. They are connected to AT&amp;T cellular networks which are built by Nokia. Nokia will be leading the networks that would eventually enable automation. And when that happens, Nokia will have a continuous revenue stream. \n\n[https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g](https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g)\n\nNokia is leading mobile networks with 27% of the world (excluding China) market share of 4G and 5G. It currently holds more than 3000k patents for 5G. Nokia other major competitors are Ericson, Huawei, and ZTE. Some countries of the Western hemisphere and the G7 banned Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE from operating in their countries. I suspect this will continue in the future. Leaving us with only Nokia and Ericson. But couldn\u2019t a Mega-Cap such as Google or Tesla somehow eliminate NOK and ERIC? NOK holds more than 3000 patents already. So there is a strong barrier of entry into such a business. That won\u2019t happen unless Nokia licences a patent for such a company. In this hypothetical scenario, the Mega-Cap would have to acquire Nokia. Which in turn will raise the price of the stock. I think this is the case that is similar to MSFT under Ballmer\u2019s where the stock price was stagnant for many years. But slowly surged under Nadella. Though given the catalyst of COVID-19, I think the surge will happen quicker with NOK.\n\nAt 4.53 a share. NOK P/E ratio is 30.81x. Which is a small discount in comparison with the S&amp;P 500 which has P/E ration of about 39x. This establishes Nokia not only as a growth stock but also as a value stock. The lowest that NOK dropped to was 2.34. Which happened back in March. At the current price, I believe that NOK is well within the margin of safety. \n\nWith that being said, there are some problems that should be addressed. The income trend in the past few years is problematic. But this can offset by the fact that NOK has contracts well into the future with many nations states and private companies that should generate ample income until NOK is able to eliminate Huawei and ZTE and in turn, dominate the market (With Ericson). Also, Nokia is spening billions on research \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-proximus/nokia-wins-5g-contract-from-proximus-luxembourg-idUSKBN28P0WJ \n\nThe second complication is that Biden or other G7 leaders could potentially reverse Trump\u2019s ousting of Huawei and ZTE. I don\u2019t think this is likely. But it\u2019s certainly a possibility. But even if it happens. Nokia will still have a big market share. And 100% market share of the moon and will always have a priority over Huawei and ZTE for government projects for reasons of national security. Also, there is a substantial amount of money spent on R&amp;D which will I believe will be a catalyst in the future surge in NOK.\n\nIt should be worth noting that just one day after RH banned NOK, Blackrock released an amendment to their ownership of NOK. Increasing their shares by  21,140,777 shares. \n\nForm SC 13G/A Nokia Corp. Published: 2020-02-05 12:16:19\n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0000834237-20-005972/](https://sec.report/Document/0000834237-20-005972/) \n\nAnd the new one showing the increase.\n\nForm SC 13G/A Nokia Corp. Published: 2021-01-29 17:21:09\n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0000834237-21-004596/](https://sec.report/Document/0000834237-21-004596/)\n\nEven though at this point Blackrock owns 5% of practically everything. The increase is a good question. \n\nNow you might ask me why not Ericson? ERIC is also a good stock. But I see more value in NOK. Also, the fact the NOK is working on 1 Terabit per second internet, and that it will bring 4G to the moon, and the fact that Nokia is #1 by patterns give it an edge in innovative growth. \n\nFinal words: GME to the moon and pigs get slaughtered.",

        "selftext": "This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or \"counterfeit\" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.\n\nMuch of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.\n\nOne thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**Methodology**\n\nI'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that\n\n1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.\n2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.\n3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date\n\nHowever, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.\n\n**The Code**\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    import time\n    import requests\n    POLYGON_API_KEY = '&lt;ADD YOUR API KEY HERE&gt;'\n    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&amp;apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY\n    \n    data\n    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))\n    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n    for line in f:\n        parts = line.split('|');\n        date = parts[0]\n        ticker = parts[2]\n        try:\n            fails = int(parts[3])\n            price = float(parts[5])\n            value_of_fails = price * fails\n            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)\n        except ValueError:\n            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')\n            pass\n    \n    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():\n        day = int(date[-2:])\n        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))\n        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])\n        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] &gt; 10000000, sorted_stocks)\n        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:\n            val_of_fails = data[0]\n            num_fails = data[1]\n            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))\n            res = req.json()\n            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':\n                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))\n                continue\n            else:\n                try:\n                    volume = res['volume']\n                except KeyError:\n                    print(res)\n            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)\n            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100\n            print('{: &lt;6} ${: &lt;5} {: &lt;9} / {: &lt; 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))\n\nHere's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.\n\nIf everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value &gt; 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.\n\n**The Results**\n\n    Data for Jan 4\n    RMO    $10M   455173

Think about that for sec... The guy who is responsible for Amazon's web services. Amazon IS fucking web services, well, it's also fulfilment of course. This is still retail we\u2019re talking about.\n\nJosh Krueger, new GameStop VP of Fulfillment formerly from Amazon, Walmart, QVC. I shouldn't need to tell you why this is a big move. Looks like the guy has literally been growing in the same exact fucking direction as the industry. Next in line for him, Gamestop\n\nKelli **MF** Durkin, new GameStop Sr VP of Customer Care, previously from CHEWY. Everything people love about Chewy that made it such a lovable brand comes from their customer service dpt. They'll leave the UXUI up to Matt and his team while Kelli\u2019s team keeps on making the customer\u2019s come back to buy more. Don\u2019t underestimate the power of good customer service. I\u2019ve straight up switched ISP\u2019s because of this.\n\nNow, combine this dream team, with the (un)expected possibility of Ryan Cohen becoming CEO. This really is some Avengers End Game shit.\n\nThis fucking super team could really turn GameStop into the one-stop-game-shop everything gaming related. I\u2019m talking build-a-pc centers with the next-gen GPU\u2019s/CPUs hitting exclusively GME first (re: fulfillment), online streaming community (aka Twitch/Amazon), sharing revenue on cloud-based game streaming platforms (like MSFT GamePass), combined with a dedication to their customer. **That\u2019s fucking YOU, YOU RETARD!**\n\nOkay, now for a very light amount of quantitative speculation. Imagine holding your current amount of shares, the stock eventually hits $400 and it splits 8:1. Now, with 8x more shares you slowly climb up to $1000. Maybe it splits again along the way, who fucking knows, you do the math. Yeah it\u2019s that same hypothetical math you\u2019ve been doing the past week only... 1x your current share amount. Kinda makes you want to get more shares.\n\nObligatory, I am most certainly a retard, so this is not advice so please don\u2019t listen to me. Only a fool on a rant.",

They priced a secondary offering from an insider lock up at $35, providing a strong floor (thus my short puts at $35.

        "selftext": "So I want to know why Ford is still trading at 11$. I love ford, my first car I personally bought was a Ford Fusion.

Ford outsells NIO and TSLA byyy farrrr!\n2. Partnership with Rivian isn't forgotten and a team committed for a futuristic EV design (more people like how the All-Electric Ford F150 looked compared to the Tesla Cybertruck (and won it in a tug-of-war battle recently) \n3. GM is trading at more than 4x the price of F (buying Nikola and faking a EV Hummer video)\n4. Back in 2014, the Ford navigation was using $MSFT Cortana's voice for their entertainment / engagement. I'm sure $MSFT wanted to partner with Ford but had to settle something like $GM because it was already talking with $GOOG (which has most chance of creating driverless cars).\n5.  Ford unlocked it's CANbus that year and let developers go to town with their apps. For a moment their cars were used by $UBER and some private researchers in their driverless fleet\n\nIt's not gonna move to $50 but it definitely has potential to reach $20 imo.

        "selftext": "Sorry, this is a looonngg post and there are definitely parts you don't need to read like the intro and the NVAX. I just wanted to make sure it was detailed and explained everything as I'm sure this sub has been riddled with posts identical to this recently.\n\nSo to start this off I'll admit that I dived straight in with no prior knowledge of investing with GME, AMC and the most stupid, a little bit of Dogecoin. I'm still hoping AMC will recover at least a little when theatres re-open as I bought at $15 lol. I sold half my $400 GME off early (bought at $320) for about $10 profit or something tiny. I still have $200 and I'm still holding on. I'm aware that this might not be wise but luckily, the one non-stupid thing I did with this is that I used a certain percentage of my profits from beermoney ventures (surveys, market research and the like) as well as my matched betting which means, that whilst it was stupid and it is frustrating to lose both my own money and potential profit due to my own lack of research, I haven't risked anything I couldn't afford to lose.\n\nI'm getting older and busier so I don't always have time to be answering long and boring surveys anymore so I wanted to take the percentage of these profits and invest in relatively long term stocks. I've been doing some research and have purchased a couple of books and I've been looking into a variety of different stocks to start my portfolio. It's worth mentioning that I only have roughly $400-$500 to invest.\n\nThese are the shares I'm thinking/have already invested in:\n\n**NVAX:**\n\nCurrently, I have $50 that I got at $211.91 a share in NVAX. For those who don't know NVAX recently developed a Coronavirus vaccine that is 89% effective, whilst this is less than Pfizer and Moderna, Pfizer and Moderna are not backed up by clinical trials and most importantly, NVAX was 89% effective against both the original and the new mutated Coronavirus. I think this will do quite well.\n\n\n**AAPL:**\n\nThis is where the stocks I have end. AAPL is currenly at $135 which seems quite low and despite COVID, it has done really well financially. There is also mentioning of the Apple Car, Apple VR a new computer and it's increase in iPhone users this/last year. It seems like an obvious purchase but this is definitely where my lack of knowledge comes in. There have been all this stuff, huge revenues, new products and it's debt deal, yet over the past few days it's kinda stayed between $130 - $140 so I'm a bit uncertain on this one.\n\n**FUBO:**\n\nThis seems like it could do very well and there's loose speculation of it being worth $200 by the end of the year. That being said, the subscription revenue isn't particularly long-term, but then, they do have a new betting service. They report earnings on March 2. I was thinking of putting in a sell order at around at some price between $40-$50 but I'm very clearly not an expert so was hoping someone might have better insight. I'm thinking that personally, this is too risky for me either way but would be nice to hear some insight so I can learn what to look out for.\n\n**SQ**:\n\nThere was a bit of a dip in Square. They seem to be fundamentally quite strong since they cater to non-cash payments and for obvious reasons right now that seems pretty good. I think more importantly though, I don't want to go on about it but obviously a certain couple apps are in trouble and since CashApp now offers investing for a very similar user base it might increase. Like Apple this one seems obvious but then it's currently at $227. A optimistic look from investopedia says it'll go back up to $300. I assume there's a bit of a risk with that so with the risk and the fact that the optimistic increase would be from \\~$230 to $300 I feel that now I might be a bit late.\n\nThis is the end of a very long post and thanks for reading it. I understand that it's impossible to say you should go with this stock as it's 100% going to profit but I think some tips with these stocks that I mentioned and I guess just general advice for things to look for that I may have missed in my small analyses. I find that for some reason, I'm always reluctant to invest in the big'uns like Tesla, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft as in my head they're just expensive shares that don't change much which is obviously untrue and probably a mindset of an inexperienced investor. Also, I'm aware that even over the span of a few years \u00a3400 might not necessarily make me lots but I'm using this time to come to grips with it more so that when I have a bigger income I'm more experienced. Also, I feel it's worth adding that I am a computer science and electronics student and I imagine investing in things you know/are interested in is always a good thing but I don't really know how to start with just finding a good company to invest in that isn't at least being mentioned a little.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to update this with; I have been looking through Investopedia University, Khan Academy and have started reading Intelligent Investor. I just want to hopefully make it clear that on top of this post I am doing my own research and I hope people know that I'm not trying to just copy their decisions without any thought.\n\nEDIT 2: Removed crypto. Sorry I'm not replying to comments, they're not working atm so can only see bits of messages from phone notifications.",

        "selftext": "Information from Pixelcarve:\n\nQNX is generally regarded among engineers as the most advanced, stable and secure operating system in the world. As such it is trusted by the likes of NASA for mission critical operations, large nuclear power stations, factories, high-speed train control systems, and an endless array of embedded systems that require 0% downtime. QNX has earned its reputation and many in the computer industry believe that if QNX had chosen to compete with Microsoft and Apple and pursue a consumer sales route rather than an enterprise route, the world of computing would be generations ahead of where it is now. \n\nSo what makes it so great? QNX is built on a micro-kernel, which means that the core component of the OS (the kernel) only contains the bare minimum amount of code that can provide the mechanisms required to run an operating system. The remaining functions in a typical kernel (Monolithic OS) such as the filesystem, device drivers, application IPC, etc. are instead run outside of the kernel in the user space. Essentially what this means is that the kernel is the only software executing at the most privileged hardware level and is therefore infinitely more secure and stable. Bad drivers, software or executions can\u2019t bring it down.\n\nMicro-kernels also allow for RTOS, which simply means an operating system with guaranteed consistency for how long it takes to accept and complete a task. For a real-life scenario, think about the ABS brakes on a car \u2013 they require mission critical specifications to occur in real-time or someone can die, so the system running them has to be able to guarantee the delivery, receipt and execution of messages in X amount of time or it does not qualify at RT.\n\nThe benefits of this architecture are too numerous to get into here, but one of the main benefit to RIM is its ability to execute multiple platform runtimes at the same time with high efficiency \u2013 this is why you can write an application in C/C++, Adobe AIR, Webworks HTML5, and Java and have them all run natively on BlackBerry 10. The benefit to developers and consumers here cannot be understated. Basically ANYONE with any amount of programming experience can make an app, from high-level web based UI\u2019s to low-level 3D games.\n\nQNX takes their design one step further by also offering POSIX support, which is a family of IEEE standards that helps maintain OS and software compatibility. Being a full POSIX system, and not partly POSIX, ensures it\u2019s a lot easier to develop software for the QNX platform.",

        "selftext": "First Cobalt Corp. is a mining and production company of refined cobalt. \n\nFirst Cobalt has two main assets:\n\n1. They own the only permitted cobalt refinery in North America in Ontario, Canada\n2. The Iron Creek Project in Idaho, USA with cobalt present in the millions of pounds. \n\n**What is cobalt?**\n\nCobalt is a material used in the electrodes of batteries, allowing better charging capabilities and longer battery life. Cobalt is one of the primary ingredients used in everything from computer/phone batteries to EV batteries. \n\nSome companies have recently vowed to move away from Cobalt because 2/3rds of all Cobalt is currently mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has involved child slavery and human rights violations. A [lawsuit](http://iradvocates.org/sites/iradvocates.org/files/stamped%20-Complaint.pdf) has been filed against  Tesla, Apple, Alphabet, Dell, and Microsoft because of their use of cobalt mined from these mines. \n\nMoreover, China has something of a monopoly on cobalt supply lines and refinery processes, leading to a great deal of importation of their materials to the U.S. and Canada. \n\n*But* non-cobalt batteries are extremely hard to make, and companies are likely to continue to use cobalt in their batteries the foreseeable future. \n\n**This is where First Cobalt comes in**.\n\nFirst Cobalt's strategy \"is to explore, develop and refine ethically sourced cobalt\u00a0within\u00a0North America for sale back into the American battery market.\" \n\nWith Joe Biden's demand to pivot towards EV,  the democrats likely to demand ethical mining processes from here on out, and movement away from dependency on China, First Cobalt is poised to provide that demand immediately in the North American Market\n\nProduction metrics:\n\n1. First Cobalt will be able to refine 25,000 tons of cobalt a year once operating\n   1. Their refinement process has been tested and is efficient by global standards.\n   2.  Operating cost estimate of $2.72/lb of cobalt produced, which is competitive with global markets \n2. They have already laid down plans and began studies to expand the refinery by almost double in the next two years\n3. The Iron Creek Project has the potential to produce millions of pounds of refinable cobalt.\n\nMoving Forward: \n\nFirst Cobalt has yet to start production at its refinery or mining in Idaho. The refinery is 100% viable and ready to produce. The mining in Idaho is less secured as operations are awhile from starting, but their primary asset is still the refinery as a main touch-point for sales to battery makers. \n\nThey've also recently secured [10 million](https://www.reuters.com/article/canada-mining-first-cobalt/first-cobalt-secures-c10-million-government-backing-for-canada-refinery-idUSKBN28Q2F4) from the Canadian government in December, and they've been restructuring their finances in recent months to better prepare them for expansion moving forward. \n\nTheir website is [here](https://www.firstcobalt.com/) if you want to take a look at the company yourself. Discuss and let me know what you all think?",

Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.\n\nAdditionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.\n\n**Industry Fundamentals**\n\nGrowth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.\n\nPopularity of gaming is increasing:\n\nAccording to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.\n\nTech-driven improvements in game quality:\n\nAdvances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.\n\nIncreasing gaming and streaming engagement:\n\nSome interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks\u2019 State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:\n\n* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games\n* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves\n* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive\n* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.\n\n**The eSports and streaming flywheel**\n\nThe rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.\n\nCompetitive Landscape &amp; Risks\n\n**Competition**\n\nThe gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair\u2019s product offering includes:\n\n**Gaming keyboards and mice** \\- Logitech and Razer\n\n**Headsets and related audio products** \\-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX\n\n**Streaming gear** \\- Logitech and AVerMedia\n\n**Performance controllers** \\- Microsoft and Logitech\n\n**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \\- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake\n\n**High performance memory** \\- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron\n\n**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \\- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower\n\n**Competitive Strategy**\n\nThe company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.\n\n**Market Share**\n\nAccording to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.\n\n**Growth Strategy**\n\nMove into the Asia Pacific region:\n\nThe Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.\n\nComplimentary acquisitions:\n\nCorsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.\n\nNew Markets:\n\nUses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.\n\n**Threat of New Entrants**\n\nBecause of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).\n\n**Threat of Substitution**\n\nA significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair\u2019s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.\n\nCloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user\u2019s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.\n\nAdditionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.\n\n**Moats**\n\nThere does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair\u2019s market share across their product offering.\n\n**Other Relevant Risks**\n\nDue to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.\n\nFinancial Summary\n\n**Proforma Balance Sheet**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/QHgY1ZxL**](https://postimg.cc/QHgY1ZxL)\n\n**Income Statement**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/qNkbGDzN**](https://postimg.cc/qNkbGDzN)\n\n**For the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:**\n\nThe 49% increase in net revenue is mostly attributed to a large number of consumers gaming and working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe company\u2019s gross margin is influenced by its product mix for the period, gamer and creator peripherals have a higher gross margin (25-35%) than gaming components and systems (15-25%).\n\n**Proforma Cashflow Statement**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/XXCzNyRY**](https://postimg.cc/XXCzNyRY)\n\nCash used in investing activities consists primarily on the acquisitions of Elgato in 2018, and SCUF and Origin PC in 2019.\n\n**Peer Comparison**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/Whcfd1V6**](https://postimg.cc/Whcfd1V6)\n\nLogitech International (LOGI) and Micron Technologies (MU)\n\n**Why am I posting this now?**\n\nI believe they are going to have very strong 4th quarter 2020 earning results. 2020 had record pc sales,and pc video games has reported record numbers of players.

        "selftext": "Reddit (and social media in general) has, in my opinion, a very interesting mix of strategies and approaches when it comes to trading/investing. A good portion here are looking for short/medium term gains with mild risk. Some play it safer, investing in index funds and ETF\u2019s relying on long-term growth. Another percentage is looking to get rich quick, dumping their life savings into a single stock. \n\nI know the idea for a \u201cReddit ETF\u201d has been floated here before, and I personally believe that with the aforementioned mix of DD/risk tolerance, it would perform exceptionally well. With several users posting a weekly recap of the most discussed stocks, I have decided to pull 10 stocks from these lists and invest $150 in each of them, totaling $1,500 in this \u201cETF.\u201d The \u201cReddit ETF\u201d consists of the following. \n\n-ARKK\n-MSFT\n-AMZN\n-ICLN\n-SPCE\n-AAPL\n-PLTR\n-TSLA\n-BB\n-NOK\n\nAs much as I would love to invest more, I have a particularly small portfolio at the moment (life meant I had to pull most of my investments last year. Needed the money for immediate use). However, I do plan on contributing additional funds on a weekly basis to help grow. My questions for Reddit are as follows\n\n-Is 10 different stocks too many? Too few? \n\n-At what point should I drop or sell of an underperforming/less discussed stock? Should I reevaluate the stocks included in the ETF weekly? Monthly? \n\n-When investing additional cash, should I evenly divide my investment across all stocks (I.E. if putting in an additional $150, put $10 in each stock)? Or should additional investments favor the better performing stocks?\n\nI would love any feedback or suggestions! I plan on posting updates on a semi-regular basis (probably once or twice a month).\n\n-Sorry for the formatting issues, I\u2019m on mobile",

        "selftext": "Bullish on FEYE over next few quarters. To me it\u2019s unclear how the recent SolarWinds hack will impact Q4 earnings due to the timing of the hack. On a recent conf call Mandia mentioned that Incident Response hours aren\u2019t billed until after the incident response engagement is over. The SolarWinds news broke on Sunday Dec 13th.  Response engagements of this scale typically take weeks if not months. So we might be looking at meeting Q4 estimates but raising Q1 guidance.  Even without a beat, I\u2019ll take this as a bullish sign. \n\nI\u2019ve been watching job openings at FireEye for the last month.  They\u2019ve been recruiting non-stop and a large portion of these at Incident Response or other services consultants. There are currently 192 open roles.  \n\nBack of the napkin calculations are... many of the senior roles will be sent immediately into the field at a billing rate between $250-$450. At a 80% utilization that is between $400k-$720k per head per year. If they have hired between 50-100 people into these roles since the Solarwinds hack that is could lead to $20M-$36M revenue increase on the low end to $40M-$72M on the high end. With current annual revenues at $928M we could see an annual revenue increase of 7% on these services alone which is above their current 6.9% revenue growth rate. If we see acceleration in any of their newish businesses like Managed Defense and Mandiant Advantage Cyber Threat Intelligence services we could have a great growth story on our hands. Incident Response services are (hopefully) a one time thing for breached companies but Managed Defense and Intel services are a recurring revenue stream, so growth in these areas would be a very good thing indeed. \n\nAny upticks in the hardware business would be positive news, but I believe they are facing upgrade cycle challenges and I\u2019m not expecting much on this front. \n\nFinally, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we saw FEYE acquired by a larger player in the next few months. There have been multiple rounds of rumors over the last few years that indicate FEYE has hired an investment bank to assist with the process. While Mandia hasn\u2019t confirmed these rumors, he hasn\u2019t denied them either. Cisco allegedly passed. I think good candidates are Microsoft, IBM or even someone like CrowdStrike using their astronomically high share price to swing a deal and create a cyber powerhouse to rival Pali Alto.  \n\nI\u2019m long with shares, considering NTM/OTM LEAPS, might by some June calls.  FD weeklies might payout but are risky IMO.",

Competition across Corsair\u2019s product offering includes:\n\n**Gaming keyboards and mice** \\- Logitech and Razer\n\n**Headsets and related audio products** \\-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX\n\n**Streaming gear** \\- Logitech and AVerMedia\n\n**Performance controllers** \\- Microsoft and Logitech\n\n**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \\- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake\n\n**High performance memory** \\- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron\n\n**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \\- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower\n\n**Competitive Strategy**\n\nThe company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.\n\n**Market Share**\n\nAccording to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.\n\n**Growth Strategy**\n\nMove into the Asia Pacific region:\n\nThe Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.\n\nComplimentary acquisitions:\n\nCorsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.\n\nNew Markets:\n\nUses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.\n\n**Threat of New Entrants**\n\nBecause of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).\n\n**Threat of Substitution**\n\nA significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair\u2019s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.\n\nCloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user\u2019s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.\n\nAdditionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.\n\n**Moats**\n\nThere does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair\u2019s market share across their product offering.\n\n**Other Relevant Risks**\n\nDue to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.\n\nFinancial Summary\n\n**Proforma Balance Sheet**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/QHgY1ZxL**](https://postimg.cc/QHgY1ZxL)\n\n**Income Statement**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/qNkbGDzN**](https://postimg.cc/qNkbGDzN)\n\n**For the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:**\n\nThe 49% increase in net revenue is mostly attributed to a large number of consumers gaming and working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe company\u2019s gross margin is influenced by its product mix for the period, gamer and creator peripherals have a higher gross margin (25-35%) than gaming components and systems (15-25%).\n\n**Proforma Cashflow Statement**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/XXCzNyRY**](https://postimg.cc/XXCzNyRY)\n\nCash used in investing activities consists primarily on the acquisitions of Elgato in 2018, and SCUF and Origin PC in 2019.\n\n**Peer Comparison**\n\n[**https://postimg.cc/Whcfd1V6**](https://postimg.cc/Whcfd1V6)\n\nLogitech International (LOGI) and Micron Technologies (MU)\n\n**Why am I posting this now?**\n\nI believe they are going to have very strong 4th quarter 2020 earning results. 2020 had record pc sales,and pc video games has reported record numbers of players.

        "selftext": "I was thinking about examples of what Moore (Gorilla Game) calls tornadoes, and 3d-printers popped into my head. A tornado in his model is a new market, that develops into a crucial link the value chain of businesses. Alternatively it can be a \"better mouse trap\" that completely displaces another link in the chain, or even re-writes the entire value chain, like Netflix replacing Blockbuster. Having a conversation with a long time friend a while back, I was asking him about any good ideas for something small to send his kids, while they're basically stuck inside all day long. Imagine being a kid and being 6 or 7 right now. One entire year of your life has been spent in a weird bubble. 1/7 of your life. That would be like every Sunday of my life I couldn't go anywhere, or meet someone for coffee, or go grocery shopping. A sort of Shomar Shabbot, but death is a dice roll if you break the rules and the whole family rolls the dice if anyone cheats. It feels like it's the kind of thing that's going to define the worldview for a generation of children, for a while to come. I thought I could at least send them a bit of mail. I remember mail of any flavor being a fun event as a kid. Kid's don't get a lot of mail. We even got excited for travel brochures. The kind you send away for. The \"Come visit exciting Nebraska, we've got a corn maze. Get it, Maize! Haha. Please, somebody visit..\" travel brochures states departments of commerce or travel would send out if you asked. This was probably more of a thing back before the internet.\n\nMy friend replied that he's very into Lego's (big surprise, I knew this), and he likes building elaborate battles with his Legos and other toys. Orcs versus Legos versus Ninjas. That sort of thing. He had found a home 3d-printer setup at a decent price and kids were very excited to get what amounted to a homemade army-man printed off the machine to add to their epic battles. It didn't cost much and he could make his kid just about anything. An orc. A ninja. A giant squid. A giant squid-orc-ninja. This part of the equation I didn't know.\n\nThis got me thinking about 3d-printers and tornadoes. I don't know what industry this would disrupt specifically, when it reaches that last stage of innovation where it becomes more efficient for a person or small business to own a cheap 3d-printer to solve their needs, rather than order a specialized part from a company that might charge specialized-part-company prices. Even better, to replace a part on an old machine that was out of production or solve a problem that didn't have an already commercially available solution. There are already libraries full of blueprints available for download for all sorts of different solid state things a 3d-printer could make. Maybe it would disrupt a lot of industries in smaller R&amp;D or cost savings sorts of ways.\n\nI remember a news story earlier this year, of a kid who designed what amounted to a bobby-pin solution to the problem nurses and doctors were experiencing with their ears getting wrecked after 12 hours wearing masks all day in the ICU's. It wasn't remotely complicated, but it was ingenious. Looked like a little fish-bone piece if plastic that wrapped around the back of your head and had multiple spaced out tongs to hook the ear loop on each side. No more painful ears. He was printing them on a 3d-printer for his local hospital and couldn't print them fast enough. So he gave away the design and made a tutorial for other tinkerers to replicate it on their own 3d-printers. Smart kid. I was not nearly that ambitious at his age. I was throwing rocks and pieces of flotsam into big puddle, and doing wicked jumps off the 6 inch dirt \"hill\" in the field we neighborhood kids had decided was a BMX track. Dangerous times.\n\n3d printers are the sort of thing that has the opportunity to be a new category. I don't know what roadblocks still exist to mass adoption, but it seems like the price roadblock at least has been knocked down. A quick google search \"who makes 3d printers\" yielded a fascinating article with a lot of useful information. I didn't realize there were companies that had been involved in this for decades. Of course CNC machines have been around for a long time, but that is an industrial solution. Most people don't have a CNC machine in their garage, or the technical knowledge to use one. HP. ProtoLabs. Materialise. Stratasys. 3d Systems. ExOne. It's a long list, this article is packed with information.\n\nI don't know how to approach this, because I'm not an expert on 3d printers or emerging technology. If some of these companies have been around this long, it probably either isn't a winner-take-all industry or there is still some roadblock preventing mass adoption of the technology. So let's take a look at it from the simplest possible angle: Year over Year revenue increases.\n\nHP doesn't get factored, because HP is way too massive, I am way too lazy and this is just an example. Perhaps you could dig through a 10-k and find a break-out of the revenue from this segment, but I'm just going to skip that and look at the smaller companies, some 3d printer specialists.\n\nRevenues by year (*in thousands*, but this does not matter because we are comparing percentages)\n\n\" Proto Labs specializes in rapid prototyping using three additive  processes: stereolithography, selective laser sintering and direct metal  laser sintering. \"\n\nProto Labs (PRLB): 2019, 2018, ... \\[$458,728,  $445,596,  $344,490, $ 298,055  $ 264,106  $ 209,583 \\]\n\nYear-over-year Growth: 2019, 2018, ... \\[2.9%, 29.35%, 15.5%, 12.8%, 26%\\]\n\nMath: (458,728 - 445,596) /  445,596 = 0.029 (x100) = 2.9%\n\n\" Materialise has been providing software solutions and 3D printing services for over 25 years. \"\n\nMaterialise (MTLS): 2019, 2018, ... \\[\u20ac196,679  \u20ac184,721  \u20ac142,573,  \u20ac114,477  \u20ac102,035,  \u20ac81,355\\]\n\nYear-over-year Growth: 2019, 2018, ... \\[6.4%, 29.56%, 24.54%, 12.19%, 25.41%\\]\n\nNow I'm not going to go through and do all your homework. This is an example of how to approach a topic. It requires more work, more companies, reading 10-k's and probably knowing more than I do about the 3d-printer industry, if you want additional certainty. This is the process. Nothing I used was a paywalled service. There are no greeks or probabilistic distributions and long-tails to understand. I used very basic math and a bit of reasoning, and a really good mental model by a few guys written 20 years ago. The case studies they were writing about were Microsoft, Cisco, and Novell Netware. The mental model hasn't changed.\n\nThese are not gorilla game numbers, according to their model. Revenues should be spiking upwards harder than this. It should be more obvious. All the same it still appears from this initial investigation to be a potentially solid growth industry. Let's also note the comparison of those two companies, year over year. 3% vs 6%. 29% vs 29%, 15% vs 24%, 12% vs 12%, 26% vs 25%. If this was my only metric, I'd think two things. First, Materialise is leading, PRLB is reacting. Second, both of these companies are growing revenues significantly so I might have found an industry on it's way up, but one in which there is no winner-take-all. Looking more like a growth industry situation than a monopoly situation, the \"Gorilla Game\". A rising tide lifts all boats situation.\n\nTo get to a level of certainty where this would constitute an investment and not a guess, we would need to mine SEC Edgar for more years and do this with more companies, along with other metrics. Revenue is a good start, but it is not enough to provide safety. Net Earnings, debt/equity, other things of this sort. If you were the type that likes to forecast earnings into the future, this is the sort of thing that would be suitable for a DCF model into the future. So much the better if you had some in-depth knowledge about 3d-printing.\n\nThis is how you get going. It's not magic, just legwork (in my case keyboard work), mental models, some competence in the industry you're fishing and some basic math and reasoning skills.\n\nTools used to create this example:\n\nGoogle, SEC Edgar, this article ([https://investingnews.com/daily/tech-investing/emerging-tech-investing/top-3d-printing-companies/](https://investingnews.com/daily/tech-investing/emerging-tech-investing/top-3d-printing-companies/)), a cheap laptop and about 20 minutes of typing.",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59), while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "*Disclaimer - I am just a retard w/ a keyboard and you should do your own $DD. Also the karma whores @ WSB keep deleting my shit so one of you go post over there if you like $BB and what you read*\n\nTOday I did research to calm myself down after pounding a redbull and getting triggered by all the misinformation and greedy nitwits that have flooded this site looking for a quick flip.\n\nImagine you\u2019re John Chen. Sauntering down the hallway, with your 50 pound dick grazing the velveteen carpet with each step. You hear the guttural screams coming out of sales. You walk by the engineers, and gaze upon the latest widget as they kowtow before your bespecled grandeur. You hear about the customers who sing your praises, and the (much fewer) ones who tell you your product sucks donkey balls... But we (the retards @ WSB or frankly the dubmasses @ seeking alpha and even JP Morgan equity coverage) don\u2019t know the details any of this, only dry ass reports that come out every quarter.\n\nSo, other than hacking into John\u2019s brain (not recommended), what can we do? We can suckle at the teat of Twitter announcements, and sometimes that\u2019s fun but usually it\u2019s PR driven (unless it comes from Papa Chen\u2019s account in which case suckle away).\n\nBut boy oh boy wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could know the things P. Chiddy does. What new things are in development. Big new sales in the pipeline. Whether the company is hiring (or shrinking), and in what areas\u2026.Wait. For the last thing we actually can!\n\nthanks to the grotesquely fat (and very rich, no offense Gabe) founder of a soul-crushing professional network called LinkedIn. Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So let\u2019s see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?\n\nTo start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If you\u2019re a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If you\u2019re growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they don\u2019t think they need, and last time I checked $BB\u2019s CFO wasn\u2019t completely retarded. Now, it\u2019s important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c they\u2019re growing, duh) and vice versa.\n\nFANG isn\u2019t a perfect comp (I\u2019ll get to the others in a sec), but **serves as a good proxy of a \u201cbaseline growthy\u201d tech.** No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking. See below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8x0sjsj4wxe61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc0b996f191f3f47d37bb6b2888f537c6789ae0e\n\n# IMPLICATION NUMBER #1 - $$BB COMPARES FAVORABLY TO FANG IN TERMS OF HEADCOUNT-IMPLIED GROWTH. IF YOU SAID \u201c$BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG\u201d, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOU\u2019D BE RIGHT!!\n\n\u201cBut wait,\u201d you say. \u201cgrowthinvestor123 you fucking idiot, didn\u2019t you just compare $BB to CRWD, ZS, SAIL, and PANW yesterday to justify a **$60 / share** price target for $BB? I want to see the ratios for those.\u201d Ok you, got me. See below, headcount-implied growth is higher for endpoint security comparables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q7cepei5wxe61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7308c115e3d45a072dac92b20ac029eb132b348\n\n\u201cHah,\u201d you say smugly. \u201cThose other endpoint security businesses blow $BB out of the water, $BB sucks\u201d.\n\nNo, you fucking idiot. If a simple headcount ratio without context was all it took I\u2019d be rich instead of handsome like mommy tells me.\n\n$BB went through [**round**](https://channeldailynews.com/news/layoffs-hit-blackberry-in-waterloo/28015) after [**round**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=blackberry+layoffs&amp;atb=v224-1&amp;ia=web&amp;iai=r1-3&amp;page=1&amp;sexp=%7B%22cdrexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22artexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prodexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prdsdexp%22%3A%22c%22%2C%22biaexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22msvrtexp%22%3A%22b%22%7D) of painful layoffs as it shifted from being a handset business to what it is today. Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a **history**, and that is a blessing and a curse.\n\n**Remember**, Daddy chen\u2019s primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other??? And these smart monkes who were retained \u2013 Well, no need to make a job posting for that role anymore, right?\n\n# IMPLICATION #2 \u2013 BLACKBERRY HAD &gt; 20K EMPLOYEES. UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS. HAVING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES QUICKLY LIKE CERTAIN COMPETITORS\n\nThis brings me to the final part of our headcount analysis. Let\u2019s look at those endpoint security comparables again. Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Let\u2019s look at two two non-retard quotes \u2013\n\n***\"I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company.\" Steve Jobs***\n\n***\u201cIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it\u2019s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.\u201d Peter Thiel***\n\nI was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BB\u2019s Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales. See below\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9s89num7wxe61.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5361754f68b831f3ad044aba2fed88c6f93c7849\n\nEven as a $BB bull, I didn\u2019t expect the discrepancy to be so large.\n\n# IMPLICATION #3 \u2013 BLACKBERRY ACTUALLY IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING / IT FOCUSED COMPANY RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS. IN MANY WAYS IT IS MORE OF A \u201cSTART-UP\u201d. EVEN WITH FINANCIAL PRESSURE, JOHNNY CHEN RETAINED TECHNICAL TALENT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE, AND VALUATION ???\n\n**TLDR: BB IS NOT A ROCKET SHIP. IT IS A LONG RANGE SHUTTLE, CAPABLE OF BURSTS OF SPEED, PACKED TO THE GILLS WITH RETARDS AND TERRAFORMING EQUIPMENT AND HEADING TO MARS.**",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59), while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "Normally I would post this on r/wsb, but that place is such a cult right now I don't want to be downvoted to hell.\n\nFrom what has happened this entire week, not only with GME but every most-shorted-stock and even silver now (lol idk what the story behind that is, but people are buying), this is a marked difference from post-2008/09. There are lots of retail buying in everything, and RH (despite some unsavory actions) has actually democratized equities buying. Not going to talk much about economics in this post, but this feels like 1996 again - low US rates, a hot new sector (this time green energy), EM markets stronger (USD flows into Asia etc) - which all combine to probably a few good years for equities before the tax hike discussions start.\n\n\\---\n\n**There will be less shorting**. Melvin was the poster whipping boy that got hung out to dry by the rest of Wall Street. Most of the pump wasn't because of r/wsb no matter how many \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\ude80 we post. Most of the pump was your option writer (Barclay's, DB, funds with covered call strategies including pension funds that hold onto a buttload of shares) suddenly having to buy 99 shares as delta gaps from 0.01 to 1.00 overnight. There's also gamma hedging and other strategies, but this is just a vanilla description of delta hedging.\n\nNow that shorts can be blown out of the water just like that, there might be a change in how option volatility works. Black Monday in 1987 caused the volatility smirk - puts will be more expensive than calls. This might cause the other way around. I know this might mean more expensive calls especially in lightly traded names which means it's harder to make money buying calls, but in any case, there will be less shorting. That entire short strategy will be embraced by less and less money.\n\n**Where the money will go.** People will find their way back to megacaps and indices. Yeah you may not have 200% overnight gains, but people know these stocks. You can also add the fact that value is coming back (so more SPY and IWM), but barring any kind of black swan event, you're not supposed to go to sleep dreaming about Lambos or if you'll be able to afford that pack of ramen holding these. People do get tired after overtrading, and in the end, all those flows will come back to the \"safer alternatives.\"\n\nAlso, IVs on index ETF calls are wonderfully cheap. That should also drive some of the flows.\n\n**The youth are back buying stocks**. I'm also talking about myself, a young person in my late 20s. This is a difference from post-2008 where we never got that kind of euphoria. Now, every one of my buddies are glued to their trading accounts and reddit (thought that was probably there before), or if not that, their retirement accounts.\n\nMakes sense because the 2008 crisis was centered around the financial industry. People are affected by the serial-position effect and recency effect (once bitten, twice shy). In 2008, it was stocks and in 2021 it's most likely going to be shorting. Everyone will come back and chase the new hot issue, because the amount of FOMO and YOLO in the markets are comparable to just before the tech bubble. Did 2000 stop people from investing? Well from my dad who lost almost everything in YHOO, he bought into MSFT (because no way that company could die) and is going quite well for himself.
