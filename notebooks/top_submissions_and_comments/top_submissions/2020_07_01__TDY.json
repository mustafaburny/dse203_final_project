        "selftext": "\nFor Trading JULY 8th\n \n \nJOLTs 5.4 vs. 5 Million\n \nNVAX gets $1.6B from BARDA\n \n \n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a very soft start in the DJIA but not so much in the NASDAQ and S&amp;P-500, with the DJIA starting off -240 and managing a rally only as far as -125 before spending several hours going sideways until the last hour of trading when the NASDAQ and S&amp;P ran out of steam and fell below the close and the selloff resumed.  It\u2019s never a good thing when and overbought index makes a new all-time high and then closes down and on the lows.  The DJIA was -396.85 (1.51%), NASDAQ -89.76 (.86%), S&amp;P 500 -34.30 (1.08%), the Russell -26.89 (1.86%) and the DJ Transports -108 (1.1%).  The internals were 3:1 down on NYSE and 2.5:1 on NASDAQ with volume on the NYSE 2:1 down also.  The DJIA was 28 down and only 2 up with WMT the big gainer +55 DP\u2019s and on the downside, BA-62, GS -55, and UNH -43DP\u2019s.  Even with the good JOLTs number, this market is just over-extended and tired.  The stat I mentioned in tonight\u2019s video about the S&amp;P is very telling, I think, with the S&amp;P only 2% off its high, the median S&amp;P stock is down 11%.  This market has simply gotten too narrow and it will correct.\n \nWe sold half of the remaining NEM 7/17 $60\u2019s bought @ 1.55 and added to last Friday @ $1.30 for an average of $1.47 triggered a 100% Up Rule sale at $2.94, and today\u2019s sale was @ $3.20. They closed today $3.20.  We also own a position in SLV 8/21 17 calls @ $ .74, and they closed $ .75, and we also added a spread using the NEM 8/65 / 70 calls at a $1.30 debit.\n \n\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video https://youtu.be/5afUNy48sFI\n\nOur Discord Forum link is on the video description..\n\nSECTORS: The FAANG names all finished near the lows, several like MSFT coming off a new all-time high and closing down on the day.  Not a good sign if they follow-thru to the downside tomorrow.  Also having trouble was CCL, who has had to cancel several cruises for Q4 and Q1 2021.  It closed $14.57 -1.04 (6.7%).  Add to that, the UAL report that it is giving warnings that it will be laying off \u201c10\u20192 of thousands of employees.\u201d  UAL finished $32.55 -2.66 (7.55%).  These two companies do not operate in a vacuum, so both groups are in jeopardy, again.  Novavax (NVAX) got a $1.6billion grant from BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) to help it along in it\u2019s search for a workable vaccine.  The stock, up from $8 as late as the end of February had worked its way up to $85 last month and opened today $104 and traded as high as $111.77 and finished $104.56 +25.12 (31.63%).  Don\u2019t get too crazy with this one, this is not its first rodeo.  In 2015 it was trading $300 before it had a failure on a different vaccine and the stock fell to $80 before a rally and then in the week of 9/16/2016 it fell further from $169.80 to $23.20 and then on to the adjusted (1:20 reverse) low around $4.00.  We\u2019ll hope for a better outcome this time around.  Walmart was the big winner on a RECODE that said they are ready to launch Walmart +, to compete with Amazon Prime for same day grocery delivery and next day for other products.  Its move today added 55 DP\u2019s to the averages.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal since for the same money, with Prime you get streaming too.  And the margins on groceries are razor thin.\n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was MIXED with TSN -.67, BGS +.70, FLO -.03, CPB -.11, CAG +.54, MDLZ -.22, KHC +.22, CALM +.03, JJSF -1.43, SAFM +.54, HRL -.14, SJM +.18, PPC -.34, KR -.03, and PBJ $31.56 +.06 (.19%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA was MIXED with BIIB - -1.72, ABBV +.72, REGN +14.50, ISRG -9.30, GILD -.13, MYL -.43, TEVA -.29, VRTX +8.35, BHC -.59, INCY +.86, ICPT -.74, LABU +3.36, and IBB $140.15 +.71 (.51%).\n \nCANNABIS: was LOWER with TLRY -.13, CGC -.40, CRON -.19, GWPH +2.93, ACB +.17, CURLF -.07, KERN -.62 and MJ $13.08 -.01 (.08%).\n\nDEFENSE:  was LOWER with LMT -8.59, GD -3.29, TXT -1.73, NOC -7.89, BWXT -1.78, TDY \u2013 7.84, RTX -2.12 and ITA $160.32 -6.10 (3.67%).\n\n \nRETAIL: was LOWER with M +.03, JWN -.58, KSS -.72, DDS -.88, WMT +9.11 (7.66%), TGT -1.40, TJX -1.84, RL -2.49, UAA -.41, LULU -6.66, TPR -.51, CPRI -.18 and XRT $43.78 -.43 (.97%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were MIXED with GOOGL -7.40, AMZN -44.69, AAPL +1.06, FB -.91, NFLX +.69, NVDA +3.06, TSLA +9.42, BABA -2.60, BIDU -4.54, CMG -10.92, CAT -2.03, BA -8.57, DIS -.53 and XLK $106.34 -.77 (.72%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS \u2013 7.91, JPM2.52, BAC -.63, MS -1.32, C -1.53, PNC -3.15, AIG -1.36, TRV -2.45, AXP -3.48, V -3.13, and XLF $22.93 -.48 (2.05%).\n \nOIL, $40.62 -.01. Oil was lower in last night\u2019s trading before we rallied in the morning. I mentioned in last night\u2019s charts with comments section in the Weekly Strategies letter, prices are trying to work higher towards $45.00. We needed a close over the previous high close of $40.83 and while we were there, we sold off to close below that number.  The stocks were higher with XLE $36.26 -1.19 (3.18%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,809.80 +16.40. It was a continuation rally and a new recovery high OF $1807.70  Last night I said \u201cwe\u2019ve moved $50 since the low on Friday and while the trend and momentum are positive, we may have to test 1790 to consolidate our gains.\u201d  Unfortunately, we pulled back to 1,767 instead.  We rallied a bit and finished only slightly better. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 and half of what was left today @ $3.20, we closed $3.20 + .80 today.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,290 -65. After trading back to 8985 we rallied back to close \u2013 only $5.  Since last week we have closed between 9200 \u2013 92.85 every day with narrow ranges and today was a good start to move higher.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97.

The FED announcement and the press conference had absolutely no effect on the market as did the House Judiciary cross examination of the CEOs of AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, and FB.  There was nothing new discussed as the congressional questioners got on their soapboxes to mug to the TV cameras.  As is usually the case on Fed days, the market just drifted higher and when they got what was expected the market added on to the gains.

This had a snowball effect and caused a total of 5 teams cancelling games and putting into question the viability of continuing sports available for betting.  The NFL is also at odds with the NFL Players association over several issues and that would clearly put into question of whether there will be a season for them also.  After the deal with the SPAC to bring the company public the stock had a steady rise from the $12.00 level to a high of $44.79, a decline and a pullback and an attempt to move higher that resulted in a lower high (43.75 in June), and another decline back to 27.54 in July and another lower high of 38.84 last week and the possible start of a new decline.

The strongest sectors were energy, industrials, health care and materials.  Weaker were consumer discretionary and financials.  The U.S. Dollar continued weak and commodities were generally higher.  Economic numbers, CPI was released this morning and came in at + .6% for CPI, up from an expected .5%, and Core CPI was + .2% vs .1% expected.

The stock, up from $3.00 just last month, hit a high of $20.65 before closing $17.03 +5.84 (52%).\n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was LOWER with TSN -.20, CAG -.18, MDLZ -.72, KHC -.05, CALM -.78, JJSF +1.20, SAFM -.73, HRL -.24, SJM -1.34, PPC -.45, PPC -.45, KR -1.14, and PBJ -.11 (.36%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA was HIGHER with BIIB +10.75, ABBV +.15, REGN +3.87, ISRG +5.62, GILD -.65, MYL +.08, TEVA +.19, VRTX -3.06, BHC -.88, INCY -.38, ICPT -1.22, LABU +2.93, IBB $140.89 +.83 (.59%).\n \nCANNABIS: was LOWER with TLRY -.09, CGC -.09, ACB -.29, CRON -.01, GWPH -.62, CURLF -.06, KERN +.11, MJ $13.04 -.04 (.31%).\n\nDEFENSE:  was MIXED with LMT -1.39, GD -.93, TXT +.22, NOC -2.47, BWXT -.61, TDY +5.24, RTX +.28 and ITA $160.65 +.33 (.21%).\n\n \nRETAIL: was HIGHER with M +.84, JWN +1.98, KSS +1.98, DDS +1.01, WMT -1.38, TGT -.07, RL +1.57, UAA +.16, LULU +3.41, TPR +.45, CPRI +.40, and XRT $44.32 +.54 (1.23%).\n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +15.69, AMZN +95.88, AAPL +9.51, FB +3.55, NFLX +12.06, NVDA +16.33, TSLA -28.83, BABA +21.56, BIDU +3.15, CMG +6.90, CAT +1.30, BA +1.89, DIS +3.32, and XLK $107.72 +1.73 (1.63%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS +2.94, JPM +.99, BAC +.13, MS +1.51, C +.67, PNC +.43, AIG +.75, TRV +.70, AXP -.09, V +1.21 and XLF $23.17 +.24 (1.05%).\n \n \nOIL, $40.90 +.28. Oil continues to trade in short ranges without much movement, but today\u2019s close is the highest in the current consolidation.  I mentioned in last night\u2019s charts with comments section in the Weekly Strategies letter, prices are trying to work higher towards $45.00. We needed a close over the previous high close of $40.83 and today we finally did.  The stocks were higher with XLE $36.23 -.03 (.08%).\n \n \nGOLD, $1820.70 +10.70.  After making a new recovery high of $1,829 we finished the day at another new closing high.  I expect this move to continue to work higher to new highs.  As I mentioned earlier in this note, the U. S. dollar continues to be supportive to higher prices of world commodities quoted in US$. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also closed out the final portion of our July 60 calls @ $4.30.  We still own a spread in the August expiration long 65 / 70 spread at a $1.30 debit.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,510 +220. Since last week we have closed between 9200 \u2013 9285 every day with narrow ranges and today was a good start to move higher.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $10.32 + .56 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "\nFor Trading JULY 8th\n \n \nJOLTs 5.4 vs. 5 Million\n \nNVAX gets $1.6B from BARDA\n \n \n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a very soft start in the DJIA but not so much in the NASDAQ and S&amp;P-500, with the DJIA starting off -240 and managing a rally only as far as -125 before spending several hours going sideways until the last hour of trading when the NASDAQ and S&amp;P ran out of steam and fell below the close and the selloff resumed.  It\u2019s never a good thing when and overbought index makes a new all-time high and then closes down and on the lows.  The DJIA was -396.85 (1.51%), NASDAQ -89.76 (.86%), S&amp;P 500 -34.30 (1.08%), the Russell -26.89 (1.86%) and the DJ Transports -108 (1.1%).  The internals were 3:1 down on NYSE and 2.5:1 on NASDAQ with volume on the NYSE 2:1 down also.  The DJIA was 28 down and only 2 up with WMT the big gainer +55 DP\u2019s and on the downside, BA-62, GS -55, and UNH -43DP\u2019s.  Even with the good JOLTs number, this market is just over-extended and tired.  The stat I mentioned in tonight\u2019s video about the S&amp;P is very telling, I think, with the S&amp;P only 2% off its high, the median S&amp;P stock is down 11%.  This market has simply gotten too narrow and it will correct.\n \nWe sold half of the remaining NEM 7/17 $60\u2019s bought @ 1.55 and added to last Friday @ $1.30 for an average of $1.47 triggered a 100% Up Rule sale at $2.94, and today\u2019s sale was @ $3.20. They closed today $3.20.  We also own a position in SLV 8/21 17 calls @ $ .74, and they closed $ .75, and we also added a spread using the NEM 8/65 / 70 calls at a $1.30 debit.\n \n\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video https://youtu.be/5afUNy48sFI\n\nOur Discord Forum link is on the video description..\n\nSECTORS: The FAANG names all finished near the lows, several like MSFT coming off a new all-time high and closing down on the day.  Not a good sign if they follow-thru to the downside tomorrow.  Also having trouble was CCL, who has had to cancel several cruises for Q4 and Q1 2021.  It closed $14.57 -1.04 (6.7%).  Add to that, the UAL report that it is giving warnings that it will be laying off \u201c10\u20192 of thousands of employees.\u201d  UAL finished $32.55 -2.66 (7.55%).  These two companies do not operate in a vacuum, so both groups are in jeopardy, again.  Novavax (NVAX) got a $1.6billion grant from BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) to help it along in it\u2019s search for a workable vaccine.  The stock, up from $8 as late as the end of February had worked its way up to $85 last month and opened today $104 and traded as high as $111.77 and finished $104.56 +25.12 (31.63%).  Don\u2019t get too crazy with this one, this is not its first rodeo.  In 2015 it was trading $300 before it had a failure on a different vaccine and the stock fell to $80 before a rally and then in the week of 9/16/2016 it fell further from $169.80 to $23.20 and then on to the adjusted (1:20 reverse) low around $4.00.  We\u2019ll hope for a better outcome this time around.  Walmart was the big winner on a RECODE that said they are ready to launch Walmart +, to compete with Amazon Prime for same day grocery delivery and next day for other products.  Its move today added 55 DP\u2019s to the averages.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal since for the same money, with Prime you get streaming too.  And the margins on groceries are razor thin.\n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was MIXED with TSN -.67, BGS +.70, FLO -.03, CPB -.11, CAG +.54, MDLZ -.22, KHC +.22, CALM +.03, JJSF -1.43, SAFM +.54, HRL -.14, SJM +.18, PPC -.34, KR -.03, and PBJ $31.56 +.06 (.19%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA was MIXED with BIIB - -1.72, ABBV +.72, REGN +14.50, ISRG -9.30, GILD -.13, MYL -.43, TEVA -.29, VRTX +8.35, BHC -.59, INCY +.86, ICPT -.74, LABU +3.36, and IBB $140.15 +.71 (.51%).\n \nCANNABIS: was LOWER with TLRY -.13, CGC -.40, CRON -.19, GWPH +2.93, ACB +.17, CURLF -.07, KERN -.62 and MJ $13.08 -.01 (.08%).\n\nDEFENSE:  was LOWER with LMT -8.59, GD -3.29, TXT -1.73, NOC -7.89, BWXT -1.78, TDY \u2013 7.84, RTX -2.12 and ITA $160.32 -6.10 (3.67%).\n\n \nRETAIL: was LOWER with M +.03, JWN -.58, KSS -.72, DDS -.88, WMT +9.11 (7.66%), TGT -1.40, TJX -1.84, RL -2.49, UAA -.41, LULU -6.66, TPR -.51, CPRI -.18 and XRT $43.78 -.43 (.97%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were MIXED with GOOGL -7.40, AMZN -44.69, AAPL +1.06, FB -.91, NFLX +.69, NVDA +3.06, TSLA +9.42, BABA -2.60, BIDU -4.54, CMG -10.92, CAT -2.03, BA -8.57, DIS -.53 and XLK $106.34 -.77 (.72%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS \u2013 7.91, JPM2.52, BAC -.63, MS -1.32, C -1.53, PNC -3.15, AIG -1.36, TRV -2.45, AXP -3.48, V -3.13, and XLF $22.93 -.48 (2.05%).\n \nOIL, $40.62 -.01.

        "selftext": "On social media, this disruptor company has been called the Robinhood of fintech.  Its customer base is the little guy: small and medium enterprises the world over.  Thanks to its fintech, the company enables these same businesses to obtain trade finance and engage in global trade, treading where at least 60% of banks and trading companies won\u2019t in a $40 trillion industry.  This first mover aims to address the $1.5 trillion gap in SME trade finance.\n\nBetter yet, this industry disruptor has not only survived the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has thrived.  [Not least because it is based in Singapore, a solid financial hub with robust disease control measures.]\n\nTrade and trade finance will only migrate more and more to the online platform of this [\u201cmost innovative fintech company\u201d in Asia-Pacific](https://d2tyltutevw8th.cloudfront.net/media/document/press-release-the-innovators-2020-regional-winn-1588769601.pdf) (*Global Finance*).\n\nLater this very month, Triterras will enter into a definitive merger agreement with the 7th-ranking special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) on Robinhood\u2019s list of Blank Check Companies: Netfin Acquisition Corp ($NFIN).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8omJ_Hzz08M\n\n**TRANSACTION VALUES**\n\nPublished transaction values are as follows:\n\nPre-money equity value is approximately $670 million.\n\nPost money equity value is approximately $939 million.\n\nProposed enterprise value is approximately $995 million.\n\nTo put things into a conservative perspective:\n\nPre-money equity value to NFIN market cap ratio (7/02): 1.92\n\nPost-money equity value to NFIN market cap ratio (7/02): 2.69\n\nProposed enterprise value to NFIN market cap ratio (7/02): 2.85\n\n**GROWTH PROSPECTS**\n\nWhile already profitable at $87 million EBITDA and $46 million consolidated net income, Triterras is aiming to more than double these two performance measures by the end of their next fiscal year.  Of the $1.5 trillion gap in SME trade finance, it has addressed $4.1 billion, and aims to more than double this by the end of fiscal 2021.  That the company has three modules for its Kratos platform, [two more than the end of calendar 2019](https://www.gtreview.com/news/fintech/blockchain-fintech-triterras-goes-live-with-trade-finance-product-for-smes/), indicates its commitment to developing that platform further as part of its business growth story.\n\nSomething suggests that $NFIN\u2019s proposed enterprise value may be a discount on a growth company.  Its valuation seems to be based on a multiple of fiscal 2019 EBITDA, rather than on a multiple of sales.  It is definitely not based on a multiple of fiscal 2021 sales.\n\nOh, well.  Let that proposed enterprise value stand before the merger.  It just might go noticeably past that in the short term, even after all the equity dilution is said and done.\n\n*Disclosure: Long on $NFIN.*",

I present with you some DD.\n\nIf the above holds true, fund managers, large pension funds and ETF's will need to rebalance portfolios this coming quarter. If you look at the top holdings of SPY.

SPY holds 257 Billion. If this fund decides to move just .5% out of Microsoft they would be redistributing 1 billion amongst the lower tier stocks. Will they do this? why not? They do it regularly, the question is if enough funds and ETF's do it at once, will it boost some stock and suppress others?\n\nBack to microsoft. SPY had 81 million shares as of yesterday. What did they have last september? 84 million.  [https://www.ssga.com/library-content/products/fund-docs/etfs/us/ps/SPDR\\_500-TRUST\\_PROSPECTUS.pdf](https://www.ssga.com/library-content/products/fund-docs/etfs/us/ps/SPDR_500-TRUST_PROSPECTUS.pdf)\n\nSPY has actually REDUCED microsoft holdings over the last year. Would they boost top holdings right now having such a massive run? if your mandate is to have a diverse portfolio, I doubt it.\n\nThis trend in the SPY ETF reducing holdings over the last year is also true of Apple, and Facebook but not Amazon.\n\nComapnies I like with low weights barring that something crazy with the virus doesn't happen and JPow's printer doesn't get jammed:\n\nCalls on :KO, PFE, INTC,  MMM, RTX",

Literally a week after being in the market it dropped but since I bought heavily into big tech I made it back out. My biggest holdings are\nAapl\nMsft\nAbbv\nV\nBaba\nAll of which I'm positive on. Since everyone realizes the market is stupid overvalued do yall think it would be beneficial to set 6 month stop orders on these investments just so if/when it does crash again I'm covered? I know timing the market is a bad idea but I dont think it wise to just gamble on the money printer never jamming and watching the PE of spx hit 10k by 2021. Then again I also dont want to screw myself if it does a \"mini dip\" like it has a few times then watch as the share prices skyrocket. Thanks in advance for your opinions.",

Ive done okay and am up about ~20% but I think its finally time to clean up my portfolio. I have so many random positions from just being a nooby and never really having a strategy. I\u2019ve decided to shift a majority of my money into ETFs and and higher dividend stocks.\n\nMy goal with this post is just to see if anyone has any input on my new portfolio setup and my plans for the stocks in it. So anyway, heres the plan. ~70% ETF, ~25% stocks, ~5% options, meme stocks, \u201cplay money\u201d basically\n___________________________________________________\n\n~70% ETFS - my goal with ETFS is to be the \u201csafer\u201d play while throwing in some riskier sectors that I believe in \n\n\n$VOO\n$VGT - not much to say about these, VOO is an obvious long term play for me and I think the big boys are big boys for a reason and Tech isnt going anywhere\n\n$VTI - debating on this one as it has 20% the same holdings as VOO but it does get exposure into smaller companies. Might try and find more small/midcap etfs\n\n$XLF - holds alot of stocks that I was individually looking at and diversifies my portfolio abit\n\n$MJ - my riskiest ETF, this hasnt been going well for me but I\u2019m very bullish on weed stocks even if it takes a long time. \n\n\n$HERO - Again, an etf I found that holds many of the stocks I was individually looking at. Gaming industry etf. I know my bias show on this one and I\u2019m not positive how gaming/esports will be in the future but I think there are some good companies in these holdings related to the industry\n___________________________________________________\n\n~25% Individual stocks \n\nMy goal here is to get in on some companies I believe in that arn\u2019t covered too much in my etfs with a preference to those with decent dividends.\n \n\n$BA \n$V\n$MCD\n$CRH\n$SWBI\n$TWO\n$SBUX\n\n___________________________________________________\n\n~5% day trades/options\n\na small amount for fucking around with day trades/option.\n\nSo there\u2019s my new plan.

Since it's now been a few months and COVID has gone on much longer than I had initially expected. I thought it would be a good time to take a second look.\n\nI went through all of their income statements to compare how they were doing before 2020. I thought this would be useful if and when things return to normal to know how they were doing before COVID. I compared their debt situation in 2019 to how things changed in the first Q of 2020. You can actually see how their equity and debt has changed already from just the first Q. I also looked at the cash flow statement of all three to see how much debt they've reported financing and if they can cover their capital expenditures. Their 10Ks showed how vulnerable the companies are if the pandemic continues in only North America since about 50% of their revenues come from North America, and 30% of their revenue comes from onboard services.\n\nI hope this is useful for people who've never done a fundamental analysis on a company.

        "selftext": "TLDR: Is this a good time to start a retirement fund for my parents or should I wait till after election (around January) once the cloud clears? I will max their traditional IRA into 2 etfs (SPY and QQQ) and 3 stocks (MSFT, COST, JNJ).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSituation:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheyre in their mid 50s and I will help them manage it.  Jointly, they make about 54k net per year (after taxes, insurance etc) but they dont have any sort of retirement fund/emergency fund currently. They just starting now since we are immigrants and was able to settle down just recently. They have a monthly expense of about $2600 (this includes a mortgage of 30 more years and a car payment of 4 years). They love to work, so they will probably retire in their 70s. Overall, they will have about 1900 per month in saving. My sibling and I are done with college and have our own jobs now. We are still with them but we're financially independent and plan to settle on our once their retirement fund is smooth sailing which will probably increase their monthly expenses to 3000$ since we will be contributing less (we are willing to help them as much as we could so it could stay as it is or hopefully even less depending on our future financial situation). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlan:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth their 401k does not match so I am thinking of starting traditional IRA with schwab. My plan is to max out their traditional IRA (14k combined per year) and focus it into two ETFs (SPY and QQQ) and 3 stocks (MSFT, COST, JNJ). I will DCA equally into 5 on their red days. Overall, they will have 700$ per month left over (after retirement contribution with this plan and expenses) which they can use for leisure...or should I have them contribute some to 401k and/or roth?.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy rationale of starting now is I can have their retirement fund ride the recovery from the pandemic drop (roughly about 1/4 more left to V shape recovery). We can argue that there is another drop (which is very likely) but I am not worried since I am DCAing anyway and I dont think this \"2nd drop\" will be as bad as the first one (especially this election, i dont think the current admin will let this happen). Election aftermath is a different story. I dont know what to expect after election hence this post. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy investment choices rationale: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSPY - Diversified basket\n\nQQQ- Tech heavy growth basket (pandemic proof)\n\nMSFT - Tech growth (pandemic proof)\n\nCOST - retail growth (pandemic proof, arguably)\n\nJNJ - healthcare growth especially post pandemic (I am thinking of omitting this since I also feel this might be a risky choice for a late retirement account). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother route: Have their retirement fund professionally managed. If so where?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am thinking of asking this in other financial sub but my really concern here is my investment choices and timing (which i believe this sub has the best point of view/opinion on); time in the market is better than timing the market but I feel like timing for a late retirement account in this situation is especially important. I dont have much experience with the market (just recently started myself) but my educational background is enough to understand it and its caveats. Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m an early 20\u2019s investor who has been in the market on [automoded deleted for saying broker name]  for a few years. Ive done okay and am up about ~20% but I think its finally time to clean up my portfolio. I have so many random positions from just being a nooby and never really having a strategy. I\u2019ve decided to shift a majority of my money into ETFs and and higher dividend stocks.\n\nMy goal with this post is just to see if anyone has any input on my new portfolio setup and my plans for the stocks in it. So anyway, heres the plan. ~70% ETF, ~25% stocks, ~5% options, meme stocks, \u201cplay money\u201d basically\n___________________________________________________\n\n~70% ETFS - my goal with ETFS is to be the \u201csafer\u201d play while throwing in some riskier sectors that I believe in \n\n\n$VOO\n$VGT - not much to say about these, VOO is an obvious long term play for me and I think the big boys are big boys for a reason and Tech isnt going anywhere\n\n$VTI - debating on this one as it has 20% the same holdings as VOO but it does get exposure into smaller companies. Might try and find more small/midcap etfs\n\n$XLF - holds alot of stocks that I was individually looking at and diversifies my portfolio abit\n\n$MJ - my riskiest ETF, this hasnt been going well for me but I\u2019m very bullish on weed stocks even if it takes a long time. \n\n\n$HERO - Again, an etf I found that holds many of the stocks I was individually looking at. Gaming industry etf. I know my bias show on this one and I\u2019m not positive how gaming/esports will be in the future but I think there are some good companies in these holdings related to the industry\n___________________________________________________\n\n~25% Individual stocks \n\nMy goal here is to get in on some companies I believe in that arn\u2019t covered too much in my etfs with a preference to those with decent dividends.\n \n\n$BA \n$V\n$MCD\n$CRH\n$SWBI\n$TWO\n$SBUX\n\n___________________________________________________\n\n~5% day trades/options\n\na small amount for fucking around with day trades/option.\n\nSo there\u2019s my new plan. Diversified? Too diversified? Thoughts comments or concerns? Thanks!",

        "selftext": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-02/deutsche-bank-considers-financial-support-for-wirecard-bank-kc4tsbnd\n\nDeutsche Bank AG is weighing the acquisition of all or part of disgraced Wirecard AG\u2019s bank, potentially throwing the business a lifeline after one of the biggest corporate scandals in recent years.\n\nThe Frankfurt-based lender is in touch with regulator BaFin, Wirecard Bank\u2019s management board and administrators on possible further steps to help Wirecard\u2019s finance unit, a Deutsche Bank spokesman said by e-mail, without elaborating. Options include taking on pieces of Wirecard Bank or the unit in its entirety, people familiar with the matter said, adding that the lender is still debating other ways to help Wirecard Bank and hasn\u2019t made a final decision.\n\nDeutsche Bank had informal tie-up talks with the scandal-hit fintech last Spring, though it quickly broke off the preliminary discussions. Wirecard Bank -- which sat at the heart of the firm -- could be valuable to a potential acquirer because of its relationship with credit card companies Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and JCB International, which are also key to other parts of Wirecard.\n\nDeutsche Bank may also be hit if Wirecard Bank were to file for insolvency. Germany\u2019s deposit insurance scheme for private banks would have to make depositors whole if the lender didn\u2019t have enough funds of its own to repay them. That could lead to higher contributions from the scheme members, of which Deutsche Bank is the biggest and highest paying.\n\nWirecard filed for insolvency last week after saying that almost 2 billion euros ($2.25 billion) it previously reported as cash probably never existed, throwing the future of its banking and others businesses into doubt. The company faces a potential avalanche of lawsuits and former Chief Executive Officer Markus Braun was arrested, though he is now out on bail.\n\nWhile Wirecard Bank isn\u2019t part of the bankruptcy proceedings, the parent ceded control of funds last week after the financial regulator stepped in to prevent the money from being deployed elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWe are currently reviewing the possibility of providing Wirecard Bank AG with financial support,\u201d Deutsche Bank said. \u201cWe are in principle prepared to provide this support in the context of a continuation of business operations, if such assistance should become necessary.\u201d\n\nInsolvency administrator Michael Jaffe said on Wednesday that the assets he\u2019s trying to sell are attracting interest from numerous investors. He didn\u2019t say whether he intends to sell Wirecard Bank as well, though said the lender remains solvent.\n\nTo fuel its growth, Wirecard had been paying depositors attractive interest at a time when traditional banks increasingly started to pass on negative rates. This year, it began offering a 0.75% interest rate via its Boon app, betting that more deposits will translate into more payments via its systems and lucrative contracts with stores and online merchants.\n\nIn addition to the earlier talks on a possible tie-up, the two financial firms had others links. Deutsche Bank is part of a lending group of 15 banks that together are owed about 1.6 billion euros, Bloomberg has reported. CEO Christian Sewing has been trying to shift the lender away from its reliance on trading income toward a focus on processing payments for companies, and he\u2019s made the division responsible for the business -- known as Corporate Bank -- the centerpiece of his large restructuring plan.\n\nSewing has focused tech investment on the Corporate Bank but he has also said that the division is being challenged by the low interest-rate environment it\u2019s operating in.\n\nThe collapse of Wirecard has prompted criticism of regulators and soul-searching among Germany\u2019s elite grappling for answers over the failure of what was once one of its most lauded companies. BaFin President Felix Hufeld has acknowledged that his institution is among those to blame for not catching the irregularities, which he referred to as \u201cmassive fraud\u201d on Thursday in Frankfurt.",

They closed today $2.81.  We also added a position in SLV 8/21 17 calls @ $ .74, and they closed $ .7\n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a decent start and rallied to a high of +210 by 9:45 but didn\u2019t hold it and was back down on the day by 11:00 but wouldn\u2019t give up, and spent all day between + / - 100 until the close when it sold off in the last 15 minutes and finished -77.91 (.30%).  The DJIA was the outcast with the NASDAQ +95.86 (.95%) at another new high, S&amp;P +15.57 (.50%), the Russell -14.05 (.97%), and the DJ Transports -19.71 (.21%) even though FDX and UPS had added 120 DJT points to the average.  Market internals were even on the NYSE while the NASDAQ was actually 9:7 Down, regardless of its new high close.  The DJIA was 20:9 down and WMT unchanged with no winners or losers moving over 20 DP\u2019s. Volume on NYSE was average but on the NAZ it was about 20% higher than yesterday.  Hong Kong and Covid-19 were the big negatives today and it was the ISM gains to 52.6, well over the 50 break-point, and the excitement of the PFE vaccine news were the big positives that helps us higher.\n \n \n \n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video https://youtu.be/dr95ohxzdjo\n\nOur Discord forum link is in the video description..\n\n\nSECTORS: The transports were the sector in the spotlight with FDX earnings (a loss) sending the stock higher by $16.44, although it closed just over its low of the day with a gain of 11.7% after being up over 14% for the biggest one-day gain since coming public in 1978.  UPS also gained 2.9% and between them they added 120 point to the average but still couldn\u2019t keep the average in positive territory.\n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was LOWER with TSN -.53, BGS -.08, FLO -.11, CPB -.32, CAG +.50, MDLZ -.05, KHC -.21, CALM -.54, JJSF -2.80, SAFM -3.21, HRL -.83, SJM -.59, PPC -.15, KR -.20, and PBJ $31.06 -.17 (.54%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA was MIXED with BIIB -3.44, ABBV +1.22, REGN -15.55, ISRG +5.71, GILD -.94, MYL -.23, TEVA -.82, VRTX -3.31, BHC +.13, INCY -1.32, ICPT -1.41, LABU +.59, and IBB $137.80 +1.11 (.81%).\n \nCANNABIS: was HIGHER with TLRY -.06, CGC +.25, CRON +.05, GWPH +3.53, ACB -.18, CURLF +.06, KERN -.16, and MJ $12.98 +.11 (.85%).\n\n \nDEFENSE:  was LOWER with LMT -3.92, GD -.86, TXT -.77, NOC +.70, BWXT -.18, TDY -6.76, RTX -.01, and ITA $163.19 -1.53 (.93%)\n \n \nRETAIL: was LOWER with M -.26, JWN -.29, KSS -.63, DDS -.94, WMT -.23, TGT -.93, TJX +.64, RL -1.85, UAA -.12, LULU -2.82, TPR -.33, CPRI -.37, and XRT $43.06 +.18 (.42%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +23.95, AMZN +122.28 (4.43%), AAPL -.69, FB +10.03, NFLX +31.96, NVDA +1.49, TSLA +58.18 (5.39%), BABA +.60, BIDU +.91, CMG +17.52, CAT +.07, BA -1.85, DIS +1.45, and XLK $104.66 +.17 (.16%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -.12, JPM -.64, BAC -.44, MS -.74, C -.70, PNC -2.38, AIG -1.55, TRV -1.65, AXP -.84, V +.50, and XLF $22.94 -.20 (.86%).\n \n \nOIL, $39.82 +.55. Oil was lower in last night\u2019s trading before we rallied midday. I mentioned in last night\u2019s charts with comments section in the Weekly Strategies letter, prices are trying to work higher towards $45.00. The stocks were higher with XLE $36.93 -.92 (2.43%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,779.30 -20.60. It was a continuation rally and a new recovery high OF $1807.70  Last night I said \u201cwe\u2019ve moved $50 since the low on Friday and while the trend and momentum are positive, we may have to test 1790 to consolidate our gains.\u201d  Unfortunately, we pulled back to 1,767 instead.  We rallied a bit and finished only slightly better. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 yesterday and we closed $2.81 - .49 today.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,325 + 140. After trading back to 8985 we rallied back to close \u2013 only $5.  Since last week we have closed between 9200 \u2013 92.85 every day with narrow ranges and today was a good start to move higher.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC last Wednesday @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $9.77 + .17 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "Hello, Redditors,\n\nI have started investing a couple of years back. I had my fair share of gambling with penny stocks and other FOMO stocks. Finally settled on investing only in MSFT, APPL, GOOG, V, AMZN. Other stocks of interest are TSM, BABA, LUV, DIS. I have around 10k to invest, and I have been waiting on the sidelines watching stocks hit bottom in March and back to all-time highs again. And, I have decided to get into the market with the DCA approach. I am planning to buy $500 worth of stocks (fractional stocks - a mix of MSFT, APPL, GOOG, V, AMZN, TSM, LUV) on a weekly basis to hedge against volatility. So, my question is, is there a way to automate the process? Let's say if I want to buy 5 shares (fraction of each MSFT, APPL, GOOG, V, AMZN) I have to make 5 different orders.\n\nAlso, any suggestions my stock picks and DCA, in general, will be highly appreciated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.",

I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed.

The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

Survey responses reflect the change, if any, in the current month compared to the previous month. For each of the indicators measured (Business Activity, New Orders, Backlog of Orders, New Export Orders, Inventory Change, Inventory Sentiment, Imports, Prices, Employment and Supplier Deliveries) this report shows the percentage reporting each response, and the diffusion index. An index reading above 50 percent indicates that the non-manufacturing economy in that index is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally declining. Orders to the service producers make up about 90 percent of the US economy.",

        "selftext": "Hello guys,\n\nLong time lurker here.\n\nChamath has been recognized by making some bold moves in the market, him being invested in SPCE, TSLA ( he was saying to buy it when TSLA was \\~ $200) and having expressed his positive view on AMZN growth (when it was around \\~$2500 and probably before). As we see so far his picks has been doing pretty well. \n\nIf Buffet can't make good calls in todays market, maybe he can. Since some call him next Buffet.\n\nIn his recent interview, he mentioned the above stocks and also noted that renewable energy is the future. \n\n[Recent Interview on Yahoo Finance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdNIJ5JlJRY)\n\nIn his previous ones by a youtuber, dont have the link, he mentioned that since everyone will be using Internet, obviously more will work from home, that stocks related could do well. Maybe T, VZ, etc.\n\nJust wanted to get your opinion, what would he invest in? I cant seem to find information on his personal portfolio, besides the Social Capital.\n\nWould NEE be one of them? What are other Clean Energy stocks you guys are keeping an eye on?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStay safe and healthy everyone! Hope you had a great long weekend who's here in US :)",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been managing my stock portfolio kinda randomly, some options some stocks buying on a whim and selling. I\u2019m bummed that I didn\u2019t hold any stock long term even though I was an early adopter of AMZN, NFLX etc. and being in tech I knew they were going to be big, even NVDA or SHOP couple years ago. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t want to lose the next 10-15 years. I want to invest in a disciplined way, buy around 20 stocks and then add on dips, So I\u2019ll keep around $100K cash. My big confusion is which 20 stocks to pick? I\u2019ve been reading here, checking TipRanks, have Motley fool advisor and the list I come up with is huge. I\u2019m pasting the symbols that have creeped into my planning spreadsheet below. Also I\u2019m confused whether to buy fewer stocks at higher investment or many at lower. Also whether more investment into the stable large names (MSFT, AMZN, AAPL) or more in relatively newer names (SE, DOCU, NET etc.) I\u2019ve searched many posts on the \u201c20 stock portfolio\u201d or such but my confusion will not go away. Hence I\u2019m posting here to hear from you directly. I\u2019m 42 years old, good stable job, will have $50K more to add to the portfolio every year. I\u2019m open to moderate risk. Help me with a 15-20 stock investment portfolio that I can hold long term and add on dips. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on my spreadsheet right now:\n\nNewer stars 2 yrs: SE, NET, CRWD, CHWY, FSLY, DDOG, TTD, ZS, TWLO, TEAM, SPLK, MDB, WORK, SHOP\n\nETFs: ARKK, ARKW, WCLD, QQQ\n\nPayments or Banks: SQ, PYPL, V, JPM, BAC \n\nBetting: GAN, DKNG, PENN\n\nChips: NVDA, AMD, MU\n\nEnergy: ENPH, NEE, PCG, FANG\n\nHealthcare: LVGO, TDOC, UNH, MOH, DHR, CATS, VEEV, MODN\n\nCovid: HOLX, NVAX, MRNA, INO, IBIO, AYTU, VBIV , TTOO\n\nEVs: TSLA, NIO, WKHS, FUV, GRAF, PLUG\n\nFANG stocks: MSFT, AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, FB\n\nSocial/Entertain: PINS, NFLX, ROKU\n\nCyber: PANW, ZS, CRWD, NET, PING, FNET, FEYE\n\nBeaten down (1 year recovery): WYNN, LVS, DAL, LUV, STWD, SPG, CAR, MAR, RCL\n\nMy Options are:\n1) Invest $10K into 50 stocks since I can\u2019t choose with all the confusion\n2) Choose 15 stocks and invest $30K each or so \n3) Invest more % in couple categories above like the FANG stocks, ETFs, EVs, and less in others \n4) Buy 100 shares of 15 or so from the above list and sell covered calls getting ~$4K per week (but with the limited upside of covered calls, downside will be the same as holding) \n5) Stay 50% or more cash since the market could crash given the high valuations, pandemic and election year \n6) Something else that you\u2019d do in my shoes",

The overarching theme behind these picks is **American Innovation &amp; Mexican Development.** \n\nI'm a 26 year old fintech engineer in the US and an avocado farmer in Mexico and I hold a strong conviction that investing in Mexican development will reward me well in the decades to come.  \n\n**In a nutshell, the USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring and my strategy favors the Texas-Nuevo Leon economy and overall Mexican-American trade.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is Monterrey, Nuevo Leon\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png))\n\n \n\nI'm from a rural village south of Jalisco which produces far more agricultural goods like avocados alongside Michoacan.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am very aware of the problems that Mexico faces but I also view Mexico as a sleeping giant that the US utilizes for capital efficiency in global trade. Mexico is part of a puzzle that fits in a large scope that involves other bulwark nations like Germany, Japan, Brazil, and India.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n!\\[Bulwark Trading Nations\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86080247-51709b00-ba47-11ea-8d38-54da06916f57.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86080247-51709b00-ba47-11ea-8d38-54da06916f57.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n!\\[The North American Trade Block\\]([https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40](https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the same time, Mexico is a nation in crisis. The economic damage narcotrafficking has delivered has resulted in:\n\n\\- \\[An increasing black market integration into the global money supply, in the order of hundreds of billions of dollars, resulting in a growing vacuum of theft AKA the Drug War &amp; Economics of Peace\\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank\\_Secrecy\\_Act#Sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Secrecy_Act#Sanctions))\n\n\\- North American suppressed wage suppression\n\n\\- refugee style illegal immigration\n\n\\- NA workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- Mexican workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- A Mexican workforce and brain drain, as skilled and motivated laborers leave for opportunity and better pay who are loyal to both nations\n\n\\- Multiple events of civil unrest or civil disasters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- National cyncism against the current administration\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see this as a complex problem where most people's perspective is not complete or clouded by one of the reasons above. I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

Thanks to its fintech, the company enables these same businesses to obtain trade finance and engage in global trade, treading where at least 60% of banks and trading companies won\u2019t in a $40 trillion industry.  This first mover aims to address the $1.5 trillion gap in SME trade finance.\n\nBetter yet, this industry disruptor has not only survived the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has thrived.  [Not least because it is based in Singapore, a solid financial hub with robust disease control measures.]\n\nTrade and trade finance will only migrate more and more to the online platform of this [\u201cmost innovative fintech company\u201d in Asia-Pacific](https://d2tyltutevw8th.cloudfront.net/media/document/press-release-the-innovators-2020-regional-winn-1588769601.pdf) (*Global Finance*).\n\nLater this very month, Triterras will enter into a definitive merger agreement with the 7th-ranking special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) on Robinhood\u2019s list of Blank Check Companies: Netfin Acquisition Corp ($NFIN).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8omJ_Hzz08M\n\n**TRANSACTION VALUES**\n\nPublished transaction values are as follows:\n\nPre-money equity value is approximately $670 million.\n\nPost money equity value is approximately $939 million.\n\nProposed enterprise value is approximately $995 million.\n\nTo put things into a conservative perspective:\n\nPre-money equity value to NFIN market cap ratio (7/02): 1.92\n\nPost-money equity value to NFIN market cap ratio (7/02): 2.69\n\nProposed enterprise value to NFIN market cap ratio (7/02): 2.85\n\n**GROWTH PROSPECTS**\n\nWhile already profitable at $87 million EBITDA and $46 million consolidated net income, Triterras is aiming to more than double these two performance measures by the end of their next fiscal year.  Of the $1.5 trillion gap in SME trade finance, it has addressed $4.1 billion, and aims to more than double this by the end of fiscal 2021.  That the company has three modules for its Kratos platform, [two more than the end of calendar 2019](https://www.gtreview.com/news/fintech/blockchain-fintech-triterras-goes-live-with-trade-finance-product-for-smes/), indicates its commitment to developing that platform further as part of its business growth story.\n\nSomething suggests that $NFIN\u2019s proposed enterprise value may be a discount on a growth company.  Its valuation seems to be based on a multiple of fiscal 2019 EBITDA, rather than on a multiple of sales.  It is definitely not based on a multiple of fiscal 2021 sales.\n\nOh, well.  Let that proposed enterprise value stand before the merger.  It just might go noticeably past that in the short term, even after all the equity dilution is said and done.\n\n*Disclosure: Long on $NFIN.*",

SPY holds 257 Billion. If this fund decides to move just .5% out of Microsoft they would be redistributing 1 billion amongst the lower tier stocks. Will they do this? why not? They do it regularly, the question is if enough funds and ETF's do it at once, will it boost some stock and suppress others?\n\nBack to microsoft. SPY had 81 million shares as of yesterday.

Would they boost top holdings right now having such a massive run? if your mandate is to have a diverse portfolio, I doubt it.\n\nThis trend in the SPY ETF reducing holdings over the last year is also true of Apple, and Facebook but not Amazon.\n\nComapnies I like with low weights barring that something crazy with the virus doesn't happen and JPow's printer doesn't get jammed:\n\nCalls on :KO, PFE, INTC,  MMM, RTX",

        "selftext": "TLDR: Is this a good time to start a retirement fund for my parents or should I wait till after election (around January) once the cloud clears? I will max their traditional IRA into 2 etfs (SPY and QQQ) and 3 stocks (MSFT, COST, JNJ).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSituation:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheyre in their mid 50s and I will help them manage it.  Jointly, they make about 54k net per year (after taxes, insurance etc) but they dont have any sort of retirement fund/emergency fund currently. They just starting now since we are immigrants and was able to settle down just recently. They have a monthly expense of about $2600 (this includes a mortgage of 30 more years and a car payment of 4 years). They love to work, so they will probably retire in their 70s. Overall, they will have about 1900 per month in saving. My sibling and I are done with college and have our own jobs now. We are still with them but we're financially independent and plan to settle on our once their retirement fund is smooth sailing which will probably increase their monthly expenses to 3000$ since we will be contributing less (we are willing to help them as much as we could so it could stay as it is or hopefully even less depending on our future financial situation). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlan:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth their 401k does not match so I am thinking of starting traditional IRA with schwab. My plan is to max out their traditional IRA (14k combined per year) and focus it into two ETFs (SPY and QQQ) and 3 stocks (MSFT, COST, JNJ). I will DCA equally into 5 on their red days. Overall, they will have 700$ per month left over (after retirement contribution with this plan and expenses) which they can use for leisure...or should I have them contribute some to 401k and/or roth?.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy rationale of starting now is I can have their retirement fund ride the recovery from the pandemic drop (roughly about 1/4 more left to V shape recovery). We can argue that there is another drop (which is very likely) but I am not worried since I am DCAing anyway and I dont think this \"2nd drop\" will be as bad as the first one (especially this election, i dont think the current admin will let this happen). Election aftermath is a different story. I dont know what to expect after election hence this post. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy investment choices rationale: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSPY - Diversified basket\n\nQQQ- Tech heavy growth basket (pandemic proof)\n\nMSFT - Tech growth (pandemic proof)\n\nCOST - retail growth (pandemic proof, arguably)\n\nJNJ - healthcare growth especially post pandemic (I am thinking of omitting this since I also feel this might be a risky choice for a late retirement account). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother route: Have their retirement fund professionally managed. If so where?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am thinking of asking this in other financial sub but my really concern here is my investment choices and timing (which i believe this sub has the best point of view/opinion on); time in the market is better than timing the market but I feel like timing for a late retirement account in this situation is especially important. I dont have much experience with the market (just recently started myself) but my educational background is enough to understand it and its caveats. Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

        "selftext": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-02/deutsche-bank-considers-financial-support-for-wirecard-bank-kc4tsbnd\n\nDeutsche Bank AG is weighing the acquisition of all or part of disgraced Wirecard AG\u2019s bank, potentially throwing the business a lifeline after one of the biggest corporate scandals in recent years.\n\nThe Frankfurt-based lender is in touch with regulator BaFin, Wirecard Bank\u2019s management board and administrators on possible further steps to help Wirecard\u2019s finance unit, a Deutsche Bank spokesman said by e-mail, without elaborating. Options include taking on pieces of Wirecard Bank or the unit in its entirety, people familiar with the matter said, adding that the lender is still debating other ways to help Wirecard Bank and hasn\u2019t made a final decision.\n\nDeutsche Bank had informal tie-up talks with the scandal-hit fintech last Spring, though it quickly broke off the preliminary discussions. Wirecard Bank -- which sat at the heart of the firm -- could be valuable to a potential acquirer because of its relationship with credit card companies Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and JCB International, which are also key to other parts of Wirecard.\n\nDeutsche Bank may also be hit if Wirecard Bank were to file for insolvency. Germany\u2019s deposit insurance scheme for private banks would have to make depositors whole if the lender didn\u2019t have enough funds of its own to repay them. That could lead to higher contributions from the scheme members, of which Deutsche Bank is the biggest and highest paying.\n\nWirecard filed for insolvency last week after saying that almost 2 billion euros ($2.25 billion) it previously reported as cash probably never existed, throwing the future of its banking and others businesses into doubt. The company faces a potential avalanche of lawsuits and former Chief Executive Officer Markus Braun was arrested, though he is now out on bail.\n\nWhile Wirecard Bank isn\u2019t part of the bankruptcy proceedings, the parent ceded control of funds last week after the financial regulator stepped in to prevent the money from being deployed elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWe are currently reviewing the possibility of providing Wirecard Bank AG with financial support,\u201d Deutsche Bank said. \u201cWe are in principle prepared to provide this support in the context of a continuation of business operations, if such assistance should become necessary.\u201d\n\nInsolvency administrator Michael Jaffe said on Wednesday that the assets he\u2019s trying to sell are attracting interest from numerous investors. He didn\u2019t say whether he intends to sell Wirecard Bank as well, though said the lender remains solvent.\n\nTo fuel its growth, Wirecard had been paying depositors attractive interest at a time when traditional banks increasingly started to pass on negative rates. This year, it began offering a 0.75% interest rate via its Boon app, betting that more deposits will translate into more payments via its systems and lucrative contracts with stores and online merchants.\n\nIn addition to the earlier talks on a possible tie-up, the two financial firms had others links. Deutsche Bank is part of a lending group of 15 banks that together are owed about 1.6 billion euros, Bloomberg has reported. CEO Christian Sewing has been trying to shift the lender away from its reliance on trading income toward a focus on processing payments for companies, and he\u2019s made the division responsible for the business -- known as Corporate Bank -- the centerpiece of his large restructuring plan.\n\nSewing has focused tech investment on the Corporate Bank but he has also said that the division is being challenged by the low interest-rate environment it\u2019s operating in.\n\nThe collapse of Wirecard has prompted criticism of regulators and soul-searching among Germany\u2019s elite grappling for answers over the failure of what was once one of its most lauded companies. BaFin President Felix Hufeld has acknowledged that his institution is among those to blame for not catching the irregularities, which he referred to as \u201cmassive fraud\u201d on Thursday in Frankfurt.",

We rallied a bit and finished only slightly better. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 yesterday and we closed $2.81 - .49 today.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,325 + 140. After trading back to 8985 we rallied back to close \u2013 only $5.  Since last week we have closed between 9200 \u2013 92.85 every day with narrow ranges and today was a good start to move higher.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC last Wednesday @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $9.77 + .17 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "Hello, Redditors,\n\nI have started investing a couple of years back. I had my fair share of gambling with penny stocks and other FOMO stocks. Finally settled on investing only in MSFT, APPL, GOOG, V, AMZN. Other stocks of interest are TSM, BABA, LUV, DIS. I have around 10k to invest, and I have been waiting on the sidelines watching stocks hit bottom in March and back to all-time highs again. And, I have decided to get into the market with the DCA approach. I am planning to buy $500 worth of stocks (fractional stocks - a mix of MSFT, APPL, GOOG, V, AMZN, TSM, LUV) on a weekly basis to hedge against volatility. So, my question is, is there a way to automate the process? Let's say if I want to buy 5 shares (fraction of each MSFT, APPL, GOOG, V, AMZN) I have to make 5 different orders.\n\nAlso, any suggestions my stock picks and DCA, in general, will be highly appreciated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.",

I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed.

The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I\u2019m bummed that I didn\u2019t hold any stock long term even though I was an early adopter of AMZN, NFLX etc. and being in tech I knew they were going to be big, even NVDA or SHOP couple years ago. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t want to lose the next 10-15 years. I want to invest in a disciplined way, buy around 20 stocks and then add on dips, So I\u2019ll keep around $100K cash. My big confusion is which 20 stocks to pick? I\u2019ve been reading here, checking TipRanks, have Motley fool advisor and the list I come up with is huge. I\u2019m pasting the symbols that have creeped into my planning spreadsheet below. Also I\u2019m confused whether to buy fewer stocks at higher investment or many at lower. Also whether more investment into the stable large names (MSFT, AMZN, AAPL) or more in relatively newer names (SE, DOCU, NET etc.) I\u2019ve searched many posts on the \u201c20 stock portfolio\u201d or such but my confusion will not go away. Hence I\u2019m posting here to hear from you directly. I\u2019m 42 years old, good stable job, will have $50K more to add to the portfolio every year. I\u2019m open to moderate risk. Help me with a 15-20 stock investment portfolio that I can hold long term and add on dips. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on my spreadsheet right now:\n\nNewer stars 2 yrs: SE, NET, CRWD, CHWY, FSLY, DDOG, TTD, ZS, TWLO, TEAM, SPLK, MDB, WORK, SHOP\n\nETFs: ARKK, ARKW, WCLD, QQQ\n\nPayments or Banks: SQ, PYPL, V, JPM, BAC \n\nBetting: GAN, DKNG, PENN\n\nChips: NVDA, AMD, MU\n\nEnergy: ENPH, NEE, PCG, FANG\n\nHealthcare: LVGO, TDOC, UNH, MOH, DHR, CATS, VEEV, MODN\n\nCovid: HOLX, NVAX, MRNA, INO, IBIO, AYTU, VBIV , TTOO\n\nEVs: TSLA, NIO, WKHS, FUV, GRAF, PLUG\n\nFANG stocks: MSFT, AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, FB\n\nSocial/Entertain: PINS, NFLX, ROKU\n\nCyber: PANW, ZS, CRWD, NET, PING, FNET, FEYE\n\nBeaten down (1 year recovery): WYNN, LVS, DAL, LUV, STWD, SPG, CAR, MAR, RCL\n\nMy Options are:\n1) Invest $10K into 50 stocks since I can\u2019t choose with all the confusion\n2) Choose 15 stocks and invest $30K each or so \n3) Invest more % in couple categories above like the FANG stocks, ETFs, EVs, and less in others \n4) Buy 100 shares of 15 or so from the above list and sell covered calls getting ~$4K per week (but with the limited upside of covered calls, downside will be the same as holding) \n5) Stay 50% or more cash since the market could crash given the high valuations, pandemic and election year \n6) Something else that you\u2019d do in my shoes",

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy. It is certainly in a golden era of sorts, and Mexico reflects as a nation in decline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# The Economic Framework\n\nI am selecting industries that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Empower the US and have a rippling effect on Mexico\n\n\\- Will fundamentally continue to build and grow the future global supply\n\n\\- Are friendly to primarily German/Euro and Japanese/Asian trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# My Portfolio Structure\n\nThere are two systems at play at the same time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 12 Primary Asset Collection - these are stocks I regularly invest in.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082755-62bca600-ba4d-11ea-8857-95e902f8d0ce.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082755-62bca600-ba4d-11ea-8857-95e902f8d0ce.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 12 Competitor Arenas (Cloud Infrastructure Group) - these are stocks that are competing for Primary Asset Allocation each quarter and receive less allocation.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082923-c3e47980-ba4d-11ea-9543-b31eb000962d.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082923-c3e47980-ba4d-11ea-9543-b31eb000962d.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I own 12 primary companies.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed.

The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.
