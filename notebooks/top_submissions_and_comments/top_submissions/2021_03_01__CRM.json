        "selftext": "Hey there folks! Today I want to talk to you about what\u2019s really going on in the stock market and what we should expected next\u2026\n\n**\\[Don't Read/Dislike Before Reading - Very Long Post\\]**\n\nSo, in the last couple of weeks, we have seen a very fast correction in the tech heavy Nasdaq [Index](https://imgur.com/aK26hjA) after the bond yields rapidly spiked over 1.5% for the 10y, as a lot of investors kept getting spooked by the employment numbers coming in slightly better than expected, though many important things are still hidden in those numbers.\n\nFor example, last week we saw the US gaining almost 400K jobs, but this barely moved the unemployment [rate](https://imgur.com/7PJTWUA) which still stands at 6.2% (and this doesn\u2019t even include people who just quit searching for jobs). Almost all of the job [gains](https://imgur.com/B3av5gb) were seen in the leisure and hospitality sector, which has started to regain some momentum after it was the most affected by the events of last year, as this sector is still down more than 3.5M jobs since a year ago.\n\nThese past weeks we also [saw](https://imgur.com/yeudkin) jobless claims continuing to go down, with the latest initial jobless claims coming in at the lowest level since last early last year at just over 700K, as the continuing jobless claims also coming in at just over 4.1M.\n\nBut guys, regardless of the jobs &amp; unemployment numbers, the main thing that will keep investors on edge will continue to be treasury [yields](https://imgur.com/rDjy9fO), the interest rates and how this are affected by the inflation [numbers](https://imgur.com/awXUGgw) which are expected to see a huge bump in the next months as we will have very low comps compared to last year when we saw the rona starting to pick up steam.\n\nWe can see [here](https://imgur.com/QbuiSot) the core inflation came lower this month with an increase of just .1% which jolted the stock market and started a recovery after the sell-off in the past weeks.\n\nGiven that tech names &amp; EVs were some of the biggest hit stocks we should also take a quick look at NIO, as the company lost almost half of its value in the past month, dropping from over $66 to just $35 after the big sell off in the past weeks.\n\nNIO\u2019s drop was also amplified probably by the fact that they posted mixed [results](https://imgur.com/t0jRJEW) for the 4th quarter of last year, as they just missed the top line but did manage to post a solid beat on the company\u2019s bottom line, losing just $0.14/share.\n\nInvestors might not have been happy to see a guidance of just 15% above their 4th quarter given the huge valuation and expectations of the company and the huge global chip shortage that will limit NIO\u2019s production capacity to just 7.5K in the 2nd quarter of 2021.\n\nI still have a mixed opinion about NIO\u2019s stock, but after this huge sell-off, it has become more attractive given the continued [growth](https://imgur.com/cI1TNWJ) of sales the company has seen in the last years, while I also believe NIO will remain one of the winners of the EV disruption.\n\nThe other stock that I wanted to mention after what has happened in the past weeks is Zoom.\n\nI really like Zoom\u2019s products and I understand the hype of the stock, but I also really believe they will struggle to keep the huge growth rate going, as the company might have seen its peak growth after the massive work-from-home movement in 2020.\n\n[Zoom](https://imgur.com/UygZxJZ) also reported a beat on the top &amp; bottom line and I expect them to continue to have another great first half to start 2021, but after that, the company will have very though comps to go against, which might really put some downward pressure on the stock, especially as more people go back to their workplaces.\n\nYou can see, even the company doesn\u2019t expect the huge growth to continue, with the revenue growth expected to only slightly continue to grow during 2021.\n\nZoom is valued at almost $100B which is really hard to justify unless the company continues to innovate and bring more &amp; more products to the market, as the industry they operate in will only become more competitive over time with other big players like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce &amp; many others looking to take market share.\n\nGuys, if you are still in doubt about what to do next in the stock market, you should just take a look at the chart below and start thinking long term, because investing, if you are really looking to make money is all about the long-term.\n\nYou can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/ZlO593t) in the past 100 years we've had 8 bear markets previous to the one we saw in 2020, with the average bear market lasting just 1.4years compared to over 9 years for every bull market with a staggering difference in gains vs losses as well.\n\nWe can also see in this [chart](https://imgur.com/wM39iSQ) that it only took 15 days for the Nasdaq to enter a 10% correction this time, but you can see the average 12 month return after a 10% correction is almost 30% which is huge, with the likelihood of the index posting a positive return in the next 12 months standing at over 90%\n\nSo, given that we had a bear market last year, I believe it\u2019s highly unlikely that we will see a huge drop in stocks even if yields continue to rise, as the real return of the treasury yields will continue to be close to 0, as I don\u2019t expect them to jump more than 2% for the 10y anytime soon.\n\nMoving on, I recently saw some [comments](https://imgur.com/I3ijkKT) made by David Tepper which I wasn\u2019t really aware of but which made a lot of sense to me, he highlighted that the other downward pressure put on treasury yields, which will keep them in check, will come from investors in other countries like Japan, Germany &amp; many others, as the US treasuries have become way more attractive than others.\n\nOne other thing that I think should be mentioned is that the [Dow Jones](https://imgur.com/undefined) has continued to make new high after new high in the past week, being led by companies like Disney which has just surpassed 100M [subscribers](https://imgur.com/fCTDNGX) on their Disney+ platform while also getting a boost from their other revenue streams starting to come back online, and of course the stock that has led the DOW in the past week, Boeing, as the [company](https://imgur.com/K6SPGY1) had more sales than cancellations for the first time since November 2019 as the 737 MAX crisis is finally starting to fade away for the company, with even more possible [deals](https://imgur.com/4XYgfs9) likely to close in the next period, as airlines start to have a better view of what the future will bring for them.\n\nFriends, you shouldn\u2019t be scared of stock market corrections or dips as we have [seen](https://imgur.com/74dAwZO) a 10% pullback once every 11 months as you can see, with the frequency of bigger crashes decreasing significantly, but as always, because we are highly emotional beings, it\u2019s very hard for us to handle our emotions after a series of red days.\n\nYou should remember though, most often than not, the best way to go is just to ride out the dip and even starting deploying more cash into the stock market the more it drops. I think you should develop a strategy of not selling on big red days and deploying an increasingly higher % of your cash into great stocks the more the stock market drops.\n\nI also fully expect some part of the next stimulus check, which was just signed by Biden, to end up in the stock market, which might help push the stock market on the right path despite increasing pressures from rising yields and possible short-term inflation fears.\n\n**So just to end this post guys, is the stock market going to crash? My short answer is NO!**\n\nI don\u2019t expect that to happen any time soon. Even if we continue to see volatility in the stock market you should use that to your advantage and smartly deploy cash into great companies, which leads me to my other question, should you buy stocks today? Well, at the moment of writing this post, futures are currently trending down pre-market (SP &amp; Nasdaq in the Red, Dow +0.2%) and If they continue to do so it might be a good chance to deploy some cash, but don\u2019t rush into the first red day you see, slowly build your positions or add to them. As a rule of thumb, I like to buy more once a 5% dip occurs in the stock market and slowly deploy cash the more it drops.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "New company listings are always exciting and I generally try to keep track of any big news surrounding unicorns. These days I look at the recent IPO filings on Nasdaq.com and all I see is a sea of SPAC haha.\n\n\nI made a list in December of 2020 and with Roblox crossed off after their recent IPO I thought I'd share the next 5 in line and see if anybody wanted to share theirs as well. In addition to the unicorns, there are a ton of companies with potential out there that most people aren't too familiar with, so if you think you've got a 3, 5, or even 10 bagger then drop your names below!\n\n\nMine are as follows:\n\n\n1. Applovin\n\n1.45B revenue in 2020. Basically a company that helps app developers promote their app, acquire users, and monetize their app. Growing at a fast pace and has achieved profitability every year except for 2020 due to aggressive content acquisition and expansion. \n\n\n2. Vizio\n\n2B revenue in 2020. This company is a household name and doesn't have the flashy revenue growth as other tech companies that are recently IPO-ing. But the idea that this company is going for is that they hope to model themselves after ROKU. They have a very high quality SmartTV OS and TV manufacturing line that is already vertically integrated, and they hope to expand by monetizing their Vizio SmartTV OS the same way Roku does- basically by SVOD, advertising, and selling user data. We'll see if it can catch ROKU in this market segment. \n\n\n3. Nextdoor\n\nJust going out on a limb but I think COVID helped people who normally ignore their neighbors get to know them a bit better. Especially if you live in a condo/apartment or whatever. Nextdoor is a nifty app that lets people connect with their physical neighbors and communities, and I think COVID was just the right catalyst for them to take off. There's not much on this company that I could find regarding their financials unfortunately, but apparently at their last funding round in late 2019 they were valued at 2B, and apparently are looking for a valuation of maybe 5B in 2021. \n\nI am bullish though as Sarah Friar is heading Nextdoor. CFO of Square, Senior VP at Salesforce, and served on the Board of Directors of Walmart and Slack. Banking background. Very confident in her abilities to drive the vision of the company forward. \n\n4. This one was tough, but I think Olo is a great high upside pick. Olo builds the software and platform that connects restaurants to users. Notable brands that use them include the Cheesecake Factory, Shake Shack, Wingstop, and Dennys. They can help build apps, order tracking software, and delivery coordination platforms for restaurants. \n\n\nThere are some more high profile ones like Databricks, UIPath, Coinbase, Robinhood, and Instacart that aren't listed above but I wanted to share some lesser known ones.",

I don't own any Palantir and this is my own opinion and not financial advice. Am trying to determine if i should invest.\n\nI get what Palantir does in terms of a business model. I also saw a post here comparing to $CRM, and here is where i need some help.\n\nLooking at palantir's [10-k](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/97b89af1-0ad9-4daf-a411-6ca576744e7e.pdfhttp://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/97b89af1-0ad9-4daf-a411-6ca576744e7e.pdf), pg 111, 112\n\ncash is 2b+, likely from the public listing, double 2019, a plus.\n\nRevenue is 1.1b up from 742mm in 2019, and i believe guidance for 2021 was another 45% also good.\n\nThey only problem i have is stock compensation. I know the company went public and that's a large reason for the number, because if you focus on including it, they has a loss of 1.1b for the year. In of itself as a growth company i get, the only concern is the comparison to $CRM.\n\n$CRM currently puts much of their salary expense into this category, and is maintaining the the business through acquisition. They've been hit hard in earnings as a result 260--&gt;220 and maybe lower? (keep growing revenue, but profit isn't materializing, and they are categorizing stock comp as CapEx because their employees derive compensation (in sales anyway) via stock\n\nhas anybody noticed anything similar on $PLTR?\n\ni'm assuming if they deliver on estimates, that's $40 per share by the end of year if not 50 conservatively, but another bout of stock comp will drag the stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: after going through the comments, in for 200 shares at 24.5, and will average in.\n\nedit 2: Picked up 10c LEAPS.",

        "selftext": "Been watching CRM for about a week. Did some digging on the stock because the price is 25% below it\u2019s 52 wk high right now.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how to feel. Most of the articles I\u2019ve read only offer one sentence type explanation for why the price is down so much. So I thought it\u2019d be cool to ask y\u2019all.\n\nBear Case:\n\n- It has a ~50 P/E which is super high for a value stock but maybe average for a tech growth stock. \n\n- Up about 40% YTD (Reference SP500 is up ~50% and QQQ is up ~70%)\n\n- TA shows pretty clear 6 month bearish channel \n\n- Bond yields rising so growth stocks are taking a hit. CRM down ~12% (reference QQQ down ~6%)\n\nBull Case:\n\n- Goldman just moved CRN into their conviction but category. The average analyst rating implied an upside of ~20%.  \n\n- CRM seems to be a dominant leader in CRM and SaaS. \n\n- Has grown revenue ~30% YoY. Super crazy profit margins (don\u2019t remember exact numbers but ~ 60%). Very low debt and asset/liabilities.\n\n\nI should note that my source for the second point in the Bull case is from a couple YouTube videos and articles I\u2019ve looked at; I\u2019m not an expert so I wasn\u2019t able to make sense of Salesforce lead in CRM or SaaS yet.\n\nBut yeah.

        "selftext": "So I posted this on /alpp, and well, got told to post it on here, so, here we go.\n\nSo, this is a basic \"DD\" to explain to people about the company, basically, i'll explain each of the subsidiaries and try to keep as up to date as possible, this is all whilst Alpine 4 Holdings, Inc (which i'll simplify to $ALPP going forward) is currently in the process of being uplisted to Nasdaq, as opposed to OTCQB.\n\n**Before I start, I do hold a position in ALPP, this is all my due diligence following several hours of researching, if you're looking to invest, be aware of the risks in investing in any company, especially one as volatile as a OTCQB stock, all of these are my own opinions and not financial advice, the value of a stock can go up aswell as down and you may lose money, please consult a financial advisor before investing to understanding the risks.**\n\nSo, to start, currently Alpine 4 Holdings is a holding company, which is a company comprised of multiple separate companies, under one umbrella, currently it consists of 8 separate companies (this is including the merger of Deluxe Sheet Metal and Morris Sheet Metal Corp - [source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alpine-4-holdings-inc-alpp-123000378.html)).\n\nThese companies are as follows, which will include a little about each of the holdings, and what they do, and any numbers I can find.\n\n\\--\n\nFirstly, we have **Alita Corp** \\- **Altia Corp** is an automotive technology company with products in the Connected Car and Vehicle Safety markets, basically, it's all about the brakes with these guys, they've patented what they call the \"Brake Active\", which consists of two patents that they hold, to summarize what brake active is, it's as follows;\n\nBrake Active is a safety enhancement product that causes the 3rd brake light in a vehicle to pulse when the brake pedal is depressed. A NHTSA Study has shown that 90% of all rear-end Collisions could be avoided with just one more second of warning.\n\nSo where does this make money, good question, the way they make money will reside in the licensing of the IP directly to manufacturers, who will deploy Brake Active directly into their product lineups, potentially realizing tens of millions of Brake Active units sold annually, which in itself is accessing a $20 billion market in automotive products, some further information is [here](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/alpine-4-alpp-receives-second-patent-approval-for-their-brake-active-product-2021-01-26?siteid=bigcharts&amp;dist=bigcharts&amp;tesla=y), this is a post from 26/01/2021 in relation to their second granted patent, and it explains the whole company MO very well.\n\n\\--\n\nSecondly, we have **SpectrumEbos, Inc.** SpectrumEbos is an Enterprise Business Operating System that combines key software components that maximize efficiency and visibility, leading to increased productivity. Spectrum tethers management reporting and collaborative tool sets so progress is easy to follow. Spectrum is embedded into a robust BlockChain ledger system.\n\nThis is set to launch in 2021, it is anticipated that SPECTRUMebos will be a pivotal solution of the small and mid-cap public sector companies as it pertains to operating their businesses and complying with the scrutiny of public filings.\n\nKey Components of **SpectrumEbos**:\n\n* Accounting and Financial Reporting of an Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP)\n* Business Intelligence (Bi) platform\n* Customer Resource Management (CRM) hub\n* Document Management System (DMS)\n\n**SpectrumEbos** is basically $ALPPs way of tracking progression of Impossible Aerospace and Vayu as they go through the production process at Quality Circuit Assembly and can provide accounting/auditing services for other subsidiaries, it's all about that integrated business structure, which reduces costs.\n\nSources [here](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alpine-4-technologies-spectrumebos-a-blockchain-enabled-enterprise-business-operating-system-set-for-2021-public-launch-301000473.html).\n\n\\--\n\nNext we have **Impossible Aerospace**, I feel we could go on about this company for ages, but basically, in a nut shell, 70+ Minute Lifetime, A Performance Drone for First Responders and one of the key things that $ALPP is big on, is it's made in USA.\n\nA little bit about **Impossible Aerospace** and it's major product, the US-1.\n\n* Founded in 2016 by former Tesla engineer Spencer Gore, the company unveiled its US-1 aircraft in 2018, unique for its long endurance and US origin.\n* The company received financial backing from Bessemer Venture Partners, Eclipse Venture and Airbus Ventures during their start-up phase. IA\u2019s patent-pending battery technology enables unprecedented industry leading flight times of 70+ minutes.\n* Impossible Air Support allows you to send flight ready drones to 911 calls and other emergencies to get eyes on scene withing seconds (some press regarding first responses [here](https://impossible.aero/2020/03/impossible-aerospace-unveils-drones-that-respond-to-911-calls/) and [here](https://impossible.aero/2019/04/drone-assist-campbell-swat-team/))\n* You can deploy from rooftops or from mobile command centers that can be positioned in high crime areas or any remote location.\n\nThis is one of $ALPPs major holdings, and what I believe to be one of the biggest growth markets for ALPP going forward as a holding company.\n\n\\--\n\nNext, I couldn't talk about **Impossible Aerospace** without including **Vayu Inc.**\n\nTo quote the company themselves;\n\n&gt;Vayu\u2019s mission is to solve the hardest and most critical logistics challenges, anywhere in the world. We aim to set the standard and lead the market in safe, reliable, and affordable VTOL aircraft.\n\nBasically, the major drones that Vayu has, are the X5, G1 and G2 aircraft, and these aircraft are chunky, and I mean genuinely chunky aircraft, some facts are as follows:\n\n* 44lb payload capacity drone.\n* TESLA FOUNDER\u2019S Martin Eberhard and Marc Terpenning are heavy investors.\n* Partnership with Bill &amp; Melinda Gates foundation aswell as Verizon ([here](https://www.vayu.us/), at the very bottom it's listed as partners).\n\nThis company is why I invested in ALPP, it's got a pay range of 5lb - 45lb and a life of 10 hours (attempt of breaking the world record [here](https://www.accesswire.com/628045/Alpine-4-ALPP-Drone-Subsidiary-Vayu-Looks-to-Set-a-World-Record-With-Their-Autonomous-Delivery-G1-Aircraft)), which is one of the market leaders, and allows for such a broad range of applications, from disaster efforts, to logistical applications.\n\n\\--\n\nSo next we have **Quality Circuit Assembly Inc**, founded in 1988, this one, expect a lot of boasting about numbers here, they're bringing in good contracts here.\n\nQCA provides electronic contract manufacturing solutions for customers via strategic business partnerships. From initial prototype to turnkey production, QCA offers clients a wide range of services, affording them cost savings through the benefits of vertical integration.\n\nSome of the services they offer are as follows:\n\n* **PCB assembly**\n* **Turnkey and consigned assembly**\n* **Full production runs**\n* **Cable and harness assembly**\n* **Box builds**\n* **Product testing**\n* **Conformal coating**\n\nThey're highly accredited, a list of certifications they hold are [here](https://www.qcamfg.com/certifications/)\n\nNow I said I had some numbers to throw about, and I do, Quality Circuit Assembly (QCA) has received an additional $1 million in new orders for Q1 &amp; Q2 on top of the $1.5 million in new orders received in December 2020 and early January 2021. ([here](https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/940831/alpine-4-holdings-says-quality-circuit-assembly-subsidiary-has-received-an-additional-1million-in-new-orders-for-q1--q2-940831.html))\n\nIt's expected that QCA projects to report $2.8 million to $3 million which is a 35% increase over Q1 and Q2. QCA\u2019s leadership team attributes the increase in revenue to the addition of new technology customers who have been able to help counteract the effect the pandemic has had on some of QCA\u2019s longtime customer base. (yoinked straight from the website [here](https://www.alpine4.com/alpine-4s-alpp-subsidiary-quality-circuit-assembly-inc-qca-expects-to-report-strong-q3-demand-from-its-technology-customers/))\n\nQCA also completed $1.2M in projects for these Fortune 500 EV customers in Q4 2020.\n\n\\--\n\nHere we have a 2 for 1, following the most recent merger of **Deluxe Sheet Metal** and **Morris Sheet Metal**, i'll give you a basic lowdown of both of them together, to avoid overcluttering..\n\nMorris Sheet Metal (MSM) is a full-service HVAC Contractor offering design, fabrication and installation services.\n\nSince 1971, Indiana based Deluxe Sheet Metal (DSM), has specialized in all aspects of Commercial and Industrial Sheet Metal installations.\n\nBasically, before I give a few numbers I found in regards to contracts, this should explain the merger between the two companies.\n\n&gt;Announces the combination of subsidiaries Deluxe Sheet Metal, Inc. (Deluxe) and Morris Sheet Metal Corporation (Morris) to become one of the largest sheet metal contractors in the Midwest region of the United States. Both companies will be under the Morris Sheet Metal brand. Deluxe and Morris are expected to be fully integrated by May 2021.  \nThis merger will allow us to leverage complementary strengths between the two companies. Deluxe Sheet Metal can trace its roots back to the 1950's and is known in the industry as the go-to contractor for high-tech thermal management. Its customers range from the University of Notre Dame to GE and many other top-tier companies in the Midwest. The company recently built one of the largest crypto currency mining facilities in the Midwest, requiring precise thermal management. Morris Sheet Metal is the preferred contractor for one of the largest hospital networks in Indiana. During 2020 and the COVID 19 epidemic, Morris was responsible for building hundreds of isolation rooms. The combined company anticipates the benefits of that merger to drop the General &amp; Administrative expenses by almost 7% in the first 12 months after the transaction. We also expect our gross profit margin to increase as our Material Cost of Goods will decrease by 5% due to increased purchasing power. The combined companies should reach revenues in excess of $50M, without major capital investments, within the next 36 months.\" ([here](https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/940831/alpine-4-holdings-says-quality-circuit-assembly-subsidiary-has-received-an-additional-1million-in-new-orders-for-q1--q2-940831.html))\n\nBasically, it means that revenues should be in excess of $50 million within 36 months, from one singular subsidiary, and allows them to better work together, to achieve a better symbiotic relationship between the two companies.\n\nCurrent contracts also include a $2.9 Million contract for Morris Sheet Metals ([here](https://www.alpine4.com/alpine-4-holdings-alpp-subsidiary-morris-sheet-metal-awarded-2-9m-in-new-building-projects-with-their-food-processing-and-healthcare-clientele/)).\n\n\\--\n\nThe next one will be a briefer one, **JTD Spiral, inc** is the sister company of Morris Sheet Metal, to specialize in producing spiral ducts, oval ducts, and dual wall ducts. Around ten years ago, as Morris Sheet Metal was rapidly expanding, so was their usage of the spiral duct. An opportunity was recognized to be more cost-effective.\n\n\\--\n\nFinally, the last holding (as of 15/03/2021) is **Excel Fabrication LTD,** some advantages of using this company is they have a 12' Accrupress hydraulic press brake, a 10' hydraulic shear, a 5' plate roll, a 60 ton hydraulic iron worker, several smaller support tools and equipment, along with several welding machines in various sizes for the different applications and processes. We have a 20,000 sqf fabrication facility, and additional 3,000 sqf storage facility dock accessible, with a large lay down area outside which is fenced off and accessible by trucks for storage and safe keeping of materials and finished products.\n\nHowever, one key note to take in regards to Excel is partnered with Varco Pruden Buildings (VP Steel) as a supplier of steel structures for commercial buildings. Excel holds general contracting licenses in several states and continues to expand its footprint. This partnership allows Excel to offer competitive pricing being both the supplier and contractor. VP Steel applications are used\u00a0 in industries such as agriculture, automotive, churches, distribution, government, manufacturing, retrofit and retail spaces with certified energy efficiency and numerous certifications such as UL and US army corps of engineers.\n\n\\--\n\nTo conclude, Alpine 4 Holdings, Inc, is a company that is focused on growth and creating good quality US made products, it has contracts with Fortune 500 Companies, and has just paid down $12.5 million of debt.\n\nDo I think this could be a good company, honestly, yes, i'm not going to go hyping it up, because i'm sure it has it's flaws, but for what it's claiming to be, for what markets it's planning to go into, I think it's genuinely going to leave a footprint in that, it's going into a market (drones) that is expected to be a very lucrative market, especially in the logistical sector and their need to improve efficiently.\n\nSure, it sucks that Nasdaq is taking it's sweet time, but, honestly, this company has incredible growth potential, and it's stated it's planning to expand into the defense sector, and it's just got $50M in funding, so honestly, i'm optimistic.\n\nApologies if it's a bit rough and not as fully fleshed out as i'd like it to be, it's currently 1.30am and I have been staring at this screen for way to long.\n\nRemember, investing isn't a guaranteed return on your money, think rationally, and don't invest on emotions.\n\nFeel free to include any further DD. :)",

        "selftext": "What do you think will be SNOW's growth and trajectory in the next months, and next year?  \nI saw a few posting buying puts pre-earnings, some positive talk but overall little hype except about the lockup end happening on 3/6. So far SNOW is victim of its success with cautious bullishness from analysts, preventing  the market from pushing the stock up like ZM... maybe its growth is a bit more predictable.  \n\n\n* Quarter results are in, good as expected:  \nQ4'20:  \nrevenue $190M (+117% YoY, beats $178.5M consensus)  \nlosses -70c/share (vs $-1.67 a year ago, but consensus was an optimistic -17c/share)  \nnet loss $199M (vs $83M a year ago)  \nQ1'21 guidance:  \nrevenue of $195\\~$200M (+92% YoY)  \n2021 guidance:  \nrevenue of $1B\\~1.02B (+82% YoY) - is that really too bearish?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/osfm6yvr63l61.png?width=1362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4df483eda886911de0ef5a0b0e7c617fc4813202\n\nAnalysts are cautiously optimistic, because the valuation is high but the prospects also very high so it's hard to put a price tag, just like buying a house when the market's hot:  \n[https://www.thestreet.com/investing/snowflake-gets-cautious-support-from-analysts](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/snowflake-gets-cautious-support-from-analysts)  \nAt $71B market cap/$250 share, and a nearly 2X growth prospect, that's 70X 2021 earnings 35X 2022, 20X 2023... Maybe we can assume growth slows around 5B to 10B aka 10% of TAM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Does the employee lock up really matter ?\n\nLockup ends this week. The vast majority of the shares are held by VCs, the CEO &amp; founders, etc. the hands of a very few. Those shares will likely never see the market, as they're controlling shares. Original B shares had also 10 voting rights, and needed to be converted to single voting right A shares to trade, but it looks like they're disolving this structure. Will these billionaires sell lots of shares? no. And if they do they'll have to disclose. Snowflake has few employees and they don't hold that many shares so would they really influence the market selling? Also would they sell at $250 lows? Is this deadline just FUD fuel?  \n\n\n* I like the stock.\n\nI'm personally very bullish on the company's future. I like its culture  and the product, I  trust the founders who've worked hand in hand with the angel investor VCs along the way, and I believe they're passionate about the company and product. IDK about the CEO who was brought in later - because of his track record. There's tons of ex Oracle employees working there who understand the business and the customers (it's a customer centric company).  \nFor me their product is this : it's a classic SQL OLAP database in the cloud that's elastic, with easy management, which has many plugins to do data mining and AI, and fine controls for sharing securely parts of tables (that's big for security inside a company AND for selling data). It is secure enough to be certified to hold medical (HIPAA) and banking data (CapitalOne!). It's also an \"ACID\" transactional database, and its SQL language superset is rich enough to facilitate migration from other vendors like Terradata, Redshift, Oracle, etc. That'll be key to migrate customers from legacy on-prem solutions to cloud.  \nUnfortunately it is not an OLTP database so it can't tap customers sensitive to query latency. It's also likely not the fastest to store and manipulate text like logs, though it can handle large JSON and XML data fine, it shines in columnar data.  \nWhy it's hot I think is it bring old school SQL to the next century as a compatibility story, where other map-reduce cloud solutions failed to become ubiquitous because it was too hard to migrate.  \nThe big 3 (AMZ, GOOG, MSFT) provide similar offerings BUT AFAIK, they do so packaging old school on-prem databases into cloud servers, so it's a kludge to make it work and the customer ends up dealing with it when they try to use the scalable \"elastic\" part, aka hiring very skilled DBA engineers. There's a reason SNOW customers like the product, stick there and buy more. It's not just because it's cheaper, it's also easier.  \nDatabases are the foundations to build on top of, and all businesses need to buy strong foundations, SNOW is such an offering with a few years of lead time vs competition in terms of tech. I believe the addressable market (TAM) is like many 10's or 100's of billions estimated with a handful of big players. \"Big data\" and \"cloud\" have been buzz words since Y2K, but that revolution happening now.  \nI have a feeling Snow was at the sweet spot: not too early that it needs to justify why you want to buy the product, and not too late to justify why to use them vs other established vendors. I feel it will be one of the mammoths. :)  \n\n\n* Why I care?\n\nI am overweight on those shares and I need to decide when to sell &amp; diversify my savings. I still feel Snow might be the next CRM or ORCL growth story, but did it just start too hot? Will it go back to $420 within a few month? How good do the news have to be? I certainly don't feel I want to sell at $250, it feels I could be on a rocket's passenger seat waiting for liftoff and I don't want to miss that... At $350? Hmmm... maybe I'm willing to miss some of the liftoff, and diversify to protect myself if SNOW actually trips :P At $420? I definitely would diversify.  \n\n\n* Palantir\n\nIDK why there's way more hype on Palantir than snowflake on reddit, and why they're compared so much. Maybe it's PLTR's valuation? What's Palantir's addressable market and its competition? Palantir I feel is more of an end user product to do analytics with custom plumbing behind, but I don't really understand their business  value add and how it's different from say Looker or Tableau, and if Palantir's value add is relevant if the data is in a database format compatible with standard tools, which should be the case for most non-gov customers.",

        "selftext": "So, i want to talk about Big Tech's unloved little brother (other than Facebook (aha!)), and that's obviously Salesforce.\n\nLet's talk fundamentals, because fundamentals are what we should speak about and I am more of a fundamental player than a technical one. And fundamentally, Marc Benioff has kept to and maintained his 20% YoY revenue growth. The last three quarters, especially, have been gigantic in terms of earnings, as Salesforce has significantly beat Earnings due to the pandemic boost.\n\nFurthermore, margin expansion also beat expectations. Furthermore, what that means is that when revenue growth inevitably dips below twenty percent sometime in the next few years, margin growth should keep earnings growth above 20 percent well in the future. Margin expansion should be helped by WFH after the pandemic, as Salesforce reduces workspace to accommodate (something it has mentioned it will be doing).\n\nThe acquisitions that Salesforce has made, while perhaps too generous, ensure that there is retention of top executives because they buy in. It also allows for upselling, and that's huge for us because like, like Microsoft, it can keep you within its ecosystem. As customer retention is above -90  percent-, this allows for sticky customers... And this will likely continue to grind higher.\n\nFurthermore, Salesforce dominates the SFA space but only has 30 percent of the market in a highly fragmented and still growing space.\n\nSalesforce's projected acquisition of Slack was a very large drag, and the general selloff of the tech sector has provided a huge downward push unto Salesforce. I think that critics have been proven wrong about Benioff's prior acquisitions, and that acquiring companies always suffer a short term drag to their stock before gaining upward momentum because of it. Slack's earnings are tomorrow, and should definitely beat last quarter's EPS which was positive. I expect that Slack will have an amazing quarter, much as other WFH companies have had, and that will prove to be a positive catalyst on Salesforce Stock.\n\nAnalysts have a consensus price target of 270.75. Morningstar has one at 265. The price right now is a touch under 206. That's huge upside, and a positive catalyst could cause an upward explosion in the stock. It doesn't even have to be micro, but macro, with passage of the stimulus bill which congress says it will pass mid march. Heck, even a  more micro focused easing of tension regarding interest rates would cause a significant upward momentum. Salesforce is oversold.\n\nI bought 3 March 19 calls to allow them to print, and I also have 14 shares. \n\nMy positions are:\n\n[CRM - $205.70 | Robinhood and 18 more pages - Personal - Microsoft\u200b Edge (gyazo.com)](https://gyazo.com/e695d1f42ecc13d8789be0a00966e894)\n\n[Merrill Edge - Account and 21 more pages - Personal - Microsoft\u200b Edge (gyazo.com)](https://gyazo.com/7782af3825e3f513fb0efa9286ed77ef)",

        "selftext": "DISCLOSURE I own 10,000 SHARES of $FTOC may add more or the warrants in the future if price continues to decline. \n\rThe 1 sentence conclusion is that at $11 a share $FTOC seems to provide a good risk/reward. Below I provide a more detailed explanation, the real version would take me 20 pages but this version is for THE REDDITORS!!!\n\rSo, in the past here I have posted about $COTY and $APPH but what many of you may not know about me is that I have been involved in the digital coin and payments space for the past 5 years and have been using Payoneer for years to pay contractors.  Nevertheless, Payoneer is more than that. I understand that at first glance it looks like just another Paypal which is fine because PayPal has been growing and is profitable, even though it took a bit of a hiatus once it was owned by EBAY (Ebay was right to buy them but wrong to not let them grow freely as they could after the spin-off).  \n\rAnyway, I see so many possibilities for Payoneer that I think many are not being considering at all.  Not only is the business going to be growing at LEAST 25% for the next few years but I think it can expand 35% to 50% per year for the next 3 to 5 given the massive shift of online transactions but also new services. To simplify, adding more services to cater their current customers helps them bring in new customers which nets them more revenues and profits. \r\n\nThe issue with Payoneer has been that they never had enough capital to grow or to provide their customers more. It takes a long time to build a really robust and safe payments platform. Payoneer has been around for more than 10 years and it took a lot of capital and development hours to get to where they are today.  The business was limited to transactional growth which is fine but when that is like a profit of like 0.5% (as most goes to the credit card companies or banks) it is hard to grow or ever be profitable.  So, Payoneer for years has been in this stunted growth because of lack of capital or because they are in markets that were \u201chigh risk\u201d, like not being in the USA vs. being in the Ukraine.\n\rI think there are many reasons they did a SPAC and if I were to top it off it is because they failed to do an IPO a long time ago, capital is expensive via private transactions and it would never be enough.  So, yes they could have done raises of $50mm every year but in this type of industry when you have so many competitors who have tens of billions of revenues and hundreds of billions of transaction volume you need a lot more to be able to compete.  $500 million makes you a pretty major player in the game vs. struggling with small raises.  Definitely not ideal for shareholders but in the long-term it is the best way to assure your business can compete at the very least survive.   \n\rWhen I usually look into these stock ideas or analysis I go through a process but here on REDDIT I feel I need to provide a sort of cliffs notes because I can really go into a deep dive analysis of like 10 to 20 pages to really understand the entire business, how it makes or loses money. So I will to the best of my ability be concise but deep with my knowledge of the business. \n\rBusiness model\rHere are all of the products that Payoneer offers its customers. \rGlobal Payments, Multi-currency account, physical and virtual cards, B2B accounts payable and accounts receivable, working capital, merchant services, compliance and tax. \n\rSo, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business\u2019 needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins and no doubt they will be offering that soon, if anything they should make that a major priority. \n\rWho are their customers and where are they know?\r5 million businesses in 190 countries. Customers include Amazon, Wish, Lazada (owned by Alibaba) Shopee, and Ebay. Weird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too.  This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypal\u2019s or banks are NOT willing to take the risk.  Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access.  \n\rWhat are the growth drivers?\rAcquisition in new or existing markets (which drives better margins) and working capital for some of their customers (not all) which is what helps Amazon and Paypal grow their business.  When someone makes a transaction say buyer and seller the bank or credit card companies make fees but when both consumer and business use Payoneer exclusively they avoid transaction fees with banks which is why these platforms push or provide discounts for encouraging transactions within the same network vs. out of network.  Over time more and more transactions will be within network, just takes more people to be part of the ecosystem. \n\rWhat are the revenues of the business? Company estimates. \r2020  $346mm\r*2021 $432 mm\r*2022 $540 mm\rWhat do I think actually happens?\r2020 $350 to $400mm\r2021 $450 to $550mm\r2022 $600 to $700mm\rWhy?  Because $500 million of capital allows you to expand faster than before and I think the management has been prudent not to be so aggressive in their esimtates because I don\u2019t think anyone can believe they can so more than 35% a year but I do.  \n\rWhat does that say about valuation? \rWell, Paypal at its spin-off inception traded as low as 5x revenue but growing 15% to 20% a year and when it had $11 billion in revenues now it is growing same rate but trading at 15x Revenue. That means that given Payoneer is growing double the rate and 95% smaller they can command a higher multiple but for the sake of being \u201cconservative\u201d let\u2019s use 5x revenue as the TROUGH valuation and 20x revenue as the PEAK. \n\r2020  $346mm  Trough is $1.75 billion or $4.60 a share. Peak is $6.92 Billion or $18.21 \r*2021 $432mm Trough is $2.16 Billion or $5.70 a share. Peak is $8.64 billion which is $22.75 a share. \r*2022 $540 mm Tough is $2.70 Billion or $7 a share. Peak is $10.8 Billion or $28 a share. \n\rIf you used my estimates it would be the following\r2021 $450 to $550mm Trough is $6 or Peak of $29\r2022 $600 to $700mm Tough is $7.89 or Peak of $36.84\rGiven the current price of $11 it becomes a 4 up and 1 down scenario, a good risk/reward bet. \n\rWhat do I think the future holds for Payoneer?\rI actually think there are several exits for this company. \r1.\tCompany continues to grow and eventually reach billions or revenue within 5 to 10 years. So many factors and things that can happen since sometimes a 10x of revenue growth does not always mean 10x in stock price, could be -50% (due to massive dilution or debt) or 10,000% (no dilution, growth increasing, becomes a top 5 player).  So consider that when you get too enthusiastic about prospects there is always a downside. \r2.\tLarge international payments processer buys them. Could be Paypal, Square, Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company.  Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed.  Before you had 100,000 banks then it was 50,000 banks, then 10,000 banks and now like 5,000 banks but the top 10 banks make up a large % of the business/volume. \r3.\tWildcard: CRM business buys them. What many people do not realize is that CRM\u2019s have been changing the game.  First it was to help you sell with marketing tools, then it is to improve communication within the team, then it will be storage, and legal transactions then it will be financial transaction.  They are literally going to control the beginning to the end of the customer relationship and all of that data they possess is very valuable to help their customers grow. \r\rConclusion:  $FTOC provides a good risk reward and many ways to play the exit depending on your risk tolerance.  \rIf you like my analysis please share with other people and if you want me to look at a company and provide an analysis like this I can do that for a small fee. Nevertheless, I welcome everyone and anyone here to discuss all of the good and bad about $FTOC because that I love about the Reddit community is how open, transparent and sometimes incredibly funny you all are. \n\rGood luck to every one! \rValue Maverick",

        "selftext": "# Summary\n\nAdobe\u2019s powerful position in the professional design and media production ecosystem has given them a valuable foothold in helping their clients get things done. Synergies between Digital Media and Digital Experience will allow Adobe to grow existing accounts as their solutions evolve to support customer operations far beyond creative and marketing.\n\n# Profile\n\nAdobe views its business in two key segments, Digital Media and Digital Experience.\n\nDigital Media (\\~75% of revenue) \u2013 what you probably think of when you hear the name Adobe. Products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by modernizing how they view, share and engage with documents and creative content. Things like Creative Cloud and Document Cloud.\n\nDigital Experience (\\~25% of revenue) \u2013 a comprehensive and integrated platform and set of applications and services through Adobe Experience Cloud that enable brands and businesses of all sizes to create, manage, execute, measure, monetize and optimize customer experiences that span from analytics to commerce. Spoiler: this is where my bull case lies.\n\nIn Adobe\u2019s own words [(Form 10-K)](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/investor-relations/pdfs/ADBE-10K-FY20-FINAL.pdf):\n\n&gt;*\u201cBy integrating products from each of these areas, our customers are able to utilize a comprehensive suite of solutions and services that no other company currently offers. In addition, our ability to deliver innovation and productivity improvements across customer workflows involving the creation, management, delivery, measurement and optimization of engaging content favorably positions Adobe as our customers continue to invest in delivering digital experiences.\u201d*\n\n# Fundamentals\n\n|Next Earnings Date|March 23rd (no time given)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Market Cap|$213B|\n|Forward P/E|41.02|\n|Shares|479M (Outstanding), 403.5M ( \\~85% Institutionally owned)|\n|Previous Close (3/12)|$444.30|\n|52WK Range|$255.13 - $536.88|\n|Average Volume|2.6M, so liquid enough.|\n|TAM|Adobe considers its TAM to be $147B by 2023|\n|Revenue Expectations|Plans to surpass $15B of revenue in FY21|\n\n**Inside activity** \u2013 only two small sales in the last 3 months that weren\u2019t automatic or scheduled. Net activity is \\~300K shares sold (mostly automatic)\n\n**Buybacks** \u2013 Adobe has accelerated buybacks and recently increased the board\u2019s share buyback authorization to $15B, as their original $8B repurchase is expected to be exhausted by mid-FY21.\n\n# Climate\n\nAdobe has a formidable moat around its Digital Media business segment, with very few competitors to its creative workflow management solutions. With many offices continuing to work virtually, and companies continuing to invest in their creative infrastructure for remote employees, strong growth in Digital Media should continue. **Whether they love or hate it, every creative professional knows they need proficiency in the Creative Cloud suite, and probably a subscription to it too.**\n\nAs Adobe says in their 10-K and [Annual Shareholder letter](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/investor-relations/pdfs/AdobeStockholderLetter2021.pdf), *\u201cevery business is a digital business, and the imperative for customer experience management has never been more real.\u201d* Organizations and brands of every shape and size are wisely looking to improve their digital presence and customer experiences. Whether it's look and feel, project management tools, or e-commerce buy flow \u2013 Adobe has a solution for it. The pandemic only accelerated the trend, when nearly every opportunity to engage audiences went digital. To that end, the **Digital Experience segment stands to become a larger contributor to future revenue growth.** Adobe will successfully cross-sell Digital Experience solutions to existing Digital Media customers (think e-commerce, marketing and analytics tools, project management tools, etc.).\n\nAdobe will also generate new revenue streams from [recently-announced public sector use cases](https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2021/Adobe-Partners-With-All-50-US-States-to-Modernize-Digital-Experiences-for-Citizens/default.aspx). These federal, state, and local government partnerships will serve as lighthouse accounts for future growth within government, [healthcare](https://www.adobe.com/customer-success-stories/walgreens-boots-alliance-case-study.html), and other public impact sectors. These are reliable customers that are reluctant to switch solution providers due to baked-in opex approvals \u2013 which makes a SaaS offering incredibly sticky with large institutions.\n\nWhile we're discussing government and healthcare customers, it's really worth mentioning third party resellers. Again, from the [Form 10-K](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/investor-relations/pdfs/ADBE-10K-FY20-FINAL.pdf):\n\n&gt;*\"We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (VARs), systems integrators (SIs), independent software vendors (ISVs), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions.\u201d*\n\nTypical multi-channel, large software company strategy. But these third party solutions providers become incredibly important in highly regulated spaces like government and healthcare. With Adobe's [recent acquisitions](https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2020/Adobe-Completes-Acquisition-of-Workfront/default.aspx) and [getting FedRAMP approval in 2019](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2019/09/20/adobe-obtains-new-fedramp-authorizations-enhancing-its-digital-government-services-in-the-cloud.html#gs.vn62be), they\u2019ve shown they\u2019re serious about becoming a bigger government and institutional player. These are highly regulated industries, with long and bureaucratic procurement processes. **Often, government and healthcare buyers are only authorized to do business with a handful of pre-approved vendors.** As Adobe continues to integrate and white-label their Experience products to third party partners, they become an increasingly available, attractive option for customers in highly regulated verticals. Inside these organizations, it\u2019s very difficult for buyers at big enterprise and government customers to win large appropriations approvals (to switch or rebuild systems), and much easier to lock in software solutions as a monthly \"cost of doing business.\" As organizations move to opex models like SaaS, there\u2019s even more stickiness than there used to be.\n\n# Technicals\n\nP/E ratio of \\~41.02 seems high, but looking at Adobe\u2019s closest competitors shows they\u2019re not the highest.\n\n|Autodesk (ADSK)|49.28|\n|:-|:-|\n|PayPal (PYPL)|70.72|\n|Salesforce (CRM)|48.45|\n|DocuSign (DOCU)|N/A|\n|SAP (SAP)|29.92|\n|Accenture (ACN)|32.61|\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to find a direct comparison, but I think Adobe\u2019s marketing, analytics and e-commerce ambitions make their P/E getting closer to Salesforce very plausible. Part of Adobe's strength is that there's nobody that directly competes with them on all fronts.\n\n**Analyst Sentiment** \u2013 solid buy sentiment from 23+ analysts, which has gone mostly unchanged in the last few months. Lowest price target is $500, with the average around $560-$570. I have yet to see a sell rating. ([Source](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=ADBE))\n\n**Moving Averages and Technical Indicators** \u2013 I\u2019ll let others chime in here, because this is my weakest area of knowledge. From what I can see, monthly moving averages and technical indicators suggest ADBE is a semi-strong buy and slightly oversold, respectively. I expect positive momentum to accelerate due to trading at 6-month lows leading up to earnings, BidenBux coming through, and the market forgetting about the 10yr Treasury Yield. ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ADBE?p=ADBE))\n\nRemember, this was trading at $500 a month ago. While I think this is worth a long term hold, I also think we'll see it pop when they post yet another earnings beat.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nCombined with Adobe\u2019s well-known lock-in for professional design and content production workflows in their Media segment, growing competency in their Experience segment will make Adobe extremely competitive as an end-to-end SaaS provider for public and institutional customers. **Simply put, I believe Adobe\u2019s Digital Experience segment will  grow to be at least half the size of Digital Media, with large enterprise and government partnerships being a sleeping giant in their pipeline.**\n\nPlanning to purchase 4/19 $490c at open tomorrow.",

        "selftext": " \n\nFirst let me say we are in an excellent position we were before the 2/26 earnings call. The stock is trading at 26! I didn't expect to see this price to soon. Yes, I know we had fall from $41 (RKT even hit $46) and that could be discourage to some, since you \"lost\" 36%. Probably the surge to $41 was massive call options, some shorts covering, but the surge to $26 was due to the excellent results RKT showed in their earnings call.\n\nHere I'm going to make a comparison between LDI and UWMC results with RKT. Let me start with an extract of their earnings calls:\n\n\"... **our incremental gain in 2020 alone, was nearly large enough to eclipse the entire all-in closed loan volume of the nation's second largest originator last year\"**\n\nUWMC close volume for 2020 was 182 billion (76% was due to refinance) an increase of 69% with respect to 2019. LDI was 100 billion (they don't disclose refinance vs purchase) an increase of 122%. RKT close volume was 320 billion, an increase of 175 billion (or 121%). RKT gains were 2.3 times UWMC gains or 3.1 LDI gains.\n\nMargins: Rkt margins were 4.46% (4.41% Q4 2020), LDI were 4.27% (3.38% Q4 2020), UWMC were 3.05% in Q4 2020 (I couldn't find the metric for the full year)\n\n**Rocket Auto ... results orchestrating more than $750 million in gross merchandise value of automotive e-commerce transactions**\n\nI notice kind of a shift in this market call, they put Rocket Auto in front and Jay was excited of the possibilities of this business with Rocket Mortgage. Rocket has two agreements with Vroom 1) They are going to list used cars in the Rocket Auto platform in exchange of VRM [**stocks**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001580864/000156459021010584/vrm-10k_20201231.htm) 2) They provide selling and customer servicing to Vroom, in other words, Rocket offers support and sales to Vrom, you should read the agreement [**here**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1580864/000119312520157158/d801274dex1011.htm)**.** The agreement is very interesting because Rkt has to literally collect all the documents needed and assist them in the transactions. So if anyone can call Vrom and ask how they do this process, are they fast? they had to fill the information twice? one in Vrom CRM and the other in Rkt platform?.. (I can't call myself because I'm not American, so the I call will cost me like 10 RKT shares)\n\nThe agreement started on April 2020. VRM [**sold**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001580864/000156459021010584/vrm-10k_20201231.htm) 62,981 autos for 1,072 millions in 2020. The e-comerce segment of VRM sold 34,488 units and as stated in the call \"**This equates to just over 32,000 auto units in 2020\"** This means (for me at least) Rocket Auto revenue comes entirely of Vrom ecommerce segment.\n\nEdit:\n\nLook at this beautiful peace in Vrom earnings call \"**we've also partnered with business process outsourcers to help us scale and manage our ever-increasing volumes. We believe that we will be substantially ahead of the customer service curve by the beginning of the second half** \" They are talking about RKT!",

        "selftext": "Hi all, long time lurker here and I've found this subreddit to be tremendously useful!  With the recent tech stock beatdown, here are some of the stocks I am eyeing and looking to buy: \n\n- Corsair (CRSR) : had stellar earnings and they make fantastic products in the gaming and PC hardware space.  They're making good acquisitions in the streaming space.  \n\n- Salesforce (CRM) : another solid company that has taken a big beating for no apparent reason.  They recently acquired Slack and I dont see any other competitor being remotely close in the CRM space. \n\n- Square (SQ): revolutionizing payments for small businesses and making key moves in the crypto space.  \n\n- Cloudflare (NET): yet to turn profitable but a great tech company that is growing rapidly. \n\n- Snowflake (SNOW): another tech company that was overvalued upon IPO and climbed all the way to $429 before being brought back to earth.  Currently trading at  $213\n\n- Costco (COST): solid company that has a loyal following and great business model.  \n\n- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM): market leader in chip manufacturing and with the current shortage in chips,  their future looks great. \n\n- Teladoc (TDOC): one of the big companies in the telemedicine space that should thrive in the post covid world as more patients want the convenience of seeing their doctor from the comfort of their own home. \n\n- Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY): pharma giant that made key acquisitions recently (Celgene and Myokardia) that should boost their pipeline and revenue.  Also pays good dividend. \n\n- Facebook (FB) : social media giant that isn't going away anytime soon.  Would be interesting to see how they leverage Oculus to boost their revenue.  \n\n- CVS (CVS) : pharmacy giant that should get a boost from covid vaccine rollout and their new in-house clinics. \n\n- Tattooed Chef (TTCF): fast growing company in the plant based protein and healthy frozen foods space.  They have products in almost all major retailers and are rapidly expanding.  \n\n- Nvidia (NVDA): leader in GPU space and a tech giant.  \n\n- Palantir (PLTR): big data company with a revolutionary product that is just getting started.  \n\n- Qualcomm (QCOM): makes chips for phones and are well established for the 5G Era\n\n- American Tower Corp (AMT): they make/ rent out cell signal towers and should benefit from the move to 5G\n\n- Planet13 Holdings (PLNHF): they make giant superstores for Marijuana sale and are set to have their own brand of products \n\nOf course I would also add Apple, Visa, Microsoft, and Amazon if they dipped enough. \n\nWhat stocks did I miss?  Are there any others you would suggest keeping an eye on during the recent sell-off?  Thank you!",

        "selftext": "Hey there folks! Today I want to talk to you about what\u2019s really going on in the stock market and what we should expected next\u2026\n\nSo, in the last couple of weeks, we have seen a very fast correction in the tech heavy Nasdaq [Index](https://imgur.com/aK26hjA) after the bond yields rapidly spiked over 1.5% for the 10y, as a lot of investors kept getting spooked by the employment numbers coming in slightly better than expected, though many important things are still hidden in those numbers.\n\nFor example, last week we saw the US gaining almost 400K jobs, but this barely moved the unemployment [rate](https://imgur.com/7PJTWUA) which still stands at 6.2% (and this doesn\u2019t even include people who just quit searching for jobs). Almost all of the job [gains](https://imgur.com/B3av5gb) were seen in the leisure and hospitality sector, which has started to regain some momentum after it was the most affected by the events of last year, as this sector is still down more than 3.5M jobs since a year ago.\n\nThese past weeks we also [saw](https://imgur.com/yeudkin) jobless claims continuing to go down, with the latest initial jobless claims coming in at the lowest level since last early last year at just over 700K, as the continuing jobless claims also coming in at just over 4.1M.\n\nBut guys, regardless of the jobs &amp; unemployment numbers, the main thing that will keep investors on edge will continue to be treasury [yields](https://imgur.com/rDjy9fO), the interest rates and how this are affected by the inflation [numbers](https://imgur.com/awXUGgw) which are expected to see a huge bump in the next months as we will have very low comps compared to last year when we saw the rona starting to pick up steam.\n\nWe can see [here](https://imgur.com/QbuiSot) the core inflation came lower this month with an increase of just .1% which jolted the stock market and started a recovery after the sell-off in the past weeks.\n\nGiven that tech names &amp; EVs were some of the biggest hit stocks we should also take a quick look at NIO, as the company lost almost half of its value in the past month, dropping from over $66 to just $35 after the big sell off in the past weeks. \n\nNIO\u2019s drop was also amplified probably by the fact that they posted mixed [results](https://imgur.com/t0jRJEW) for the 4th quarter of last year, as they just missed the top line but did manage to post a solid beat on the company\u2019s bottom line, losing just $0.14/share.\n\nInvestors might not have been happy to see a guidance of just 15% above their 4th quarter given the huge valuation and expectations of the company and the huge global chip shortage that will limit NIO\u2019s production capacity to just 7.5K in the 2nd quarter of 2021.\n\nI still have a mixed opinion about NIO\u2019s stock, but after this huge sell-off, it has become more attractive given the continued [growth](https://imgur.com/cI1TNWJ) of sales the company has seen in the last years, while I also believe NIO will remain one of the winners of the EV disruption \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe other stock that I wanted to mention after what has happened in the past weeks is Zoom.\n\nI really like Zoom\u2019s products and I understand the hype of the stock, but I also really believe they will struggle to keep the huge growth rate going, as the company might have seen its peak growth after the massive work-from-home movement in 2020.\n\n[Zoom](https://imgur.com/UygZxJZ) also reported a beat on the top &amp; bottom line and I expect them to continue to have another great first half to start 2021, but after that, the company will have very though comps to go against, which might really put some downward pressure on the stock, especially as more people go back to their workplaces.\n\nYou can see, even the company doesn\u2019t expect the huge growth to continue, with the revenue growth expected to only slightly continue to grow during 2021.\n\nZoom is valued at almost $100B which is really hard to justify unless the company continues to innovate and bring more &amp; more products to the market, as the industry they operate in will only become more competitive over time with other big players like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce &amp; many others looking to take market share.\n\nGuys, if you are still in doubt about what to do next in the stock market, you should just take a look at the chart below and start thinking long term, because investing, if you are really looking to make money is all about the long-term.\n\nYou can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/ZlO593t) in the past 100 years we've had 8 bear markets previous to the one we saw in 2020, with the average bear market lasting just 1.4years compared to over 9 years for every bull market with a staggering difference in gains vs losses as well \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nWe can also see in this [chart](https://imgur.com/wM39iSQ) that it only took 15 days for the Nasdaq to enter a 10% correction this time, but you can see the average 12 month return after a 10% correction is almost 30% which is huge, with the likelihood of the index posting a positive return in the next 12 months standing at over 90%\n\nSo, given that we had a bear market last year, I believe it\u2019s highly unlikely that we will see a huge drop in stocks even if yields continue to rise, as the real return of the treasury yields will continue to be close to 0, as I don\u2019t expect them to jump more than 2% for the 10y anytime soon.\n\nMoving on, I recently saw some [comments](https://imgur.com/I3ijkKT) made by David Tepper which I wasn\u2019t really aware of but which made a lot of sense to me, he highlighted that the other downward pressure put on treasury yields, which will keep them in check, will come from investors in other countries like Japan, Germany &amp; many others, as the US treasuries have become way more attractive than others.\n\nOne other thing that I think should be mentioned is that the [Dow Jones](https://imgur.com/undefined) has continued to make new high after new high in the past week, being led by companies like Disney which has just surpassed 100M [subscribers](https://imgur.com/fCTDNGX) on their Disney+ platform while also getting a boost from their other revenue streams starting to come back online, and of course the stock that has led the DOW in the past week, Boeing, as the [company](https://imgur.com/K6SPGY1) had more sales than cancellations for the first time since November 2019 as the 737 MAX crisis is finally starting to fade away for the company, with even more possible [deals](https://imgur.com/4XYgfs9) likely to close in the next period, as airlines start to have a better view of what the future will bring for them.\n\nFriends, you shouldn\u2019t be scared of stock market corrections or dips as we have [seen](https://imgur.com/74dAwZO) a 10% pullback once every 11 months as you can see, with the frequency of bigger crashes decreasing significantly, but as always, because we are highly emotional beings, it\u2019s very hard for us to handle our emotions after a series of red days. \n\nYou should remember though, most often than not, the best way to go is just to ride out the dip and even starting deploying more cash into the stock market the more it drops. I think you should develop a strategy of not selling on big red days and deploying an increasingly higher % of your cash into great stocks the more the stock market drops.\n\nI also fully expect some part of the next stimulus check, which was just signed by Biden, to end up in the stock market, which might help push the stock market on the right path despite increasing pressures from rising yields and possible short-term inflation fears.\n\n**So just to end this post guys, is the stock market going to crash? My short answer is NO!\ud83d\ude80**\n\nI don\u2019t expect that to happen any time soon. Even if we continue to see volatility in the stock market you should use that to your advantage and smartly deploy cash into great companies, which leads me to my other question, should you buy stocks today? Well, at the moment of writing this post, futures are currently trending down pre-market (SP &amp; Nasdaq in the Red, Dow +0.2%) and If they continue to do so it might be a good chance to deploy some cash, but don\u2019t rush into the first red day you see, slowly build your positions or add to them. As a rule of thumb, I like to buy more once a 5% dip occurs in the stock market and slowly deploy cash the more it drops \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

The kids got 4 bears, clothes, and a little cardboard box that doubled as a \"house\" for the bear, averaging about $50 a bear (didn't mind since I factored in paying for the \"experience\")\n\nLooking through the awesomeness of Jan 2021, Build A Bear Workshop ticker $BBW (let's try and be professional)...seemed to ride the momentum of the other BB's in the market. \n\n**Now the $$ and details I want to highlight. Take them with a grain of salt, just calling what I see:**\n\n* On Jan 21st $BBW closed at 42% higher at $6.78 vs a prior day close of $4.77. \n* After dropping briefly, the stock continued and continues to be in an uptrend (the same cannot be said for some others out there)\n* Trading off less than 500,000 in volume on a good day the stock was able to reach a 52wk high of $8.40 in Feb...could be the hype of everything going on, but there could be more there\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Notes from the ICR Conference and my personal views:**\n\n* Reorganized swiftly during the pandemic\n* Cutting OpX was in focus\n   * 99% of lease agreements were re-negotiated\n   * Employees furloughed \n   * Margins for 4Q20 seem flat (on the high end), but are based on lower Revenue (okay by me, the outlook looks great)\n      * On the high end (they used mid-point) /  10.1% 4Q20 EBITDA Margin vs 10.4% in 4Q19\n      * Prudent spend management I think is a more than fair statement\n      * Net YoY change in Cash is looking like +$10M\n* Shift to digital and e-commerce in focus\n   * Pretty awesome website and they have a new CRM in place (don't know which) but they are making an effort\n   * Licensing brands is a huge plus, especially with Disney movies coming out. They are currently doing a Peeps theme collection for Easter (genius). ALSO some of the collections/characters like Mew from Pokemon are pretty rare...5X in resale..pretty wild\n* 8.8M bonus club subscribers (started in May 2019) \n   * 8.8M x $50 a bear...$440M in the pipe for the highly optimistic... that is possible?\n   * I would like to see the growth potential of this base (they take a lot of polling of these metrics)\n* **This is all with the pandemic in play and 18% decrease in operating days in retail stores and anticipating some full closures internationally like in the UK which had stores closed in Jan 2021**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEarnings announced for March 10th, 2021.....I like the stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\n***Notes taken from:*** [***Build a Bear ICR Presentation PowerPoint 01-11-2-21***](https://buildabear.gcs-web.com/static-files/8a954a06-482f-41d1-8b08-5f8905a5e7c3)\n\n\n***Chart Post:*** [***Chart for BBW + Cup Forming To Fill Gap to $10+***](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/BBW#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)\n\n***I could be retarded but it looks like a cup is forming with an attempt to test filling the gap back to $10+.***\n\n\n***\\*\\*Not a financial advisor, just expressing my thoughts and holding some shares and calls.

        "selftext": "Want to get your thoughts on Slack's recent pull back after the Salesforce acquisition. I am still holding my $WORK position *(average price of $30.82)* though in the last 14 days it is **down 10%** to a price of **$40.04**. This seems very strange and perhaps there is an arbitrage *(correct term???)* opportunity to buy more Slack and get some profit. Feels like the recent tech selloff is just dragging  Slack down with it.\n\nThe Salesforce acquisition price *(according to CNBC)* was $26.79 a share plus 0.0776 shares of Salesforce ($CRM). The math and thus potential value of $WORK according to today's closing price of $CRM is then:\n\n**$26.79 + ($205.01 \\* 0.0776)  = $42.69 = value of Slack**\n\nFirst, any idea when my Slack position will close out and convert into $CRM? I've never held a public company that got acquired before. What's this process look like?\n\nSecond, is my thinking correct that as long as the potential value of Slack is higher than the current trading price there is value. What are the gotchas I am missing?",

        "selftext": "Biotricity (OTCQB:BTCY) is a company most of you have never heard of, but is poised to disrupt a segment of the cardiac medical device space. Though small, it already has nearly two years of eye-popping sequential and annual growth rates. But that's just the beginning. The company has publicly guidedfor 25-40% sequential growth and continued triple digit annual growth for the next couple years, at least.\n\nAs if that growth is not impressive enough, the guidance only includes the expansion of their initial commercialized product, Bioflux, a mobile cardiac telemetry (MCT) device. Yet, in January of this year the company submitted a 510(K) FDA filing for another cardiac device, Biotres, a holter/extended holter device. This device will have a higher total addressable market (TAM) than Bioflux, and the CEO noted on the last conference call that Biotres should quickly add 20-30% more to the top line.  \n \n\nBTCY's TaaS Model Will Help Them Disrupt\n\nAs mentioned, BTCY is currently focused on the cardiac market, most especially the MCT market, which is used primarily now for high-risk cardiac patients. The MCT devices and technology monitor high-risk patients in real time so that if a patient has an adverse cardiac event, such as arrythmia, the physician and patient are immediately alerted to address the problem at that time. Using a holter device, which is usually used on low to medium-risk patients, the adverse event would not be detected until the patient's next physician visit. If the patient had an adverse event while wearing the holter, the physician would not know this in real time, and the patient may have severe damage, or death, from the event not being timely-treated.\n\nDespite the differences between an MCT and holter device and technology, the use and payment process for these devices follows the same pattern. Namely: (1) the doctor prescribes the patient to wear the device for a given period of time, e.g., seven days; (2) the patient wears the monitor for that time; (3) the doctor is paid a nominal fee for reading the device's report; (4) the medical device/clinical company is paid around $800 per use of its device; (5) if insurance does not cover all $800, the device company will likely bill the patient for the remaining balance. So, in this standard model, the doctor is paid a nominal reading fee and the patient may be billed for an amount not paid by their insurance.\n\nBTCY's model is different. In this model, both the physician and the patient benefit. Here's BTCY's model: (1) the doctor purchases the device from BTCY; (2) the doctor prescribes the patient to wear the BTCY device for a given period of time; (3) the patient wears the monitor; (4) the doctor is not only paid the nominal reading fee, but also can bill the $800 per use of the device; (5) the doctor often chooses not to bill any difference between the $800 and the amount paid by insurance because they have a long-term relationship with the patient; (6) the doctor pays BTCY a technology fee for use of their technology in the device.\n\nAs you can see, in BTCY's model, the doctor benefits by being paid significantly more money; the patient wins by possibly being billed less, but certainly not being billed anymore; and BTCY wins not primarily through the device sale, but through the reliable, recurring, and high margin revenue from the technology fee. While BTCY sells the device once, the technology fee will repeat several dozen times per year for that one device. Notice the only ones who lose in this model: the device/clinical companies who currently cut out the physician from any meaningful payment in this process. For cardiologists and electrophysiologists who regularly prescribe MCT devices, using BTCY's product and technology (which is the most up-to-date) and billing model (which allows them to make significantly more money) seems like a no brainer. In fact, when I contacted a close friend of mine who himself is an electrophysiologist, he immediately asked me to put him in touch with the company (he lives in one of the 30 states where BTCY currently does not have a salesforce presence). Perhaps this is why BTCY is seeing eye-popping growth rates with its Bioflux device and subsequent technology fees.\n \n\nFuture Products &amp; Technology\n\nWhile BTCY has plans to expand well beyond the adult cardiac monitoring market, I will focus on more near-term catalysts and expansion. I have already mentioned the Biotres product and technology that management indicated would quickly add 20-30% revenue increases. In addition to those, there are two other exciting developments underway.\n\nFirst, is BTCY's Bioheart, a direct-to-consumer (DTC) product expected to be launched in June 2021. According to people familiar with the company, BTCY is still doing a full market assessment to see how best to market this product. In any case, Bioheart is essentially Bioflux for non-medical-professional use. I believe Bioheart could have significant appeal to people generally concerned about heart health due to family history, etc., as well as to athletes and \"gym rats\" who want to monitor their heart (full disclosure: I am personally quite interested in Bioheart for both of these reasons).\n\nSecond, according to its presentation from the LD Micro conference in December, the company is working on an app for cardiologists and patients to use to better monitor the patient's heart health between doctor visits. Beyond that tease, the company has not spoken publicly about the app, but they did show on that presentation that the TAM is approximately 10 times as large as the combined TAM for Bioflux and Biotres.\n\nBTCY'S STRENGTHS \n\n1) Gross margins: current gross margins are just a tick under 50%. While that is good, it is nothing compared to where gross margins should eventually land. The company has mentioned that margins will expand as one-time device sales become a smaller portion of revenue, giving way to the higher margin TaaS fees. Based on my own research, I would expect gross margins to easily hit the high 50% to low 60% range by the end of fiscal 2022. Long term, the company will likely eventually settle with at least mid-60% range gross margins.\n\n(2) Churn: So far, BTCY has nearly a 100% customer retention rate. This bodes well for the company because it speaks not only to their effectiveness and good relationships with customers, but also to their visibility into future revenue run rates.\n\n(3) The Board of Directors and management team are experienced. In addition to strong corporate and medical device commercialization experience, the team has members familiar with raising capital for new companies and taking them public. Although BTCY is obviously already public, this experience could help with this final strength I wish to mention.\n\n(4) Uplisting to a Major Exchange: BTCY is working to be listed on a major exchange sometime in calendar year 2021. Based on my review, I believe the only necessary hurdle to being uplisted is the share price. From what I will show in the \"Valuation\" section, I believe that issue will take care of itself as BTCY continues to execute. But beyond that, being listed on a major exchange will provide a tailwind with analyst coverage being more likely, and additional institutional interest given that some institutions have restrictions from purchasing OTC stocks.\n\n1) Gross margins: current gross margins are just a tick under 50%.

        "selftext": "The following is a detailed analysis that I have spent more than ten hours doing research. In addition, I will forecast the price of this stock. I hope everyone enjoy reading my article! ( This article was written in mid-February, today JG announces partnership with TTD and stock price is going up; previously announced partnership: FARFETCH, BYD, Tesla, BMW, IQIY)\n\nQuick summary: **Aurora Mobile Limited (JG)** is a highly underestimated SaaS stock like GME, however, with much stronger financial status and profitability. JG has much lower PS (just 11 now at stock price US6.11) versus other famous US SaaS stock: Salesforce, Shopify, Twilio, Ring central, Cloopen Group (RAAS), Agora(API) (on average PS \\~19, at most Shopify: 31). Growing with highly profitable SaaS business, the stock price should go up soon when more spotlight is shed on this stock. I thought its\u2019 value is at least 10.79, optimistically to the standard RAAS 18.18, which is significantly lower than the current price. The current price of 6.11 has at least a 77%-197.5% growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 904oth9ywmk61...*\n\n[https://ir.jiguang.cn/](https://ir.jiguang.cn/)\n\nContent (A kind reminder: It takes about 5 minutes to complete the reading): \n\nPart 1: Stock Research Report on Aurora Mobile \n\nPart 2: Stock Price Forecast\n\n**Part 1: Stock Research Report on Aurora Mobile** \n\n**Brief comment on industry\u2019s potential:**\n\nWith reference to the huge industry market and growth that SaaS (Software as a Service) has formed in the United States, it is not difficult to speculate that almost all enterprises will use this service in the future, and its market size may be trillions. Credit Suisse stated on 5th February 2021 that China\u2019s SaaS market lagged behind that of the United States by 10 years. The current market is still very fragmented and there is no super leader in China. \n\n**Company Profile:**\n\nAurora is an experienced and rare SaaS company in China. In fact, it is a leading company in the field of mobile developer services over the past ten years. The well-known fund Fidelity International is the second largest institutional shareholder of Aurora which has currently increased its position by 26.6%. In the mid of October 2020, Aurora received a special support funding of 17.24 million for the first batch of strategic emerging industries in Shenzhen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img ymu8i1l0xmk61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/67naqjh3xmk61.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=978c21e402e5b6ce4ca885c558b35e21fe8e8858\n\nIn 2020, Aurora's operating income mainly came from two parts: 1) SaaS business with high gross margin and low risk, including developer services and industry applications; 2) Targeted marketing business with low gross margin and high bad debt risk. However, targeted marketing is exiting in an orderly manner. It is expected that it will be completely cleared in 2021Q1, and the 2020Q4 results will no longer be included in the report of the early March financial result. \n\nAurora has formed three major SaaS business products: developer subscription service + developer value-added service + industry application. The developer subscription service is the cornerstone of the business. Through the APP traffic network, the flow is realized through Aurora Alliance products to form a value-added service, and the massive data accumulated by the developer subscription service is applied to solve the demand pain points of various vertical industries.\n\n**8 reasons to be optimistic about Aurora's short-term and long-term stock prices:**\n\n**1. The performance of the transformation to pure SaaS is great, and the valuation should be targeted to other US-listed SaaS stocks such as Twilio, RAAS and API**\n\nWith the completion of the transformation and upgrading of Aurora, start from 2020Q4 (will be announced at 4/3/2021), all operating income will come from the SaaS business with high gross profit margin (\\~74.7% in Q3). The company has become a pure SaaS concept stock, so its valuation logic has also undergone a qualitative change. Aurora Mobile has much lower PS (6.11, PS \\~11) versus Salesforce, Shopify. Twilio, Ring central, RAAS, API (average PS \\~19)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/comqw8a6xmk61.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a5aba7c793daab67513e5fe3cfa4aa1f35d0e60\n\n**2. Aurora\u2019s 2020Q3 financial indicators have been improving, and the financial situation is getting healthier**\n\nBy looking at the 2020Q3 cash and cash flow data, the company's operations are in a very healthy state and the financial situation is stable. In the third quarter, the company's operating cash flow reached 30 million, and cash flowed in for two consecutive quarters.\n\nAurora has adopted strict customer accounting period management policies and collection measures, and the number of receivable turnover days has dropped significantly from 84 days in the same period last year to 45 days, which also reflects that the company's various financial conditions are getting healthier.\n\n**3. Rapid growth in performance in 2020Q4 and 2021, and it is expected to turn losses into profits in 2021: become the first stock to achieve profit earlier than RAAS, API**\n\nAccording to the management's Q4 guidance, the SaaS business revenue in the fourth quarter will be between 74 million and 78 million, an increase of approximately 13% to 19% compared with that of the previous quarter. The annual revenue of SaaS business in 2020 will be 296-312 million. Management expects that in 2021, SaaS revenue will grow by more than 40% compared to 2020, and it is estimated that Aurora's SaaS business revenue in 2021 will reach RMB 414.4-4368 million. It is expected that a turnaround will be realized in 2021 and Aurora will become the first stock that achieve profits earlier than RAAS and API!\n\n**4. Stock that benefits from the post-epidemic**\n\nAs mentioned above, the industry application business under Aurora\u2019s SaaS service will be affected by the epidemic in 2020Q1. However, since Q2-Q3, it has gradually recovered due to the decline of the epidemic in China. It is expected that Q4 will be better. As China's vaccines has been distributing widely and economic activity have been recovered strongly, Aurora will benefit from this revenue and provide more momentum for growth.\n\n**5. Recently cooperated with numerous well-known companies to expand customer base, which increases income, reduces risks and catalyzes the rise of stock price**\n\nThe company has recently cooperated with leading platforms in various industries such as finance, insurance, weather, online platforms, games, fresh food, education, etc. For example, Aurora has cooperated with Tesla, TDD, Kuaishou (competitor of Tiktok), German brand-name car manufacturers (BMW), iQiyi, Mavericks, etc. Ping An Bank, China Life Data Center, Moji Weather, WiFi Master Key, Lilith Game, Daily Fresh, and Job Together, and other well-known enterprises. In fact, since the third quarter, the company has worked hard to diversify its customer base by accelerating cooperation with companies. Aurora , as a growing company transitioning to pure SaaS in 2020, it is expected that a new round of announcements will begin after the Chinese Lunar New Year. This acts as a strong catalyst for the rise of the stock price. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tji5ovtlxmk61.png?width=2500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01beb06fc7bcd84bbbc6db15f7caa37f1804f395\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/57jy4ffkxmk61.png?width=335&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83ca9bfa13184ed5402b773356003f53cb30118f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bh2oysx7xmk61.jpg?width=119&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18c1c6b9eb2db0ec276adc69f85e0be80aa2c005\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jp50eo5nxmk61.png?width=200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b0cdf738535a4710d8a341f13c165cac0d69ece\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lrvqbiyoxmk61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=278f0acc2b49051501dac917bcbb16168ac1ccf3\n\n**6. The strong potential of the new growth engine VaaS short video push**\n\nOn 2 nd December, 2020, Aurora announced the launch of a new product VaaS short video push. According to market research, the overall market size of VaaS may exceed RMB 50 billion. As long as Aurora gains 1% of the market, the revenue of RMB 500 million is already huge in terms of its market value. I believe we will see initial performance in 2021Q1.\n\n**7. Potential mergers and acquisitions, share repurchase possibilities**\n\nMost SaaS business customers adopt the prepaid model. After the company completes the transformation of the SaaS business, the cash flow situation will improve, and the extra funds can identify and merge other potential SaaS companies; or be acquired by other large international or Chinese SaaS companies. For example, China Youzan (8083) with a market value of 66.9 billion and Weimob (2013) with a market value of 67 billion, because the acquisition of Aurora can bring synergies to the businesses of the two.\n\nThe management also expects that the company will achieve a balance of payments in 2021. Once there is enough cash, the company will consider some acquisitions and even share repurchases in the future (this is common in SaaS, because shareholders are optimistic about the future of the company).\n\n**8. The wave of Chinese SaaS IPO has just begun, the valuation has room to rise**\n\nFollowing the official announcement, RAAS became the first Chinese SaaS listed on the U.S. stock market, and was subscribed by many institutions, professional investors and retail investors. Assuming that Aurora is only listed today, with its high performance growth, predictability, and a turnaround in 2021, I am convinced that its valuation is at least comparable to RAAS. With RAAS current price of PS32, Aurora should be valued 18.18, nearly 2 times higher than the current price. It is estimated that other Chinese SaaS stocks will see RAAS's unprecedented success and will speed up their plans for listing in the United States. It is expected that China's SaaS listed stocks will continue to come this year, greatly increases the popularity and valuation of related stocks.\n\nAs a SaaS company with high revenue growth in the next few years, Aurora will arouse more attention, and the repair of stock value will continue to accelerate. The early bird gets the worm and earns the most generous return.\n\n**Part 2: Stock price forecast: Valuation has undergone a qualitative change, and the repair of stock price is initiated**\n\nQuoting from the research company, Citibank data, Aurora\u2019s comparable companies include Salesforce, Shopify, Twilio and other US SaaS companies. The US stock market\u2019s recognition of SaaS services is much higher than advertising services, and Shopify\u2019s PS in 2021 is even higher: 31. Based on 1) Aurora\u2019s 21-year (after cut off of  the target marketing business) management\u2019s forecasted median income of approximately RMB 425.6 million, 2) the average lowest forecast of the research company\u2019s industry is 19 times PS (2021E) valuation and 3)1 USD = 6.458 RMB:\n\nThe most conservative and reasonable market value is about US$1.252 billion, and the corresponding stock price is 10.79, which is 77% higher than the current price of 6.11\n\nIndustry median: PS 25.6, stock price 14.54, up 138% from the current price\n\nAgainst the standard of RAAS, PS 32, the stock price is 18.18, up 197.5% from the current price\n\nFor API, PS57, the stock price is 32.38, 430% higher than the current price\n\nThe recent conservative valuation of one of the research companies:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kykebdhlymk61.jpg?width=554&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dec4b7f841a4f296059ce78df277ef57a21edc01\n\n\\*\u603b\u5e02\u503c:Market Cap; \u6bdb\u5229\u7387= Gross margin;\n\nLatest and aggressive valuation excluding JG targeted marketing business (RAAS is also listed), Industry median of Saas, PS 25.6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aivhxcbmymk61.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf8b729c616034c46a30187e78296e41d80e667f\n\n\\*\u5e02\u503c/\u6536\u5165= PS; \u4e2d\u4f4d\u6578= Industry median of SaaS; \n\nResearch report summary:\n\nCompared with the estimated revenue of API and RAAS in 2021, although Aurora\u2019s revenue is relatively small, its performance growth rate and gross profit margin are the highest. The absolute value of its 2021E gross profit is 320 million, which can be compared to the standard RAAS's 380 million. Therefore, Aurora\u2019s valuation is at least 10.79, optimistically to the standard RAAS 18.18, which is significantly lower than the current price. The current price of 6.11 has at least an increase of 77%-197.5%.\n\n**Warren Buffett: Be greedy when others are fearful**\n\nI hope that all of friends, after reading my article, you will realize that you are holding a high-potential multiplying stock. If you have missed Tesla, Square, Sea limited, please cherish the rare Aurora bargaining chip in your hand! Personally, I have bought this stock with all my money USD 183507 with average stock price 7.2 and I will make a long-term investment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img x1tco58oymk61...*\n\nIf you disagree with me and you are a short seller, please sell stock to us.

        "selftext": "I get it. You sense this massive, homegrown, organic stonk movement, and you want to be a part of it. So you buy in on GME to get the tendies. But your entire plan is predicated on the idea that you can somehow coordinate a bunch of idiots to HODL the stock. What on earth makes you think that you could possibly take on large hedge funds with billions of dollars at their disposal? Melvin and the like don't need to go on WSB and give their DD; they have the money to manipulate the market in whatever way they see fit. They make their own pump &amp; dumps, or short &amp; distorts. They don't need to crowd source that shit. You're basically a bunch of cat wranglers. Do you really think you're going to be able to herd a bunch of apes into a coordinated effort? Most just want to get rich quick. And for those of you who don't, what is the exit plan, anyway? Just buy and hold forever? Do you really not ever desire to realize any gains? Then what is the point? I get it. Gamestop represents the pinnacle of nostalgia for our generation. Many of us spent hours in that store every week, clawing through games and talking about them with the staff. But to waste your savings in an attempt to relive those days is absolute insanity. Move on. Grow up. Buy into some established companies that will actually be around long enough to make you some money, and do it just a little bit at a time. I just really don't want to read about people jumping off bridges because SEC halted trading on meme stonks. I would rather you enjoy your life with some disposable cash. Anyway, that's just my $0.02, take it or leave it. Feel free to talk smack. I don't mind. FYI, as you may have already guessed, I do not currently own, and do not plan to own, any GME. Currently holding AMD, MRNA, PLTR, CRM, RYCEY, TBIO, &amp; SNDL (bought at the recent peak, like a true ape).",

        "selftext": "Hey there folks! Today I want to talk to you about what\u2019s really going on in the stock market and what we should expected next\u2026\n\n**\\[Don't Read/Dislike Before Reading - Very Long Post\\]**\n\nSo, in the last couple of weeks, we have seen a very fast correction in the tech heavy Nasdaq [Index](https://imgur.com/aK26hjA) after the bond yields rapidly spiked over 1.5% for the 10y, as a lot of investors kept getting spooked by the employment numbers coming in slightly better than expected, though many important things are still hidden in those numbers.\n\nFor example, last week we saw the US gaining almost 400K jobs, but this barely moved the unemployment [rate](https://imgur.com/7PJTWUA) which still stands at 6.2% (and this doesn\u2019t even include people who just quit searching for jobs). Almost all of the job [gains](https://imgur.com/B3av5gb) were seen in the leisure and hospitality sector, which has started to regain some momentum after it was the most affected by the events of last year, as this sector is still down more than 3.5M jobs since a year ago.\n\nThese past weeks we also [saw](https://imgur.com/yeudkin) jobless claims continuing to go down, with the latest initial jobless claims coming in at the lowest level since last early last year at just over 700K, as the continuing jobless claims also coming in at just over 4.1M.\n\nBut guys, regardless of the jobs &amp; unemployment numbers, the main thing that will keep investors on edge will continue to be treasury [yields](https://imgur.com/rDjy9fO), the interest rates and how this are affected by the inflation [numbers](https://imgur.com/awXUGgw) which are expected to see a huge bump in the next months as we will have very low comps compared to last year when we saw the rona starting to pick up steam.\n\nWe can see [here](https://imgur.com/QbuiSot) the core inflation came lower this month with an increase of just .1% which jolted the stock market and started a recovery after the sell-off in the past weeks.\n\nGiven that tech names &amp; EVs were some of the biggest hit stocks we should also take a quick look at NIO, as the company lost almost half of its value in the past month, dropping from over $66 to just $35 after the big sell off in the past weeks.\n\nNIO\u2019s drop was also amplified probably by the fact that they posted mixed [results](https://imgur.com/t0jRJEW) for the 4th quarter of last year, as they just missed the top line but did manage to post a solid beat on the company\u2019s bottom line, losing just $0.14/share.\n\nInvestors might not have been happy to see a guidance of just 15% above their 4th quarter given the huge valuation and expectations of the company and the huge global chip shortage that will limit NIO\u2019s production capacity to just 7.5K in the 2nd quarter of 2021.\n\nI still have a mixed opinion about NIO\u2019s stock, but after this huge sell-off, it has become more attractive given the continued [growth](https://imgur.com/cI1TNWJ) of sales the company has seen in the last years, while I also believe NIO will remain one of the winners of the EV disruption.\n\nThe other stock that I wanted to mention after what has happened in the past weeks is Zoom.\n\nI really like Zoom\u2019s products and I understand the hype of the stock, but I also really believe they will struggle to keep the huge growth rate going, as the company might have seen its peak growth after the massive work-from-home movement in 2020.\n\n[Zoom](https://imgur.com/UygZxJZ) also reported a beat on the top &amp; bottom line and I expect them to continue to have another great first half to start 2021, but after that, the company will have very though comps to go against, which might really put some downward pressure on the stock, especially as more people go back to their workplaces.\n\nYou can see, even the company doesn\u2019t expect the huge growth to continue, with the revenue growth expected to only slightly continue to grow during 2021.\n\nZoom is valued at almost $100B which is really hard to justify unless the company continues to innovate and bring more &amp; more products to the market, as the industry they operate in will only become more competitive over time with other big players like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce &amp; many others looking to take market share.\n\nGuys, if you are still in doubt about what to do next in the stock market, you should just take a look at the chart below and start thinking long term, because investing, if you are really looking to make money is all about the long-term.\n\nYou can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/ZlO593t) in the past 100 years we've had 8 bear markets previous to the one we saw in 2020, with the average bear market lasting just 1.4years compared to over 9 years for every bull market with a staggering difference in gains vs losses as well.\n\nWe can also see in this [chart](https://imgur.com/wM39iSQ) that it only took 15 days for the Nasdaq to enter a 10% correction this time, but you can see the average 12 month return after a 10% correction is almost 30% which is huge, with the likelihood of the index posting a positive return in the next 12 months standing at over 90%\n\nSo, given that we had a bear market last year, I believe it\u2019s highly unlikely that we will see a huge drop in stocks even if yields continue to rise, as the real return of the treasury yields will continue to be close to 0, as I don\u2019t expect them to jump more than 2% for the 10y anytime soon.\n\nMoving on, I recently saw some [comments](https://imgur.com/I3ijkKT) made by David Tepper which I wasn\u2019t really aware of but which made a lot of sense to me, he highlighted that the other downward pressure put on treasury yields, which will keep them in check, will come from investors in other countries like Japan, Germany &amp; many others, as the US treasuries have become way more attractive than others.\n\nOne other thing that I think should be mentioned is that the [Dow Jones](https://imgur.com/undefined) has continued to make new high after new high in the past week, being led by companies like Disney which has just surpassed 100M [subscribers](https://imgur.com/fCTDNGX) on their Disney+ platform while also getting a boost from their other revenue streams starting to come back online, and of course the stock that has led the DOW in the past week, Boeing, as the [company](https://imgur.com/K6SPGY1) had more sales than cancellations for the first time since November 2019 as the 737 MAX crisis is finally starting to fade away for the company, with even more possible [deals](https://imgur.com/4XYgfs9) likely to close in the next period, as airlines start to have a better view of what the future will bring for them.\n\nFriends, you shouldn\u2019t be scared of stock market corrections or dips as we have [seen](https://imgur.com/74dAwZO) a 10% pullback once every 11 months as you can see, with the frequency of bigger crashes decreasing significantly, but as always, because we are highly emotional beings, it\u2019s very hard for us to handle our emotions after a series of red days.\n\nYou should remember though, most often than not, the best way to go is just to ride out the dip and even starting deploying more cash into the stock market the more it drops. I think you should develop a strategy of not selling on big red days and deploying an increasingly higher % of your cash into great stocks the more the stock market drops.\n\nI also fully expect some part of the next stimulus check, which was just signed by Biden, to end up in the stock market, which might help push the stock market on the right path despite increasing pressures from rising yields and possible short-term inflation fears.\n\n**So just to end this post guys, is the stock market going to crash? My short answer is NO!**\n\nI don\u2019t expect that to happen any time soon. Even if we continue to see volatility in the stock market you should use that to your advantage and smartly deploy cash into great companies, which leads me to my other question, should you buy stocks today? Well, at the moment of writing this post, futures are currently trending down pre-market (SP &amp; Nasdaq in the Red, Dow +0.2%) and If they continue to do so it might be a good chance to deploy some cash, but don\u2019t rush into the first red day you see, slowly build your positions or add to them. As a rule of thumb, I like to buy more once a 5% dip occurs in the stock market and slowly deploy cash the more it drops.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

Is the industry growing?\n3. Is the management team strong?\n\nBelow are a few firms I believe could be successful in the medium/long-term (this is not a short-term bet !): \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Database/CRM**: it is here to stay and will continue to grow. Large corporates are inclined to have their CRM and database external. It does not make sense to build it in-house:\n\n**Database/CRM - Firms**: *Salesforce/Alteryx/Microstrategy/Snowflakes* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Genetics:** Genetics is the future for health care. The pandemic has accelerated research (more resources in FDA to review patents/trials and generally increased funding). \n\n**Genetics - Firms:**  \n\n*Intellia* and *Editas*: both firms have ongoing trials on gentech and have among the strongest technology in the industry.\n\n*GenoWay*:\u00a0customized, genetically modified (GM) models for genom engineering. With growing GenTech, the demand for such models will surge.\n\n*Sensorion*: one of few GenTech firms focusing on hearing problems. Hearing problems is a huge market and continues to grow a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Psycadelics/Brain Health:** the Pandemic has and will lead to a lot of psychological stress and disorders. A solutions will be needed.\n\n**Psycadelics/Brain Health - Firms:** *Sage, MindMed, Numinus* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FoodTech:** FoodTech is the future and it will grow in future.\n\n**FoodTech - Firm:** \n\n*Agronomics*: provides a portfolio of interesting firms in FoodTech\n\n*Valsoia*: Italian producer of vegetarian/vegan products, like meat, ham, yogurt  etc.: well established since over 20 years  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Insurance:** this industry will be disrupted big time.\n\n**Insurance - Firm:** Lemonade: unique was of finding attractive entry points for insurance and position themselves well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Energy:** we are going to see a huge shift in energy consumption. Alternatives and batteries might be the future. Maybe Fuel Cell technology also?\n\n**Energy - Firms:** FuelCell, Power Cell Sweden, United Lithium \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is just my way to position myself for the next 5 years or so. I do NOT check the markets daily. Every 6 months or so I check it and if something big happened, e.g. stock made a 10x, then I sell 50% and keep the reset. The cash I gradually re-invest diversifying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I never use leverage. I only invest what I can afford to lose. You best investment is your job and yourself. \n* Do your own DD.\n* What I do: I have a plan and stick to it. \n* This is NOT an investment advice. Do whatever you think it right for you. \n\nI am in my late 20s. Hence have a long investment horizon and do not worry about the volatility. For every stage in your life there is a different investment approach: take your bets early, reduce your risk with time.\u00a0",

        "selftext": "First, this is a 5.13mm float stock that moves quickly, so beware. It was an IPO that launched on 7/30/2020. \nAlso, this stock has EARNINGS on 3/10/2021. \nAs far as when they will be profitable, a 2/10/21 article by Simply Wall St projected that FTHM will be profitable by 2023 at their current rate of growth. Again, not an expert so that is why I am posting that. \nWhy agents are moving to Fathom over major brokerages: \n\nThey pay significantly less commission with Fathom than the other Major Brokers \n\nThe Fathom proprietary technology, IntelliAgent, saves agents time and money and makes it easier to get paid faster. \n\nFree CRM Program for Agents \n\nStock Incentive \n\nIn Depth Detail: \n\nSimple enough, Fathom has one of the best opportunities for agents in the market when it comes to KEEPING their own commission. At a brokerage like Keller Williams, you are expected to pay 20% to 30% of your commission on each sale to the brokerage. On a $300,000 sale at 3% commission, that comes out to $1,800 (@ 20%) or $2,700 (@ 30%) of your $9,000 commission. These brokerages also have desk/monthly/errors and omission (e&amp;o) fees that are $25+ a month. At a certain amount of total commission paid, some brokerages \u201ccap\u201d the agent and they then get to keep 100% of commission. I have seen this be anywhere from $20,000 to $30,000 (this will vary by market). \n\nWith Fathom, an agent only pays a one-time yearly fee of $500 (it comes out of the first commission check), and then $450 per transaction up to 12 sales. Then they pay $99 a transaction afterwards. A Fathom agent pays a total of $5,900 before they cap, then $99 afterwards for every transaction. This is simply a PHENOMINAL deal for the agent. \nI reviewed a number of other agencies like Fathom where you keep 100% of your commission and pay a transaction fee. I did not find one that beat Fathom. The closest second was Realty One. I really liked their offering as well but their costs with monthly fees and transaction fees were double what Fathom was. \nThe only way I could figure out how to keep more of my commission was to open my own brokerage, which has significantly more liability. \n\nFathom OWNS a program called IntelliAgent which every agent they have today uses to submit their paperwork and to obtain funding on their transactions. An agent uploads certain documents to the program in order for their district manager to review for compliance. While this sounds simple, it has been a nightmare in the industry finding something that works across different states with different requirements per transaction. Fathom has navigated this hurdle and IntelliAgent makes it easy for the Agent to get paid. I can speak personally that before I worked for Fathom I had to hire a Transaction Coordinator for each sale I made ($300+ per transaction) just to move the paperwork through my old brokerage. With Fathom I have never needed any assistance because IntelliAgent works so well. This will be a KEY factor in how they scale up from the 27 states they are in today. \n\nRight now Fathom gives all their agents KV Core, which is a CRM /Marketing platform for agents to use to help run their business and customer drips. It is the same program a number of real estate companies use (I believe EXP uses KV Core). It is a VERY good program. But they do not OWN the program and I am sure they pay a hefty sum to offer this as part of their package. \n\nOn 3/2/2021 Fathom closed a deal to purchase a company called Naberly Solutions. With Naberly, Fathom will have the last piece of the puzzle they did not own; their own proprietary CRM software. By owning the software, Fathom will reduce their costs as they no longer will be paying for KV Core for agents and differentiate themselves from other brokerages. Owning their CRM should also be a major plus for investors. This will be a savings for Fathom once it is rolled out to their agents. I have not seen a timeline announced for that at this time. \n\nOne final reason agents are moving to Fathom is because of the stock program. Right now, seasoned agents are being given stock grants for joining Fathom. Agents who qualify are being offered $200 per transaction they had the year prior to joining Fathom, up to $6000 in grants. These grants come with a three-year vesting schedule which will help keep agents with the company. A lot of the original agents received their stock grants at $10.00 per share when the company had their IPO last year. The stock is currently selling over $30.00 and was over $50.00 before the market downturn the past few weeks. Fathom also launched a program to incentivize current agents to recruit new agents. Agents also get stock grants for each transaction they complete. \n\nA lot of brokerages have an additional hook to get agents to recruit, but if you look more into them it is more of a pyramid scheme than an incentive program. No one has a program like Fathom is offering with their stock grants. I also believe the upside on the stock is significant and many agents moving over see the potential as well. \nSo if everything is cheap and the agent is getting such a great deal, how does Fathom make money? They do so by scaling the business. For the past six years they have been on the INC 500/5000 Fastest Growing Companies in America and are currently in 27 states. Because of the influx of new agents in 2020, they had 74% revenue growth between Q3 2019 vs Q3 2020. \nFathom also bought a title company in 2020 which should create additional opportunity on each transaction completed by their agents to make additional revenue by being the company who manages the title search (around $75 to $200 per transaction). This does not mean they WILL get that additional revenue on each transaction, but the opportunity will be there when it wasn\u2019t before. \nI do not expect the acquisitions to end there. They just acquired 230 additional agents in Atlanta through the acquisition of Red Barn Real Estate on 3/5/2021 to add on to the 200 agents Fathom already had in the area per their press release. \nOverall I moved my business to Fathom for the reasons I listed above. I believe in the company and I like the stock. \nI do want to note, I believe the illustrious Ripster has also noted a few times he has or was trading this stock also.",

        "selftext": "Hey there folks! Today I want to talk to you about what\u2019s really going on in the stock market and what we should expected next\u2026\n\nSo, in the last couple of weeks, we have seen a very fast correction in the tech heavy Nasdaq [Index](https://imgur.com/aK26hjA) after the bond yields rapidly spiked over 1.5% for the 10y, as a lot of investors kept getting spooked by the employment numbers coming in slightly better than expected, though many important things are still hidden in those numbers.\n\nFor example, last week we saw the US gaining almost 400K jobs, but this barely moved the unemployment [rate](https://imgur.com/7PJTWUA) which still stands at 6.2% (and this doesn\u2019t even include people who just quit searching for jobs). Almost all of the job [gains](https://imgur.com/B3av5gb) were seen in the leisure and hospitality sector, which has started to regain some momentum after it was the most affected by the events of last year, as this sector is still down more than 3.5M jobs since a year ago.\n\nThese past weeks we also [saw](https://imgur.com/yeudkin) jobless claims continuing to go down, with the latest initial jobless claims coming in at the lowest level since last early last year at just over 700K, as the continuing jobless claims also coming in at just over 4.1M.\n\nBut guys, regardless of the jobs &amp; unemployment numbers, the main thing that will keep investors on edge will continue to be treasury [yields](https://imgur.com/rDjy9fO), the interest rates and how this are affected by the inflation [numbers](https://imgur.com/awXUGgw) which are expected to see a huge bump in the next months as we will have very low comps compared to last year when we saw the rona starting to pick up steam.\n\nWe can see [here](https://imgur.com/QbuiSot) the core inflation came lower this month with an increase of just .1% which jolted the stock market and started a recovery after the sell-off in the past weeks.\n\nGiven that tech names &amp; EVs were some of the biggest hit stocks we should also take a quick look at NIO, as the company lost almost half of its value in the past month, dropping from over $66 to just $35 after the big sell off in the past weeks. \n\nNIO\u2019s drop was also amplified probably by the fact that they posted mixed [results](https://imgur.com/t0jRJEW) for the 4th quarter of last year, as they just missed the top line but did manage to post a solid beat on the company\u2019s bottom line, losing just $0.14/share.\n\nInvestors might not have been happy to see a guidance of just 15% above their 4th quarter given the huge valuation and expectations of the company and the huge global chip shortage that will limit NIO\u2019s production capacity to just 7.5K in the 2nd quarter of 2021.\n\nI still have a mixed opinion about NIO\u2019s stock, but after this huge sell-off, it has become more attractive given the continued [growth](https://imgur.com/cI1TNWJ) of sales the company has seen in the last years, while I also believe NIO will remain one of the winners of the EV disruption.\n\nThe other stock that I wanted to mention after what has happened in the past weeks is Zoom.\n\nI really like Zoom\u2019s products and I understand the hype of the stock, but I also really believe they will struggle to keep the huge growth rate going, as the company might have seen its peak growth after the massive work-from-home movement in 2020.\n\n[Zoom](https://imgur.com/UygZxJZ) also reported a beat on the top &amp; bottom line and I expect them to continue to have another great first half to start 2021, but after that, the company will have very though comps to go against, which might really put some downward pressure on the stock, especially as more people go back to their workplaces.\n\nYou can see, even the company doesn\u2019t expect the huge growth to continue, with the revenue growth expected to only slightly continue to grow during 2021.\n\nZoom is valued at almost $100B which is really hard to justify unless the company continues to innovate and bring more &amp; more products to the market, as the industry they operate in will only become more competitive over time with other big players like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce &amp; many others looking to take market share.\n\nGuys, if you are still in doubt about what to do next in the stock market, you should just take a look at the chart below and start thinking long term, because investing, if you are really looking to make money is all about the long-term.\n\nYou can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/ZlO593t) in the past 100 years we've had 8 bear markets previous to the one we saw in 2020, with the average bear market lasting just 1.4years compared to over 9 years for every bull market with a staggering difference in gains vs losses as well. \n\nWe can also see in this [chart](https://imgur.com/wM39iSQ) that it only took 15 days for the Nasdaq to enter a 10% correction this time, but you can see the average 12 month return after a 10% correction is almost 30% which is huge, with the likelihood of the index posting a positive return in the next 12 months standing at over 90%\n\nSo, given that we had a bear market last year, I believe it\u2019s highly unlikely that we will see a huge drop in stocks even if yields continue to rise, as the real return of the treasury yields will continue to be close to 0, as I don\u2019t expect them to jump more than 2% for the 10y anytime soon.\n\nMoving on, I recently saw some [comments](https://imgur.com/I3ijkKT) made by David Tepper which I wasn\u2019t really aware of but which made a lot of sense to me, he highlighted that the other downward pressure put on treasury yields, which will keep them in check, will come from investors in other countries like Japan, Germany &amp; many others, as the US treasuries have become way more attractive than others.\n\nOne other thing that I think should be mentioned is that the [Dow Jones](https://imgur.com/undefined) has continued to make new high after new high in the past week, being led by companies like Disney which has just surpassed 100M [subscribers](https://imgur.com/fCTDNGX) on their Disney+ platform while also getting a boost from their other revenue streams starting to come back online, and of course the stock that has led the DOW in the past week, Boeing, as the [company](https://imgur.com/K6SPGY1) had more sales than cancellations for the first time since November 2019 as the 737 MAX crisis is finally starting to fade away for the company, with even more possible [deals](https://imgur.com/4XYgfs9) likely to close in the next period, as airlines start to have a better view of what the future will bring for them.\n\nFriends, you shouldn\u2019t be scared of stock market corrections or dips as we have [seen](https://imgur.com/74dAwZO) a 10% pullback once every 11 months as you can see, with the frequency of bigger crashes decreasing significantly, but as always, because we are highly emotional beings, it\u2019s very hard for us to handle our emotions after a series of red days. \n\nYou should remember though, most often than not, the best way to go is just to ride out the dip and even starting deploying more cash into the stock market the more it drops. I think you should develop a strategy of not selling on big red days and deploying an increasingly higher % of your cash into great stocks the more the stock market drops.\n\nI also fully expect some part of the next stimulus check, which was just signed by Biden, to end up in the stock market, which might help push the stock market on the right path despite increasing pressures from rising yields and possible short-term inflation fears.\n\n**So just to end this post guys, is the stock market going to crash? My short answer is NO!**\n\nI don\u2019t expect that to happen any time soon. Even if we continue to see volatility in the stock market you should use that to your advantage and smartly deploy cash into great companies, which leads me to my other question, should you buy stocks today?

Again, not an expert so that is why I am posting that.\n\n**Why agents are moving to Fathom over major brokerages:** \n\n1: They pay significantly less commission with Fathom than the other Major Brokers\n\n2: The Fathom proprietary technology, IntelliAgent, saves agents time and money and makes it easier to get paid faster.\n\n3: Free CRM Program for Agents\n\n4: Stock Incentive\n\n**In Depth Detail:**\n\n1: Simple enough, Fathom has one of the best opportunities for agents in the market when it comes to KEEPING their own commission. At a brokerage like Keller Williams, you are expected to pay 20% to 30% of your commission on each sale to the brokerage. On a $300,000 sale at 3% commission, that comes out to $1,800 (@ 20%) or $2,700 (@ 30%) of your $9,000 commission. These brokerages also have desk/monthly/errors and omission (e&amp;o) fees that are $25+ a month. At a certain amount of total commission paid, some brokerages \u201ccap\u201d the agent and they then get to keep 100% of commission. I have seen this be anywhere from $20,000 to $30,000 (this will vary by market).\n\nWith Fathom, an agent only pays a one-time yearly fee of $500 (it comes out of the first commission check), and then $450 per transaction up to 12 sales. Then they pay $99 a transaction afterwards. A Fathom agent pays a total of $5,900 before they cap, then $99 afterwards for every transaction.  This is simply a PHENOMINAL deal for the agent.\n\nI reviewed a number of other agencies like Fathom where you keep 100% of your commission and pay a transaction fee. I did not find one that beat Fathom. The closest second was Realty One. I really liked their offering as well but their costs with monthly fees and transaction fees were double what Fathom was.\n\nThe only way I could figure out how to keep more of my commission was to open my own brokerage, which has significantly more liability.\n\n2: Fathom OWNS a program called IntelliAgent which every agent they have today uses to submit their paperwork and to obtain funding on their transactions. An agent uploads certain documents to the program in order for their district manager to review for compliance. While this sounds simple, it has been a nightmare in the industry finding something that works across different states with different requirements per transaction. Fathom has navigated this hurdle and IntelliAgent makes it easy for the Agent to get paid. I can speak personally that before I worked for Fathom I had to hire a Transaction Coordinator for each sale I made ($300+ per transaction) just to move the paperwork through my old brokerage. With Fathom I have never needed any assistance because IntelliAgent works so well. This will be a KEY factor in how they scale up from the 27 states they are in today.\n\n3: Right now Fathom gives all their agents KV Core, which is a CRM /Marketing platform for agents to use to help run their business and customer drips. It is the same program a number of real estate companies use (I believe EXP uses KV Core). It is a VERY good program. But they do not OWN the program and I am sure they pay a hefty sum to offer this as part of their package.\n\nOn 3/2/2021 Fathom closed a deal to purchase a company called Naberly Solutions. With Naberly, Fathom will have the last piece of the puzzle they did not own; their own proprietary CRM software. By owning the software, Fathom will reduce their costs as they no longer will be paying for KV Core for agents and differentiate themselves from other brokerages. Owning their CRM should also be a major plus for investors. This will be a savings for Fathom once it is rolled out to their agents. I have not seen a timeline announced for that at this time.\n\n4: One final reason agents are moving to Fathom is because of the stock program. Right now, seasoned agents are being given stock grants for joining Fathom. Agents who qualify are being offered $200 per transaction they had the year prior to joining Fathom, up to $6000 in grants. These grants come with a three-year vesting schedule which will help keep agents with the company. A lot of the original agents received their stock grants at $10.00 per share when the company had their IPO last year. The stock is currently selling over $30.00 and was over $50.00 before the market downturn the past few weeks. Fathom also launched a program to incentivize current agents to recruit new agents. Agents also get stock grants for each transaction they complete.\n\nA lot of brokerages have an additional hook to get agents to recruit, but if you look more into them it is more of a pyramid scheme than an incentive program. No one has a program like Fathom is offering with their stock grants. I also believe the upside on the stock is significant and many agents moving over see the potential as well.\n\nSo if everything is cheap and the agent is getting such a great deal, how does Fathom make money? They do so by scaling the business. For the past six years they have been on the INC 500/5000 Fastest Growing Companies in America and are currently in 27 states. Because of the influx of new agents in 2020, they had 74% revenue growth between Q3 2019 vs Q3 2020.  \n\nFathom also bought a title company in 2020 which should create additional opportunity on each transaction completed by their agents to make additional revenue by being the company who manages the title search (around $75 to $200 per transaction). This does not mean they WILL get that additional revenue on each transaction, but the opportunity will be there when it wasn\u2019t before. \n\nI do not expect the acquisitions to end there. They just acquired 230 additional agents in Atlanta through the acquisition of Red Barn Real Estate on 3/5/2021 to add on to the 200 agents Fathom already had in the area per their press release.\n\nOverall I moved my business to Fathom for the reasons I listed above. I believe in the company and I like the stock.",

        "selftext": "\nDISCLOSURE I own 10,000 SHARES of $FTOC may add more or the warrants in the future if price continues to decline. \n\rThe 1 sentence conclusion is that at $11 a share $FTOC seems to provide a good risk/reward. Below I provide a more detailed explanation, the real version would take me 20 pages but this version is for THE REDDITORS!!!\n\rSo, in the past here I have posted about $COTY and $APPH but what many of you may not know about me is that I have been involved in the digital coin and payments space for the past 5 years and have been using Payoneer for years to pay contractors.  Nevertheless, Payoneer is more than that. I understand that at first glance it looks like just another Paypal which is fine because PayPal has been growing and is profitable, even though it took a bit of a hiatus once it was owned by EBAY (Ebay was right to buy them but wrong to not let them grow freely as they could after the spin-off).  \n\rAnyway, I see so many possibilities for Payoneer that I think many are not being considering at all.  Not only is the business going to be growing at LEAST 25% for the next few years but I think it can expand 35% to 50% per year for the next 3 to 5 given the massive shift of online transactions but also new services. To simplify, adding more services to cater their current customers helps them bring in new customers which nets them more revenues and profits. \r\n\nThe issue with Payoneer has been that they never had enough capital to grow or to provide their customers more. It takes a long time to build a really robust and safe payments platform. Payoneer has been around for more than 10 years and it took a lot of capital and development hours to get to where they are today.  The business was limited to transactional growth which is fine but when that is like a profit of like 0.5% (as most goes to the credit card companies or banks) it is hard to grow or ever be profitable.  So, Payoneer for years has been in this stunted growth because of lack of capital or because they are in markets that were \u201chigh risk\u201d, like not being in the USA vs. being in the Ukraine.\n\rI think there are many reasons they did a SPAC and if I were to top it off it is because they failed to do an IPO a long time ago, capital is expensive via private transactions and it would never be enough.  So, yes they could have done raises of $50mm every year but in this type of industry when you have so many competitors who have tens of billions of revenues and hundreds of billions of transaction volume you need a lot more to be able to compete.  $500 million makes you a pretty major player in the game vs. struggling with small raises.  Definitely not ideal for shareholders but in the long-term it is the best way to assure your business can compete at the very least survive.   \n\rWhen I usually look into these stock ideas or analysis I go through a process but here on REDDIT I feel I need to provide a sort of cliffs notes because I can really go into a deep dive analysis of like 10 to 20 pages to really understand the entire business, how it makes or loses money. So I will to the best of my ability be concise but deep with my knowledge of the business. \n\rBusiness model\rHere are all of the products that Payoneer offers its customers. \rGlobal Payments, Multi-currency account, physical and virtual cards, B2B accounts payable and accounts receivable, working capital, merchant services, compliance and tax. \n\rSo, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business\u2019 needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins and no doubt they will be offering that soon, if anything they should make that a major priority. \n\rWho are their customers and where are they know?\r5 million businesses in 190 countries. Customers include Amazon, Wish, Lazada (owned by Alibaba) Shopee, and Ebay. Weird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too.  This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypal\u2019s or banks are NOT willing to take the risk.  Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access.  \n\rWhat are the growth drivers?\rAcquisition in new or existing markets (which drives better margins) and working capital for some of their customers (not all) which is what helps Amazon and Paypal grow their business.  When someone makes a transaction say buyer and seller the bank or credit card companies make fees but when both consumer and business use Payoneer exclusively they avoid transaction fees with banks which is why these platforms push or provide discounts for encouraging transactions within the same network vs. out of network.  Over time more and more transactions will be within network, just takes more people to be part of the ecosystem. \n\rWhat are the revenues of the business? Company estimates. \r2020  $346mm\r*2021 $432 mm\r*2022 $540 mm\rWhat do I think actually happens?\r2020 $350 to $400mm\r2021 $450 to $550mm\r2022 $600 to $700mm\rWhy?  Because $500 million of capital allows you to expand faster than before and I think the management has been prudent not to be so aggressive in their esimtates because I don\u2019t think anyone can believe they can so more than 35% a year but I do.  \n\rWhat does that say about valuation? \rWell, Paypal at its spin-off inception traded as low as 5x revenue but growing 15% to 20% a year and when it had $11 billion in revenues now it is growing same rate but trading at 15x Revenue. That means that given Payoneer is growing double the rate and 95% smaller they can command a higher multiple but for the sake of being \u201cconservative\u201d let\u2019s use 5x revenue as the TROUGH valuation and 20x revenue as the PEAK. \n\r2020  $346mm  Trough is $1.75 billion or $4.60 a share. Peak is $6.92 Billion or $18.21 \r*2021 $432mm Trough is $2.16 Billion or $5.70 a share. Peak is $8.64 billion which is $22.75 a share. \r*2022 $540 mm Tough is $2.70 Billion or $7 a share. Peak is $10.8 Billion or $28 a share. \n\rIf you used my estimates it would be the following\r2021 $450 to $550mm Trough is $6 or Peak of $29\r2022 $600 to $700mm Tough is $7.89 or Peak of $36.84\rGiven the current price of $11 it becomes a 4 up and 1 down scenario, a good risk/reward bet. \n\rWhat do I think the future holds for Payoneer?\rI actually think there are several exits for this company. \r1.\tCompany continues to grow and eventually reach billions or revenue within 5 to 10 years. So many factors and things that can happen since sometimes a 10x of revenue growth does not always mean 10x in stock price, could be -50% (due to massive dilution or debt) or 10,000% (no dilution, growth increasing, becomes a top 5 player).  So consider that when you get too enthusiastic about prospects there is always a downside. \r2.\tLarge international payments processer buys them. Could be Paypal, Square, Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company.  Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed.  Before you had 100,000 banks then it was 50,000 banks, then 10,000 banks and now like 5,000 banks but the top 10 banks make up a large % of the business/volume. \r3.\tWildcard: CRM business buys them. What many people do not realize is that CRM\u2019s have been changing the game.  First it was to help you sell with marketing tools, then it is to improve communication within the team, then it will be storage, and legal transactions then it will be financial transaction.  They are literally going to control the beginning to the end of the customer relationship and all of that data they possess is very valuable to help their customers grow. \r\rConclusion:  $FTOC provides a good risk reward and many ways to play the exit depending on your risk tolerance.  \rIf you like my analysis please share with other people and if you want me to look at a company and provide an analysis like this I can do that for a small fee. Nevertheless, I welcome everyone and anyone here to discuss all of the good and bad about $FTOC because that I love about the Reddit community is how open, transparent and sometimes incredibly funny you all are. \n\rGood luck to every one! \rValue Maverick",

        "selftext": "\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Zoom Video Communications says its mission is \"to make video communications frictionless,\" which it\nseeks to accomplish with a unified, video-first communications platform that incorporates video, voice,\nchat, and content sharing. The company offers a differentiated peer-to-peer technology, complete with\nproprietary routing technology. Zoom is a recognized market leader in meeting software and is\ndisrupting and expanding the $43 billion video conferencing market with its ease of use and superior\nuser experience. Zoom has product and technology advantages, but there may not be \nenough for a moat at this stage in its life cycle.\nZoom relies mainly on a low-touch e-commerce model that lends itself to viral adoption, but it has also\nestablished a direct salesforce to gather and serve larger, more strategic customers. The company has\nbeen adept at adding users, especially during COVID-19-induced lockdowns, and it also has several\nrelated products to upsell. Zoom has already produced a full year of GAAP\nprofitability, and has seen quarterly non-GAAP operating margin top 40%.\nWith the recent introduction of Zoom Phone, which it does not plan to sell to customers who do not\nalready have Zoom Meetings, the portfolio is expanding meaningfully. The company\u2019s focus is squarely\non adding as many users as possible. This starts with generating buzz and familiarity with free users,\nwhile the direct salesforce sells to enterprise accounts. Customers are growing rapidly, with larger\ncustomers numbering more than 988, while smaller customers total approximately 370,000.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\ude80  Revenue grew 369% year over year to $882 million, which topped the high end of guidance of $811\nmillion. Demand remains robust as Zoom continues to gather new customers, which continue to\ncontribute more to revenue growth than existing customers are--unusual for a software company of\nZoom\u2019s size. Demand remains strong across all verticals and customer sizes, which was initially\npandemic-driven but is resulting in dee okper walled penetration at larger paying customers. Customers with more than $100,000 in trailing annual revenues accelerated meaningfully once again to 156% year-\nover-year growth to 1,644. Clearly larger customers added meaningfully to their seat count, but small\ncustomers contributed 37% of revenue, up from around 20% over the last couple years. As the world\nopens back up from COVID-19 over the next several quarters, management expects churn to be elevated\nfrom its 4% monthly historical norm, but notes that turnover has been better than expected over the last\ncouple quarters and net dollar expansion remains strong.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\ude80  According to Morningstar, fair value estimate for Zoom is $223 per share, which implies a fiscal 2022 enterprise value/sales\nmultiple of 17 times, adjusted price/earnings multiple of 60 times, and a 1.5% free cash flow yield.\nDespite the substantial model reset higher after the April 2020 quarter, multiples remain near the top\nend of the range for software companies.\nThere are two related controversies surrounding the stock: 1) how rapidly will the user base\ngrow and 2) how long robust growth can continue. Forecasts suggest aggressive growth continuing in the coming\nyears and model total revenue growth in excess of 40% in fiscal 2022, decelerating to 20% in fiscal\n2026, representing a five-year compound annual growth rate of 26%. Revenue will shift more\ntoward existing customers over time, and solutions beyond Zoom Meetings (Rooms, Connector,\nOnZoom, Zapps, and Phones) will increase within the mix. Models estimate non-GAAP operating margin\nactually contracting modestly from 37% in fiscal 2021 (actual) but still remaining in the mid 30% area\nthrough fiscal 2026.\nIn its S-1 filing, the company sized the unified communications and collaboration market at $43.1 billion\nby 2022, based on data from IDC. This market is likely growing at approximately 3% annually, with a\nclear shift toward cloud-based solutions like Zoom\u2019s. Management further believes that Zoom\u2019s\nopportunity is larger, especially after blowout results throughout fiscal 2021, as video penetration can\nincrease materially as users experience the ease of use and robust features the platform offers. Phone systems make up the lion\u2019s share of this total market, with conferencing (including\nvideo conferencing) accounting for 10%-15% of the total.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80  Tldr;\n\n\nBoth the Zoom user base and the company\u2019s revenue have grown rapidly and are expected to continue\nto do so over the next several years.\nZoom offers a disruptive technology that is designed from the ground up as a video-first collaboration\nplatform. Customer satisfaction is well above video conferencing peers. Zoom\u2019s low-touch, low-friction model should eventually drive strong margins. The company has already\nproduced a full year of positive GAAP profitability, which is well ahead of other high-growth software\npeers\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\nTldr;Tldr;\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\n[ZM position](http://imgur.com/gallery/PKcxHP6)",

        "selftext": "\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Zoom Video Communications says its mission is \"to make video communications frictionless,\" which it\nseeks to accomplish with a unified, video-first communications platform that incorporates video, voice,\nchat, and content sharing. The company offers a differentiated peer-to-peer technology, complete with\nproprietary routing technology. Zoom is a recognized market leader in meeting software and is\ndisrupting and expanding the $43 billion video conferencing market with its ease of use and superior\nuser experience. Zoom has product and technology advantages, but there may not be \nenough for a moat at this stage in its life cycle.\nZoom relies mainly on a low-touch e-commerce model that lends itself to viral adoption, but it has also\nestablished a direct salesforce to gather and serve larger, more strategic customers. The company has\nbeen adept at adding users, especially during COVID-19-induced lockdowns, and it also has several\nrelated products to upsell. Zoom has already produced a full year of GAAP\nprofitability, and has seen quarterly non-GAAP operating margin top 40%.\nWith the recent introduction of Zoom Phone, which it does not plan to sell to customers who do not\nalready have Zoom Meetings, the portfolio is expanding meaningfully. The company\u2019s focus is squarely\non adding as many users as possible. This starts with generating buzz and familiarity with free users,\nwhile the direct salesforce sells to enterprise accounts. Customers are growing rapidly, with larger\ncustomers numbering more than 988, while smaller customers total approximately 370,000.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\ude80  Revenue grew 369% year over year to $882 million, which topped the high end of guidance of $811\nmillion. Demand remains robust as Zoom continues to gather new customers, which continue to\ncontribute more to revenue growth than existing customers are--unusual for a software company of\nZoom\u2019s size. Demand remains strong across all verticals and customer sizes, which was initially\npandemic-driven but is resulting in dee okper walled penetration at larger paying customers. Customers with more than $100,000 in trailing annual revenues accelerated meaningfully once again to 156% year-\nover-year growth to 1,644. Clearly larger customers added meaningfully to their seat count, but small\ncustomers contributed 37% of revenue, up from around 20% over the last couple years. As the world\nopens back up from COVID-19 over the next several quarters, management expects churn to be elevated\nfrom its 4% monthly historical norm, but notes that turnover has been better than expected over the last\ncouple quarters and net dollar expansion remains strong.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\ude80  According to Morningstar, fair value estimate for Zoom is $223 per share, which implies a fiscal 2022 enterprise value/sales\nmultiple of 17 times, adjusted price/earnings multiple of 60 times, and a 1.5% free cash flow yield.\nDespite the substantial model reset higher after the April 2020 quarter, multiples remain near the top\nend of the range for software companies.\nThere are two related controversies surrounding the stock: 1) how rapidly will the user base\ngrow and 2) how long robust growth can continue. Forecasts suggest aggressive growth continuing in the coming\nyears and model total revenue growth in excess of 40% in fiscal 2022, decelerating to 20% in fiscal\n2026, representing a five-year compound annual growth rate of 26%. Revenue will shift more\ntoward existing customers over time, and solutions beyond Zoom Meetings (Rooms, Connector,\nOnZoom, Zapps, and Phones) will increase within the mix. Models estimate non-GAAP operating margin\nactually contracting modestly from 37% in fiscal 2021 (actual) but still remaining in the mid 30% area\nthrough fiscal 2026.\nIn its S-1 filing, the company sized the unified communications and collaboration market at $43.1 billion\nby 2022, based on data from IDC. This market is likely growing at approximately 3% annually, with a\nclear shift toward cloud-based solutions like Zoom\u2019s. Management further believes that Zoom\u2019s\nopportunity is larger, especially after blowout results throughout fiscal 2021, as video penetration can\nincrease materially as users experience the ease of use and robust features the platform offers. Phone systems make up the lion\u2019s share of this total market, with conferencing (including\nvideo conferencing) accounting for 10%-15% of the total.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nTldr;\nBoth the Zoom user base and the company\u2019s revenue have grown rapidly and are expected to continue\nto do so over the next several years.\nZoom offers a disruptive technology that is designed from the ground up as a video-first collaboration\nplatform. Customer satisfaction is well above video conferencing peers. Zoom\u2019s low-touch, low-friction model should eventually drive strong margins. The company has already\nproduced a full year of positive GAAP profitability, which is well ahead of other high-growth software\npeers\n\n\nTldr;Tldr;\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n[ZM position](http://imgur.com/gallery/PKcxHP6)",
