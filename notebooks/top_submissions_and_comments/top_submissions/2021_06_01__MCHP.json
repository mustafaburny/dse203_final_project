        "selftext": "bla bla apes bla bla stupid idiots bla bla not financial advice bla bla intro meme\n\nReal talk, I'd like to reintroduce you to the deep value gaming market stock the world seems to have forgot about.\n\nI've been bleeding out on FDs in sideways trading hell on this for too many months and its about time everybody opens their eyes to this play...and reap the inevitable rewards.\n\nIn the shadow of the $AMC mega-gains, you might overlook $CRSR's respectable 7% lift this week.  But this movement is actually the sign of a fuse thats just been lit.I shouldn't have to give most of you too much introduction on the company itself. Corsair was founded in 1994, and has since become one of the global leaders in PC gaming hardware and peripherals.  The company IPO'd last September at \\~$15 and made a heroic run up to almost $51 before retreating into a seemingly never-ending sideways cycle. The company has a proven track record in an exploding industry.\n\n# Rockstar Fundamentals\n\nWhether you care about the F-word or not, Corsair has been an incredible buy opportunity. Even before the pandemic their revenues and profits were growing.\n\nCRSR is on track to exceed $2bln revenue this year, more than doubling 2019 sales.  Profitability margins have been increasing every year since IPO\n\nThey have plenty of cash in the tank, and have been paying down debts. Its held 5% by Insiders, and a whopping 77% by institutional investors.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6tc7coxn3371.png?width=836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26e7364054a60f1b492cfcbd2b1fb672c1a77ab6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8wfy4lwyn3371.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b9bbdf6f4a9971648fa7799d8bcf1b2680e1828\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe company isn't a one-trick pony. Aside from dominating some hardware sectors like Memory, Corsair has been making strategic acquisitions in the streaming space (most notably scooping up Elgato.)\n\nBy all accounts, Corsair is making all the right moves and is currently firmly in undervalued territory.\n\n# Months of sideways strangulation by FUD-bears and Shorts.\n\n$CRSR investors have endured many months of maddening sideways trading. For the first few months it seemed like it was trading with the market...and that investors were just waiting to see what happened with some upcoming news.\n\nBut after releasing good news after good news, the stock has continued to stagnate, and bounce around in completely unnatural intraday boom/bust cycles. Almost on queue swinging -2% to +2% to -2%  every day.\n\nThe reason for this is due to a mix of a very **low float and ridiculously low volume.** These two factors have allowed swing traders and institutional short sellers to play this stock like a fiddle.\n\nCRSR has just **92 M** shares outstanding, and  **26.51M** shares in the float\\*\\*.\\*\\* Most of the shares are held by institutions.\n\nShort interest has been hovering around 20%. Which is high on its own...but doesn't tell the full story. Big pocket institutions have been selling tens of thousands of shares short in the AM, then covering intraday.\n\nWith the low volume, it doesn't take much to push the price down substantially without much ammo.\n\nThe big boys have been writing calls / buying puts, and then using shorts and their own holdings to push  the price down before exercise.\n\nMeanwhile, bears have been spreading FUD throughout the investment world about CRSR on 3 primary points. None of which have actually come to fruition.\n\n1. **CRSR is a \"Pandemic Play\", and gaming will magically disappear after things return to normal.**   This is the biggest boomer bs. The pc gaming and esports industries have been absolutely exploding over the last few years. Not to mention the streaming space which has been growing independently of it.  CRSR sales are cyclical like every retail company, but Q1 sales showed no signs of slowing.   Gaming is not going anywhere.\n2. **THE SPOOOOKY Lockup period will cause millions of shares to flood the market.** There was tons of FUD spreading about 14 million IPO shares that would become unrestricted for sale back in March. People were convinced that these shares would flood the market instantly and tank the price.  But the lockup period came and went, almost no shares were actually sold.\n3. **The global supply chain shortages means CRSR will not be able to grow.**  True, the microchip shortage is a threat to CRSR, but its also a threat to every other company in that space. What they've announced in their reports is that they had MORE DEMAND THAN THEY COULD FULFILL. That is not a bearish signal.  Despite the supply chain woes, CRSR sales dramatically beat expectations...showing they adapted and overcame this issue.\n\nYou may also be interested that the latest to join the short party is our good friends at Shita-del, making a short play at the end of May.\n\n# The 59% Earning Beat everybody ignored\n\nWhile some were expecting lackluster Q1 21 results as the pandemic wanes and supply chain issues rage on, in the May 2021 earnings release CRSR subverted all expectations. They beat estimates by an incredible 59%.  If anybody needed proof positive CRSR could weather the FUD, this was it.\n\nBut despite the stellar report, the stock actually DROPPED on the earnings report, and never recovered.\n\nYou might be saying \"of course the stock dropped, every tech stock drops on earnings\". Yes, this is true, IF there is a runup in the share price before the announcement. But in this case, there was no runup...the stock had been stagnant and even declining before the announcement.\n\nThis is when every retail CRSR holder knew this stock was not making natural movements, it was being intentionally held down.\n\nBy every logical account, the stock should have lifted in the weeks following the Q1 results. And because it didn't, the market has been ignoring CRSR due to the very effective FUD campaigns and short seller.\n\nBut this also means that the stock has entered deep into undervalued territory.\n\n# LOW FLOAT VOLUME ROCKET\n\nGiven all the drama, why should you be looking at this stock? Because the same factors that bears have been using to hold this stock down are exactly what will cause it to take off.\n\n**ALL $CRSR NEEDS TO BLOW IS A LITTLE MORE VOLUME**\n\nThe big bears have written calls and puts stacked around the $30-$35 strikes out through the EOY  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t0ujqgdnn3371.png?width=973&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a506a07911ed26f5cbef6624b56a4717068089c\n\nAs soon as there is enough positive momentum on this thing from retail, the bearish trading strategies will become ineffective. They will lose a ton of money.\n\n# Breaking Out\n\nCRSR just hit $35/shr today for the first time since early March. This might not seem like much, but its the spark we needed.\n\nI will reiterate, all this stock needs to pop is slightly more positive volume. This stock is poised to blow up fast and hard.  The float is too small, the short-selling tactics will not work when this thing makes a run.\n\nAt the moment it can be moved with only about 50k shares volume... if the volume increases even by 10% or so, its going to run.\n\nAs CRSR continues its exceptional performance, it's only a matter of time before it breaks free from the cycle, and it looks like it will happen sooner than later. When it does happen....the shorts will crumble.\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR\\*\\* A few thousand more people buy $CRSR the rocket gonna go Pop  \n\n\nPositions:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xse2n6qpn3371.png?width=1586&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79d9b5cbecbaf98a53fec3d4c57b9b247275f77e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0c9jf3qtn3371.png?width=724&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=696b50a0218adbddccd0b86aaf11aa2a79220236",

        "selftext": "Pembina  Pipeline Corp. has struck a  friendly deal to acquire Inter Pipeline  Ltd. for $8.3 billion in an  all-share deal after the midstream company  was put in play earlier this  year.\n\nUnder  the terms of the deal, shareholders of Inter Pipeline will  receive  half a share of Pembina for each share held, valuing the deal at  $19.45  per share based on the most recent closing price. That trumps  the  unsolicited $16.50 offer from Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP   that Inter Pipeline rebuffed earlier this year. According to the release   issued Tuesday, Pembina\u2019s executive team will lead the combined  entity,  while Inter Pipeline will have representation on the board of   directors.\n\nInter Pipeline Chair  Margaret McKenzie said the deal with Pembina  represented the best value  for shareholders after the company launched a  strategic review in  February.\n\n\u201cIt was evident that a  combination with Pembina offered compelling  value for Inter Pipeline  shareholders in the short-term, as well as the  opportunity to  participate in the upside of \\[the Heartland Petrochemical  Complex\\] and  the combined business longer-term,\u201d she said in the  release.\n\n\u201cThe  creation of a more highly integrated business across the energy   infrastructure value chain results in a combined entity that is greater   than the sum of its parts.\u201d\n\nThat  Heartland Petrochemical Complex has been key to Inter Pipeline\u2019s  path  forward, with the project outside Edmonton slated to produce  525,000  tonnes of polypropylene per year upon completion. However, it  has been  dogged by contruction delays and cost overruns, and is now  expected to  commence production in early 2022.\n\nThe  two companies said their friendly transaction is expected to  close in  the fourth quarter of this year, pending all necessary  approvals.\n\n[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/pembina-strikes-8-3b-all-stock-deal-for-inter-pipeline-1.1611131](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/pembina-strikes-8-3b-all-stock-deal-for-inter-pipeline-1.1611131)",

        "selftext": "Hello degenerates. \n\nI've been looking into the EV market and everyone always says you late to the party or missed the train when buying EV shares (Missing the boat with TESLA etc). Its like the California gold rush in the old times! People rushed out to make money and find gold but the real entrepreneurs made money selling them their shovels, buckets, food and clothes. Electric Vehicles need charging bays, its a  no brainier?!? SO how on gods green earth can BLNK Shares be heavily shorted to 30% and \"Experts\" say this sector should see nothing but growth! \n\nI've done some very basic DD on BLNK. I've always been quite optimistic in this space for electric vehicles and for those that dont know BLNK provides charging solutions for Electric Vehicles. As of December 2020 they had 16, 617 charging stations around the USA but they are one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the NYSE. Over 30% short interest. I would hate to know what the outstanding naked short value is. \n\nNow when you look at expected Electric vehicle sales forecasts below:\n\n*\"The US electric vehicles market is expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020\"*\n\n[https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan)\n\nDeloitte even say this sector will continue to boom for the next 10 years.  \"Our global *EV forecast* is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years\"\n\n[https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html)\n\nAND EVEN FORBES SAYS IT!!! I know Forbes hasn't always been on our apes side for the GME battle and AMC war but they seem to contradicting what is currently going on in EV charging! \n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2021/03/09/electric-cars-are-coming-and-if-you-dont-like-it-tough/?sh=6f8be1c5698f](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2021/03/09/electric-cars-are-coming-and-if-you-dont-like-it-tough/?sh=6f8be1c5698f) \n\n*\u201cWith the prospect of sticker price parity even without subsidies by  2025, we take a strong positive view on EV penetration. We raise our  global EV sales forecasts again, this time mainly driven by higher  estimates for the U.S. market. We expect the Biden administration to  increase direct support for EV purchases,\u201d the UBS report said.*\n\n*The Biden plan for 500,000 charging stations would more than double  the current count, while it could impose tougher fuel economy standards  to curb ICE car sales. The ban on ICE sales by governments like  Britain\u2019s will also give a powerful signal to buyers to embrace  electric. .\"*\n\n They also out shot analyst expectations for revenue for the previous quarter see below.\n\n## Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) Earnings Information\n\nBlink  Charging last announced its quarterly earnings data on May 12th, 2021.  The reported ($0.18) EPS for the quarter, missing analysts' consensus  estimates of ($0.17) by $0.01. **The company had revenue of $2.23 million  for the quarter, compared to analysts' expectations of $1.71 million.**  Blink Charging has generated ($0.59) earnings per share over the last  year. Blink Charging has not formally confirmed its next earnings  publication date, but the company's estimated earnings date is Thursday,  August 12th, 2021 based off prior year's report dates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8zncmbtdsm271.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad2848ae0b193b360ddf5f727fe8b0e051c1b480\n\nI also cant explain how BLNK had a share price above 3600 in 2010. Maybe some wrinkled brains can help explain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ucgewxa3um271.png?width=1610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8bf33e2f66e875cd6ec05d96c78450366962c42\n\nSo in ending for now I cant help but wonder what the hell is going on in the EV charging scene. With all this talk about the future Being EV, Biden backing the electric F150 and international markets across the scene being so bullish. How can one stock like BLNK be so heavily shorted. I would love to know how many Naked shorts have been placed against a company like this. \n\nI'm No financial advisor nor am I calling for people to load up on BLNK to squeeze the hell out of these hedge funds and their short positions. And just to clarify I am holding shares in BLNK and have been for some time.",

        "selftext": "Hear me out on this one as we are on the brink of theScore's BIGGEST catalyst.\n\nPosition: 1K shares at an avg of $CAD 12.18.\n\nThe stock is traded on the NASDAQ &amp; TSX under ticker: SCR\n\n**Some context on the company and it\u2019s industries (Sports Media/Sports Betting):**\n\nTheScore mobile is the number 1 most used sports app in Canada with 10 times more users than ESPN. It\u2019s one of the most used sports mobile apps in all of North America citing almost 4 BILLION user sessions over the last year. They have industry leading rates of user engagement at an average of 130 minutes per visitor with each user opening the app an average of 125 times a month.\n\nThis engagement is due to the many features in the app including: real-time sports news, live scores, in-game highlights, a social ecosystem where fans can chat and discuss live games, add friends, send private messages, etc. They have original media content, in-game odds, sports betting content and even personalized promos for bettors based on their in-app media interests. They\u2019ve reported close to 4 million unique users per month.\n\nTheScore achieved this success despite being a small company against industry titans. They\u2019re no stranger to being an underdog which now follows them in the mobile sports betting industry. PASPA was repealed in 2018 allowing individual states to offer legalized, regulated sports betting. The North American opportunity for this industry is estimated to represent a $US 22 billion opportunity by 2025.\n\ntheScore made the decision in 2019 to enter the market as an operator in [NJ through a partnership with Darby Development](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/09/introducing-thescore-bet-thescores-mobile-sportsbook-launches-in-new-jersey/) with their Score Bet app. They have since expanded operations to a total of 4 betting states (NJ, CO, IN, IO) and have acquired market access agreements across 14 states via a [partnership with Penn National](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/07/thescore-and-penn-national-gaming-enter-into-strategic-multi-state-market-access-partnership/) and other market access deals ([CZR deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210329005427/en/theScore-Secures-Market-Access-for-Mobile-Sports-Betting-in-Illinois-Through-Agreement-with-Caesars-Entertainment)) which represent more than 30% of the U.S. population and a $US 8.2 billion opportunity for them. The CEO and founder, John Levy, has stated that by next year they will be operating in at least double the amount of states and that they\u2019ll be active in 35 States within 3 to 5 years.\n\nTheScore recently rebuilt their media app completely in-house to increase its performance, stability, and scalability, likely related to continued user growth and future betting integrations. They\u2019ve built their \u201cFuse\u201d and \u201cBet Section\u201d as a fully integrated approach to link their gaming and media apps. Users of both apps can now build their bet slip while benefiting from all of theScore\u2019s features. When they\u2019re ready to finalize their bet, they\u2019ll be taken to the [Score Bet app](https://www.thescore.bet/) to place their bet or cash out. This is a defining feature that their highly engaged userbase will remember and one that will lead to higher rates of retention vs competitors that treat the bet as just a transaction. This approach not only increases retention rates but also greatly reduces their customer acquisition costs in an industry that is renowned for not having brand loyalty.\n\nThe New Jersey handle (Percentage of the total amount of bets taken in the State) rose 195% versus the prior year, validating that their unique combination of media and betting remains a powerful differentiating factor against competitors in their oldest operating State. Total gaming handle also grew 46% overall compared to the previous quarter. They are the only media company to be operating their own book and they\u2019ve been seeing these early signs of success. Other companies have started to take notice as they\u2019ve been buying or partnering with media companies via expensive deals (ex: [DKNG 1](https://www.sportico.com/business/sports-betting/2021/draftkings-buys-vsin-1234625970/), [DKNG 2](https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/09/draftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&amp;wpaffn=Google&amp;wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F&amp;wpcn=about&amp;wpscn=news%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F), [PENN](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/29/21113130/barstool-sports-penn-national-deal-dave-portnoy-chernin), [FOX](https://www.starsgroup.com/press-center/the-stars-group-news/the-stars-group-and-fox-sports-announce-historic-u-s-media-and-sports-wagering-partnership)). However, they have not been able to develop the same seamless approach that theScore has attained internally.\n\ntheScore, like all other sports betting companies is currently sitting at a negative EBITDA. They reported a loss of (17.5 M) in the last quarter. This is because we are still in the early days of a high-growth industry. Companies have to get passed all of the free promotions and incentives that are offered, Market entry costs, etc and then they have to retain their users to start seeing profits. They reported a handle of 81,6 million, a 491% YoY increase, with Net gaming revenue being ($2.4M) and a media revenue of $8.0 M, a 17% increase.\n\ntheScore is not the loudest nor the flashiest betting operator. You won\u2019t see Score ads like you do with some other companies because they\u2019re targeting their existing userbase in a way that is financially responsible. They aren't aiming to do flashy deals. They won\u2019t win by trying to outspend the big guys, but they already know this, as it\u2019s a situation that they've already been through. Instead they're growing their numbers organically with their customer focus.\n\n**So, what\u2019s this huge catalyst that I spoke of?**\n\nThe Legalization of Mobile Sports Betting in Canada, where theScore Media app is a household name will [likely take place](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/here-are-the-liberal-bills-likely-to-pass-this-spring-and-others-that-could-be-doomed-by-an-election) within the next 3 weeks or earlier.\n\nLast week, bill C-218 passed its 2nd reading in the Senate, this is often where the biggest risk lies.\n\nTomorrow, it will be studied by a Standing Committee. After passing that stage it will then move to 3rd reading before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is supported by provincial bodies, [by every major sports league](https://www.gamblingnews.com/news/cga-major-sports-leagues-support-the-push-for-single-event-wagering/), and even sports broadcast companies as their viewership numbers continue to decline. It just so happens that the [Deputy Chair of the reviewing committee](https://sencanada.ca/en/senators/smith-larry-w/) also served as [Commissioner of the Canadian Football League (CFL)](https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/video/cfl-hopes-for-the-pass-of-bill-c-218-in-order-to-boost-future-revenue~2205144).\n\nThe opportunity presented by this bill passing is forecasted to be US$4 to US$5+ billion at maturity. TheScore is actively preparing for this opportunity and extremely well-positioned to benefit long-term as Canada\u2019s leading mobile sports media brand.\n\n10% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 400 Million15% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 625 Million20% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 850 Million\n\nThe current market cap is valued at $US 843.647M which indicates that this legalization is not currently priced in, as it wouldn't take into consideration everything else that theScore has built. The stock\u2019s technicals have bottomed out and we can finally see that the trend is reversing. All of this, combined with SCR\u2019s low float will mean an explosive next few weeks.\n\n**Bonus info about eSports:**\n\n\\- Gen Z is half as likely as millennials to watch live sports and 2x more likely to never watch\n\n\\- 35% of Gen Z identify as eSports fans, a higher percentage than NASCAR, MLB and NHL\n\n\\- There\u2019s a potential for \\~6 million new bettors with an outsized affinity for eSports over the next five years\n\n\\- 495 million people watched eSports online or on television in 2020, worldwide and viewers are projected to grow to 646 million by 2023.\n\neSports betting will be one of the biggest categories of sports betting over the long term, if not the biggest. theScore eSports has the #1 esports media following with 186.5 million reported video views in their most recent quarter, which represents a 139% YoY growth and an average social media reach of 88 million a month. Guess who\u2019s actively seeking and preparing opportunities to enter this space?\n\n**TLDR:** PEOPLE LIKE GAMBLING ON SPORTS AND ESPORTS. SCR, the #1 Canadian Sports Media app entered Sports Betting and is seeing encouraging results. They\u2019re also the leading eSports media brand and are actively seeking to enter esports betting which will eventually become one of the biggest betting categories.\n\nLegalization of Canadian Sports betting is expected in the next weeks + US Sports betting expansion means that this company is extremely undervalued for its future potential in a $US 22 Billion industry. \ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "***This does not constitute stock advice.*** *I have done my best to do my research, but I am not a professional investor and will not take responsibility for losses.*\n\nHi. This is my first DD, feedback welcomed, but I've tried to take what I've learned from other DDs. \n\nI've tried writing other DDs, but I can never finish because it always feels like I'm trying to sell a loser, and not really contributing to the sub. This time it felt different, and I don't feel like a greedy scrub expecting everyone to be schmucks. Ultimately, please do your own research. ***Do not take my word for it, you are responsible for your own gains and losses after all.*** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What does Acelarin do?**\n\nIn a nutshell, it's a more effective cancer treatment. It\u2019s based off current chemotherapy treatments, but it has an easier time delivering the anti cancer metabolites. This leads to higher concentrations of it in Tumor cells. I'm not a scientist, so you will need to go to their website to better understand this. Nucana.com\n\n**Notes about Acelarin:**\n\nIt's in a Phase III trial. \n\nIn its Phase I trial it achieved a whopping 217x higher intracellular level of dFdCTP(the anti cancer metabolite) than gemcitabine(the current standard).\n\nIt also stayed in the cells significantly longer. They report 139x greater intracellular AUC of dFdCTP. \n\n**The CEO:**\n\nHugh Griffith (Founder, CEO &amp; Board Member): \n\n28 years in biopharmaceuticals. Chief operating officer of a company bought by Genzyme, now Sanofi. Graduated honours. Inventor of 80 patents, 135 patents pending. Plus held senior positions at AbbVie and Pfizer.\n\n**Other drugs in pipeline:**\n\nI wont go to far into these as these are just icing for longer term potential. You're realistically investing in Acelerin at the moment. \n\nNUC-3373: In Phase 1. Cancer treatment intended to replace 5-FU\n\nNUC-7738 In Phase 1. Another cancer treament in pipeline.\n\nBoth have had results worth looking deeper into. But as I said, I'm currently investing in the potential of Acelerin.\n\n**PRICE:**\n\nAt a 5 year low. $2.93 is it's low point, it is currently 3.06 as I type this.\n\n**Analysts:**\n\n57% Strong Buy\n\n43% Buy\n\nHigh: $22.05, Average: 16.03, Low, 8.02\n\n**Institutions:**\n\nOn the high side. 78.75% ownership, increased 4.60%\n\n**Why is it so low?**\n\nThere was a big share dilution in sept 2020 is my best guess. \n\nCash: 78.6m with a net income of around -35 mil last year.\n\n**Bull Argument:**\n\nIn Phase 3 of a potential game changer for chemotherapy. Had good results in Phase 2.\n\nExcellent, proven leadership.\n\nOther drugs in pipeline are in the same wheelhouse as their current flagship drug Acelerin, so if Acelerin becomes a winner, you may have 2 more winners on your hands.\n\nCost is way down. Perhaps a 5 year low.\n\nHigh institutional ownership.\n\nHigh analyist ratings.\n\nI think that further dilution(if it happens) will easily be offset by general gains, because of the significant improvement it promises over current treatments.\n\nHuge market. 150 billion spent on cancer a year.\n\nVery little short interest.\n\nNot a meme stock, yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bear Argument:**\n\nDiluted shares by around 50% recently.\n\nNo revenue yet\n\nMax 2 years of cash. May need to do share dilutions again.\n\nCancer treatment is a common market for bio companies. Lot of competition.\n\nIf Acelerin fails, the company will be in a really bad spot, with low cash on hand and no solid prospects.",

        "selftext": " We all like tendies, so from one ape to another, hear me out on this one as we are on the brink of this company's BIGGEST catalyst.   \n\n\n**Some context on the company and it\u2019s industries (Sports Media/Sports Betting):**\n\nTheScore mobile is the number 1 most used sports app in Canada with 10 times more users than ESPN. It\u2019s one of the most used sports mobile apps in all of North America citing almost 4 BILLION user sessions over the last year. They have industry leading rates of user engagement at an average of 130 minutes per visitor with each user opening the app an average of 125 times a month.\n\nThis engagement is due to the many features in the app including: real-time sports news, live scores, in-game highlights, a social ecosystem where fans can chat and discuss live games, add friends, send private messages, etc. They have original media content, in-game odds, sports betting content and even personalized promos for bettors based on their in-app media interests. They\u2019ve reported close to 4 million unique users per month.\n\nTheScore achieved this success despite being a small company against industry titans. They\u2019re no stranger to being an underdog which now follows them in the mobile sports betting industry. PASPA was repealed in 2018 allowing individual states to offer legalized, regulated sports betting. The North American opportunity for this industry is estimated to represent a $US 22 billion opportunity by 2025.\n\ntheScore made the decision in 2019 to enter the market as an operator in [NJ through a partnership with Darby Development](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/09/introducing-thescore-bet-thescores-mobile-sportsbook-launches-in-new-jersey/) with their Score Bet app. They have since expanded operations to a total of 4 betting states (NJ, CO, IN, IO) and have acquired market access agreements across 14 states via a [partnership with Penn National](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/07/thescore-and-penn-national-gaming-enter-into-strategic-multi-state-market-access-partnership/) and other market access deals ([CZR deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210329005427/en/theScore-Secures-Market-Access-for-Mobile-Sports-Betting-in-Illinois-Through-Agreement-with-Caesars-Entertainment)) which represent more than 30% of the U.S. population and a $US 8.2 billion opportunity for them. The CEO and founder, John Levy, has stated that by next year they will be operating in at least double the amount of states and that they\u2019ll be active in 35 States within 3 to 5 years.\n\nTheScore recently rebuilt their media app completely in-house to increase its performance, stability, and scalability, likely related to continued user growth and future betting integrations. They\u2019ve built their \u201cFuse\u201d and \u201cBet Section\u201d as a fully integrated approach to link their gaming and media apps. Users of both apps can now build their bet slip while benefiting from all of theScore\u2019s features. When they\u2019re ready to finalize their bet, they\u2019ll be taken to the [Score Bet app](https://www.thescore.bet/) to place their bet or cash out. This is a defining feature that their highly engaged userbase will remember and one that will lead to higher rates of retention vs competitors that treat the bet as just a transaction. This approach not only increases retention rates but also greatly reduces their customer acquisition costs in an industry that is renowned for not having brand loyalty.\n\nThe New Jersey handle (Percentage of the total amount of bets taken in the State) rose 195% versus the prior year, validating that their unique combination of media and betting remains a powerful differentiating factor against competitors in their oldest operating State. Total gaming handle also grew 46% overall compared to the previous quarter. They are the only media company to be operating their own book and they\u2019ve been seeing these early signs of success. Other companies have started to take notice as they\u2019ve been buying or partnering with media companies via expensive deals (ex: [DKNG 1](https://www.sportico.com/business/sports-betting/2021/draftkings-buys-vsin-1234625970/), [DKNG 2](https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/09/draftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&amp;wpaffn=Google&amp;wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F&amp;wpcn=about&amp;wpscn=news%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F), [PENN](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/29/21113130/barstool-sports-penn-national-deal-dave-portnoy-chernin), [FOX](https://www.starsgroup.com/press-center/the-stars-group-news/the-stars-group-and-fox-sports-announce-historic-u-s-media-and-sports-wagering-partnership)). However, they have not been able to develop the same seamless approach that theScore has attained internally.\n\ntheScore is not the loudest nor the flashiest betting operator. You won\u2019t see Score ads like you do with some other companies because they\u2019re targeting their existing userbase in a way that is financially responsible. They aren't aiming to do flashy deals. They won\u2019t win by trying to outspend the big guys, but they already know this, as it\u2019s a situation that they've already been through. Instead they're growing their numbers organically with their customer focus.\n\n**So, what\u2019s this huge catalyst that I spoke of?**\n\nThe Legalization of Mobile Sports Betting in Canada, where theScore Media app is a household name will [likely take place](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/here-are-the-liberal-bills-likely-to-pass-this-spring-and-others-that-could-be-doomed-by-an-election) within the next 3 weeks or earlier.\n\nLast week, bill C-218 passed its 2nd reading in the Senate, this is often where the biggest risk lies.\n\nTomorrow, it will be studied by a Standing Committee.

TheScore is actively preparing for this opportunity and extremely well-positioned to benefit long-term as Canada\u2019s leading mobile sports media brand.\n\n10% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 400 Million15% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 625 Million20% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 850 Million\n\nThe current market cap is valued at $US 843.647M which indicates that this legalization is not currently priced in, as it wouldn't take into consideration everything else that theScore has built.

SCR, the #1 Canadian Sports Media app entered Sports Betting and is seeing encouraging results. They\u2019re also the leading eSports media brand and are actively seeking to enter esports betting which will eventually become one of the biggest betting categories. Legalization of Canadian Sports betting in the next weeks + US Sports betting expansion means that this company is extremely undervalued for its future potential in a $US 22 Billion industry. \ud83d\ude80",

Share-price declines and a ticking clock to take companies public are ratcheting up the pressure.\n\nThe new challenges for creators of special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, result in part from the abundance of the deals that raised money early in 2021. Looming over these firms is a two-year deadline to do a deal or hand back cash to investors. \n\nNow that shares of many SPAC-related companies have fallen, fewer startups are interested in going public through a SPAC. That mismatch is intensifying competition between some blank-check firms for the same private firms, known by some on Wall Street as a \u201cSPAC-off.\u201d\n\nSPACs are shell companies that raise money and list on an exchange with the sole intent of merging with a private firm to take it public. The private company, often a startup, then gets the SPAC\u2019s place in the stock market. Blank-check mergers let companies going public make future business projections\u2014which aren\u2019t allowed in regular IPOs\u2014one reason they took Wall Street by storm this winter and have raised a record $105 billion this year, according to SPAC Research. \n\nBut with SPAC shares in retreat, many blank-check firms now trade below their debut price. Many companies in recent months have said that several different SPACs have asked them about mergers, a trend that contributed to the frenzy in the sector.\n\nThe pressure to execute deals at realistic valuations could get even more intense in the months ahead because nearly 260 blank-check companies with about $87 billion on hand face merger deadlines in the first three months of 2023, according to a Methuselah Advisors analysis of SPAC Research figures. \n\nWhile such deadlines can be extended, they can pressure SPAC teams that often need several months to finish deals and now face turbulent market conditions.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere is an awful lot of capital sitting there that has to find a home,\u201d said John Chachas, co-managing principal at Methuselah, a boutique investment bank. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a fair number of less-than-desirable deals done just because they have to get done.\u201d\n\nPrivate companies open to SPAC mergers should focus on their business, then begin exploring blank-check options next year, Mr. Chachas said. By then, many SPAC teams could be desperate to finish deals before their deadlines and make generous offers.\u00a0\n\nWith investors retreating in recent weeks from early-stage investments, shares of many companies tied to SPACs\u2014including those taking genetic-testing firm 23andMe Inc., electric-vehicle battery maker Microvast Inc. and flying-taxi startup Joby Aviation public\u2014have fallen about 30% or more since mid-February.  \n\nSigns that regulators are taking a stricter stance on the once-hot sector also have pressured the stocks. Regulatory questions have slowed the timeline for finishing mergers and cut new issuance of blank-check companies to a fraction of the record levels from earlier this year. Just two of the 23 SPACs that announced deals in May are trading above their initial public offering price, figures from data provider SPAC Research show.  \n\nIf no deal is done by the final date\u2014after any extensions\u2014the SPAC creators have to return money to investors and lose what they put in up front to create the shell companies, typically several million dollars for underwriting fees and other expenses. In that scenario, they also don\u2019t get the deeply discounted shares that let them make several times their initial investment, on average.\n\nThose incentives explain why many blank-check mergers will still get done in the months ahead\u2014even if they are completed at lower valuations or the SPAC teams have to give away some of the discounted shares to complete the deals. \n\nBecause of the market reversal, some analysts now expect private companies and investors in SPAC mergers to have more leverage when negotiating deal terms with blank-check firms. The shift shows how many on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley are grappling with the unprecedented market environment created by SPACs, which were a rarely used alternative to traditional initial public offerings before late 2020 and are now evolving quickly. \n\n\u201cPeople are getting a lot more choosy,\u201d said Kristi Marvin, founder of data and research provider SPACInsider.\n\nMany investors say smaller SPACs will likely face the most pressure, while the most well known backers such as venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya continue to churn out deals.\n\nBecause investors can typically withdraw at that low IPO price per share, plus a tiny bit of interest, before SPAC mergers are completed, low share prices mean many are likely to do so to eliminate the possibility of taking a loss. That can leave the SPAC with much less money, potentially forcing executives to find other sources of cash or renegotiate some terms of the deal.\n\n\u201cThey are going to have to be more careful with what the valuation is and what they are agreeing to,\u201d said Patrick Galley, a SPAC investor and CEO of RiverNorth Capital Management.\n\nInvestors who put money into SPAC mergers through a fundraising round called a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, could particularly benefit. Large PIPE investors include funds managed by asset management giants BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments Inc. Their money is critical to deals and is added to the cash held by the blank-check company to complete a merger several times as large as the SPAC itself. \n\nIn one sign that PIPE investors could now get better terms, mobile entertainment firm Jam City recently said PIPE investors bought into the company at $8.42 a share in its roughly $1.2 billion SPAC merger, including debt. That is a discounted price unavailable to other investors. \n\nStill, some analysts say momentum in the market could quickly change once again, particularly if some strong deals draw investors back into the space.  \n\n\u201cThree months from now, the market could look very different,\u201d Ms. Marvin said. \u201cIt could be game on again.\u201d",

No it would not be wiser to wait for everything to settle before buying more theaters. If they did that. Others wood then recognize the opportunity as well. Which would potentially result in others purchasing the theater chains. Or it would result in a bidding war over the purchase of that chain. Thus increasing the price to be paid.

        "selftext": " Recent IPO for Alfi (ALF) Providing AI Assisted Brand Building and a Marketing SaaS Platform for the Internet and Out of Home Applications  \n   \n**The technology to help brands grow will always be in-demand. This tiny float, newly NASDAQ listed stock could be our next runner.**  \n   \nGood day everyone,  \n   \nWe are initiating coverage of\u00a0**Alfi, Inc.

The IPO consisted of 3,731,344 common shares and warrants. The common shares were sold at $4.15 each and the warrants are exercisable at $4.57 each for up to five years.  \n   \nALF shares are trading at a 49% discount from the IPO price. While it\u2019s not unusual for IPO shares to contract after the event, there usually comes an inflection point where the shares begin to gain. We believe ALF shares have reached that point and with a tiny float, these shares could move quickly.  \n   \n**The scope of the AI driven Alfi SaaS product is awe inspiring and may have you saying, \u201cwhat the heck? I didn\u2019t even know that was possible.\u201d**  \n   \nAlfi is developing an AI enterprise SaaS platform powering computer vision with machine learning models, and deep learning to deliver the right content, to the right person at the right time. When a consumer interacts with an ALFI Tablet, Kiosk, or internet content, the software begins a sophisticated AI assisted data capture. The digital device then displays content/advertising relevant to its analysis of the viewer.  \n   \nThe company has provided a\u00a0[brief overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7XTQqUEN2U)\u00a0of the firm's SaaS platform. This video may be a critical part of your due diligence.  \n   \nDigital advertising isn\u2019t new, but Digital out of Home (DOOH) advertising, utilizing AI to generate and report data from consumer interactions is still in its infancy. This niche in advertising is where ALF lives right now.  \n   \nThe market for tracking and reporting on DOOH advertising activity is expected to grow at a double-digit CAGR through 2023. Imagine getting into a taxi or a ride share vehicle and there\u2019s an interactive pad on the back of the headrest or going to a mall and interacting with kiosk. This kind of technology will become ubiquitous in the near term, and ALF is one of the leaders and innovators in the sector.  \n   \n**The overall market for digital advertising is $614 billion.**  \n   \nAlf is already reporting positive results in more than 12 separate pilot programs deploying over 1,000 devices and expects to start generating revenues in Q2 and be profitable by Q421. The company plans to have tablets installed in 100,000 ride share vehicles within 4-5 years.  \n   \nThese are the applications ALF wants to deploy both to brands and to businesses to generate revenues:  \n   \nAirports and Malls \u2013 Kiosks  \nTaxis and Rideshares \u2013 Tablets  \nEnterprise Software \u2013 SaaS  \nData Analytics \u2013 Subscriptions  \n   \nAlfi plans to woo ride share drivers and taxis and others with participation in the revenues generated by placing a tablet in their vehicles or locations.  \n   \nUnderstanding the sophistication of the Alfi software may best be understood by their disclaimer statements:  \n   \nALF is compliant with all GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA standards. Alfi\u2019s proprietary Ai algorithm understands small facial cues and perceptual details. The automation works in a way that respects user privacy; without tracking, storing cookies, or using identifiable personal information. The company states it will not store facial images.  \n   \nWe look at ALF as a rare opportunity to get involved in a new IPO with the technology of the future, a future that is starting right now. There may be the potential for a triple digit increase in value here.  \n   \nStay tuned for our full report on ALF.  \n[Disclaimer](https://mailchi.mp/tradersnewssource/recent-ipo-providing-ai-assisted-brand-building?e=[UNIQID])\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Catch me if you can!](https://preview.redd.it/6agncoisqn271.jpg?width=203&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40ecbc53ac8b28d3596f164085001d6c2fd877cd)",

        "selftext": " \n\n80% in own of retail investors Currently,\n\nall real stocks (not naked shorts) are counted, and on June 2nd you will know how many naked shorts are in roughly real terms.\n\nRumor has it in the US that it should be between 1 and 2 billion pieces, which would be an empty catastrophe for the hedge funds. If the retail traders keep buying and do not let themselves be unsettled by the massive \"negative\" interference from media such as CNBC, Motley Fool, Fox News as well as moderators such as Jim Cramer or hedge fund manager Rich Greenfield and hold their shares (HODL) , it is possible that the share, as in the VW Shortqueeze 2008 ($ 1,000 per share), will also skyrocket. This is because the hedgies have to cover their short positions.\n\n!!The longer the retail traders hold their shares instead of selling them during the squeeze, the higher the price can rise. At Reddit, where the \"Apes\" exchange ideas, the mood was such that a few months ago they spoke of a possible floor of $ 1,000.!! ((this floor is rly possibre? xD))\n\nDue to the many phenomenal reports from brilliant analysts in the forum, there is now talk of a floor of 10,000 or even 100,000 dollars per share.\n\nThis all sounds completely crazy, but it is not impossible if the investors do not sell too early during a short squeeze. This is exactly what the Hedgies in the USA are terrified of. For a few weeks now, bots have been flooding in, which are intended to unsettle investors and encourage them to sell - via Reddit, Twitter and Youtube.\n\nHardly ever seen on this scale. The trouble is that this doesn't work because the community sticks together so well that the numerous \"ladder attacks\" have no consequences. Now the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) comes into play with its new chairman, Gary Gensler, who had closely observed the game stop process and is now introducing the first changes to the rules of the game for the hedgies, which are supposed to make shorting a lot more difficult . At the recent conference hearing, Gensler mentioned that he wanted to create more fairness and transparency for small investors.\n\nThis is roughly the opposite of what the hedge funds want.\n\nCopied from [https://insideparadeplatz.ch/](https://insideparadeplatz.ch/)",

        "selftext": "Hello there like minded village folk. ;)\n\nI've been looking into the EV market and everyone always says you late to the party or missed the train when buying EV shares (Missing the boat with TESLA etc). Its like the California gold rush in the old times! People rushed out to make money and find gold but the real entrepreneurs made money selling them their shovels, buckets, food and clothes. Electric Vehicles need charging bays, its a  no brainier?!? SO how on gods green earth can BLNK Shares be heavily shorted to 30% and \"Experts\" say this sector should see nothing but growth! \n\nI've done some very basic DD on BLNK. I've always been quite optimistic in this space for electric vehicles and for those that dont know BLNK provides charging solutions for Electric Vehicles. As of December 2020 they had 16, 617 charging stations around the USA but they are one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the NYSE. Over 30% short interest. I would hate to know what the outstanding naked short value is. \n\nNow when you look at expected Electric vehicle sales forecasts below:\n\n*\"The US electric vehicles market is expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020\"*\n\n[https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan)\n\nDeloitte even say this sector will continue to boom for the next 10 years.  \"Our global *EV forecast* is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years\"\n\n[https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html)\n\nAND EVEN FORBES SAYS IT!!! I know Forbes hasn't always been on our apes side for the GME battle and AMC war but they seem to contradicting what is currently going on in EV charging! \n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2021/03/09/electric-cars-are-coming-and-if-you-dont-like-it-tough/?sh=6f8be1c5698f](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2021/03/09/electric-cars-are-coming-and-if-you-dont-like-it-tough/?sh=6f8be1c5698f) \n\n*\u201cWith the prospect of sticker price parity even without subsidies by  2025, we take a strong positive view on EV penetration. We raise our  global EV sales forecasts again, this time mainly driven by higher  estimates for the U.S. market. We expect the Biden administration to  increase direct support for EV purchases,\u201d the UBS report said.*\n\n*The Biden plan for 500,000 charging stations would more than double  the current count, while it could impose tougher fuel economy standards  to curb ICE car sales. The ban on ICE sales by governments like  Britain\u2019s will also give a powerful signal to buyers to embrace  electric. .\"*\n\n They also out shot analyst expectations for revenue for the previous quarter see below.\n\n## Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) Earnings Information\n\nBlink  Charging last announced its quarterly earnings data on May 12th, 2021.  The reported ($0.18) EPS for the quarter, missing analysts' consensus  estimates of ($0.17) by $0.01. **The company had revenue of $2.23 million  for the quarter, compared to analysts' expectations of $1.71 million.**  Blink Charging has generated ($0.59) earnings per share over the last  year. Blink Charging has not formally confirmed its next earnings  publication date, but the company's estimated earnings date is Thursday,  August 12th, 2021 based off prior year's report dates.\n\nSo in ending for now I cant help but wonder what the hell is going on in the EV charging scene. With all this talk about the future Being EV, Biden backing the electric F150 and international markets across the scene being so bullish. How can one stock like BLNK be so heavily shorted. I would love to know how many Naked shorts have been placed against a company like this. \n\nI'm No financial advisor nor am I calling for people to load up on BLNK to squeeze the hell out of these hedge funds and their short positions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust want to see if anyone else can give better insight than me on why this stock is so heavily shorted.",

I am particularly excited that we can achieve this result even before we include the carbon offset potential from our waste rock and tailings which we expect to allow us to produce NetZero NickelTM, NetZero CobaltTM, and NetZero IronTM. These results reflect the mine's low strip ratio and our ability to utilize the low carbon hydroelectricity in the region and by using trolley trucks and electric shovels to reduce the consumption of diesel fuel.\"*\n\n**Short-term Catalysts**\n\n* Drilling on the Crawford extensions as assay backlogs finally begin to clear;\n* First results from exploration targets at MacDiarmid (geophysical target bigger than the original Crawford discovery);\n* The Company's wholly-owned subsidiary NetZero Metals Inc. will begin negotiations with potential partners immediately following the release of the PEA;\n* Discussions with various supply chain participants in the EV supply chain are expected to accelerate now with the completion of the PEA.\n\n**Long-term catalysts**\n\n* Feasibility Study by mid-year 2022\n\n*Disclaimer: I've been long Canada Nickel Company since March, 2019 with no intension of selling short-term.

        "selftext": "Hello community,  \n\n\nEnlivex Therapeutics (ENLV) is a Israeli pharmaceutical company that is targeting the Sepsis market (33B of untapped potential). They have been developing the drug since 2019 and it turned that the pandemic was the perfect storm for them. Because COVID-19, governments were willing to give emergency approval to drugs that were able to help COVID patients. Well, Enlivex's drug Allocetra, which delivers immune rebalancing therapy, turns out to also aid critical patients that have COVID-19. The company has received patients from three of the biggest Sepsis markets (US,Japan, and today Canada) while simultaneously (and silently) partnering with Brazil, India, and the UK for Enlivex clinical trials. Their past trials got amazing grades and I believe that this is the beginning of a long and amazing rollercoaster ride.  \n[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/enlv](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/enlv)  \n\n\nYour Welcome Boys.  \nNOW FEAST!",

        "selftext": "Pembina Pipeline Corp. has struck a  friendly deal to acquire Inter Pipeline Ltd. for $8.3 billion in an  all-share deal after the midstream company was put in play earlier this  year.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, shareholders of Inter Pipeline will  receive half a share of Pembina for each share held, valuing the deal at  $19.45 per share based on the most recent closing price. That trumps  the unsolicited $16.50 offer from Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP  that Inter Pipeline rebuffed earlier this year. According to the release  issued Tuesday, Pembina\u2019s executive team will lead the combined entity,  while Inter Pipeline will have representation on the board of  directors.\n\nInter Pipeline Chair Margaret McKenzie said the deal with Pembina  represented the best value for shareholders after the company launched a  strategic review in February.\n\n\u201cIt was evident that a combination with Pembina offered compelling  value for Inter Pipeline shareholders in the short-term, as well as the  opportunity to participate in the upside of \\[the Heartland Petrochemical  Complex\\] and the combined business longer-term,\u201d she said in the  release.\n\n\u201cThe creation of a more highly integrated business across the energy  infrastructure value chain results in a combined entity that is greater  than the sum of its parts.\u201d\n\nThat Heartland Petrochemical Complex has been key to Inter Pipeline\u2019s  path forward, with the project outside Edmonton slated to produce  525,000 tonnes of polypropylene per year upon completion. However, it  has been dogged by contruction delays and cost overruns, and is now  expected to commence production in early 2022.\n\nThe two companies said their friendly transaction is expected to  close in the fourth quarter of this year, pending all necessary  approvals.\n\n[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/pembina-strikes-8-3b-all-stock-deal-for-inter-pipeline-1.1611131](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/pembina-strikes-8-3b-all-stock-deal-for-inter-pipeline-1.1611131)",

        "selftext": "Analysis on AMC:\n\nI will probably get downvoted for this, however I still feel the need to write this as most people here dont understand what is really going on with AMC and most of the DD that I have seen are basically just hype train or regurgitated information they got from a youtube or a reddit post, who also got their information this way, creating a cycle of misleading analysis .  \n\n1.  AMC is not a short squeeze but a gamma squeeze.  You can tell easily who has option experience and who is brand new to the scene, just from this statement alone.  A gamma squeeze is triggered when there are so alot of call options being bought, which forces the market makers to hedge by buying shares of amc.  Which then moves the price of the stock up.  However once the stock price reaches a certain price, market makers do not have to hedge by buying the stock as they now have enough shares.  What they normally do at this point is to sell more call optoins using a covered call.  A covered call is when you sell option contracts using the shares you have.  This basically means that market makers are not losing money, but in fact making bank.  A covered call is basically a hack, where you short delta, but you come out ahead financially, unless the stock price moves below where you bought it from, minus the premiums you collected.  The other critical point regarding market makers and gamma squeezes, is that once the Iv spikes, they can sell very very far otm call options and DO NOT HAVE TO HEDGE.  As those OTM (out of the money) options becoming ITM (in the money) are basically mathmaticlaly so low, market makers will not hedge those $60 strike call options.  No matter how many you buy.\n2. Wall street is not losing money on AMC as many of you seem to think.  Some of the hedge funds who shorted early will temporarilly lose money on UNREALISED GAINS.  This is not the same thing as taking actual losses.  There is a huge difference between the two.\n3. Most of the shorts came in at much higher strike prices (most shorted from $18-$20 back in march).  The same as most of you probably came in at the higher stock price and not the $2 it was trading at.  The new shorts are also shorting from a higher level due to the run up and the old shorts can cost average thier short position. Cost average is when you buy a stock at either a higher or lower price to average down your cost.\n4. AMC is different then GME.  AMC has a much bigger float and the chance of a short squeeze is much lower compared to GME. GME you could logically make a case for it due to the smaller float size and also new leadership turning GME into a winner.\n5. The media reports what will get it clicks and views.  The same as youtube.  Which is why they are running with headlines such as \"AMC short sellers dealt massive 1.2 billion dollar losses\".  Most youtubers, including the stock market channels do not have much experience or knowledge.  There are some very legit ones, but most of the channels are trash.  The blind leading the blind.\n6. On a fundamentals perspective AMC is not worth more then $2-$5 dollars, even with the re-opening.  AMC was managed poorly and in bad financial shape PRE PANDEMIC.  Now those financial are even worse as they are still liable for the debt from leases.  Which also brings me to another point.  AMC does not own most of thier locations.  Which means they dont even have any assets of value besides the brand \"AMC\".\n7. The value of AMC will be tied to what another buyer is willing to pay for AMC.  As long as the hype train is there, you can find a buyer, but the last guys holding the bag will be looking at a long career behind wendy's giving blowjobs and not as a side hustle to invest more into amc. If you are new, this is known as a pump and dump.  This is not something new to the stock market.  It has been going on for decades.  Normally this is done on low float stocks such as penny stocks. \n\nThis is a long read, but I hope you got the hard truth about AMC.  Im not saying dont invest in amc, all im saying is know the truth before making any plays.  BTW for full disclosure.  I do make plays on AMC and other meme stocks on the call side. So I've definitley made money playing amc and other meme stocks but I also locked in my gains and only make plays when its breaking resistance or have big buy volume comming in for a momentum play.",

        "selftext": " We all like tendies, so from one ape to another, hear me out on this one. On the brink of this company\u2019s BIGGEST catalyst, you have a unique opportunity to invest in SCR while it\u2019s at a 38% discount from its IPO price and a 46% discount from it\u2019s 52-week high on the NASDAQ. All of which will be a small fraction of what this stock can be worth in the future.\n\n**But first, here\u2019s some context on the company and it\u2019s industries (Sports Media/Sports Betting):**\n\nTheScore mobile is the number 1 most used sports app in Canada with 10 times more users than ESPN. It\u2019s one of the most used sports mobile apps in all of North America citing almost 4 BILLION user sessions over the last year. They have industry leading rates of user engagement at an average of 130 minutes per visitor with each user opening the app an average of 125 times a month.   \n \n\nThis engagement is due to the many features in the app including: real-time sports news, live scores, in-game highlights, a social ecosystem where fans can chat and discuss live games, add friends, send private messages, etc. They have original media content, in-game odds, sports betting content and even personalized promos for bettors based on their in-app media interests. They\u2019ve reported close to 4 million unique users per month. \n\nTheScore achieved this success despite being a small company against industry titans. They\u2019re no stranger to being an underdog which now follows them in the mobile sports betting industry. PASPA was repealed in 2018 allowing individual states to offer legalized, regulated sports betting. The North American opportunity for this industry is estimated to represent a $US 22 billion opportunity by 2025.\n\ntheScore made the decision in 2019 to enter the market as an operator in [NJ through a partnership with Darby Development](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/09/introducing-thescore-bet-thescores-mobile-sportsbook-launches-in-new-jersey/) with their Score Bet app. They have since expanded operations to a total of 4 betting states (NJ, CO, IN, IO) and have acquired market access agreements across 14 states via a [partnership with Penn National](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/07/thescore-and-penn-national-gaming-enter-into-strategic-multi-state-market-access-partnership/) and other market access deals ([CZR deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210329005427/en/theScore-Secures-Market-Access-for-Mobile-Sports-Betting-in-Illinois-Through-Agreement-with-Caesars-Entertainment)) which represent more than 30% of the U.S. population and a $US 8.2 billion opportunity for them. The CEO and founder, John Levy, has stated that by next year they will be operating in at least double the amount of states and that they\u2019ll be active in 35 States within 3 to 5 years.\n\nTheScore recently rebuilt their media app completely in-house to increase its performance, stability, and scalability, likely related to continued user growth and future betting integrations. They\u2019ve built their \u201cFuse\u201d and \u201cBet Section\u201d as a fully integrated approach to link their gaming and media apps. Users of both apps can now build their bet slip while benefiting from all of theScore\u2019s features. When they\u2019re ready to finalize their bet, they\u2019ll be taken to the [Score Bet app](https://www.thescore.bet/) to place their bet or cash out. This is a defining feature that their highly engaged userbase will remember and one that will lead to higher rates of retention vs competitors that treat the bet as just a transaction. This approach greatly reduces their customer acquisition costs, while increasing bettor retention rates in an industry that is renowned for not having user loyalty. \n\nThe New Jersey handle (Percentage of the total amount of bets taken in the State) rose 195% versus the prior year, validating that their unique combination of media and betting remains a powerful differentiating factor against competitors in their oldest operating State. Total gaming handle also grew 46% overall compared to the previous quarter. They are the only media company to be operating their own book and they\u2019ve been seeing these early signs of success. Other companies have started to take notice as they\u2019ve been buying or partnering with media companies via expensive deals (ex: [DKNG 1](https://www.sportico.com/business/sports-betting/2021/draftkings-buys-vsin-1234625970/), [DKNG 2](https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/09/draftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&amp;wpaffn=Google&amp;wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F&amp;wpcn=about&amp;wpscn=news%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F), [PENN](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/29/21113130/barstool-sports-penn-national-deal-dave-portnoy-chernin), [FOX](https://www.starsgroup.com/press-center/the-stars-group-news/the-stars-group-and-fox-sports-announce-historic-u-s-media-and-sports-wagering-partnership)). However, they have not been able to develop the same seamless approach that theScore has attained internally.\n\ntheScore is not the loudest nor the flashiest betting operator. You won\u2019t see Score ads like you do with some other companies because they\u2019re targeting their existing userbase in a way that is financially responsible. They aren't aiming to do flashy deals. They won\u2019t win by trying to outspend the big guys, but they already know this, as it\u2019s a situation that they've already been through. Instead they're growing their numbers organically with their customer focus.\n\n**So, what\u2019s this huge catalyst that I spoke of?** \n\nThe Legalization of Mobile Sports Betting in Canada, where theScore Media app is a household name will [likely take place](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/here-are-the-liberal-bills-likely-to-pass-this-spring-and-others-that-could-be-doomed-by-an-election) within the next 3 weeks or earlier. \n\nLast week, bill C-218 passed its 2nd reading in the Senate, this is often where the biggest risk lies.   \n\n\nTomorrow, it will be studied by a Standing Committee. After passing that stage it will then move to 3rd reading before becoming law.  \n \n\nThe bill is supported by provincial bodies, [by every major sports league](https://www.gamblingnews.com/news/cga-major-sports-leagues-support-the-push-for-single-event-wagering/), and even sports broadcast companies as their viewership numbers continue to decline. It just so happens that the [Deputy Chair of the reviewing committee](https://sencanada.ca/en/senators/smith-larry-w/) also served as [Commissioner of the Canadian Football League (CFL)](https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/video/cfl-hopes-for-the-pass-of-bill-c-218-in-order-to-boost-future-revenue~2205144). \n\nThe opportunity presented by this bill passing is forecasted to be US$4 to US$5+ billion at maturity. TheScore is actively preparing for this opportunity and extremely well-positioned to benefit long-term as Canada\u2019s leading mobile sports media brand.   \n \n\n10% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 400 Million  \n 15% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 625 Million  \n 20% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 850 Million\n\nThe current market cap is valued at $US 843.647M which indicates that this legalization is not currently priced in, as it wouldn't take into consideration everything else that theScore has built. The stock\u2019s technicals have bottomed out and we can finally see that the trend is reversing. All of this, combined with SCR\u2019s low float will mean an explosive next few weeks.\n\n**Bonus info about eSports:**\n\n\\- Gen Z is half as likely as millennials to watch live sports and 2x more likely to never watch\n\n\\- 35% of Gen Z identify as eSports fans, a higher percentage than NASCAR, MLB and NHL\n\n\\- There\u2019s a potential for \\~6 million new bettors with an outsized affinity for eSports over the next five years\n\n\\- 495 million people watched eSports online or on television in 2020, worldwide and viewers are projected to grow to 646 million by 2023.  \n \n\neSports betting will be one of the biggest categories of sports betting over the long term, if not the biggest. theScore eSports has the #1 esports media following with 186.5 million reported video views in their most recent quarter, which represents a 139% YoY growth and an average social media reach of 88 million a month. Guess who\u2019s actively seeking and preparing opportunities to enter this space?\n\n**TLDR:** APES LIKE GAMBLING ON SPORTS AND ESPORTS**.** SCR, the #1 Canadian Sports Media app entered Sports Betting and is seeing encouraging results. They\u2019re also the leading eSports media brand and are actively seeking to enter esports betting which will eventually become one of the biggest betting categories. Legalization of Canadian Sports betting in the next weeks + US Sports betting expansion means that this company is extremely undervalued for its future potential in a $US 22 Billion industry. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
