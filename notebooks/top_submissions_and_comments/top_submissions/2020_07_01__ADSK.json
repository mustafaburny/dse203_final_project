The overarching theme behind these picks is **American Innovation &amp; Mexican Development.**\n\nI'm a 26 year old fintech engineer in the US and an avocado farmer in Mexico and I hold a strong conviction that investing in Mexican development will reward me well in the decades to come.\n\n**In a nutshell, the USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring and my strategy favors the Texas-Nuevo Leon economy and overall Mexican-American trade.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is Monterrey, Nuevo Leon\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png))\n\nI'm from a rural village south of Jalisco which produces far more agricultural goods like avocados alongside Michoacan.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am very aware of the problems that Mexico faces but I also view Mexico as a sleeping giant that the US utilizes for capital efficiency in global trade. Mexico is part of a puzzle that fits in a large scope that involves other bulwark nations like Germany, Japan, Brazil, and India.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n!\\[Bulwark Trading Nations\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86080247-51709b00-ba47-11ea-8d38-54da06916f57.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86080247-51709b00-ba47-11ea-8d38-54da06916f57.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n!\\[The North American Trade Block\\]([https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40](https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the same time, Mexico is a nation in crisis. The economic damage narcotrafficking has delivered has resulted in:\n\n\\- \\[An increasing black market integration into the global money supply, in the order of hundreds of billions of dollars, resulting in a growing vacuum of theft AKA the Drug War &amp; Economics of Peace\\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank\\_Secrecy\\_Act#Sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Secrecy_Act#Sanctions))\n\n\\- North American suppressed wage suppression\n\n\\- refugee style illegal immigration\n\n\\- NA workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- Mexican workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- A Mexican workforce and brain drain, as skilled and motivated laborers leave for opportunity and better pay who are loyal to both nations\n\n\\- Multiple events of civil unrest or civil disasters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- National cyncism against the current administration\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see this as a complex problem where most people's perspective is not complete or clouded by one of the reasons above. I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy. It is certainly in a golden era of sorts, and Mexico reflects as a nation in decline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # The Economic Framework\n\nI am selecting industries that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Empower the US and have a rippling effect on Mexico\n\n\\- Will fundamentally continue to build and grow the future global supply\n\n\\- Are friendly to primarily German/Euro and Japanese/Asian trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # My Portfolio Structure \n\nThere are two systems at play at the same time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 12 Primary Asset Collection - these are stocks I regularly invest in.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082755-62bca600-ba4d-11ea-8857-95e902f8d0ce.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082755-62bca600-ba4d-11ea-8857-95e902f8d0ce.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 12 Competitor Arenas (Cloud Infrastructure Group) - these are stocks that are competing for Primary Asset Allocation each quarter and receive less allocation.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082923-c3e47980-ba4d-11ea-9543-b31eb000962d.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082923-c3e47980-ba4d-11ea-9543-b31eb000962d.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I own 12 primary companies.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed.

The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.
