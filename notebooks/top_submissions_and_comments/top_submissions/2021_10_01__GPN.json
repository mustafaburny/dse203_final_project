        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 11th, 2021.\n\n# **Stock market on comeback trail heads into what\u2019s supposed to be another stellar earnings season - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/08/stock-market-on-comeback-trail-heads-into-whats-supposed-to-be-another-stellar-earnings-season-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks proved hard to keep down this week, and the start of the earnings season next week could further bolster the comeback if profits roll in as expected or better.\n*****\n&gt; The major averages notched a winning week after overcoming a debt ceiling debacle in Washington. Lawmakers passed a short-term deal that will extend the debt ceiling until December, kicking that overhang for the market down the road.\n*****\n&gt; This week\u2019s price action also overcame surging oil prices and a disappointing jobs report, with investors buying bank and energy shares.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn the face of Washington drama, delta worries, multiyear highs in crude oil, and a much weaker than expected jobs number, you have to be impressed by how stocks were able to bounce back this week,\u201d LPL Financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick said.\n*****\n&gt; https://i.imgur.com/Zh7JRt2.png\n*****\n&gt; A market pullback that began in September brought the S&amp;P 500 down more than 5% from its record at one point Monday, before stocks mounted a comeback. For the week, the S&amp;P 500 added back 0.8% and sits just 3.4% away from its record.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs stuck by its bullish year-end forecast earlier this week, predicting stocks would start to climb the wall of worries. And they did.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin said in a note to clients that his year-end S&amp;P 500 price target for 2021 is still 4,700, which is nearly 7% above its current level.\n*****\n&gt; The firm said earnings growth, not valuation expansion, was the primary driver of the S&amp;P 500\u2032s 17% return year to date, adding that should still be the case.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings season begins\n&gt; The third-quarter earnings season \u2014 which kicks off next week with big bank earnings \u2014 is expected to be another strong series of reports, despite some worries about supply chain issues and higher costs. Third-quarter earnings are expected to have risen 27.6% year over year, according to FactSet. That would be the third-highest growth rate since 2010.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some record earnings seasons the past few quarters, so all eyes will be on if earnings can help justify stocks near all-time high levels,\u201d Detrick said. \u201cWe do expect another solid earnings season, but we\u2019ve seen some high profile warnings already, so corporate America could have a rather high bar to clear this quarter. Buckle up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bank earnings are the main focus next week with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs set to report.\n*****\n&gt; After a range-bound few months for bank stocks, analysts are looking ahead to catalysts that could fuel the next phase in their recovery. Wall Street expects loan growth, interest rates and reserve releases to play into the major banks\u2019 reports.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEarnings for the third quarter quarter should again be strong and mostly outpace expectations,\u201d Leuthold Group chief investment strategist Jim Paulsen said. \u201cHours worked in the third quarter rose by about 5% suggesting real GDP for the quarter may be close to 7%. With most companies reporting strong pricing power, solid real GDP growth should result in another surprisingly strong corporate earnings season.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen sees earnings season rewarding cyclicals, like banks, and small caps more than technology stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the stock market is already showing signs of a leadership shift away from slow economic growth favorites including growth, tech, and defensive toward more the economically sensitive areas of small caps and cyclical sectors,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; # Supply chain, higher cost warnings?\nWhile the earnings season should be strong, there are likely to be some warning signs about inflation and supply constraints that could scare the market about the year-end set-up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe risks of higher inflation, Fed tapering and what will likely be a choppy earnings season are still with us,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.\n*****\n&gt; There was some foreshadowing of this last week, when Bed Bath and Beyond shares cratered 25% after the company said it saw a steep drop-off in traffic in August. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond saw inflation costs escalating over the summer months, especially toward the end of its second quarter in August, which corroded profits.\n*****\n&gt; What investors know going into the third quarter \u2014 from company guidance \u2014 is that there could be haves and have nots this earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; FactSet data shows that 47 S&amp;P 500 companies have issued negative earnings guidance for the third quarter, and 56 companies have issued positive outlooks.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed headwind ahead?\n&gt; The headline jobs number Friday was a major disappointment, as the economy added just 194,000 jobs in September, well below the the Dow Jones estimate of 500,000. On the positive side, the unemployment rate fell to a much lower point than economists forecast. At 4.8%, that\u2019s the same level seen in late 2016.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s unclear if the number changes the calculus for when and how fast the Federal Reserve will slow its $120 billion-per-month bond-buying program.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn our view these figures are good enough, and when combined with the debt-ceiling can being kicked down the road, likely solidifies November as \u2018go time\u2019 for tapering,\u201d Wells Fargo Securities senior equity analyst Christopher Harvey said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe continue to expect a choppy equity market rally and a two-to-four-week tech bounce, but the bounce probably peters out next month when the Fed says those magical words: We will begin to taper,\u201d he added.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/WuOc7cb.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnJ6ZF2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/CojntqX.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/mxZnyBJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eZbwxOb.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JPCsx2m.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kyfY7Xn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zEMv32q.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uaj9G7t.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VAaeJ4E.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/fgsZNEH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/W5HmLSK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/DDVPGco.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best and Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2021\n\n&gt; The fourth quarter is now off to the races and we thought it worthwhile to check in on the best and worst-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks on a year-to-date basis. As shown below, there are currently six members of the index that have rallied over 100% this year. Apt for the year that its vaccine has rolled out, the biggest gainer of these has been Moderna (MRNA) with a 196.12% rally. It now has a market cap of $124.87 billion versus a market cap of only $41 billion at the start of the year. Of the 20 best performers, MRNA is also the only one with a market cap above $100 billion. The next largest is ConocoPhillips (COP) with a $95.76 billion market cap. COP is one of multiple Energy stocks on this list as well. Of the top 20 performers, Energy sector names dominate the list with 8 members.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-SPX-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Pivoting to the other end of the spectrum, Las Vegas Sands (LVS) is down the most this year having been cut by 36.18%. IPG Photonics (IPGP), Lamb Weston Holdings (LW), Viatris (VTRS), MarketAxess (MKTX), and Global Payments (GPN) also have fallen by at least 25%. Once again, there is only one member of this list with a market cap above $100 billion: Qualcomm (QCOM). One other interesting factor to note of the worst performers is there are several stocks that were at some point plays on pandemic trends, whether those be reopening or stay at home. For example, in addition to LVS, another gaming/reopening name, Wynn Resorts (WYNN), ranks as the eighth-worst performer YTD. Additionally, strong performers during the onset of the pandemic like Clorox (CLX), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) are all down double digits this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-SPX-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Intraday Commodity Spikes\n\n&gt; Since the late spring, both silver and gold have been in steady downtrends spending much of that time below their 50-DMAs. Those downtrends remain in place, but both metals did find a short-term bottom on September 29th. While they have been rallying in the past week and a half, today each one has stalled out. From the early morning leading up to the Nonfarm Payrolls report, precious metals ramped higher with a surge immediately following the weaker than expected report. Only a couple hours after the release, gold and silver had erased a large portion of their earlier gains. In fact, silver is now 2.15% below its intraday high and gold is 1.36% below its high. For gold, in particular, that intraday reversal also marked a rejection of its 50-DMA which it\u2014as well as silver\u2014has struggled to stay above for most of the past several months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-GC-SI.png))**\n\n&gt; Crude oil is yet another commodity that is currently down off of its intraday highs, and like gold, the reversal came at a pretty interesting level. At its high Friday morning, front-month WTI futures rose above $80 for the first time since November 2014.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-CL.png))**\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-CL2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Job Market Continues To Frustrate In September\n\n&gt; The September payroll report likely created more questions than it answered.\n\n&gt; The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its September employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added a disappointing 194,000 jobs during the month, falling well short of Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 median forecast for a gain of 500,000. This comes on the heels of a lukewarm August report, which did receive an upward revision of 131,000. Somewhat contradictory, the unemployment rate fell more than forecast to 4.8% in September, beating expectations, though that was paired with a reduced labor force participation rate of 61.6% when expectations called for an increase.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe observation window for this report likely came too soon for positive catalysts to really gain traction,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLeisure and hospitality jobs, a proxy for economic reopening, were only marginally higher. We take this to mean Delta\u2019s waning impact will likely be more evident in October\u2019s report where we expect to see reopening momentum reassert itself.\u201d\n\n&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, in-person segments of the labor market such as leisure and hospitality jobs grew steadily during the first half of the year when COVID-19 remained under relative control. However, the latest flare-up has dampened that trend. We expect to see renewed growth in this sector as the delta variant continues to abate.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.8.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As mentioned, definitive takeaways from this report are difficult to come by due to the offsetting nature of the report. On the one hand, headline numbers came in very weak, but private payrolls, as well as manufacturing payrolls, fared better. The unemployment rate experienced a significant drop, but interpreting that number becomes muddied when considering the fact that we are already experiencing a significant worker shortage and the participation rate is declining, not increasing, as we would hope to see in a true recovery.\n\n&gt; What is more, because the observation window for the report cuts off mid-month, we cannot yet draw conclusions about the impact of school reopening and the lapsing of enhanced unemployment benefits\u2014hotly debated crosscurrents\u2014plus the aforementioned waning delta impact. Regarding the inflation debate\u2014average hourly earnings rose 0.6% month over month and 4.6% year over year. And while wages are undeniably growing and helping to fuel inflation, the data are not mix-adjusted and therefore are inflated due to the suppressed growth in the in-person, lower-wage segment of the labor market.\n\n&gt; The biggest question, though, is what this means for the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) asset tapering plans. The market had all but expected the Fed to announce a tapering timeline at its next meeting coming into this report, with the caveat that Fed Chair Jerome Powell needed only to see a \u201creasonably good\u201d job report first. Whether September\u2019s surprise report has cleared that low bar or not now becomes an open question, one which the market had all but dismissed as a formality previously.\n\n&gt; Indeed, in the aftermath of the report\u2019s release Treasury markets immediately began pricing in a possible delay to any taper, and equity markets gyrated between positive and negative territory as they struggled to process whether bad news should actually be considered good news in this context. We will have to see in the coming weeks whether this report will be substantial enough to bring on the much-anticipated taper announcement, but one thing is for sure\u2014there are no gimmies in this labor market recovery.\n*****\n\n&gt; # Columbus Day Performance\n\n&gt; Columbus Day is an interesting trading day for financial markets as it is one of the few trading days of the year when the equity market is open, but the bond market is closed. This may lead investors to think that equity markets should perform positively, as investors do not have credit markets to allocate capital to on that specific day. However, looking at the S&amp;P 500's historical performance on Columbus Day over the last 25 years doesn't necessarily show a real positive bias. Columbus Day tends to act just like any other trading day. Over the last 25 years, median performance on Columbus Day has been a gain of 10 basis points (bps) with positive returns 55.6% of the time. While that's slightly higher than the median one-day gain of 7 bps for all trading days over the last 25 years, the difference isn't significant. That's not to say that Columbus Day hasn't seen some outliers, though. Who can forget in 2008, during the middle of the Financial Crisis, when the S&amp;P 500 rallied more than 11% on Columbus Day!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Day-of.png))**\n\n&gt; For the week of Columbus Day, the S&amp;P 500's median gain has been 0.31% with positive returns 63% of the time which also isn't extraordinary relative to average weekly returns for the S&amp;P 500 over the last 25 years. The worst Columbus Day weeks were in 1999 (-6.63%) and 2018 (-4.10%) while the best were in 1998 (+7.32%), 2002 (5.87%), and 2011 (+5.98%). Interestingly enough, in 2008, even after rallying over 11% on Columbus Day, the S&amp;P 500 finished the week up just 4.60% as it erased more than half of its gains from the holiday session.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Week-of.png))**\n\n&gt; The table below lists the S&amp;P 500's performance leading up to and after Columbus Day for each of the last 25 years. With a decline of over 2.5% since the start of September, this year ranks as the weakest performance for the equity market since 2014.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Columbus-Day-Table-100821.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Most Important Chart In The World\n\n&gt; And just like that, the calendar turned to October and volatility picked up in a big way, with three consecutive 1% moves for the S&amp;P 500 Index to start the month. As we noted in our October preview, this month gets a bad rap for being a bearish month (it isn\u2019t), but it absolutely owns the title as the most volatile month.\n\n&gt; t took nearly a full year, but the S&amp;P 500 finally had its first 5% pullback of 2021, thus ending hopes of 2021 joining 1954, 1958, 1964, 1993, 1995, and 2017 as the only years to go a full calendar year without a 5% move lower.\n\n&gt; \u201cVolatility is the price of admission,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cSure, we\u2019d all prefer stocks go straight up forever, but that isn\u2019t reality. Investors must learn to embrace and accept the eventual scares and bouts of volatility that are common even in the strongest bull markets.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, stocks experience a 14.2% peak-to-trough pullback on average during the year, putting the recent 5% pullback in perspective. In fact, 21 out of the past 41 years saw at least a 10% correction. Incredibly, 12 of those years finished in the green and those 12 years gained an average of 17.0%. Who could forget last year\u2019s 34% bear market and move back to up 16% by the end of the year? In other words, big pullbacks can happen even in years that see outsized gains, which is why this chart is so important for investors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The last new all-time high for the S&amp;P 500 was on September 2, but as of the end of September there were still 54 new all-time highs in 2021, the second most ever with one quarter to go. The good news? Previous years that saw a lot new highs the first three quarters usually had strong performance the final quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Taking things a step further, this year the S&amp;P 500 produced one of its best ever year-to-date gains through September, up 14.7% with a quarter to go. It turns out that good starts to a year tend to resolve higher. In fact, 9 of the past 10 years the S&amp;P 500 was up at least 12.5% with a quarter to go there were further gains in the fourth quarter. As you can see below, the returns are greatly skewed due to 1987, but the median return in the final quarter of the year is an impressive 5.2% (versus the average fourth quarter return of 4.0%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Performance Through Q3 And its Impact on Q4 Performance\n\n&gt; Every year, the makeup and number of sectors that outperform the S&amp;P 500 changes. This year, four sectors (Energy, Financials, Real Estate, and Communication Services) outperformed the S&amp;P 500 through the end of Q3, while last year it was only three sectors that outperformed in the first three quarters of the year (Technology, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services).\n\n&gt; As we all know, past performance does not indicate future performance, and in looking at sectors that have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of prior years compared to how they performed in Q4, the same holds true. The table below lists the number of sectors that outperformed and underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of each year since 2000 and then shows their median performance during Q4 of the same year. Looking at a summary of the annual results, it's almost a coinflip as to whether or not the leading sectors in the first three quarters of a given year will continue to outperform in Q4. On average, the sectors that outperform YTD through 9/30 have averaged a Q4 gain of 3.58% (median: +6.40%) with positive returns 76% of the time. Sectors that lag the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of the year average a rest of year gain of 3.67% (median: 5.95%) with gains 71% of the time. While the term 'strength begets strength' has historically been applicable to the broader market, at the sector level, buying the YTD winners (or losers) ahead of Q4 in expectation of continued momentum to close out the year (or a mean reversion bounce) hasn't offered any material outperformance.\n\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Snap227.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Typical October Trading: Volatile Start Sets Up Rally through Month\u2019s End\n\n&gt; Over the last twenty-one years, the full month of October has been a solid month for the market. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have all recorded gains ranging from 0.6% by Russell 2000 to 1.9% by NASDAQ. But these gains have come with volatile trading, most notably during the early days of the month. October has opened softly with mild gains on its first trading day by DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000. On the second day, all five indexes have been weak followed by a rebound on the third trading day before additional weakness pulls the market lower through the seventh trading day. At which point, the market has historically found support and began to rally through mid-month and beyond.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/070f50fc0225a24692163a37694f0425/da1ccfd284e5df51-2c/s500x750/009fdcd32ca89da61f3a47401e5e5eaf71f34f50.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 2021!](https://i.imgur.com/xrMCop9.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.11.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.11.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cF0CbQE.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.12.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D4dB9sd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.12.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jDBI2Dv.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.13.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qVRtzZv.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.13.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/V7gDj4f.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.14.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hZ42eSL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.14.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HNdhjgf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.15.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I2ihrfy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.15.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets. :)",

The BNPL market as a whole is very expensive (coming from a small investor's POV). Square\u2019s P/B ratio is currently at 40, which indicates that the company might be overvalued. On top of that, Squares Total liabilities, D/E ratio, and Long Term Debt have all seen a sharp increase. Square is aggressively trying to expand by financing its debt. This alone makes me hesitant to invest. I am concerned with Square\u2019s ties to bitcoin. I labeled this as both a bullish and bearish case. Square invested a good chunk of money in bitcoin. That means their reliant on bitcoins performance. If bitcoin goes up, they go up. If bitcoin goes down, they do down. There is a lot of news and government intervention surrounding bitcoin which can either be positive or negative. I do believe the BNPL industry is a growing market, but with more competition entering the market, it will be hard for Square to capture market share. \n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 11th, 2021.\n\n# **Stock market on comeback trail heads into what\u2019s supposed to be another stellar earnings season - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/08/stock-market-on-comeback-trail-heads-into-whats-supposed-to-be-another-stellar-earnings-season-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks proved hard to keep down this week, and the start of the earnings season next week could further bolster the comeback if profits roll in as expected or better.\n*****\n&gt; The major averages notched a winning week after overcoming a debt ceiling debacle in Washington. Lawmakers passed a short-term deal that will extend the debt ceiling until December, kicking that overhang for the market down the road.\n*****\n&gt; This week\u2019s price action also overcame surging oil prices and a disappointing jobs report, with investors buying bank and energy shares.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn the face of Washington drama, delta worries, multiyear highs in crude oil, and a much weaker than expected jobs number, you have to be impressed by how stocks were able to bounce back this week,\u201d LPL Financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick said.\n*****\n&gt; https://i.imgur.com/Zh7JRt2.png\n*****\n&gt; A market pullback that began in September brought the S&amp;P 500 down more than 5% from its record at one point Monday, before stocks mounted a comeback. For the week, the S&amp;P 500 added back 0.8% and sits just 3.4% away from its record.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs stuck by its bullish year-end forecast earlier this week, predicting stocks would start to climb the wall of worries. And they did.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin said in a note to clients that his year-end S&amp;P 500 price target for 2021 is still 4,700, which is nearly 7% above its current level.\n*****\n&gt; The firm said earnings growth, not valuation expansion, was the primary driver of the S&amp;P 500\u2032s 17% return year to date, adding that should still be the case.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings season begins\n&gt; The third-quarter earnings season \u2014 which kicks off next week with big bank earnings \u2014 is expected to be another strong series of reports, despite some worries about supply chain issues and higher costs. Third-quarter earnings are expected to have risen 27.6% year over year, according to FactSet. That would be the third-highest growth rate since 2010.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some record earnings seasons the past few quarters, so all eyes will be on if earnings can help justify stocks near all-time high levels,\u201d Detrick said. \u201cWe do expect another solid earnings season, but we\u2019ve seen some high profile warnings already, so corporate America could have a rather high bar to clear this quarter. Buckle up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bank earnings are the main focus next week with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs set to report.\n*****\n&gt; After a range-bound few months for bank stocks, analysts are looking ahead to catalysts that could fuel the next phase in their recovery. Wall Street expects loan growth, interest rates and reserve releases to play into the major banks\u2019 reports.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEarnings for the third quarter quarter should again be strong and mostly outpace expectations,\u201d Leuthold Group chief investment strategist Jim Paulsen said. \u201cHours worked in the third quarter rose by about 5% suggesting real GDP for the quarter may be close to 7%. With most companies reporting strong pricing power, solid real GDP growth should result in another surprisingly strong corporate earnings season.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen sees earnings season rewarding cyclicals, like banks, and small caps more than technology stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the stock market is already showing signs of a leadership shift away from slow economic growth favorites including growth, tech, and defensive toward more the economically sensitive areas of small caps and cyclical sectors,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; # Supply chain, higher cost warnings?\nWhile the earnings season should be strong, there are likely to be some warning signs about inflation and supply constraints that could scare the market about the year-end set-up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe risks of higher inflation, Fed tapering and what will likely be a choppy earnings season are still with us,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.\n*****\n&gt; There was some foreshadowing of this last week, when Bed Bath and Beyond shares cratered 25% after the company said it saw a steep drop-off in traffic in August. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond saw inflation costs escalating over the summer months, especially toward the end of its second quarter in August, which corroded profits.\n*****\n&gt; What investors know going into the third quarter \u2014 from company guidance \u2014 is that there could be haves and have nots this earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; FactSet data shows that 47 S&amp;P 500 companies have issued negative earnings guidance for the third quarter, and 56 companies have issued positive outlooks.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed headwind ahead?\n&gt; The headline jobs number Friday was a major disappointment, as the economy added just 194,000 jobs in September, well below the the Dow Jones estimate of 500,000. On the positive side, the unemployment rate fell to a much lower point than economists forecast. At 4.8%, that\u2019s the same level seen in late 2016.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s unclear if the number changes the calculus for when and how fast the Federal Reserve will slow its $120 billion-per-month bond-buying program.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn our view these figures are good enough, and when combined with the debt-ceiling can being kicked down the road, likely solidifies November as \u2018go time\u2019 for tapering,\u201d Wells Fargo Securities senior equity analyst Christopher Harvey said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe continue to expect a choppy equity market rally and a two-to-four-week tech bounce, but the bounce probably peters out next month when the Fed says those magical words: We will begin to taper,\u201d he added.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/WuOc7cb.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnJ6ZF2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/CojntqX.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/mxZnyBJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eZbwxOb.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JPCsx2m.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kyfY7Xn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zEMv32q.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uaj9G7t.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VAaeJ4E.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/fgsZNEH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/W5HmLSK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/DDVPGco.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best and Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2021\n\n&gt; The fourth quarter is now off to the races and we thought it worthwhile to check in on the best and worst-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks on a year-to-date basis.

It now has a market cap of $124.87 billion versus a market cap of only $41 billion at the start of the year. Of the 20 best performers, MRNA is also the only one with a market cap above $100 billion. The next largest is ConocoPhillips (COP) with a $95.76 billion market cap. COP is one of multiple Energy stocks on this list as well. Of the top 20 performers, Energy sector names dominate the list with 8 members.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-SPX-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Pivoting to the other end of the spectrum, Las Vegas Sands (LVS) is down the most this year having been cut by 36.18%. IPG Photonics (IPGP), Lamb Weston Holdings (LW), Viatris (VTRS), MarketAxess (MKTX), and Global Payments (GPN) also have fallen by at least 25%. Once again, there is only one member of this list with a market cap above $100 billion: Qualcomm (QCOM). One other interesting factor to note of the worst performers is there are several stocks that were at some point plays on pandemic trends, whether those be reopening or stay at home. For example, in addition to LVS, another gaming/reopening name, Wynn Resorts (WYNN), ranks as the eighth-worst performer YTD. Additionally, strong performers during the onset of the pandemic like Clorox (CLX), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) are all down double digits this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-SPX-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Intraday Commodity Spikes\n\n&gt; Since the late spring, both silver and gold have been in steady downtrends spending much of that time below their 50-DMAs. Those downtrends remain in place, but both metals did find a short-term bottom on September 29th. While they have been rallying in the past week and a half, today each one has stalled out. From the early morning leading up to the Nonfarm Payrolls report, precious metals ramped higher with a surge immediately following the weaker than expected report. Only a couple hours after the release, gold and silver had erased a large portion of their earlier gains. In fact, silver is now 2.15% below its intraday high and gold is 1.36% below its high. For gold, in particular, that intraday reversal also marked a rejection of its 50-DMA which it\u2014as well as silver\u2014has struggled to stay above for most of the past several months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-GC-SI.png))**\n\n&gt; Crude oil is yet another commodity that is currently down off of its intraday highs, and like gold, the reversal came at a pretty interesting level. At its high Friday morning, front-month WTI futures rose above $80 for the first time since November 2014.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-CL.png))**\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-CL2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Job Market Continues To Frustrate In September\n\n&gt; The September payroll report likely created more questions than it answered.\n\n&gt; The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its September employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added a disappointing 194,000 jobs during the month, falling well short of Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 median forecast for a gain of 500,000. This comes on the heels of a lukewarm August report, which did receive an upward revision of 131,000. Somewhat contradictory, the unemployment rate fell more than forecast to 4.8% in September, beating expectations, though that was paired with a reduced labor force participation rate of 61.6% when expectations called for an increase.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe observation window for this report likely came too soon for positive catalysts to really gain traction,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLeisure and hospitality jobs, a proxy for economic reopening, were only marginally higher. We take this to mean Delta\u2019s waning impact will likely be more evident in October\u2019s report where we expect to see reopening momentum reassert itself.\u201d\n\n&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, in-person segments of the labor market such as leisure and hospitality jobs grew steadily during the first half of the year when COVID-19 remained under relative control. However, the latest flare-up has dampened that trend. We expect to see renewed growth in this sector as the delta variant continues to abate.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.8.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As mentioned, definitive takeaways from this report are difficult to come by due to the offsetting nature of the report. On the one hand, headline numbers came in very weak, but private payrolls, as well as manufacturing payrolls, fared better. The unemployment rate experienced a significant drop, but interpreting that number becomes muddied when considering the fact that we are already experiencing a significant worker shortage and the participation rate is declining, not increasing, as we would hope to see in a true recovery.\n\n&gt; What is more, because the observation window for the report cuts off mid-month, we cannot yet draw conclusions about the impact of school reopening and the lapsing of enhanced unemployment benefits\u2014hotly debated crosscurrents\u2014plus the aforementioned waning delta impact. Regarding the inflation debate\u2014average hourly earnings rose 0.6% month over month and 4.6% year over year. And while wages are undeniably growing and helping to fuel inflation, the data are not mix-adjusted and therefore are inflated due to the suppressed growth in the in-person, lower-wage segment of the labor market.\n\n&gt; The biggest question, though, is what this means for the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) asset tapering plans. The market had all but expected the Fed to announce a tapering timeline at its next meeting coming into this report, with the caveat that Fed Chair Jerome Powell needed only to see a \u201creasonably good\u201d job report first. Whether September\u2019s surprise report has cleared that low bar or not now becomes an open question, one which the market had all but dismissed as a formality previously.\n\n&gt; Indeed, in the aftermath of the report\u2019s release Treasury markets immediately began pricing in a possible delay to any taper, and equity markets gyrated between positive and negative territory as they struggled to process whether bad news should actually be considered good news in this context. We will have to see in the coming weeks whether this report will be substantial enough to bring on the much-anticipated taper announcement, but one thing is for sure\u2014there are no gimmies in this labor market recovery.\n*****\n\n&gt; # Columbus Day Performance\n\n&gt; Columbus Day is an interesting trading day for financial markets as it is one of the few trading days of the year when the equity market is open, but the bond market is closed. This may lead investors to think that equity markets should perform positively, as investors do not have credit markets to allocate capital to on that specific day. However, looking at the S&amp;P 500's historical performance on Columbus Day over the last 25 years doesn't necessarily show a real positive bias. Columbus Day tends to act just like any other trading day. Over the last 25 years, median performance on Columbus Day has been a gain of 10 basis points (bps) with positive returns 55.6% of the time. While that's slightly higher than the median one-day gain of 7 bps for all trading days over the last 25 years, the difference isn't significant. That's not to say that Columbus Day hasn't seen some outliers, though. Who can forget in 2008, during the middle of the Financial Crisis, when the S&amp;P 500 rallied more than 11% on Columbus Day!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Day-of.png))**\n\n&gt; For the week of Columbus Day, the S&amp;P 500's median gain has been 0.31% with positive returns 63% of the time which also isn't extraordinary relative to average weekly returns for the S&amp;P 500 over the last 25 years. The worst Columbus Day weeks were in 1999 (-6.63%) and 2018 (-4.10%) while the best were in 1998 (+7.32%), 2002 (5.87%), and 2011 (+5.98%). Interestingly enough, in 2008, even after rallying over 11% on Columbus Day, the S&amp;P 500 finished the week up just 4.60% as it erased more than half of its gains from the holiday session.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Week-of.png))**\n\n&gt; The table below lists the S&amp;P 500's performance leading up to and after Columbus Day for each of the last 25 years. With a decline of over 2.5% since the start of September, this year ranks as the weakest performance for the equity market since 2014.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Columbus-Day-Table-100821.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Most Important Chart In The World\n\n&gt; And just like that, the calendar turned to October and volatility picked up in a big way, with three consecutive 1% moves for the S&amp;P 500 Index to start the month. As we noted in our October preview, this month gets a bad rap for being a bearish month (it isn\u2019t), but it absolutely owns the title as the most volatile month.\n\n&gt; t took nearly a full year, but the S&amp;P 500 finally had its first 5% pullback of 2021, thus ending hopes of 2021 joining 1954, 1958, 1964, 1993, 1995, and 2017 as the only years to go a full calendar year without a 5% move lower.\n\n&gt; \u201cVolatility is the price of admission,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cSure, we\u2019d all prefer stocks go straight up forever, but that isn\u2019t reality. Investors must learn to embrace and accept the eventual scares and bouts of volatility that are common even in the strongest bull markets.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, stocks experience a 14.2% peak-to-trough pullback on average during the year, putting the recent 5% pullback in perspective. In fact, 21 out of the past 41 years saw at least a 10% correction. Incredibly, 12 of those years finished in the green and those 12 years gained an average of 17.0%. Who could forget last year\u2019s 34% bear market and move back to up 16% by the end of the year? In other words, big pullbacks can happen even in years that see outsized gains, which is why this chart is so important for investors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The last new all-time high for the S&amp;P 500 was on September 2, but as of the end of September there were still 54 new all-time highs in 2021, the second most ever with one quarter to go. The good news? Previous years that saw a lot new highs the first three quarters usually had strong performance the final quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Taking things a step further, this year the S&amp;P 500 produced one of its best ever year-to-date gains through September, up 14.7% with a quarter to go. It turns out that good starts to a year tend to resolve higher. In fact, 9 of the past 10 years the S&amp;P 500 was up at least 12.5% with a quarter to go there were further gains in the fourth quarter. As you can see below, the returns are greatly skewed due to 1987, but the median return in the final quarter of the year is an impressive 5.2% (versus the average fourth quarter return of 4.0%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Performance Through Q3 And its Impact on Q4 Performance\n\n&gt; Every year, the makeup and number of sectors that outperform the S&amp;P 500 changes. This year, four sectors (Energy, Financials, Real Estate, and Communication Services) outperformed the S&amp;P 500 through the end of Q3, while last year it was only three sectors that outperformed in the first three quarters of the year (Technology, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services).\n\n&gt; As we all know, past performance does not indicate future performance, and in looking at sectors that have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of prior years compared to how they performed in Q4, the same holds true. The table below lists the number of sectors that outperformed and underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of each year since 2000 and then shows their median performance during Q4 of the same year. Looking at a summary of the annual results, it's almost a coinflip as to whether or not the leading sectors in the first three quarters of a given year will continue to outperform in Q4. On average, the sectors that outperform YTD through 9/30 have averaged a Q4 gain of 3.58% (median: +6.40%) with positive returns 76% of the time. Sectors that lag the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of the year average a rest of year gain of 3.67% (median: 5.95%) with gains 71% of the time. While the term 'strength begets strength' has historically been applicable to the broader market, at the sector level, buying the YTD winners (or losers) ahead of Q4 in expectation of continued momentum to close out the year (or a mean reversion bounce) hasn't offered any material outperformance.\n\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Snap227.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Typical October Trading: Volatile Start Sets Up Rally through Month\u2019s End\n\n&gt; Over the last twenty-one years, the full month of October has been a solid month for the market. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have all recorded gains ranging from 0.6% by Russell 2000 to 1.9% by NASDAQ. But these gains have come with volatile trading, most notably during the early days of the month. October has opened softly with mild gains on its first trading day by DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000. On the second day, all five indexes have been weak followed by a rebound on the third trading day before additional weakness pulls the market lower through the seventh trading day. At which point, the market has historically found support and began to rally through mid-month and beyond.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/070f50fc0225a24692163a37694f0425/da1ccfd284e5df51-2c/s500x750/009fdcd32ca89da61f3a47401e5e5eaf71f34f50.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 8th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwLj9O1yEmE))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.10.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 2021!](https://i.imgur.com/xrMCop9.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.11.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.11.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cF0CbQE.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.12.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D4dB9sd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.12.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jDBI2Dv.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.13.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qVRtzZv.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.13.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/V7gDj4f.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.14.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hZ42eSL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.14.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HNdhjgf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.15.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I2ihrfy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.15.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/smallstreetbets. :)",

Square makes it easier for customers to pay for products and services. Square\u2019s biggest product currently is a card reader that enables businesses to offer credit card payments instead of solely using cash. Square owns the popular Cash App which allows users to send payments, receive payments, invest, hold, and buy/sell bitcoin.\n\n**Industry Overview**\n\nThe buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) industry has seen some major growth this past year. There are advantages to using BNPL over credit cards. With BNPL technology, consumers don\u2019t have to worry about their credit scores. This can be seen as both an advantage and disadvantage. If you have a low credit score, you can use Square to avoid taking more hits on your credit. However, you can\u2019t build up your credit score using Square. \n\n**News Timeline**\n\nJuly 20, 2021\\[Source\\]([https://squareup.com/us/en/press/introducing-square-banking](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/introducing-square-banking))\n\nAugust 1, 2021\\[Source\\](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-announces-plans-to-acquire-afterpay)\n\n* Square announces plan to acquire Afterpay\n   * Aimed towards a younger generation\n\nSeptember 20, 2021\\[Source\\]([https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-launches-integrated-omnichannel-solutions-for-businesses-in-france](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-launches-integrated-omnichannel-solutions-for-businesses-in-france))\n\n* Square plans to enter France market\n\nSeptemeber 28, 2021\\[Source\\]([https://finance.yahoo.com/m/14b72cf0-0153-3985-ae1e-4ccf7d198700/square-partners-with-tiktok.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/14b72cf0-0153-3985-ae1e-4ccf7d198700/square-partners-with-tiktok.html))\n\n* Square partners with TikTok\n\n\\[Source\\]([https://www.barrons.com/articles/mastercard-bnpl-payments-affirm-square-51632845187](https://www.barrons.com/articles/mastercard-bnpl-payments-affirm-square-51632845187))\n\n* Mastercard announces plan to enter BNPL market\n\n**Competitors**\n\n* PayPal\n* Fiserv\n* Global Payments\n* Affirm Holdings\n* Shopify \n* Clover\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SQ/SdTObmDK-Square-SQ-Descending-Channel/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SQ/SdTObmDK-Square-SQ-Descending-Channel/)\n\n**Bullish Case**\n\n* BNPL industry has global potential to grow \n* Small business lending is increasing\n* Invested heavily in Bitcoin \n\n**Bearish Case**\n\n* Strong competition in the BNPL industry\n* Speculation of future revenue reliant on Bitcoin\n* Invested heavily in Bitcoin\n\n**Management** \n\nSquare CEO Jack Dorsey is somewhat a prodigy.

I believe that other credit cards and banks will follow suit. Up until now, banks have been slow to respond and are sustaining huge losses because of it. The BNPL market is pretty saturated as it is. The BNPL market as a whole is very expensive (coming from a small investor's POV). Square\u2019s P/B ratio is currently at 40, which indicates that the company might be overvalued. On top of that, Squares Total liabilities, D/E ratio, and Long Term Debt have all seen a sharp increase. Square is aggressively trying to expand by financing its debt. This alone makes me hesitant to invest. I am concerned with Square\u2019s ties to bitcoin. I labeled this as both a bullish and bearish case. Square invested a good chunk of money in bitcoin. That means their reliant on bitcoins performance. If bitcoin goes up, they go up. If bitcoin goes down, they do down. There is a lot of news and government intervention surrounding bitcoin which can either be positive or negative. I do believe the BNPL industry is a growing market, but with more competition entering the market, it will be hard for Square to capture market share. \n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice.

Lawmakers passed a short-term deal that will extend the debt ceiling until December, kicking that overhang for the market down the road.\n*****\n&gt; This week\u2019s price action also overcame surging oil prices and a disappointing jobs report, with investors buying bank and energy shares.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn the face of Washington drama, delta worries, multiyear highs in crude oil, and a much weaker than expected jobs number, you have to be impressed by how stocks were able to bounce back this week,\u201d LPL Financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick said.\n*****\n&gt; https://i.imgur.com/Zh7JRt2.png\n*****\n&gt; A market pullback that began in September brought the S&amp;P 500 down more than 5% from its record at one point Monday, before stocks mounted a comeback. For the week, the S&amp;P 500 added back 0.8% and sits just 3.4% away from its record.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs stuck by its bullish year-end forecast earlier this week, predicting stocks would start to climb the wall of worries. And they did.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin said in a note to clients that his year-end S&amp;P 500 price target for 2021 is still 4,700, which is nearly 7% above its current level.\n*****\n&gt; The firm said earnings growth, not valuation expansion, was the primary driver of the S&amp;P 500\u2032s 17% return year to date, adding that should still be the case.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings season begins\n&gt; The third-quarter earnings season \u2014 which kicks off next week with big bank earnings \u2014 is expected to be another strong series of reports, despite some worries about supply chain issues and higher costs. Third-quarter earnings are expected to have risen 27.6% year over year, according to FactSet. That would be the third-highest growth rate since 2010.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some record earnings seasons the past few quarters, so all eyes will be on if earnings can help justify stocks near all-time high levels,\u201d Detrick said. \u201cWe do expect another solid earnings season, but we\u2019ve seen some high profile warnings already, so corporate America could have a rather high bar to clear this quarter. Buckle up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bank earnings are the main focus next week with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs set to report.\n*****\n&gt; After a range-bound few months for bank stocks, analysts are looking ahead to catalysts that could fuel the next phase in their recovery. Wall Street expects loan growth, interest rates and reserve releases to play into the major banks\u2019 reports.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEarnings for the third quarter quarter should again be strong and mostly outpace expectations,\u201d Leuthold Group chief investment strategist Jim Paulsen said. \u201cHours worked in the third quarter rose by about 5% suggesting real GDP for the quarter may be close to 7%. With most companies reporting strong pricing power, solid real GDP growth should result in another surprisingly strong corporate earnings season.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen sees earnings season rewarding cyclicals, like banks, and small caps more than technology stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the stock market is already showing signs of a leadership shift away from slow economic growth favorites including growth, tech, and defensive toward more the economically sensitive areas of small caps and cyclical sectors,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; # Supply chain, higher cost warnings?\nWhile the earnings season should be strong, there are likely to be some warning signs about inflation and supply constraints that could scare the market about the year-end set-up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe risks of higher inflation, Fed tapering and what will likely be a choppy earnings season are still with us,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.\n*****\n&gt; There was some foreshadowing of this last week, when Bed Bath and Beyond shares cratered 25% after the company said it saw a steep drop-off in traffic in August. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond saw inflation costs escalating over the summer months, especially toward the end of its second quarter in August, which corroded profits.\n*****\n&gt; What investors know going into the third quarter \u2014 from company guidance \u2014 is that there could be haves and have nots this earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; FactSet data shows that 47 S&amp;P 500 companies have issued negative earnings guidance for the third quarter, and 56 companies have issued positive outlooks.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed headwind ahead?\n&gt; The headline jobs number Friday was a major disappointment, as the economy added just 194,000 jobs in September, well below the the Dow Jones estimate of 500,000. On the positive side, the unemployment rate fell to a much lower point than economists forecast. At 4.8%, that\u2019s the same level seen in late 2016.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s unclear if the number changes the calculus for when and how fast the Federal Reserve will slow its $120 billion-per-month bond-buying program.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn our view these figures are good enough, and when combined with the debt-ceiling can being kicked down the road, likely solidifies November as \u2018go time\u2019 for tapering,\u201d Wells Fargo Securities senior equity analyst Christopher Harvey said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe continue to expect a choppy equity market rally and a two-to-four-week tech bounce, but the bounce probably peters out next month when the Fed says those magical words: We will begin to taper,\u201d he added.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/WuOc7cb.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnJ6ZF2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/CojntqX.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/mxZnyBJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eZbwxOb.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JPCsx2m.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kyfY7Xn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zEMv32q.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uaj9G7t.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VAaeJ4E.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/fgsZNEH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/W5HmLSK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/DDVPGco.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best and Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2021\n\n&gt; The fourth quarter is now off to the races and we thought it worthwhile to check in on the best and worst-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks on a year-to-date basis. As shown below, there are currently six members of the index that have rallied over 100% this year. Apt for the year that its vaccine has rolled out, the biggest gainer of these has been Moderna (MRNA) with a 196.12% rally. It now has a market cap of $124.87 billion versus a market cap of only $41 billion at the start of the year. Of the 20 best performers, MRNA is also the only one with a market cap above $100 billion. The next largest is ConocoPhillips (COP) with a $95.76 billion market cap. COP is one of multiple Energy stocks on this list as well. Of the top 20 performers, Energy sector names dominate the list with 8 members.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-SPX-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Pivoting to the other end of the spectrum, Las Vegas Sands (LVS) is down the most this year having been cut by 36.18%. IPG Photonics (IPGP), Lamb Weston Holdings (LW), Viatris (VTRS), MarketAxess (MKTX), and Global Payments (GPN) also have fallen by at least 25%. Once again, there is only one member of this list with a market cap above $100 billion: Qualcomm (QCOM). One other interesting factor to note of the worst performers is there are several stocks that were at some point plays on pandemic trends, whether those be reopening or stay at home. For example, in addition to LVS, another gaming/reopening name, Wynn Resorts (WYNN), ranks as the eighth-worst performer YTD. Additionally, strong performers during the onset of the pandemic like Clorox (CLX), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) are all down double digits this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-SPX-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Intraday Commodity Spikes\n\n&gt; Since the late spring, both silver and gold have been in steady downtrends spending much of that time below their 50-DMAs. Those downtrends remain in place, but both metals did find a short-term bottom on September 29th. While they have been rallying in the past week and a half, today each one has stalled out. From the early morning leading up to the Nonfarm Payrolls report, precious metals ramped higher with a surge immediately following the weaker than expected report. Only a couple hours after the release, gold and silver had erased a large portion of their earlier gains. In fact, silver is now 2.15% below its intraday high and gold is 1.36% below its high. For gold, in particular, that intraday reversal also marked a rejection of its 50-DMA which it\u2014as well as silver\u2014has struggled to stay above for most of the past several months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-GC-SI.png))**\n\n&gt; Crude oil is yet another commodity that is currently down off of its intraday highs, and like gold, the reversal came at a pretty interesting level. At its high Friday morning, front-month WTI futures rose above $80 for the first time since November 2014.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-CL.png))**\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-CL2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Job Market Continues To Frustrate In September\n\n&gt; The September payroll report likely created more questions than it answered.\n\n&gt; The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its September employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added a disappointing 194,000 jobs during the month, falling well short of Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 median forecast for a gain of 500,000. This comes on the heels of a lukewarm August report, which did receive an upward revision of 131,000. Somewhat contradictory, the unemployment rate fell more than forecast to 4.8% in September, beating expectations, though that was paired with a reduced labor force participation rate of 61.6% when expectations called for an increase.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe observation window for this report likely came too soon for positive catalysts to really gain traction,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLeisure and hospitality jobs, a proxy for economic reopening, were only marginally higher. We take this to mean Delta\u2019s waning impact will likely be more evident in October\u2019s report where we expect to see reopening momentum reassert itself.\u201d\n\n&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, in-person segments of the labor market such as leisure and hospitality jobs grew steadily during the first half of the year when COVID-19 remained under relative control. However, the latest flare-up has dampened that trend. We expect to see renewed growth in this sector as the delta variant continues to abate.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.8.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As mentioned, definitive takeaways from this report are difficult to come by due to the offsetting nature of the report. On the one hand, headline numbers came in very weak, but private payrolls, as well as manufacturing payrolls, fared better. The unemployment rate experienced a significant drop, but interpreting that number becomes muddied when considering the fact that we are already experiencing a significant worker shortage and the participation rate is declining, not increasing, as we would hope to see in a true recovery.\n\n&gt; What is more, because the observation window for the report cuts off mid-month, we cannot yet draw conclusions about the impact of school reopening and the lapsing of enhanced unemployment benefits\u2014hotly debated crosscurrents\u2014plus the aforementioned waning delta impact. Regarding the inflation debate\u2014average hourly earnings rose 0.6% month over month and 4.6% year over year. And while wages are undeniably growing and helping to fuel inflation, the data are not mix-adjusted and therefore are inflated due to the suppressed growth in the in-person, lower-wage segment of the labor market.\n\n&gt; The biggest question, though, is what this means for the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) asset tapering plans. The market had all but expected the Fed to announce a tapering timeline at its next meeting coming into this report, with the caveat that Fed Chair Jerome Powell needed only to see a \u201creasonably good\u201d job report first. Whether September\u2019s surprise report has cleared that low bar or not now becomes an open question, one which the market had all but dismissed as a formality previously.\n\n&gt; Indeed, in the aftermath of the report\u2019s release Treasury markets immediately began pricing in a possible delay to any taper, and equity markets gyrated between positive and negative territory as they struggled to process whether bad news should actually be considered good news in this context. We will have to see in the coming weeks whether this report will be substantial enough to bring on the much-anticipated taper announcement, but one thing is for sure\u2014there are no gimmies in this labor market recovery.\n*****\n\n&gt; # Columbus Day Performance\n\n&gt; Columbus Day is an interesting trading day for financial markets as it is one of the few trading days of the year when the equity market is open, but the bond market is closed. This may lead investors to think that equity markets should perform positively, as investors do not have credit markets to allocate capital to on that specific day. However, looking at the S&amp;P 500's historical performance on Columbus Day over the last 25 years doesn't necessarily show a real positive bias. Columbus Day tends to act just like any other trading day. Over the last 25 years, median performance on Columbus Day has been a gain of 10 basis points (bps) with positive returns 55.6% of the time. While that's slightly higher than the median one-day gain of 7 bps for all trading days over the last 25 years, the difference isn't significant. That's not to say that Columbus Day hasn't seen some outliers, though. Who can forget in 2008, during the middle of the Financial Crisis, when the S&amp;P 500 rallied more than 11% on Columbus Day!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Day-of.png))**\n\n&gt; For the week of Columbus Day, the S&amp;P 500's median gain has been 0.31% with positive returns 63% of the time which also isn't extraordinary relative to average weekly returns for the S&amp;P 500 over the last 25 years. The worst Columbus Day weeks were in 1999 (-6.63%) and 2018 (-4.10%) while the best were in 1998 (+7.32%), 2002 (5.87%), and 2011 (+5.98%). Interestingly enough, in 2008, even after rallying over 11% on Columbus Day, the S&amp;P 500 finished the week up just 4.60% as it erased more than half of its gains from the holiday session.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Week-of.png))**\n\n&gt; The table below lists the S&amp;P 500's performance leading up to and after Columbus Day for each of the last 25 years. With a decline of over 2.5% since the start of September, this year ranks as the weakest performance for the equity market since 2014.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Columbus-Day-Table-100821.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Most Important Chart In The World\n\n&gt; And just like that, the calendar turned to October and volatility picked up in a big way, with three consecutive 1% moves for the S&amp;P 500 Index to start the month. As we noted in our October preview, this month gets a bad rap for being a bearish month (it isn\u2019t), but it absolutely owns the title as the most volatile month.\n\n&gt; t took nearly a full year, but the S&amp;P 500 finally had its first 5% pullback of 2021, thus ending hopes of 2021 joining 1954, 1958, 1964, 1993, 1995, and 2017 as the only years to go a full calendar year without a 5% move lower.\n\n&gt; \u201cVolatility is the price of admission,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cSure, we\u2019d all prefer stocks go straight up forever, but that isn\u2019t reality. Investors must learn to embrace and accept the eventual scares and bouts of volatility that are common even in the strongest bull markets.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, stocks experience a 14.2% peak-to-trough pullback on average during the year, putting the recent 5% pullback in perspective. In fact, 21 out of the past 41 years saw at least a 10% correction. Incredibly, 12 of those years finished in the green and those 12 years gained an average of 17.0%. Who could forget last year\u2019s 34% bear market and move back to up 16% by the end of the year? In other words, big pullbacks can happen even in years that see outsized gains, which is why this chart is so important for investors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The last new all-time high for the S&amp;P 500 was on September 2, but as of the end of September there were still 54 new all-time highs in 2021, the second most ever with one quarter to go. The good news? Previous years that saw a lot new highs the first three quarters usually had strong performance the final quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Taking things a step further, this year the S&amp;P 500 produced one of its best ever year-to-date gains through September, up 14.7% with a quarter to go. It turns out that good starts to a year tend to resolve higher. In fact, 9 of the past 10 years the S&amp;P 500 was up at least 12.5% with a quarter to go there were further gains in the fourth quarter. As you can see below, the returns are greatly skewed due to 1987, but the median return in the final quarter of the year is an impressive 5.2% (versus the average fourth quarter return of 4.0%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Performance Through Q3 And its Impact on Q4 Performance\n\n&gt; Every year, the makeup and number of sectors that outperform the S&amp;P 500 changes. This year, four sectors (Energy, Financials, Real Estate, and Communication Services) outperformed the S&amp;P 500 through the end of Q3, while last year it was only three sectors that outperformed in the first three quarters of the year (Technology, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services).\n\n&gt; As we all know, past performance does not indicate future performance, and in looking at sectors that have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of prior years compared to how they performed in Q4, the same holds true. The table below lists the number of sectors that outperformed and underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of each year since 2000 and then shows their median performance during Q4 of the same year. Looking at a summary of the annual results, it's almost a coinflip as to whether or not the leading sectors in the first three quarters of a given year will continue to outperform in Q4. On average, the sectors that outperform YTD through 9/30 have averaged a Q4 gain of 3.58% (median: +6.40%) with positive returns 76% of the time. Sectors that lag the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of the year average a rest of year gain of 3.67% (median: 5.95%) with gains 71% of the time. While the term 'strength begets strength' has historically been applicable to the broader market, at the sector level, buying the YTD winners (or losers) ahead of Q4 in expectation of continued momentum to close out the year (or a mean reversion bounce) hasn't offered any material outperformance.\n\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Snap227.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Typical October Trading: Volatile Start Sets Up Rally through Month\u2019s End\n\n&gt; Over the last twenty-one years, the full month of October has been a solid month for the market. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have all recorded gains ranging from 0.6% by Russell 2000 to 1.9% by NASDAQ. But these gains have come with volatile trading, most notably during the early days of the month. October has opened softly with mild gains on its first trading day by DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000. On the second day, all five indexes have been weak followed by a rebound on the third trading day before additional weakness pulls the market lower through the seventh trading day.

        "selftext": "**This is not investing advice do your own research. Yadda yadda**\n\nIts that time again. Time for another PSFE DD. Here's some multiples valuation analysis for you clowns. \n\n  Multiples is what non-autist investment chucktards look at along with a given explanation of each bc i know you autists throw money at whatever you saw on TV last. \n\n  1. First up in valuation framework, you need to have a comp set bc investment community is soooo busy and cant fathom original thought.\n\n   **Paysafe's comps (if you dont agree fuck off):** \n\n* Boku (LON: BOKU)\n* Paymentus (NYS: PAY)\n* Remitly (NAS: RELY)\n* Euronet Worldwide (NAS: EEFT)\n* Worldline (PAR: WLN)\n* EvoPay (NAS: EVO)\n* Affirm (NAS: AFRM)\n* Adyen (AMS: ADYEN)\n* Global Payments Network (NYS: GPN)\n\nAnd for you extra chromosome tardheads I'll throw in \n\n* Square (NYS: SQ)\n* Paypal (NAS: PYPL)\n* Visa (NYS: V)\n\n2. Second up, **EV / Revenue**. You can use this to decide what you want to acquire a company for as a multiple of their sales. Its simple, the lower the better as it means its undervalued. Yes you dirty apes, low equal good. These are ranked high to low, play wheres waldo and maybe you can find Paysafe.\n\n* Affirm: 48.81\n* Visa: 19.77\n* Adyen: 16.37\n* Remitly: 14.97\n* Paypal: 11.43\n* Boku (LON: BOKU): 11.07\n* Paymentus: 7.78\n* Square: 7.17\n* Global Payments Network: 6.45\n* EvoPay: 5.05\n* **Paysafe: 4.96**\n* Worldline: 4.85\n* Euronet Worldwide: 1.97\n\n  **Conclusion**: Oh wow, we are near the bottom, meaning PSFE is significantly undervalued ...shocker. Buy Paysafe or dont, who cares.\n\n 3. Next up we are moving into the \"finance ppl gaming the system multiples\" everyones favorite EBITDA. EV/EBIDTA goes same for rev but we associate big numbers with high growth and small numbers with boring ass low growth companies. \n\n  EV/EBITDA\n\n* Adyen: 142.55\n* Boku (LON: BOKU): 109.28\n* Paymentus: 86.28\n* Square: 118.13\n* Paypal: 38.50\n* Visa: 30.71\n* Worldline: 22.66\n* **PSFE: 16.97**\n* Euronet Worldwide: 16.74\n* Global Payments Network: 15.69\n* EvoPay: 14.58\n\n  **Conclusion**: Meh, PSFE is fine, they arent psycho growth but not far off from industry leaders.\n\n4. I'm skipping P/E look it up, its obvious. Lets go to something more complicated **Quick Ratio**. If anyone wants, I will draw you a crayon picture of why, but basically this is the companys ability to use cash to pay off liabilities. Since everyone is whining about all their debt and ignoring the fact cash is pretty much free right now. If its 1, that means they can pay off current debts with quick (short term) assets.\n\n* Paymentus: 8.07\n* Visa: 2.00\n* Square: 1.94\n* Paypal: 1.48\n* Adyen: 1.36\n* Boku (LON: BOKU): 1.17\n* Euronet Worldwide: 1.1\n* Worldline: 1.02\n* **PSFE: 0.98**\n* Global Payments Network: 0.6\n\n  **Conclusion**: Suck it up, they can pay their short term debts. Stop whining, PSFE is looking great.\n\n  4. Now, I told myself I'd entertain the **acquisiton/LBO scenario** bc fuck it, someones gotta look at hypotheticals while Paysafe's management sheds billions of dollars in shareholder values. Yes, I know blackstone/cvc own the company pretty much, but youve read this far so whynat. For this one we are looking at the valuation/revenue; its how much the acquiror is paying for the revenue. \n\n* Opayo: 7.4\n* Nets: 10.3\n* Trust Payments: 4.2\n* Cinnober Financial Services: 5.4\n* Prepaid Financial Services: 2.0\n* Fortumo: 6.3\n* Bitstamp: 3.9\n\n  **Conclusion**: I'm getting tired, use your brain on this one. Take the average of all of these acquisitions and apply the multiple to Paysafe. No i didnt look at growth or size or bla bla. Do it yourself if you want to.\n\n  Average Rev Multiple: 6.4\n\n* Paysafe Theoretical Acquisition Target: (1,530 \\* 6.4) = **9.79B** \n* Theoretical Shareprice: (9.79B / 750M shares) = **$13**\n\n**I did this in a shitty mood and pulled numbers from CapIQ and Pitchbook. If they are wrong just DM me and I will ignore it because I dont care. Or maybe I'll get around and fix it. This is basic shit, I'm not smart or pretending to be smart and wont answer your questions. I just wanted to put some data out their while the Paysafe management team is doing nothing for a week and a half before their Q3 earnings call. Peace suckaas**",

We've been researching Square for the past 2 weeks, these are our compiled findings. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1sp1phm14us71.png?width=1122&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dd82ffe277b3d03d17f5749f1920cfd1fe0e4bf\n\n**5-Year Recap**\n\n* Market Cap has increased by 710%\n* Total Revenue has increased by 620%\n* Gross Margin hs decreased by 39%\n* EPS Dilution has increased by 800%\n* P/S Ratio has increased by 30%\n* P/E Ratio N/A\n* P/B Ratio has increased by 133%\n* Total Liabilities have increased by 691%\n* Dividend Yield: 0%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Behind the Company**\n\nSquare is an e-commerce platform for small and large businesses. Square makes it easier for customers to pay for products and services. Square\u2019s biggest product currently is a card reader that enables businesses to offer credit card payments instead of solely using cash. Square owns the popular Cash App which allows users to send payments, receive payments, invest, hold, and buy/sell bitcoin.\n\n**Industry Overview**\n\nThe buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) industry has seen some major growth this past year. There are advantages to using BNPL over credit cards. With BNPL technology, consumers don\u2019t have to worry about their credit scores. This can be seen as both an advantage and disadvantage. If you have a low credit score, you can use Square to avoid taking more hits on your credit. However, you can\u2019t build up your credit score using Square. \n\n**News Timeline**\n\nJuly 20, 2021\\[Source\\]([https://squareup.com/us/en/press/introducing-square-banking](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/introducing-square-banking))\n\nAugust 1, 2021\\[Source\\](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-announces-plans-to-acquire-afterpay)\n\n* Square announces plan to acquire Afterpay\n   * Aimed towards a younger generation\n\nSeptember 20, 2021\\[Source\\]([https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-launches-integrated-omnichannel-solutions-for-businesses-in-france](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-launches-integrated-omnichannel-solutions-for-businesses-in-france))\n\n* Square plans to enter France market\n\nSeptemeber 28, 2021\\[Source\\]([https://finance.yahoo.com/m/14b72cf0-0153-3985-ae1e-4ccf7d198700/square-partners-with-tiktok.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/14b72cf0-0153-3985-ae1e-4ccf7d198700/square-partners-with-tiktok.html))\n\n* Square partners with TikTok\n\n\\[Source\\]([https://www.barrons.com/articles/mastercard-bnpl-payments-affirm-square-51632845187](https://www.barrons.com/articles/mastercard-bnpl-payments-affirm-square-51632845187))\n\n* Mastercard announces plan to enter BNPL market\n\n**Competitors**\n\n* PayPal\n* Fiserv\n* Global Payments\n* Affirm Holdings\n* Shopify \n* Clover\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SQ/SdTObmDK-Square-SQ-Descending-Channel/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SQ/SdTObmDK-Square-SQ-Descending-Channel/)\n\n**Bullish Case**\n\n* BNPL industry has global potential to grow \n* Small business lending is increasing\n* Invested heavily in Bitcoin \n\n**Bearish Case**\n\n* Strong competition in the BNPL industry\n* Speculation of future revenue reliant on Bitcoin\n* Invested heavily in Bitcoin\n\n**Management** \n\nSquare CEO Jack Dorsey is somewhat a prodigy.

Not many CEOs can say they\u2019ve helped build their companies' platforms and helped manage them. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI am concerned about Mastercard\u2019s announcement to enter the BNPL market. I believe that other credit cards and banks will follow suit. Up until now, banks have been slow to respond and are sustaining huge losses because of it. The BNPL market is pretty saturated as it is. The BNPL market as a whole is very expensive (coming from a small investor's POV). Square\u2019s P/B ratio is currently at 40, which indicates that the company might be overvalued. On top of that, Squares Total liabilities, D/E ratio, and Long Term Debt have all seen a sharp increase. Square is aggressively trying to expand by financing its debt. This alone makes me hesitant to invest. I am concerned with Square\u2019s ties to bitcoin. I labeled this as both a bullish and bearish case. Square invested a good chunk of money in bitcoin. That means their reliant on bitcoins performance. If bitcoin goes up, they go up. If bitcoin goes down, they do down. There is a lot of news and government intervention surrounding bitcoin which can either be positive or negative. I do believe the BNPL industry is a growing market, but with more competition entering the market, it will be hard for Square to capture market share. \n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice.

        "selftext": " The **Semiconductor Sector** has generated more than just solid gains so far this year, chip shortage has helped accelerate sales of semiconductors, sending the stock prices of companies that design and sell chips skyrocketing.  \nIn the last couple of weeks, I thought about adding a Semiconductor company to my portfolio, I decided to focus on AMD, NVIDIA, and INTEL, but because it might be a long post I decided to post in parts, the next post will be bot AMD so stay tuned.\n\n**If you think there is a company in this sector more worthwhile looking into, I'd be happy to hear some suggestions.**\n\n[ IMAGE SOURCE: youtube - cha cha video](https://preview.redd.it/avit8vg2dgr71.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a7f6bd2f815eaffa877381a845b1f0061e66ccb)\n\n#  Nvidia ~ $NVDA\n\n&gt;\"Nvidia is a platform story. We think there are many tentacles of future growth opportunity for Nvidia inclusive of the data center momentum that they are seeing today\" - Wells Fargo analyst\n\nNvidia is a big winner of many of the big tech events of the past year, including the global chip shortage, cryptocurrency volatility, and mining, the relentless fight by PC gamers to find RTX 30 series graphics cards in stock, and rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers. During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021.\n\n# Q2 Earnings\n\nAlmost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue \u2014 all those RTX 30 series graphics cards \u2014 hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates.\n\n# Crypto Market dependence\n\nWhen of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company\u2019s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs.\n\nFor Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell **$400 million** worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just **$266 million.**\n\n# Future Growth In the Gaming Segment\n\nNVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates\u00a0that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. \n\n# Arm Deal\n\nNvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it.\n\n# Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD\n\nAMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record\u00a050% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance.\n\n[ IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech](https://preview.redd.it/faswa7u5dgr71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99fdf6382da174aa1c34fff4ffb72dab7abaa7f2)\n\n#  Q2 Earnings And Growth\n\nOn July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform \"Steam\" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded\u00a030%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market.\n\n[ AMD website - q2 Financial results](https://preview.redd.it/jjeh28b8dgr71.png?width=1041&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1194ec52ebd44ff97c9ae9686ff69f63d4787d4b)\n\n#  Video Games Potential Growth\n\nVideo game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from\u00a0last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected\u00a0to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected\u00a0to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024.\n\n**AMD** supplies\u00a0semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for **Nintendo**'s Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell\u00a025.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022.\n\n# Xilinx Acquisition\n\nAMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx\u00a0is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly.\n\n# Intel ~ $INTC\n\nIntel\u2019s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It\u2019s struggled with R&amp;D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%.\n\nIntel fell behind **TSMC** in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to **AMD** in PC and data center CPU markets.\n\n[ IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL](https://preview.redd.it/sxqjttladgr71.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b541cb7bc838e7c7ddb580196ebc1e085bedce22)\n\n#  New CEO = New Future?\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia.\n\nIf Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again.\n\n# GPUs War\n\nIntel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from **Nvidia** and **AMD**, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.\n\n# Financial Comparisons\n\n[Market Size](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/AMD:NVDA:INTC/advanced%20micro%20devices:intel:nvidia/Market%20Cap?ref=nvdastonkssubreddit)\n\n1.

Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***Personal note:*** *Feel free to diagree and express your opinion about the post.*\n\n**Sources:**  \n[Jika.io](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/AMD:NVDA:INTC/advanced%20micro%20devices:intel:nvidia/Revenue?ref=nvdastonkssubreddit) \\- Companies comparisons  \n[Motleyfool.com](https://motleyfool.com/) \\- stocks news  \n[nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com/) \\- news and information  \n[amd.com](https://amd.com/) \\- investor relations  \n[investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/) \\- investor relations",

        "selftext": "Hi, I have a few thoughts on intel and would like some discussion around it. I think it's a great long term value investment right now and would input. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Finances**\n\n- Market Cap: ~220b\n\n- P/E: ~12\n\n- 80b revenue\n\n- 2.58% dividend\n\n- P/E much lower than industry average, and much better than competitors (Intel @12, AMD @36)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Bear case arguments:**\n\n**Failure to deliver**\n\nThe biggest argument I hear against Intel, is that they have failed to deliver, again and again. That it's a value trap and is a slowly sinking ship. AMD is rapidly stealing market share. I will address these with bull points under growth &amp; management below.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Shrinking market share**\n\nTheir % market share has barely declined, yet the market is pricing them as if they had been decimated.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Using TSMC is giving up on its own fabs**\n\nI will address this below, it's actually super bullish for Intel long term and is great for transitioning to their new fabs (under construction).\n\nhttps://www.techradar.com/news/intel-locks-down-all-remaining-tsmc-3nm-production-capacity-boxing-out-amd-and-apple\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Please let me know others, which I will investigate.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Bull case arguments:**\n\n**Good products, high demand, too big to fail**\n\n- There is a global shortage for semiconductors at the moment. Demand is constantly increasing as basically all new devices utilize semiconductors in one way or another. As long as intel can keep building chips, there will be buyers.\n\n- Intel is 'too big to fail' in the USA. The US military and government rely on their chips. They need US factories and companies to build these chips. They are not going to design their military chips in Taiwan, especially with the increased global tensions. The US military alone will continue to prop up intel if things go south.\n\n- Intel still controls ~77.5% of the x86 market share.  \u200bhttps://www.extremetech.com/computing/325848-amd-x86-cpu-market-share-soars-hits-14-year-high\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Growth &amp; management**\n\nThe biggest argument I hear against intel, is that they have been unable to deliver, again and again. That it's a value trap. I argue that it was mainly an issue with management, of which they have a completely changed. It will be a non-issue moving forward.\n\n- Their next gen cpu's (alder lake) leaks suggest that they outperform amd 5950x in both single &amp; multithreaded benchmarks. We will know for sure in early nov (nov 4th, rumoured release date). If true, this hints towards a turnaround already starting and that they are resolving their issues. https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2021/09/27/new-benchmark-leak-reveals-impressive-performance-of-intels-12900k-12700k-and-12600k-alder-lake-processors/ \n\n\n- Intel has basically bought out all of TSMC's 3nm nodes (https://www.techspot.com/news/90780-intel-has-reportedly-secured-majority-tsmc-3nm-production.html). This is insanely good news for the long term outlook of Intel. At a high level, it appears that Intel is giving up on their own fabs and are on the decline. Looking deeper, I strongly disagree. Intel's previous CEO refused to use TSMC or anything beyond their own FABS to save face. They kept digging a deeper and deeper hole and falling further and further behind. Gelsinger (new CEO) acknowledges these issues, and is heavily investing (&gt;$120b) into new FABS, and using TSMC in the meantime to stay relevant, while transitioning to their new fabs.\n\n- Their new fabs are using ASML's next gen tech (ie: ASML's EUV chip-printing machines). Intel will get them before TSMC &amp; Samsung. There have been many closed door meeting between Gelsinger (intels new CEO) and ASML. https://fortune.com/2021/09/10/intel-ceo-big-honking-fab-planned-eu-europe-most-advanced/\n\n&gt; Thanks to an agreement the Intel CEO struck with his immediate counterpart at ASML, whom Gelsinger has already met three times face-to-face in the six months since taking the helm, the Intel facility should be the first to employ the Dutch company\u2019s upcoming \u201chigh numerical aperture\u201d EUV chip-printing machines. (ASML customers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., known as TSMC, and Samsung are on a waiting list, however.)\n\n&gt; This second generation evolution of ASML\u2019s extreme ultraviolet photolithography can reduce the size of transistors\u2014the building blocks of integrated semiconducting circuits\u2014to just 20 angstroms (\u00c5). That would make them less than a third in length of the current seven-nanometer nodes found in many of today\u2019s smartphones. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- Management changed. This is the biggest point for me. They booted out the bean counters, and replaced them with engineers. Gelsinger (new CEO) was the CTO of intel during their glory years and is known as being a super strong / smart engineer. In my opinion, an engineer leading intel is more likely to make the company succeed vs a finance guy trying to cut corners. He is credited with designing some of their flagship cpu's / architectures that made Intel relevant in the first place. He knows what has to be done.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger\n\n- Hopping into the GPU game. Intel is known for having a good integrated graphics team. I would think that they have enough experience to pull off the dedicated gpu. Time will tell. https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-claimed-to-be-officially-targeting-rtx-3070-performance-with-first-alchemist-gpu/\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat are your thoughts? \n\n*Yardsale2*",

        "selftext": "Would Emerging Markets have more potencial for Value return than in Developed Markets?\n\nI am asking not only for individual company investment but especially for ETFs.\n\nI was comparing the to holding of Emerging Markets Value ETFs and the composition are companies like TWN Semicont, Vale, Alibaba, Tencent, Kia Motors, and many banks and their markets seem to have more potencial for growth than developed markets.\n\nDeveloped markets Value ETFs have among their top holding companies like Intel, AT&amp;T, Toyota, Cisco, Pfzer and Britsh American Tabaco. I know they are great Value companies but I feel companies in emerging Markets have much more potencial for growth.\n\nBut I know next to nothing about investment and markets or these companies.
