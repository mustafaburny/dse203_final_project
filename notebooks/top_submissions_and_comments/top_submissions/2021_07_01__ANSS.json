        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, July 13, 2021**\n\nToday was quite action-packed, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) once again recording a fresh intraday high for the second time this week before turning lower towards the end of the session. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, performed the worst, falling 1.75% at the time of writing. Market participants are digesting the beginning of Q2 earning season and a new report that showed in June, consumer prices have surged by the most since 2008.\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s June Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May\u2019s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year\u2019s pandemic-era lows.\n\nWhile the CPI print is not ideal, the market\u2019s somewhat muted reaction (though there was a little volatility) seems to confirm that market participants are increasingly pricing in higher-than-expected inflationary data and are buying into the Federal Reserve\u2019s argument that current pressures are transitory and due to pandemic-related disruptions. Moreover, it is very important to consider that current inflationary data is calculated on a year-on-year basis, so base effects are very much inflating the current numbers. In other words, inflationary readings are high because they are being measured using numbers from June 2020 when prices across the board collapsed as lockdowns and social distancing policies were implemented across the world. As I have said many times in the past, I am personally not yet worried about current inflationary pressures translating into a prolonged cycle of higher prices, though one always has to acknowledge the risks in the market and be prepared to act. \n\nIn other news, Q2 earnings seasons kicked off today, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) both reporting today, as well as Pepsi (PEP). JP Morgan, which is often considered a bellwether for the US economy given its sheer size, reported great results, driven in part by the release of $3 billion the bank had set aside to protect against potential losses from default loans during the pandemic, a sign that consumers held up better than the bank expected. JPM recorded revenues of $31.4 billion and profits of $11.948 billion, a staggering improvement from profits of $4.687 billion a year ago. One downside from the earnings report is a sharp reduction in revenues produced from trading, which is not surprising given the insane run by the market in 2020. \n\nThis quarter, earnings for companies in the SPY are expected to grow by 64% year-on-year, according to FactSet, which would mark the fastest rate of earnings growth since the fourth quarter of 2009, when the US was emerging from the 11.948 housing-bubble induced recession. \n\nA big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to Q2 2020, a period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 2021 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.\n\nGoldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market participants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions? (2) How are companies planning to prioritize cash spending? (3) How will companies deal with policy uncertainties, especially surrounding a potential tax hike?\n\nIn addition to earnings season, market participants are also looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell giving his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Analysts are expecting Powell to once again strike a dovish tone (meaning unlikely to take aggressive action against inflation and instead favor employment), given the mixed June Job Report, which saw a better than expected number of jobs added to the economy but the unemployment rate tick higher and last week\u2019s meeting minutes which showed an increasing divide between members regarding the timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing. In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, a unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Disney (DIS) outperformed the market again today thanks to the great success of Marvel\u2019s \u201cBlack Widow\u201d, which generated $80 billion in theater sales and $60 billion in streaming sales, the best domestic opening for a movie since the pandemic began. \n* Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk defended the electric-vehicle maker's purchase of SolarCity Corp. in court, telling a Delaware judge that he didn't act improperly during the negotiating process. This comes in response to a lawsuit filed by TSLA shareholders that allege Musk forced the company to buy SolarCity, a solar-cell manufacturer, in order to save his investment in the company.\n* Netflix and Universal have reached a licensing deal that will see more Universal movies, including animated pictures from DreamWorks, available on its streaming platform. \n* Despite successfully completing the company's first trip with Richard Branson as a passenger, shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) remain under pressure after the company announced it planned to take advantage of the elevated stock price by selling $500 million in stock, with the stock down roughly 25% from Friday\u2019s prices. \n* Broadcom (AVGO) is reportedly in talks to buy the SAS Institute, a software company with upwards of $3 billion a year in revenue in a deal valued between $15-$20 billion. This is yet another acquisition by one of the world\u2019s largest semiconductor companies.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it was acquiring cybersecurity firm RiskIQ to help reduce risk amid \u201cthe increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks\u201d.\n* SolarWinds says that unknown hackers exploited a previously unknown flaw in two of its programs to go after \"a limited, targeted set of customers.\" The company went on to say the hack was \u201ccompletely unrelated\u201d to last year\u2019s attack\u201d and that the company was still \u201cunaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers\u201d. Seems like hackers find it easy to attack this company. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* AutoDesk (ADSK) target raised by Mizuho from $335 to $355 at Buy.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, July 12, 2021**\n\nAfter a spurt in volatility last Thursday, stocks have shaken off any jitteriness, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again powering to fresh intraday records today. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for Q2 earnings season to begin tomorrow, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), reporting results and Jerome Powell\u2019s testimony before Congress later this week.\n\nWith Q2 earnings are fast approaching, market participants are gearing up for what is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data \u2013 an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be \"need to be revised higher.\" This would represent a sharp acceleration from the 50% year-on-year growth recorded during Q1\u2019s earnings season.\n\nA big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to the year-earlier period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.\n\nGoldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market pariticpants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions?

In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, an unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.\n\nKathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, \u201cI think the recovery is on track, it\u2019s really just the rate of change that has slowed. We couldn\u2019t continue to grow at 9-10% GDP growth every quarter, so obviously it\u2019s going to slow down. I think one of the things that got into markets that got \\[Treasury\\] yields tumbling was maybe the fact that the Fed was going to hike rates sooner than anticipated. That sends a signal to the long end of the bond market that maybe the Fed isn;t going to tolerate higher inflation for longer and that they\u2019re going to step on the brakes sooner rather than later ... we don't think that's going to be the case though. We think the economy is doing well, yields will probably bounce back.\" I agree with this sentiment. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Over the weekend, Richard Branson became the first civilian to go to space with his own company Virgin Galactic (SPCE), a remarkable milestone as companies like Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin and Musk\u2019s SpaceX intensify competition in space tourism.\n* Despite successfully completing the trip, shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) fell more than 10% after the company announced it planned to take advantage of the elevated stock price by selling $500 million in stock.\n* Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk on Monday defended the electric-vehicle maker's purchase of SolarCity Corp. in court, telling a Delaware judge that he didn't act improperly during the negotiating process. This comes in response to a lawsuit filed by TSLA shareholders that allege Musk forced the company to buy SolarCity, a solar-cell manufacturer, in order to save his investment in the company. Frankly, this lawsuit seems a little ridiculous to me given SolarCity has proven a smart acquisition.\n* Walt Disney (DIS) said on Sunday that \u201cBlack Widow\u201d, the newest Marvel movie, made $80 million in theater sales, the largest domestic opening weekend since \u201cStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\u201d in 2019, a strong sign that appetite to go to the movies remains high among Americans. Comparatively, \u201cBlack Widow\u201d made $60 million through streaming purchases.\n* In yet another crackdown of big-tech companies, Chinese regulators are reportedly set to order Tencent (TCEHY) to give up their exclusive rights to music labels and pay a small fine.\n* Broadcom (AVGO) is reportedly in talks to by SAS Institute, a software company with upwards of $3 billion a year in revenue in a deal valued between $15-$20 billion. This is yet another acquisition by one of the world\u2019s largest semiconductor companies.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it was acquiring cybersecurity firm RiskIQ to help reduce risk amid \u201cthe increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks\u201d.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Abbott Laboratories (ABT) target raised by Wells Fargo from $125 to $135 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 2, 2021**\n\nStocks rose once again, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) both recording new intraday highs amid the continued push by technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA) rose as well, but continued to lag behind the other two indexes. Market participants are encouraged by the June Jobs Report, which showed payroll gains rise more than expected. \n\nToday, the US Department of Labor released the Job June report, which showed a stronger-than-expected acceleration in hiring, with non-farm payrolls rising by 850,000, the sixth straight month of gains. The unemployment rate however, ticked slightly higher to 5.9%. Here are the numbers\n\n* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** 850,000 vs. 720,000 expected and an upwardly revised 583,000 in May\n* **Unemployment rate:** 5.9% vs. 5.6% expected and 5.8% in May \n* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.3% vs. 0.3% expected and a downwardly revised 0.4% in May\n* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 3.6% vs. 3.6% expected and a downwardly revised 1.9% in May\n\nPresident Biden said of the report, \u201cThis is historic progress, pulling our economy out of the worst crisis in 100 years, driven in part by our dramatic progress in vaccinating our nation and beating back the pandemic. Today, the US is the only major advanced economy where the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) projections of future output are higher today than they were in January 2020 before the pandemic hit.\u201d\n\nEmily Roland, co-Chief Investment Strategist at John Hancock Investment Management said of the report, \u201cThis is the Goldilocks Report that the market was looking for today. You had a nice print here of 850,000 jobs being added, wage pressure remaining \u2013 I wouldn't call them necessarily contained \u2013 but surprising here on the downside versus consensus estimates. So this is telling us right now that economic growth is continuing to accelerate here, the jobs market is continuing to heal. We're making progress here in terms of what the Fed has set out to do, which is in order to get unemployment down, they're going to let inflation run a little bit hot here. Not too hot, not too cold \u2013 this is just what the market wants.\"\n\nThis Job Report will give market participants a better idea as to the timing of the Federal Reserve\u2019s next monetary policy. For now, the Fed has so far kept in place both of its key pandemic-era policies - quantitative easing at a clip of $120 billion a month and near-zero interest rates. However, the Fed has consistently said they are looking for a \u201cstring\u201d of strong jobs reports, like the one this month before any adjustments to the current policy is made. If the Jobs Report continues being especially strong in the months ahead, it could force the Fed to taper quantitative easing earlier than originally telegraphed. I have said  before in the past I expect the Fed to begin tapering QE towards the end of the year and am not worried about that at all. For starters, the market has historically reacted very little to changes in QE ([see the 2013 Taper Tantrum here)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp), it\u2019s changes in the interest rate that really drive the market, and second, the Fed is expected to taper slowly, making any changes gradual.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of AMC pulled back slightly after financial firm Iceberg Research announced they have opened a short position. Honestly, I have no idea why they did this, only opening themselves up to becoming WSB's next target. Will be interesting to see what happens moving forward.\n* More bad news for Lordstown Motors, who have already been the subject of a short report that saw the company admit they had inflated the importance of preorders for the electric pickup truck and forced the CEO to leave. Now, the Justice Department has announced it is opening a probe into the company to investigate comments made by executives and the way the company represented its pre orders to shareholders. The whole EV market was down today in sympathy. \n* Tesla (TSLA) recorded its fifth straight quarter of vehicle delivery growth. In Q2, the company delivered 201,250 vehicles, missing expectations for 204,160, according to Bloomberg consensus data**,** but more than double the 90,891 vehicles delivered in the same period a year ago.\n* The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a proposed consent order to settle antitrust charges against semiconductor maker Broadcom Inc, the agency said in a statement on Friday. The consent order requires Broadcom to stop demanding that its customers buy components mostly or only from Broadcom. The company responded, \u201cWhile we disagree that our actions violated the law and disagree with the FTC\u2019s characterizations of our business, we look forward to putting this matter behind us.\"\n* Jeff Bezos is officially stepping down as Amazon CEO on Monday. Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassey will be taking over for him. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Anthem (ANTM) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $454 to $459.

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TSLA** and **AMZN** saved my ass today, otherwise I seriously doubt I would have been in profit, nor did I deserve to be in profit. Still have some bad habits I need to get rid of \u2013 including, but not limited to \u2013 vaping, pharmaceuticals, gambling, a messiah complex, a love of Barry Manilow songs, and a new addiction to chocolate pudding (more on that later).\n\nI entered the day today holding several low float stocks that just slowly suck the life out of you. I really wanted to get rid them \u2013 I was somewhat successful at that.\n\nAs usual, all trades were posted live, here is the link to today\u2019s \u201cplay-by-play\u201d:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/oksy42/time\\_to\\_go\\_to\\_work\\_trades\\_715/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/oksy42/time_to_go_to_work_trades_715/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n***All times are in PST, West Coast of the U.S.***\n\nMy first trade of the day was a *Put Debit Spread* on **WDAY**. Why do a *PDS* instead of straight Puts? Because the day had just started, and while I wanted to capitalize on the bearish price action in the stock, I also did not know what **SPY** was planning to do or how **WDAY** would react to any changes in the market. Besides, it seems really fancy to start with an option spread. \n\n**WDAY \u2013** CDS 230/225 (6:46am) for a $2 Debit \u2013/ Closed for $2.55 Credit (7:45am) \u2013 *Profit of .55 per contract.*\n\n*At this point (6:53am) I added to* ***ATOS****, a stock I was still holding. At 6:53am I added more shares for $6.67, bring my average price on* ***ATOS*** *to $6.46.* *This turned out to be a brilliant move on my part as* ***ATOS*** *continued to drop.* \n\nNext up was **AZN** the vaccine that protects against everything except the dominant variant out right now apparently. Stock was weak to the market, but had what I thought to be support at $57.55 (the SMA 50), I thought wrong, as **AZN** blew right through that level later in the day. Should have stuck with this one.\n\n**AZN \u2013** Short $58.08 (7:23am) / Closed at $57.88 (7:52am) \u2013 *Profit of .20 cents* *per share.*\n\n*Managed to scratch my* ***AAPL*** *calls from yesterday at 7:32am.* *Even though I could have taken profit on these calls at the open, I am still happy that I got out at breakeven.*\n\nI was missing the cheap stocks, and **VERB** caught my eye, and once those cheap stocks catch my eye, I am probably buying something, and a lot of it. This once is not a \u201clow float\u201d stock, and actually has a decent daily chart on it. So don\u2019t be lumping **VERB** in with all those other harlots! **VERB** is better than that! \n\n**VERB \u2013** Long $3.05 (7:36am) / Closed at $3.14 (8:03am) \u2013 *Profit of .06 cents per share.*\n\nI broke my rule with **RIDE** and when you break your own rules in Day Trading you usually pay for it (literally). This was no exception. **RIDE** has a terrible looking daily chart, and as such, I should not have taken the trade. And then to make matters worse, I averaged down, repeatedly. And now I have to live with myself as I sit here and think about what I\u2019ve done.\n\n**RIDE** \\- Long $9.02 (7:58am, 8:06am, 8:58am, 10:51am) / Closed at $8.84 \u2013 *Loss of .28 cents per share.*\n\nNow I am looking at red day due to all the bags I am holding, not happy with myself over the **RIDE** trade, and going into a dark place where all I wanted was to put on some Barry Manilow and eat chocolate pudding cups. But did I? No! Because along came **TSLA** dropping through its\u2019 SMA 100 like a spoon through the before-mentioned pudding**!**\n\n**TSLA** \u2013 Short $653.52 \u2013 Puts (8:04am) / Closed at $644.85 \u2013 *Profit of $4.15 per contract.*\n\nOut of my temporary funk and ready to make more money, I notice that nobody wants toys anymore! Or rather, nobody can get the toys out of China anymore! Either way, **HAS** was dropping fast.\n\n**HAS \u2013** Short 95.59 (8:14am) / Closed at $95.34 (8:41am) \u2013 *Profit of .25 cents per share.* \n\nClearly, I was in way too good of a mood because my next trade might as well be called, \u201cHow can I give some of this back, quickly?\u201d **AMKR** pops on a takeover rumor, but I did not wait to see if the green bar would hold. Literally Day Trading 101 and I screwed it up. Back to singing Mandy, and chocolate pudding for me.\n\n**AMKR \u2013** Long $23.44 (8:39am) / Closed at $22.38 (10:06am) \u2013 *Loss of $1.06*\n\nWelcome to the first bag-holder of the day section of this update. Although I do not mind holding this bag \u2013 **RCL**. The stock is very bearish, weak against **SPY** on the daily chart, but for some reason found some late day strength. I am staying with this trade until it turns green because it will.\n\n**RCL \u2013** Short $73.23 (10:04am) / Still holding \u2013 Stock currently at $74.21\n\nWe are not done with the bag-holders \u2013 so here is another one \u2013 **UNH.** Once again, I do not mind this one. Great response to earnings, through resistance and closing in on its all-time-high, which means there are not many traders holding bags on this ticker, except me of course.\n\n**UNH \u2013** Long $421.30 \u2013 Calls (10:24am) / Still holding \u2013 Stock currently at $420.05\n\n*Add some, lose some \u2013 decided to get rid of one of my losers from the other day,* ***WHLM****, which I average to $6.70 (10:28am) and then finally closed it.* *Loss - .95 cents* \n\nHere is the trade of the day! **CIDM!!**\n\n**CIDM \u2013** Long $1.44 (10:30am) / Scratched at $1.44 (10:30am)\n\nMoved on from the pudding, now I am eyeing a bag of marshmallows, Mandy is on repeat, things are getting dark again. And what do we do when things get dark? **TSLA!**\n\n**TSLA \u2013** Short $644.21 - Puts (10:32am) / Closed $638.70 (11:02am) \u2013 *Profit $4.85 per contract*\n\nLooking for a short, I find **COIN**, sorry Aunt Cathie but your stock is looking sad. Sure, I am holding it, but like the other two, I do not mind, because **COIN** is bearish, and *extremely* weak to the market. **SPY** could be way up tomorrow, and **COIN** will still be red. \n\n**COIN \u2013** Short $220.66 (10:44am) / Still Holding \u2013 Stock currently at $224.63\n\nHopped up on Snack Packs I needed a trade to bring me back down to earth, so that says **HD** to me! Maybe I\u2019ll look at **BBBY** next, who knows, *I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll have that kind of time!* Strong against SPY? Check. Good volume? Check. Looking to break out of Daily compression? Sure, why not.\n\n**HD \u2013** Long $322.15 - Calls (11:06am) / Closed $322.65 \u2013 *Profit $.50 per contract.*\n\nFor some reason I thought I needed to short more cruise ships, which is stupid, because why would anyone have two cruise stocks at the same time? Well, you ignore basic cruise duplication rule, you pay the price. I did.\n\n**NCLH \u2013** Short 23.80 (11:38am) / Closed at $24.20 (11:56am) \u2013 *Loss of .40 cents per share.*\n\nMy favorite stock to short is **AMZN**. I love using it as a hedge, and I love seeing it go down. It isn\u2019t like I have something against **AMZN**, I don\u2019t, I use them all the time actually. I just like shorting it, so when I can, I will \u2013 and I could, and I did.\n\n**AMZN \u2013** Short $3636.99 (11:55am) / Closed at $3626.30 (12:45pm) \u2013 *Profit of $7.80 per contract.*\n\nAs the day began to wind down, I was able to take advantage of a play I missed earlier. And I missed it because I was screwing around with those cheap ass stocks while wallowing in my chocolate pudding! I did not miss it this time. **SAVA** was weak against the market all day, has a clear HA reversal on the daily charts, and a long way to go before it hits any kind of support.\n\n**SAVA \u2013** Short $83.18 (12:26pm) / Closed at $81.78 (12:42pm) \u2013 *Profit of $1.40 per contract.*\n\nNaturally, I couldn\u2019t help myself and took **VERB** again, but I really do like the stock and plan on holding it. I know, I know, don\u2019t get attached, right? But I dunno, there\u2019s something about **VERB**\u2026..\n\n**VERB \u2013** Long $3.21 (12:47pm) / Still Holding \u2013 Stock currently at $3.26\n\nI also jumped back into **RCAT**, I just felt it had more to give after I let it go so quickly before. Quick scalp to end the day.\n\n**RCAT \u2013** Long $5.03 (12:48pm) / Closed at $5.11 (12:50pm) \u2013 *Profit of .08 cents per share.*\n\n***AAL*** *(12:47pm) \u2013 it was time to let it go.* *No reason other than I still had way too many positions on.* *Loss - .90 cents a share.*\n\n***NEGG,*** *I averaged down to a cost per share of $29.74, and it ended the day not doing a damn thing, but I plan on holding this until it pops back up again.*\n\n***In After Hours, I did two trades:***\n\n**FUBO \u2013** Long $27.21 (1:13pm/1:30pm) / Closed at $27.38 (1:52pm) \u2013 *Profit of .17 cents per share.*\n\n**MRNA \u2013** Long $274.63 (2:24pm, 2:31pm, 2:44pm) / Closed at $275.63 (3:22pm) \u2013 *Profit of $1 per share.*\n\n***For today:***\n\n*Wins:* ***12***\n\n*Losses:* ***3***\n\n*Scratches:* ***1***\n\n*Holds:* ***4***\n\n***For the past three days:***\n\n*Wins:* ***33***\n\n*Losses:* ***10***\n\n*Scratches:* ***11***\n\n*Holds:* ***8***\n\n***Profit:***\n\n*On Day 1 (Tuesday) my overall profit was:* ***1.3%***\n\n*On Day 2 (Wednesday) my overall profit was:* ***.8%***\n\n*Today my overall profit was:* ***2.8%*** \n\n***Current Holds:***\n\n**ATOS (long) - $6.46,** currently at $**5.67 \u2013** ***down .69 cents per share.*** ***Mental Stop - $5.25***\n\n**RCL (short) - $73.23,** currently at **$74.21 \u2013** ***down .98 cents per share, Mental Stop - $76.05***\n\n**UNH (long) - $421.30**, currently at **$420.05 \u2013** ***down $1.25 per share, Mental Stop - $415.95***\n\n**COIN (short) - $220.66,** currently at **$224.63 \u2013** ***down $3.97 per share, Mental Stop - $229.25***\n\n**VERB (long) - $3.21,** currently at **$3.26 \u2013** ***up .05 cents per share, Mental Stop - $2.75***\n\n**NEGG (long) - $29.84,** currently at **$26.20 \u2013** ***down $3.64 per share, Mental Stop - $19.75***\n\n**CRTD (long) - $5.03,** currently at **$3.50 -** ***down $1.53 per share, Mental Stop - $3.30***\n\n**WORX (long) - $3.68,** currently at **$2.41 \u2013** ***down $1.27 per share, Mental Stop - $2.35*** \n\n**OSTK (long) - $102.05,** currently at *$****86.33 \u2013 down $15.72 per share, Mental Stop \u2013 None\\**** \n\n*\\*these are ITM calls that expire in August.*\n\n***I also have AMZN puts, PFE calls, and a useless AVGO Call Debit Spread that will expire tomorrow at Max Loss.***\n\n*Keep in mind, I trade for a living, therefore the \u201cnumbers\u201d I care most about are the monthly averages for:*\n\n***Win Rate %, # of Trades Per Day and Profit Per Trade***\n\nEvery Professional Day Trader is different, some have a lower number of trades a day, but a much higher average profit for example.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, July 12, 2021**\n\nAfter a spurt in volatility last Thursday, stocks have shaken off any jitteriness, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again powering to fresh intraday records today. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for Q2 earnings season to begin tomorrow, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), reporting results and Jerome Powell\u2019s testimony before Congress later this week.\n\nWith Q2 earnings are fast approaching, market participants are gearing up for what is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data \u2013 an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be \"need to be revised higher.\" This would represent a sharp acceleration from the 50% year-on-year growth recorded during Q1\u2019s earnings season.\n\nA big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to the year-earlier period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.\n\nGoldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market pariticpants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions? (2) How are companies planning to prioritize cash spending? (3) How will companies deal with policy uncertainties, especially surrounding a potential tax hike?\n\nIn addition to earnings season, market participants are also looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell giving his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Analysts are expecting Powell to once again strike a dovish tone (meaning unlikely to take aggressive action against inflation and instead favor employment), given the mixed June Job Report, which saw a better than expected number of jobs added to the economy but the unemployment rate tick higher and last week\u2019s meeting minutes which showed an increasing divide between members regarding the timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing. In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, a unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.\n\nKathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, \u201cI think the recovery is on track, it\u2019s really just the rate of change that has slowed. We couldn\u2019t continue to grow at 9-10% GDP growth every quarter, so obviously it\u2019s going to slow down. I think one of the things that got into markets that got \\[Treasury\\] yields tumbling was maybe the fact that the Fed was going to hike rates sooner than anticipated. That sends a signal to the long end of the bond market that maybe the Fed isn;t going to tolerate higher inflation for longer and that they\u2019re going to step on the brakes sooner rather than later ... we don't think that's going to be the case though. We think the economy is doing well, yields will probably bounce back.\" I agree with this sentiment. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Over the weekend, Richard Branson became the first civilian to go to space with his own company Virgin Galactic (SPCE), a remarkable milestone as companies like Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin and Musk\u2019s SpaceX intensify competition in space tourism.\n* Despite successfully completing the trip, shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) fell more than 10% after the company announced it planned to take advantage of the elevated stock price by selling $500 million in stock.\n* Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk on Monday defended the electric-vehicle maker's purchase of SolarCity Corp. in court, telling a Delaware judge that he didn't act improperly during the negotiating process. This comes in response to a lawsuit filed by TSLA shareholders that allege Musk forced the company to buy SolarCity, a solar-cell manufacturer, in order to save his investment in the company. Frankly, this lawsuit seems a little ridiculous to me given SolarCity has proven a smart acquisition.\n* Walt Disney (DIS) said on Sunday that \u201cBlack Widow\u201d, the newest Marvel movie, made $80 million in theater sales, the largest domestic opening weekend since \u201cStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\u201d in 2019, a strong sign that appetite to go to the movies remains high among Americans. Comparatively, \u201cBlack Widow\u201d made $60 million through streaming purchases.\n* In yet another crackdown of big-tech companies, Chinese regulators are reportedly set to order Tencent (TCEHY) to give up their exclusive rights to music labels and pay a small fine.\n* Broadcom (AVGO) is reportedly in talks to by SAS Institute, a software company with upwards of $3 billion a year in revenue in a deal valued between $15-$20 billion. This is yet another acquisition by one of the world\u2019s largest semiconductor companies.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it was acquiring cybersecurity firm RiskIQ to help reduce risk amid \u201cthe increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks\u201d.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Abbott Laboratories (ABT) target raised by Wells Fargo from $125 to $135 at Overweight.

Amon has a good track record. He's been in the industry for a long time while holding multiple leadership roles. Qualcomm might be his biggest leadership role yet.

The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Disclaimer:*\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice\\*\\**\n\n*\\*\\*Do your own research\\*\\**",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, July 13, 2021**\n\nToday was quite action-packed, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) once again recording a fresh intraday high for the second time this week before turning lower towards the end of the session. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, performed the worst, falling 1.75% at the time of writing. Market participants are digesting the beginning of Q2 earning season and a new report that showed in June, consumer prices have surged by the most since 2008.\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s June Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May\u2019s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year\u2019s pandemic-era lows.\n\nWhile the CPI print is not ideal, the market\u2019s somewhat muted reaction (though there was a little volatility) seems to confirm that market participants are increasingly pricing in higher-than-expected inflationary data and are buying into the Federal Reserve\u2019s argument that current pressures are transitory and due to pandemic-related disruptions. Moreover, it is very important to consider that current inflationary data is calculated on a year-on-year basis, so base effects are very much inflating the current numbers. In other words, inflationary readings are high because they are being measured using numbers from June 2020 when prices across the board collapsed as lockdowns and social distancing policies were implemented across the world. As I have said many times in the past, I am personally not yet worried about current inflationary pressures translating into a prolonged cycle of higher prices, though one always has to acknowledge the risks in the market and be prepared to act. \n\nIn other news, Q2 earnings seasons kicked off today, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) both reporting today, as well as Pepsi (PEP). JP Morgan, which is often considered a bellwether for the US economy given its sheer size, reported great results, driven in part by the release of $3 billion the bank had set aside to protect against potential losses from default loans during the pandemic, a sign that consumers held up better than the bank expected. JPM recorded revenues of $31.4 billion and profits of $11.948 billion, a staggering improvement from profits of $4.687 billion a year ago. One downside from the earnings report is a sharp reduction in revenues produced from trading, which is not surprising given the insane run by the market in 2020. \n\nThis quarter, earnings for companies in the SPY are expected to grow by 64% year-on-year, according to FactSet, which would mark the fastest rate of earnings growth since the fourth quarter of 2009, when the US was emerging from the 11.948 housing-bubble induced recession. \n\nA big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to Q2 2020, a period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 2021 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.\n\nGoldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market participants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions? (2) How are companies planning to prioritize cash spending? (3) How will companies deal with policy uncertainties, especially surrounding a potential tax hike?\n\nIn addition to earnings season, market participants are also looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell giving his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Analysts are expecting Powell to once again strike a dovish tone (meaning unlikely to take aggressive action against inflation and instead favor employment), given the mixed June Job Report, which saw a better than expected number of jobs added to the economy but the unemployment rate tick higher and last week\u2019s meeting minutes which showed an increasing divide between members regarding the timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing. In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, a unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Disney (DIS) outperformed the market again today thanks to the great success of Marvel\u2019s \u201cBlack Widow\u201d, which generated $80 billion in theater sales and $60 billion in streaming sales, the best domestic opening for a movie since the pandemic began. \n* Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk defended the electric-vehicle maker's purchase of SolarCity Corp. in court, telling a Delaware judge that he didn't act improperly during the negotiating process. This comes in response to a lawsuit filed by TSLA shareholders that allege Musk forced the company to buy SolarCity, a solar-cell manufacturer, in order to save his investment in the company.\n* Netflix and Universal have reached a licensing deal that will see more Universal movies, including animated pictures from DreamWorks, available on its streaming platform. \n* Despite successfully completing the company's first trip with Richard Branson as a passenger, shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) remain under pressure after the company announced it planned to take advantage of the elevated stock price by selling $500 million in stock, with the stock down roughly 25% from Friday\u2019s prices. \n* Broadcom (AVGO) is reportedly in talks to buy the SAS Institute, a software company with upwards of $3 billion a year in revenue in a deal valued between $15-$20 billion. This is yet another acquisition by one of the world\u2019s largest semiconductor companies.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it was acquiring cybersecurity firm RiskIQ to help reduce risk amid \u201cthe increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks\u201d.\n* SolarWinds says that unknown hackers exploited a previously unknown flaw in two of its programs to go after \"a limited, targeted set of customers.\" The company went on to say the hack was \u201ccompletely unrelated\u201d to last year\u2019s attack\u201d and that the company was still \u201cunaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers\u201d. Seems like hackers find it easy to attack this company. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* AutoDesk (ADSK) target raised by Mizuho from $335 to $355 at Buy.

        "selftext": "  \n\n**TSLA** and **AMZN** saved my ass today, otherwise I seriously doubt I would have been in profit, nor did I deserve to be in profit. Still have some bad habits I need to get rid of \u2013 including, but not limited to \u2013 vaping, pharmaceuticals, gambling, a messiah complex, a love of Barry Manilow songs, and a new addiction to chocolate pudding (more on that later).\n\nI entered the day today holding several low float stocks that just slowly suck the life out of you. I really wanted to get rid them \u2013 I was somewhat successful at that.\n\nAs usual, all trades were posted live, here is the link to today\u2019s \u201cplay-by-play\u201d:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/oksy42/time\\_to\\_go\\_to\\_work\\_trades\\_715/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/oksy42/time_to_go_to_work_trades_715/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n***All times are in PST, West Coast of the U.S.***\n\nMy first trade of the day was a *Put Debit Spread* on **WDAY**. Why do a *PDS* instead of straight Puts? Because the day had just started, and while I wanted to capitalize on the bearish price action in the stock, I also did not know what **SPY** was planning to do or how **WDAY** would react to any changes in the market. Besides, it seems really fancy to start with an option spread. \n\n**WDAY \u2013** CDS 230/225 (6:46am) for a $2 Debit \u2013/ Closed for $2.55 Credit (7:45am) \u2013 *Profit of .55 per contract.*\n\n*At this point (6:53am) I added to* ***ATOS****, a stock I was still holding. At 6:53am I added more shares for $6.67, bring my average price on* ***ATOS*** *to $6.46.* *This turned out to be a brilliant move on my part as* ***ATOS*** *continued to drop.* \n\nNext up was **AZN** the vaccine that protects against everything except the dominant variant out right now apparently. Stock was weak to the market, but had what I thought to be support at $57.55 (the SMA 50), I thought wrong, as **AZN** blew right through that level later in the day. Should have stuck with this one.\n\n**AZN \u2013** Short $58.08 (7:23am) / Closed at $57.88 (7:52am) \u2013 *Profit of .20 cents* *per share.*\n\n*Managed to scratch my* ***AAPL*** *calls from yesterday at 7:32am.* *Even though I could have taken profit on these calls at the open, I am still happy that I got out at breakeven.*\n\nI was missing the cheap stocks, and **VERB** caught my eye, and once those cheap stocks catch my eye, I am probably buying something, and a lot of it. This once is not a \u201clow float\u201d stock, and actually has a decent daily chart on it. So don\u2019t be lumping **VERB** in with all those other harlots! **VERB** is better than that! \n\n**VERB \u2013** Long $3.05 (7:36am) / Closed at $3.14 (8:03am) \u2013 *Profit of .06 cents per share.*\n\nI broke my rule with **RIDE** and when you break your own rules in Day Trading you usually pay for it (literally). This was no exception. **RIDE** has a terrible looking daily chart, and as such, I should not have taken the trade. And then to make matters worse, I averaged down, repeatedly. And now I have to live with myself as I sit here and think about what I\u2019ve done.\n\n**RIDE** \\- Long $9.02 (7:58am, 8:06am, 8:58am, 10:51am) / Closed at $8.84 \u2013 *Loss of .28 cents per share.*\n\nNow I am looking at red day due to all the bags I am holding, not happy with myself over the **RIDE** trade, and going into a dark place where all I wanted was to put on some Barry Manilow and eat chocolate pudding cups. But did I? No! Because along came **TSLA** dropping through its\u2019 SMA 100 like a spoon through the before-mentioned pudding**!**\n\n**TSLA** \u2013 Short $653.52 \u2013 Puts (8:04am) / Closed at $644.85 \u2013 *Profit of $4.15 per contract.*\n\nOut of my temporary funk and ready to make more money, I notice that nobody wants toys anymore! Or rather, nobody can get the toys out of China anymore! Either way, **HAS** was dropping fast.\n\n**HAS \u2013** Short 95.59 (8:14am) / Closed at $95.34 (8:41am) \u2013 *Profit of .25 cents per share.* \n\nClearly, I was in way too good of a mood because my next trade might as well be called, \u201cHow can I give some of this back, quickly?\u201d **AMKR** pops on a takeover rumor, but I did not wait to see if the green bar would hold. Literally Day Trading 101 and I screwed it up. Back to singing Mandy, and chocolate pudding for me.\n\n**AMKR \u2013** Long $23.44 (8:39am) / Closed at $22.38 (10:06am) \u2013 *Loss of $1.06*\n\nWelcome to the first bag-holder of the day section of this update. Although I do not mind holding this bag \u2013 **RCL**. The stock is very bearish, weak against **SPY** on the daily chart, but for some reason found some late day strength. I am staying with this trade until it turns green because it will.\n\n**RCL \u2013** Short $73.23 (10:04am) / Still holding \u2013 Stock currently at $74.21\n\nWe are not done with the bag-holders \u2013 so here is another one \u2013 **UNH.** Once again, I do not mind this one. Great response to earnings, through resistance and closing in on its all-time-high, which means there are not many traders holding bags on this ticker, except me of course.\n\n**UNH \u2013** Long $421.30 \u2013 Calls (10:24am) / Still holding \u2013 Stock currently at $420.05\n\n*Add some, lose some \u2013 decided to get rid of one of my losers from the other day,* ***WHLM****, which I average to $6.70 (10:28am) and then finally closed it.* *Loss - .95 cents* \n\nHere is the trade of the day! **CIDM!!**\n\n**CIDM \u2013** Long $1.44 (10:30am) / Scratched at $1.44 (10:30am)\n\nMoved on from the pudding, now I am eyeing a bag of marshmallows, Mandy is on repeat, things are getting dark again. And what do we do when things get dark? **TSLA!**\n\n**TSLA \u2013** Short $644.21 - Puts (10:32am) / Closed $638.70 (11:02am) \u2013 *Profit $4.85 per contract*\n\nLooking for a short, I find **COIN**, sorry Aunt Cathie but your stock is looking sad. Sure, I am holding it, but like the other two, I do not mind, because **COIN** is bearish, and *extremely* weak to the market. **SPY** could be way up tomorrow, and **COIN** will still be red. \n\n**COIN \u2013** Short $220.66 (10:44am) / Still Holding \u2013 Stock currently at $224.63\n\nHopped up on Snack Packs I needed a trade to bring me back down to earth, so that says **HD** to me! Maybe I\u2019ll look at **BBBY** next, who knows, *I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll have that kind of time!* Strong against SPY? Check. Good volume? Check. Looking to break out of Daily compression? Sure, why not.\n\n**HD \u2013** Long $322.15 - Calls (11:06am) / Closed $322.65 \u2013 *Profit $.50 per contract.*\n\n*Managed to scratch BBIG (11:13am) from Tuesday, and of course it ran up right after I scratched it.*\n\nFor some reason I thought I needed to short more cruise ships, which is stupid, because why would anyone have two cruise stocks at the same time? Well, you ignore basic cruise duplication rule, you pay the price. I did.\n\n**NCLH \u2013** Short 23.80 (11:38am) / Closed at $24.20 (11:56am) \u2013 *Loss of .40 cents per share.*\n\nMy favorite stock to short is **AMZN**. I love using it as a hedge, and I love seeing it go down. It isn\u2019t like I have something against **AMZN**, I don\u2019t, I use them all the time actually. I just like shorting it, so when I can, I will \u2013 and I could, and I did.\n\n**AMZN \u2013** Short $3636.99 (11:55am) / Closed at $3626.30 (12:45pm) \u2013 *Profit of $7.80 per contract.*\n\nAs the day began to wind down, I was able to take advantage of a play I missed earlier. And I missed it because I was screwing around with those cheap ass stocks while wallowing in my chocolate pudding! I did not miss it this time. **SAVA** was weak against the market all day, has a clear HA reversal on the daily charts, and a long way to go before it hits any kind of support.\n\n**SAVA \u2013** Short $83.18 (12:26pm) / Closed at $81.78 (12:42pm) \u2013 *Profit of $1.40 per contract.*\n\nNaturally, I couldn\u2019t help myself and took **VERB** again, but I really do like the stock and plan on holding it. I know, I know, don\u2019t get attached, right? But I dunno, there\u2019s something about **VERB**\u2026..\n\n**VERB \u2013** Long $3.21 (12:47pm) / Still Holding \u2013 Stock currently at $3.26\n\nI also jumped back into **RCAT**, I just felt it had more to give after I let it go so quickly before. Quick scalp to end the day.\n\n**RCAT \u2013** Long $5.03 (12:48pm) / Closed at $5.11 (12:50pm) \u2013 *Profit of .08 cents per share.*\n\n***AAL*** *(12:47pm) \u2013 it was time to let it go.* *No reason other than I still had way too many positions on.* *Loss - .90 cents a share.*\n\n***TPST,*** *I averaged down to a cost per share of $20.84, and it ended the day with a nice run, hoping to close this tomorrow.* \n\n***NEGG,*** *I averaged down to a cost per share of $29.74, and it ended the day not doing a damn thing, but I plan on holding this until it pops back up again.*\n\n***In After Hours, I did two trades:***\n\n**FUBO \u2013** Long $27.21 (1:13pm/1:30pm) / Closed at $27.38 (1:52pm) \u2013 *Profit of .17 cents per share.*\n\n**MRNA \u2013** Long $274.63 (2:24pm, 2:31pm, 2:44pm) / Closed at $275.63 (3:22pm) \u2013 *Profit of $1 per share.*\n\n***And I took the loss in HUSA for a .29 cent and TPST for $1.40 a share.***\n\n***For today:***\n\n*Wins:* ***12***\n\n*Losses:* ***3***\n\n*Scratches:* ***1***\n\n*Holds:* ***4***\n\n***For the past three days:***\n\n*Wins:* ***33***\n\n*Losses:* ***10***\n\n*Scratches:* ***11***\n\n*Holds:* ***8***\n\n***Profit:***\n\n*On Day 1 (Tuesday) my overall profit was:* ***1.3%***\n\n*On Day 2 (Wednesday) my overall profit was:* ***.8%***\n\n*Today my overall profit was:* ***2.8%*** \n\n***Current Holds:***\n\n**ATOS (long) - $6.46,** currently at $**5.67 \u2013** ***down .69 cents per share.*** ***Mental Stop - $5.25***\n\n**RCL (short) - $73.23,** currently at **$74.21 \u2013** ***down .98 cents per share, Mental Stop - $76.05***\n\n**UNH (long) - $421.30**, currently at **$420.05 \u2013** ***down $1.25 per share, Mental Stop - $415.95***\n\n**COIN (short) - $220.66,** currently at **$224.63 \u2013** ***down $3.97 per share, Mental Stop - $229.25***\n\n**VERB (long) - $3.21,** currently at **$3.26 \u2013** ***up .05 cents per share, Mental Stop - $2.75***\n\n**NEGG (long) - $29.84,** currently at **$26.20 \u2013** ***down $3.64 per share, Mental Stop - $19.75***\n\n**CRTD (long) - $5.03,** currently at **$3.50 -** ***down $1.53 per share, Mental Stop - $3.30***\n\n**WORX (long) - $3.68,** currently at **$2.41 \u2013** ***down $1.27 per share, Mental Stop - $2.35*** \n\n**OSTK (long) - $102.05,** currently at *$****86.33 \u2013 down $15.72 per share, Mental Stop \u2013 None\\**** \n\n*\\*these are ITM calls that expire in August.*\n\n***I also have AMZN puts, PFE calls, and a useless AVGO Call Debit Spread that will expire tomorrow at Max Loss.***\n\n*Keep in mind, I trade for a living, therefore the \u201cnumbers\u201d I care most about are the monthly averages for:*\n\n***Win Rate %, # of Trades Per Day and Profit Per Trade***\n\nEvery Professional Day Trader is different, some have a lower number of trades a day, but a much higher average profit for example. However, *Win Rate* typically needs to be above 80%, which is a consistent benchmark for everyone that depends on Day Trading for a living.\n\nTrade Well!",

COREY GOLDMAN**](https://www.thestreet.com/author/m-corey-goldman) \n\n JUL 15, 2021 6:55 AM EDT \n\nChip and graphics card makers including Nvidia\u00a0 ([**NVDA**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/nvda)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=NVDA), Applied Materials\u00a0 ([**AMAT**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/amat)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=AMAT)\u00a0and\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices\u00a0 ([**AMD**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/amd)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=AMD)\u00a0are set to benefit from Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s\u00a0 ([**TSM**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/tsm)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=TSM)\u00a0ongoing strong momentum, which has been driven by tight supply in the semiconductor market due to the ongoing chip shortage.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor on Thursday [said it expects sales to rise more than 20% in 2021](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/dow-futures-dip-as-powell-tweaks-growth-concern-tech-stocks-gain), affirming its crucial role in helping alleviate a global chip shortage that\u2019s slammed production of everything from cars and trucks to dishwashers and toys.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor CEO C.C. Wei said the company expects semiconductor supply to\u00a0remain tight into 2022, though it will ramp up production of microcontrollers by close to 60%, which will at least help reduce the chip shortage for its automobile clients, which include the likes of Ford\u00a0 ([**F**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/f)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=F), Tesla\u00a0 ([**TSLA**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/tsla)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=TSLA)\u00a0and others.\n\nRevenue in the current quarter is expected to rise to between $14.6 billion and $14.9 billion, in line with the $14.7 billion average of analyst estimates. TSMC\u2019s 2021 sales outlook is expected to surpass earlier estimates of\u00a020% growth in full-year sales. \n\n That, in turn, is expected to benefit the likes of Apple\u00a0 ([**AAPL**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/aapl)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=AAPL), one of Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s biggest partners, as well as the likes of Nvidia, Applied Materials and AMD, [which could ride the coattails of continued strong semi demand and higher prices](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/chipmakers-taiwan-semiconductor-production-micron-nvidia-amd). \n\n \u201cYou know what is tiresome? The temporary decline of semis for no real reason just causes such angst as opposed to buying,\u201d TheStreet\u2019s Jim Cramer [noted in a recent Real Money column](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/jim-cramer-there-s-no-real-reason-why-the-semi-s-have-declined-15707510?puc=tst_sfi). This fabulous group is a ball of confusion until you look where they come from.\u201d \n\n Indeed, main chip and graphics cards makers as well as other semiconductor producers will continue to benefit from demand, particularly in computers and electronics, which Cramer noted make both semi makers and other peripheral computing equipment makers like Texas Instruments\u00a0 ([**TXN**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/txn)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=TXN), Analog Devices\u00a0 ([**ADI**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/adi)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=ADI), Broadcom\u00a0 ([**AVGO**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/avgo)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=AVGO)\u00a0and Marvell Tech\u00a0 ([**MRVL**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/mrvl)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=MRVL)\u00a0strong potential growth candidates.\n\nAnd not just lack of supply: Nvidia, which has been pegged a cryptocurrency play due its graphics cards being the equipment of choice for mining Ethereum, longer-term demand for advanced gaming, graphics and \"gamification\" of real-life applications used by consumers and businesses [make Nvidia an undervalued play](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/jim-cramer-what-q2-s-strongest-stocks-tell-us-about-this-bull-market-15702829), Cramer said.\u00a0\n\n\"Only one stock could possibly be called a perennial and that's the first and most obvious one, Nvidia, the artificial intelligence gaming platform company, two of the multiple ways I could have chosen to describe it.\"\n\nSeparately, Mizuho Securities on Thursday raised its one-year price target on Nvidia to $900 from $710. At last check, shares of Nvidia were up 0.15% at $794.85 in premarket trading.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 2, 2021**\n\nStocks rose once again, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) both recording new intraday highs amid the continued push by technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA) rose as well, but continued to lag behind the other two indexes. Market participants are encouraged by the June Jobs Report, which showed payroll gains rise more than expected. \n\nToday, the US Department of Labor released the Job June report, which showed a stronger-than-expected acceleration in hiring, with non-farm payrolls rising by 850,000, the sixth straight month of gains. The unemployment rate however, ticked slightly higher to 5.9%. Here are the numbers\n\n* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** 850,000 vs. 720,000 expected and an upwardly revised 583,000 in May\n* **Unemployment rate:** 5.9% vs. 5.6% expected and 5.8% in May \n* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.3% vs. 0.3% expected and a downwardly revised 0.4% in May\n* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 3.6% vs. 3.6% expected and a downwardly revised 1.9% in May\n\nPresident Biden said of the report, \u201cThis is historic progress, pulling our economy out of the worst crisis in 100 years, driven in part by our dramatic progress in vaccinating our nation and beating back the pandemic. Today, the US is the only major advanced economy where the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) projections of future output are higher today than they were in January 2020 before the pandemic hit.\u201d\n\nEmily Roland, co-Chief Investment Strategist at John Hancock Investment Management said of the report, \u201cThis is the Goldilocks Report that the market was looking for today. You had a nice print here of 850,000 jobs being added, wage pressure remaining \u2013 I wouldn't call them necessarily contained \u2013 but surprising here on the downside versus consensus estimates. So this is telling us right now that economic growth is continuing to accelerate here, the jobs market is continuing to heal. We're making progress here in terms of what the Fed has set out to do, which is in order to get unemployment down, they're going to let inflation run a little bit hot here. Not too hot, not too cold \u2013 this is just what the market wants.\"\n\nThis Job Report will give market participants a better idea as to the timing of the Federal Reserve\u2019s next monetary policy. For now, the Fed has so far kept in place both of its key pandemic-era policies - quantitative easing at a clip of $120 billion a month and near-zero interest rates. However, the Fed has consistently said they are looking for a \u201cstring\u201d of strong jobs reports, like the one this month before any adjustments to the current policy is made. If the Jobs Report continues being especially strong in the months ahead, it could force the Fed to taper quantitative easing earlier than originally telegraphed. I have said  before in the past I expect the Fed to begin tapering QE towards the end of the year and am not worried about that at all. For starters, the market has historically reacted very little to changes in QE ([see the 2013 Taper Tantrum here)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp), it\u2019s changes in the interest rate that really drive the market, and second, the Fed is expected to taper slowly, making any changes gradual.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of AMC pulled back slightly after financial firm Iceberg Research announced they have opened a short position. Honestly, I have no idea why they did this, only opening themselves up to becoming WSB's next target. Will be interesting to see what happens moving forward.\n* More bad news for Lordstown Motors, who have already been the subject of a short report that saw the company admit they had inflated the importance of preorders for the electric pickup truck and forced the CEO to leave. Now, the Justice Department has announced it is opening a probe into the company to investigate comments made by executives and the way the company represented its pre orders to shareholders. The whole EV market was down today in sympathy. \n* Tesla (TSLA) recorded its fifth straight quarter of vehicle delivery growth. In Q2, the company delivered 201,250 vehicles, missing expectations for 204,160, according to Bloomberg consensus data**,** but more than double the 90,891 vehicles delivered in the same period a year ago.\n* The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a proposed consent order to settle antitrust charges against semiconductor maker Broadcom Inc, the agency said in a statement on Friday. The consent order requires Broadcom to stop demanding that its customers buy components mostly or only from Broadcom. The company responded, \u201cWhile we disagree that our actions violated the law and disagree with the FTC\u2019s characterizations of our business, we look forward to putting this matter behind us.\"\n* Jeff Bezos is officially stepping down as Amazon CEO on Monday. Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassey will be taking over for him. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Anthem (ANTM) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $454 to $459.

        "selftext": "Posting here to offer a little perspective on what some apes saw as a quick hype play.\n\nIt was evident that PSFE had finally found bottom last week after months of daily short attacks.  For months, we saw all the tell-tale signs of market manipulators expertly shaking out retail shareholders with order flow, short volume, massive block trades and 13F\u2019s showing institutions steadily loading up.  In this context, just as PSFE was to be officially added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 indexes, it seemed a little suspicious that Paysafe was suddenly being hyped and trending on WallStreetBets.  I had to wonder if this was an engineered event to generate more liquidity since market makers were clearly running out of sellers right when they had to fill a lot more institutional orders.\n\nThat\u2019s all just monkey brain theory that ultimately doesn't matter because my plan is to hold PSFE long-term.  There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor, before all the rosy ER\u2019s come in.  With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and, despite recent reports, has similar growth to PayPal, it\u2019s no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de-risked from a long-term perspective.\n\nThe comprehensive DD below is for the diamond handed apes who may have been caught in the recent hype. Know that you\u2019re not alone. We saw the same thing right after CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer called Paysafe, \u201cthe ultimate stock for this moment\u201d and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to \u201c$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there.\u201d  After initial spikes, deep-pocketed short-sellers methodically crushed retail holders, eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week.\n\nBut informed short sellers knew they couldn't push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo\u2019s several funds (12 million shares) and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares.^(1)  Also, it\u2019s worth noting that, since they all decided to invest, Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, and Microsoft among others. ^(2)\n\nWith a presence in 120 countries, Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor: #1 global leader in iGaming, #2 global digital wallet, #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private, they\u2019ve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk, increase margins and profits. It's because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity. Here are a few key points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* In 2017, private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for $3.9 billion.^(3)  Blackstone says their typical investment term is \u201cupwards of 7-10 years\u201d ^(4) which aligns with the investment time-frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said, \u201cThere is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents\u2019 age,\u201d adding that the private equity firms \u201chave a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.\u201d ^(5)\n* Under Blackstone/CVC\u2019s stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their long-standing strategic decision to exit specific high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated.  This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth.  In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d  But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. ^(6,7)\n* A few months ago, Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity. The deal paid down $1.2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone/CVC about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.^(8)  The fact that Blackstone's recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares, combined with statements from them and Paysafe's board, indicates that they did this deal, not for a mere 44% gain on a four year investment, but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well-connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth.\n* Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward.  Bill Foley, now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder, is a proven M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena.  Foley took Fidelity National Financial from $3 million market cap to $10.8 billion. Yeah, that\u2019s and \u201cm\u201d and a \u201cb\u201d.  Over just the last five years, Foley grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).  Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion market cap. That\u2019s a 36x return.  He says  \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d ^(6,9)\n\n**Deleveraging, increasing margins and profit**\n\n* Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume.  Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.  Notably, their multi-year projections don\u2019t include growth from their \"active M&amp;A pipeline\" and their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR).\n* Q1's earnings disappointed some because, as part of their restructuring, they had $90 million in one-time non-recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. The company noted: \u201cResults included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.\"\n* Take away the $90 million in one-time expenses and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly net profit, thereby beating all analyst estimates. All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward, although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently.\n* In addition to paying down $1.2 billion in debt, an improved Moody\u2019s credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1.25% lower interest rate, with an option to reduce it another 25bp.^(10)  Foley says: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.\u201d  Notably, this Debt/EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers, and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still.\n* The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around $92 million annually.  This secures higher margins, increased cash for M&amp;A and higher profits which, in my view, will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.\n* As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins, Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud-based integration for easier migration between their platforms, easier cross-border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service, having identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\n**Highly competitve**\n\n* Unlike other payment processors, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.  Just today, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n* In various segments, Paysafe has recently expanded their partnerships with FOX bet, Roblox, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Draftkings, Spotify, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, and Pointsbet among many others.\n* \\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n* They are #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n* People are usually more likely to leave reviews when a payment platform doesn\u2019t meet their expectations. That said, Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11)\n   * By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1axvo1n3sl871.png?width=475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca4bb0678156d9737029ff6a3075728bd54e8940\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d**\n\n**\u201cIt\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"** \\- Bill Foley\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due to managing risk and a very complex regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT, as discussed below.  Paysafe is often an integrated back-end payment processor so most don\u2019t realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting.\n* Bill Foley says, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else\u2026we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n* In his letter to investors, fund manager Dan Loeb said, \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n* Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso, who initiated coverage with a $19 price target, noted, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d adding, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d ^(13)\n   * Recent headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n      * \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n      * \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n      * \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n      * \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n      * \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n      * \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n      * \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n      * \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n      * \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n      * \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n      * \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n      * \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n      * \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n      * \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n      * \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n      * \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Every analyst covering Paysafe rates it as a \"Buy\". A few quotes :\n   * RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d ^(14)\n   * BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" ^(15)\n   * Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(16)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MOAT:**  **\u201crobust risk management operation\u201d**\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1.7 billion globally who can't even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from transcript : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d ^(9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n* Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin,  mid to high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n* By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n* Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n* The group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their \"active M&amp;A pipeline.\"  Foley is apparently known for under-promising and over-performing.\n* As noted above, Paysafe was growing 28% CAGR pre-Covid, but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid-related business closures and strategic channel exits, it grew at 18% CAGR, a rate on par with PayPal's projected growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of peer multiples:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\nMore realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : **$50.75**\n* EV/Rev ratio : **$44.64**\n* EV/FCF ratio : **$44.18**\n\n**Average : $46.52**\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up.  While I don't necessarily agree with his time frame, market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources:**\n\n(1) see fintel or other source for institutional ownership.

        "selftext": "It was evident that PSFE had finally found bottom last week.  For months, we saw all the tell-tale signs of market manipulators expertly shaking out retail shareholders with order flow, short volume, massive block trades and 13F\u2019s showing institutions steadily loading up.  In this context, just as PSFE was to be officially added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 indexes, it seemed a little suspicious that Paysafe was suddenly being hyped and trending on WallStreetBets.  I had to wonder if this was an engineered event to generate more liquidity since market makers were clearly running out of sellers right when they had to fill a lot more institutional orders.\n\nThat\u2019s all just monkey brain theory that ultimately doesn't matter because my plan is to hold PSFE for a long time.  There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor, before all the rosy ER\u2019s come in.  With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and, despite recent reports, has similar growth to PayPal, it\u2019s no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de-risked from a long-term perspective.\n\nThe comprehensive DD below is for investors with a longer view who may have been caught in the recent hype. Know that you\u2019re not alone. We saw the same thing right after CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer called Paysafe, \u201cthe ultimate stock for this moment\u201d and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to \u201c$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there.\u201d  After initial spikes, deep-pocketed short-sellers methodically crushed retail holders, eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week.\n\nBut informed short sellers knew they couldn't push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo\u2019s several funds (12 million shares) and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares.^(1)  Also, it\u2019s worth noting that, since they all decided to invest, Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, and Microsoft among others. ^(2)\n\nWith a presence in 120 countries, Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor: #1 global leader in iGaming, #2 global digital wallet, #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private, they\u2019ve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk, increase margins and profits. It's because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity. Here are a few key points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* In 2017, private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for $3.9 billion.^(3)  Blackstone says their typical investment term is \u201cupwards of 7-10 years\u201d ^(4) which aligns with the investment time-frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said, \u201cThere is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents\u2019 age,\u201d adding that the private equity firms \u201chave a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.\u201d ^(5)\n* Under Blackstone/CVC\u2019s stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their long-standing strategic decision to exit specific high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated.  This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth.  In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d  But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. ^(6,7)\n* A few months ago, Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity. The deal paid down $1.2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone/CVC about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.^(8)  The fact that Blackstone's recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares, combined with statements from them and Paysafe's board, indicates that they did this deal, not for a mere 44% gain on a four year investment, but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well-connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth.\n* Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward.  Bill Foley, now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder, is a proven M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena.  Foley took Fidelity National Financial from $3 million market cap to $10.8 billion. Yeah, that\u2019s and \u201cm\u201d and a \u201cb\u201d.  Over just the last five years, Foley grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).  Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion market cap. That\u2019s a 36x return.  He says  \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d ^(6,9)\n\n**Deleveraging, increasing margins and profit**\n\n* Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume.  Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.  Notably, their multi-year projections don\u2019t include growth from their \"active M&amp;A pipeline\" and their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR).\n* Q1's earnings disappointed some because, as part of their restructuring, they had $90 million in one-time non-recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. The company noted: \u201cResults included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.\"\n* Take away the $90 million in one-time expenses and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly net profit, thereby beating all analyst estimates. All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward, although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently.\n* In addition to paying down $1.2 billion in debt, an improved Moody\u2019s credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1.25% lower interest rate, with an option to reduce it another 25bp.^(10)  Foley says: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.\u201d  Notably, this Debt/EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers, and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still.\n* The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around $92 million annually.  This secures higher margins, increased cash for M&amp;A and higher profits which, in my view, will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.\n* As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins, Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud-based integration for easier migration between their platforms, easier cross-border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service, having identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\n**Highly competitve**\n\n* Unlike other payment processors, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.  Just today, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n* In various segments, Paysafe has recently expanded their partnerships with FOX bet, Roblox, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Draftkings, Spotify, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, and Pointsbet among many others.\n* \\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n* They are #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n* People are usually more likely to leave reviews when a payment platform doesn\u2019t meet their expectations. That said, Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11)\n   * By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d**\n\n**\u201cIt\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"** \\- Bill Foley\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due to managing risk and a very complex regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT, as discussed below.  Paysafe is often an integrated back-end payment processor so most don\u2019t realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting.\n* Bill Foley says, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else\u2026we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n* In his letter to investors, fund manager Dan Loeb said, \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n* Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso, who initiated coverage with a $19 price target, noted, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d adding, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d ^(13)\n   * Recent headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n      * \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n      * \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n      * \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n      * \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n      * \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n      * \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n      * \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n      * \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n      * \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n      * \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n      * \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n      * \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n      * \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n      * \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n      * \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n      * \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Every analyst covering Paysafe rates it as a \"Buy\". A few quotes :\n   * RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d ^(14)\n   * BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" ^(15)\n   * Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(16)\n\n**MOAT:**  **\u201crobust risk management operation\u201d**\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1.7 billion globally who can't even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from transcript : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d ^(9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n* Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin,  mid to high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n* By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n* Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n* The group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their \"active M&amp;A pipeline.\"  Foley is apparently known for under-promising and over-performing.\n* As noted above, Paysafe was growing 28% CAGR pre-Covid, but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid-related business closures and strategic channel exits, it grew at 18% CAGR, a rate on par with PayPal's projected growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of peer multiples:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\nMore realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : **$50.75**\n* EV/Rev ratio : **$44.64**\n* EV/FCF ratio : **$44.18**\n\n**Average : $46.52**\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up.  While I don't necessarily agree with his time frame, market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources:**\n\n(1) [https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe](https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe).\n\n(2) [https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes\\_value\\_creation\\_trajectory\\_is\\_very\\_much/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/)\n\n(3) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827](https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827)\n\n(4) [https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the\\_life\\_cycle\\_of\\_private\\_equity\\_insights.pdf](https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the_life_cycle_of_private_equity_insights.pdf)\n\n(5) [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a-idUSKBN1AK0KN](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a-idUSKBN1AK0KN)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9)  [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10)  Global Capital link removed due to forbidden word in the url. \n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)\n\n(13)  [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(14) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(15) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(16) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)",

        "selftext": "Posting here to offer a little perspective on what some apes saw as a quick hype play.\n\nIt was evident that PSFE had finally found bottom last week after months of daily short attacks.  For months, we saw all the tell-tale signs of market manipulators expertly shaking out retail shareholders with order flow, short volume, massive block trades and 13F\u2019s showing institutions steadily loading up.  In this context, just as PSFE was to be officially added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 indexes, it seemed a little suspicious that Paysafe was suddenly being hyped and trending on WallStreetBets.  I had to wonder if this was an engineered event to generate more liquidity since market makers were clearly running out of sellers right when they had to fill a lot more institutional orders.\n\nThat\u2019s all just monkey brain theory that ultimately doesn't matter because my plan is to hold PSFE long-term.  There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor, before all the rosy ER\u2019s come in.  With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and, despite recent reports, has similar growth to PayPal, it\u2019s no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de-risked from a long-term perspective.\n\nThe comprehensive DD below is for the diamond handed apes who may have been caught in the recent hype. Know that you\u2019re not alone. We saw the same thing right after CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer called Paysafe, \u201cthe ultimate stock for this moment\u201d and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to \u201c$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there.\u201d  After initial spikes, deep-pocketed short-sellers methodically crushed retail holders, eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week.\n\nBut informed short sellers knew they couldn't push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo\u2019s several funds (12 million shares) and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares.^(1)  Also, it\u2019s worth noting that, since they all decided to invest, Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, and Microsoft among others. ^(2)\n\nWith a presence in 120 countries, Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor: #1 global leader in iGaming, #2 global digital wallet, #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private, they\u2019ve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk, increase margins and profits. It's because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity. Here are a few key points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* In 2017, private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for $3.9 billion.^(3)  Blackstone says their typical investment term is \u201cupwards of 7-10 years\u201d ^(4) which aligns with the investment time-frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said, \u201cThere is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents\u2019 age,\u201d adding that the private equity firms \u201chave a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.\u201d ^(5)\n* Under Blackstone/CVC\u2019s stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their long-standing strategic decision to exit specific high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated.  This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth.  In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d  But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. ^(6,7)\n* A few months ago, Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity. The deal paid down $1.2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone/CVC about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.^(8)  The fact that Blackstone's recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares, combined with statements from them and Paysafe's board, indicates that they did this deal, not for a mere 44% gain on a four year investment, but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well-connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth.\n* Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward.  Bill Foley, now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder, is a proven M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena.  Foley took Fidelity National Financial from $3 million market cap to $10.8 billion. Yeah, that\u2019s and \u201cm\u201d and a \u201cb\u201d.  Over just the last five years, Foley grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).  Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion market cap. That\u2019s a 36x return.  He says  \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d ^(6,9)\n\n**Deleveraging, increasing margins and profit**\n\n* Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume.  Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.  Notably, their multi-year projections don\u2019t include growth from their \"active M&amp;A pipeline\" and their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR).\n* Q1's earnings disappointed some because, as part of their restructuring, they had $90 million in one-time non-recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. The company noted: \u201cResults included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.\"\n* Take away the $90 million in one-time expenses and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly net profit, thereby beating all analyst estimates. All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward, although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently.\n* In addition to paying down $1.2 billion in debt, an improved Moody\u2019s credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1.25% lower interest rate, with an option to reduce it another 25bp.^(10)  Foley says: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.\u201d  Notably, this Debt/EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers, and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still.\n* The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around $92 million annually.  This secures higher margins, increased cash for M&amp;A and higher profits which, in my view, will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.\n* As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins, Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud-based integration for easier migration between their platforms, easier cross-border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service, having identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\n**Highly competitve**\n\n* Unlike other payment processors, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.  Just today, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n* In various segments, Paysafe has recently expanded their partnerships with FOX bet, Roblox, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Draftkings, Spotify, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, and Pointsbet among many others.\n* \\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n* They are #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n* People are usually more likely to leave reviews when a payment platform doesn\u2019t meet their expectations. That said, Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11)\n   * By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2tce80abpl871.png?width=475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32e78dde014d5edf387cd4f9f603fceb6ab6c4c7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d**\n\n**\u201cIt\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"** \\- Bill Foley\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due to managing risk and a very complex regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT, as discussed below.  Paysafe is often an integrated back-end payment processor so most don\u2019t realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting.\n* Bill Foley says, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else\u2026we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n* In his letter to investors, fund manager Dan Loeb said, \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n* Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso, who initiated coverage with a $19 price target, noted, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d adding, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d ^(13)\n   * Recent headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n      * \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n      * \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n      * \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n      * \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n      * \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n      * \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n      * \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n      * \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n      * \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n      * \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n      * \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n      * \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n      * \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n      * \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n      * \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n      * \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Every analyst covering Paysafe rates it as a \"Buy\". A few quotes :\n   * RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d ^(14)\n   * BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" ^(15)\n   * Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(16)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MOAT:**  **\u201crobust risk management operation\u201d**\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1.7 billion globally who can't even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from transcript : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d ^(9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n* Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin,  mid to high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n* By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n* Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n* The group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their \"active M&amp;A pipeline.\"  Foley is apparently known for under-promising and over-performing.\n* As noted above, Paysafe was growing 28% CAGR pre-Covid, but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid-related business closures and strategic channel exits, it grew at 18% CAGR, a rate on par with PayPal's projected growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of peer multiples:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\nMore realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : **$50.75**\n* EV/Rev ratio : **$44.64**\n* EV/FCF ratio : **$44.18**\n\n**Average : $46.52**\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up.  While I don't necessarily agree with his time frame, market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources:**\n\n(1) [https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe](https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe).\n\n(2) [https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes\\_value\\_creation\\_trajectory\\_is\\_very\\_much/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/)\n\n(3) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827](https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827)\n\n(4) [https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the\\_life\\_cycle\\_of\\_private\\_equity\\_insights.pdf](https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the_life_cycle_of_private_equity_insights.pdf)\n\n(5) [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a-idUSKBN1AK0KN](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a-idUSKBN1AK0KN)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9)  [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10)   [https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi](https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi)\n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)\n\n(13)  [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(14) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(15) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(16) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)",
