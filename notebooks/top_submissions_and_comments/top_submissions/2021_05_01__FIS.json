        "selftext": "How could an equity manager that has been in the game for over 30 years and relatively unheard of suddenly make a splash with Ark? What was she doing before Ark? I have been able to dig into her past performance and the results of which are below.\n\n**Quick summary**\n\n-   She has a long history of running funds that fit under \"discovery growth\" or \"global thematic\" styles.\n\n-   Cathie has a **great track record outperforming the S&amp;P 500**, but much of this has been due to outperformance of growth style.\n\n-   When compared to category style, almost all of Cathie's major**outperforming** years come during special periods in the market cycle, particularly in the periods following a market crash. With one other period of great performance during the 2017 BTC bubble craze**.**\n\n-   Outside of those special events, Cathie's funds generally **underperform** equivalent style peers on a year-by-year basis.\n\n-   She has a history of **leaving a fund during or** **following a period of underperformance**, then \"rebooting\" in another fund. This includes a short stint in a hedge fund that appears to have crash and burned.\n\nBefore getting into the deep dive, a quick note on benchmarks. Cathie's investment style is has squarely fit into one of two flavors: **US growth** and **global growth**. The S&amp;P 500 is not an appropriate benchmark at all for a growth-oriented or global oriented fund. Instead, for the years available, I will benchmark her to the Russell 1000 Growth and MSCI World Large Cap Index, as these fit her investment universe and demonstrate whether an investor would have been better off with a passive index fund.\n\nAdditionally, I'm going to compare her performance to some matching T Rowe Price Funds. Why T Rowe Price? First, their security selection universe is similar to Cathie Woods: they tend to prefer growth-oriented companies (i.e. think Amazon rather than Phillip Morris). Secondary, they have been around for a while and their funds have history dating back earlier than the indices I will be using.\n\nFinally, for another reference point I will benchmark against Yahoo Finance's category average for the year.\n\nIn Summary:\n\n-   To benchmark her \"discovery growth\" funds, I am going to use the **i-shares Russell 1000 Growth Index (IWF)** (subject to years available) as well as **T Rowe Price's New Horizon Fund (PRNHX).**\n\n-   To benchmark her \"global \" fund, I am going to use **Vanguard Total World (VT)** (subject to years available)and **T Rowe Price's Global Stock Fund (PRGSX)**.\n\n-   For years where no index data is easily available, I will instead use Yahoo Finance's category averages to another benchmark (this is an average of of active fund performance, after fees).\n\n**1980-1998 (Jennison Associates)**\n\nThis is the one period for which I could not find any performance data, as there are only a handful of surviving funds from that period. She was apparently a portfolio manager and chief economist. I tried looking up fund history on the SEC website but could not find anywhere she is listed as a manager, even after searching shareholder reports for the period. It's possible whichever funds she worked on are no longer around...so unfortunately we need to skip this period.\n\n**1998-2001 (Tupelo Capital Services)**\n\nCathie co-founded this hedge fund in 1998..right as the dotcom bubble was building steam. ARK's company profile boasts that she managed $800 billion in assets in 2000. Interesting that they give this figure for the very height of the market bubble. In 2001, as the market bubble crashes, Cathie leaves Tupelo Capital.\n\nUnfortunately there is no accurate performance history for this hedge fund, but I have found AUM filings from the SEC.\n\nIn Q4 1999, the fund's AUM reached $1.0 billion.\n\nSource (&lt;https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-001292/&gt;)\n\nIn Q1 2000, the fund's AUM then reached $1.3 billion.\n\nSource (&lt;https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-005389/&gt;)\n\nBy Q4 2000, the AUM shrank to ~$800 million: matching Cathie's stated figures.\n\nSource (&lt;https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-001535/&gt;)\n\nFinally, by the end of Q1 2001, the AUM shrank to ~$200 million.\n\nSource (&lt;https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-502496/&gt;)\n\nIn other words**, the fund's AUM shrank roughly 80% over 2000 and 2001**. Note that this would have been due to a combination of asset losses as well as investors pulling out, so it's not possible to know how much of that is due to actual equity losses.\n\nBy comparison, T Rowe's Global Equity Fund lost 17% across 2000-2001, roughly in line with the category average. Unfortunately Vanguard's Total World index (VT) did not exist during this timeframe.\n\n**2001-2013 (Alliance Bernstein)**\n\nAfter Cathie left Tupelo Capital Services, she joined Alliance Bernstein. During her tenure she managed three funds:\n\n-   AB Discovery Growth (**CHCIX**): A discovery/growth oriented fund.\n\n-   AB Sustainable Global Thematic Fund (**ALTFX**)\n\n-   AB Strategy Research Portfolio: Note that this is a Separately Managed Account (SMA) not an open mutual fund. I will use the acronym **ABSRP**.\n\nAll further sources will be at the bottom.\n\n**2001: Cathie OUTPERFORMS Category, UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe**\n\n-   **ABSRP**: -13.81% (before fees)\n\n-   PRNHX: -2.84%\n\n-   Category: -19.98%\n\nABSRP beats it's category as the 2001 recession unfolds, but loses to PRNHX. Note that Cathie joined some time in 2001, so it's uknown how much of a contributing factor she was during this period.\n\n**2002: Cathie OUTPERFORMS Category, OUTPERFORMS T Rowe**\n\n-   **ABSRP**: -20.89% (before fees)\n\n-   PRNHX: -26.60%\n\n-   Category: -27.24%\n\n**2003: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS Category, UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe**\n\n-   **ABSRP**: 36.44% (before fees), 32.69% (after fees)\n\n-   PRNHX: 49.31%\n\n-   Category: 35.96% (after fees)\n\n**2004: Cathie OUTPERFORMS Category, OUTPERFORMS T Rowe**\n\n-   **ABSRP**: 20.20% (before fees)\n\n-   PRNHX: 17.90%\n\n-   Category: 13.23%\n\n**2005: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS Category, UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe**\n\n-   **ABSRP**: 10.45% (before fees), 7.21% (after fees)\n\n-   PRNHX: 11.90% (after fees)\n\n-   Growth Category: 9.84% (after fees)\n\n**2006: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS Category, UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe**\n\n-   **ABSRP**: 4.23% (before fees)\n\n-   **CHCIX**: 1.85%\n\n-   PRNHX: 7.39%\n\n-   Growth Category: 9.00%\n\nNote: Cathie started managing AB Discovery Growth (CHCIX) in 2003, but performance data is only available from 2006.\n\nSource: &lt;https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/chcix/people&gt;\n\n**2007: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS Category, OUTPERFORMS T Rowe**\n\n-   **ABSRP**: 14.28% (before fees)\n\n-   **CHCIX**: 12.31%\n\n-   PRNHX: 6.25%\n\n-   Growth Category: 15.09%\n\n**2008: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS Category, UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe**\n\n-   **ABSRP**: -45.12% (before fees)\n\n-   **CHCIX**: -48.28%\n\n-   PRNHX: -38.78%\n\n-   Growth Category: -43.77%\n\nNotes: During the 2008-2009 market crash**, Cathie exits CHCIX and starts to manage the AB Sustainable Global Thematic Fund (ALTFX)**, with some period overlapping while new management is onboarded for CHCIX. I have no information as for the management shuffle, only what I see on Morningstar.\n\nSource:\n\n&lt;https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/altfx/people&gt;\n\n&lt;https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/chcix/people&gt;\n\n**2009: Cathie OUTPERFORMS Category, OUTPERFORMS T Rowe**\n\n-   **ALTFX**: 55.53%\n\n-   VT: 33.62%\n\n-   PRGSX: 44.77%\n\n-   **ABSRP**: 44.57% (before fees), 40.39% (after fees)\n\n-   PRNHX: 43.87% (after fees)\n\n-   Growth Category: 39.11% (after fees)\n\n**2010: Cathie MIXED against Category, MIXED against T Rowe**\n\n-   **ABSRP**: 25.30% (before fees), 21.65% (after fees)\n\n-   Growth Category: 24.61% (after fees)\n\n-   PRNHX: 34.67%\n\n-   **ALTFX**: 18.42%\n\n-   VT: 13.05%\n\n-   PRGSX: 12.45%\n\nIn 2010, Cathie's Separately Managed Account (SMA) underperforms, whereas her global fund outperforms.\n\n**2011: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS Category, UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe**\n\n-   **ALTFX**: -23.71%\n\n-   VT: -7.71%\n\n-   PRGSX: -11.55%\n\nUnfortunately no more data available for **ABSRP** starting this year.\n\n**2012: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS Category, UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe**\n\n-   **ALTFX**: 12.96%\n\n-   VT: 17.33%\n\n-   PRGSX: 16.39%\n\n*Unfortunately no data available for SREMAC for this year\n\n**2013: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS Category, UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe**\n\nNotes: Cathie left Alliance Beinstein in early 2013. Full year performance is still shown as it's likely that some or most holdings from Cathie's tenure were kept by the new manager.\n\n-   **ALTFX**: 22.62%\n\n-   VT: 22.98%\n\n-   PRGSX: 32.55%\n\n**2014-2020: Ark Years**\n\nFor the Ark era, I am going to use ARKK to evaluate her performance. I'm using ARKK because first and foremost it is her flagship fund, and secondly because her specialty funds, while interesting, are nearly impossible to benchmark against. For another comparison, I am also going to add another passive fund to the mix: Vanguard's VGT (Technology Index).\n\n**2014: N/A**\n\nThere is no full-year history for ARKK in 2014.\n\n**2015: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**\n\nBenchmarks I am using for ARKK are VGT (Vanguard Technology ETF) and IWF (IShares Russell Growth 2000). In 2015 ARKK underperformed both.\n\n-   **ARKK**: 3.76%\n\n-   VGT: 5.02%\n\n-   IWF: 5.50%\n\n-   PRNHX: 4.50%\n\n**2016: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**\n\n-   **ARKK**: -1.96%\n\n-   VGT: 13.73%\n\n-   IWF: 7.01%\n\n-   PRNHX: 7.79%\n\n**2017: Cathie OUTPERFORMS T Rowe, OUTPERFORMS Passive**\n\n-   **ARKK**: 87.38%\n\n-   VGT: 37.07%\n\n-   IWF: 29.96%\n\n-   PRNHX: 31.49%\n\nSummary: This is without a doubt the breakout year for Cathie Wood. How was this done? Can you guess what was the biggest contributor to her outperformance? Hint - it wasn't an equity holding. A position in Bitcoin Investment Trust is by far her top contributor, netting her 635, 748, 655 basis points of compounding outperformance in Q2, Q3, and Q4. Check out their quarterly reports and you'll see it's not even close. Note that the contribution of this is more than simply the compounding of 1.0635 * 1.0748 * 1.065..because this compounding is based upon the base of all assets. In other words..I estimate her actual returns without bitcoin would have been about 57%. Still great, but brings it down a bit more towards earth.\n\nQ1 Return: 19.2%\n\nQ2 Return 20.9% (14.55 without BTC)\n\nQ3 Return 18.3% (10.82 without BTC)\n\nQ4 Estiamted Return 9.9% (3.35 without BTC)\n\n**56.3% return without BTC**\n\n**87.4% return with BTC included.**\n\n&lt;https://ark-funds.com/quarterly-webinar/ark-innovation-etfs-q2-2017&gt;\n\n&lt;https://ark-funds.com/quarterly-webinar/ark-innovation-etfs-q3-2017&gt;\n\n&lt;https://ark-funds.com/quarterly-webinar/ark-innovation-etfs-q4-2017&gt;\n\n**2018: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, OUTPERFORMS Passive**\n\n-   **ARKK**: 3.58%\n\n-   VGT: 2.52%\n\n-   IWF: -1.68%\n\n-   PRNHX: 4.04%\n\n**2019: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**\n\n-   **ARKK**: 35.73%\n\n-   VGT: 48.68%\n\n-   IWF: 36.08%\n\n-   PRNHX: 37.71%\n\n**2020 Cathie OUTPERFORMS T Rowe, OUTPERFORMS Passive**\n\n-   **ARKK**: 152.52%\n\n-   VGT: 45.94%\n\n-   IWF: 38.21%\n\n-   PRNHX: 57.72%\n\n2020 bears no explanation. We all lived through the fun in the market last year. In case it isn't obvious, her biggest contributor for the year was Tesla, however there were many others as well and overall it was a much more balanced return profile versus that of 2017.\n\n**My take on ARK**\n\nThe following comes directly from ARK's own FAQ:\\\n\"ARK's funds are fully invested and do not hold a material amount of cash. ARK generally will not use cash in a tactical manner.\"\n\n&lt;https://ark-funds.com/help-center/what-is-the-typical-range-for-the-cash-position&gt;\n\nLet me explain in layman speak what this means. Here the algorithm Cathie follows to buy or sell:\n\n-   When Cathie receives inflows, she buys\n\n-   When Cathie receives outflows, she sells\n\nSounds a lot like the algorithm for a passive fund. You see, unlike most active funds...Cathie is not tactically using cash nor thinking of limiting inflows..even as she now sits with many billion AUM, and continuing to pump money into existing positions.\n\nUnlike Cathie, **top active shops tend to hold higher cash positions during times of market euphoria and close funds when they are performing** ***too*** **well**. The exception to this are mega-cap blue chip funds, but Cathie is not running a mega-cap blue chip fund. The T Rowe Funds in my benchmarks for example are currently either closed or restricted to new inflows. Fidelity has done the same with very successful small or mid-cap funds. Let me quickly summarize what IMO are some of the best virtues of a good active manager:\n\n-   Keep cash onhand and deploy it only when there is a reasonable risk/reward tradeoff.\n\n-   Sell if the risk/reward tradeoff is no longer to the best interest of your clients, even if this means selling to a cash position.\n\n-   If your cash grows too large or if your fund performs too well..you should consider closing the fund as otherwise it attracts short-minded performance chasers.\n\n-   If there is a great buying opportunity (i.e. a market crash) and your fund is closed, you should open your fund to solicit new inflows.\n\n-   You should try to keep your Assets Under Management (AUM) small if possible. The larger your AUM, the more difficult it is to make a winning bet on a small cap. Let's say for example you wanted to bet 5% of your portfolio on San Jose Water Company (SJW), an infrastructure holding of mine. Well...their total market cap is less then $2 billion. If your AUM was $100 billion, you'd need to buy the entire company outright just to make a small dent in the portfolio.\n\n-   Your marketing to your clients should be reasonable and not overpromise. Telling your clients \"your goal is to beat the S&amp;P 500 on a risk adjusted basis\" is fine as long as you are clear about risks involved.\n\nI do not see Cathie following any of the above. Instead I am seeing a combination of dangerous behaviors:\n\n-   Actively soliciting more inflows even when total AUM across Ark exceeded $100 billion. This is forcing more purchases into existing overcrowded positions.\n\n-   Advertising that ARKK should double your investment in 5 years.\n\n-   Regularly putting out videos, promotional materials, interviews, etc. promoting the house holdings with price targest significantly above most industry targets.\n\nI do not believe Cathie is acting in her investors best interests. Intentionally or not, I believe Ark is essentially a pump scheme. You see, it's actually quite easy:\n\n-   Buy companies with a marketable story and small revenue base but large revenue growth (i.e. 40% annual).\n\n-   Promote the companies heavily: sell investors on the story.\n\n-   Solicit inflows, use to buy more into those positions...sometimes owning up to 10% of the company. My theory is that this in itself is jacking up the price of those companies...\n\n-   Sit back and **watch the stock's price grow at a faster rate than revenue growth**. This is not sustainable.\n\n-   Until...well until what? Until the growth in the company revenue eventually meets up to meet the price? You now hold a basket of companies trading at very high P/S ratios. Some of them might become the next Google, but surely they all won't become the next Google. You can try selling them to some greater fool, but good luck doing that with 10s of billions in AUM.\n\n**Additional Sources**\n\n&lt;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/&gt;\n\n&lt;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/prnhx/performance/&gt;\n\n&lt;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IWF/performance/&gt;\n\n&lt;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VGT/performance/&gt;\n\n&lt;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PRGSX/performance/&gt;\n\n&lt;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/altfx/performance/&gt;\n\n&lt;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/vt/performance/&gt;\n\n&lt;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/chcix/performance/&gt;\n\n&lt;https://www.alliancebernstein.com/Microsites/ABI/Thematic/Content/Instrumentation/Investor/saleIdea_10for10_in.pdf&gt;",

On the other hand, I can be a bit more conservative and start playing with SNDL and learn the process before throwing $2k+ on PLTR or other companies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice is welcomed, Thanks!",

        "selftext": "Well long story short - during the entire GME / AMC surge I decided to make a fidelity trading account. I signed up gave them all info yada yada \n\nI ended up purchasing AMC at 8$ a stock and spent $1000. \n\nTurns out the purchase was denied because I put the wrong account/routing number in. Fidelity still purchased the stocks as \u201cgood faith\u201d\n\nWoke up the following morning and the stock went way down - not knowing I decided to just not put my account info in correctly, but fidelity had already purchased the stocks...I figured I wouldn\u2019t have to pay them back and the stock game just wasn\u2019t for me. Fidelity notified me they would be selling the stocks if I didn\u2019t pay in a week or so. They sold them.\n\nMonths later I\u2019m receiving letters from debt collectors telling me I owe them that money yada yada \n\nDo I really have to pay them the balance or is this going to haunt me? \n\nWill it go into collections?

        "selftext": "New Investor - Everything I've read says to buy a mutual fund with low expense ratios as the fees add up and you compound more money with lower fees. \n\nWhile I understand and agree with the previous statement, I am conflicted. When comparing a fund with a 0.015% expense ratio vs one with 0.7%, the fund with higher expense ratio comes out ahead when it out performs the lower expense ratio fund by 0.625%. \n\nWhen looking at Fidelity mutual funds it appears that most funds with a higher expense ratios out perform ones with lower expense ratios by significantly more than 0.625%. Examples:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX):** \n\n\\-Expense ratio 0.015%, 1yr +45.97%, 5yr +23.41%, 10yr +14.16%\n\n**Fidelity Select Software and IT Services Portfolio (FSCSX)**\n\n\\-Expense ratio 0.7%, 1yr +51.28%, 5yr +28.61%, 10yr +21.23%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn this example, and in several higher expense ratio mutual funds I looked at, it appears beneficial to pay the higher expense ratio. I do know I'm not accounting for risk here but, being youngish, I am not too worried about it at this point. I also understand the 1 year growth is a bad marker of growth due to the COVID.\n\nWhat am I missing? Is there a better r/ for this discussion?",

        "selftext": "Back in January I wrote a [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/l4ny82/silicon_valley_ai_company_ssft_is_the_next_aitx/) about this AI company and put this gem in a lot of people's radar.  In the following 2 weeks the share price increased from $0.10 to $0.40. Then came the bear market and along with all the other penny stocks SSFT fell back to where it started(at least for me) to $0.10 again. \n\nI accumulated more Sonasoft stocks in both periods, I currently have around 1.2 million shares. The reason that I did that was not to make a quick profit, it was simply investing in my future. I'm too busy to follow the markets everyday and do day trading. And with my past experience I saw that swing trading a discounted penny stock is much more profitable then taking risks every day.\n\nLast week two important things happened. \n\n1- Annual financials are released\n\n2- Investors meeting took place.\n\nThese two events strengthened my confidence in my choice of investment. We are clearly in on a company that's destined to become a Nasdaq star.\n\nBefore we start with financials, let me explain what this company is all about.\n\nSSFT used to be a data management company in Silicon Valley serving global clients for about 20 years. Company shifted it's focus from Data Management to an AI first solutions company in the early 2019 and went on with acquiring 3 AI companies and talents. \n\nTheir newly created AI platform Saibre (former NuGene) is currently used as a POC (Proof of Concept) product although even at this stage it started generating revenues.\n\nCompany's AI department annual revenue increased 15x (to 780k) YoY. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](abjpi1fgm9171)\n\nDespite 2020 being a catastrophic year for many companies, Sonasoft managed to compete with previous year's revenue.\n\n2020 total revenue has reached **$8,935,27**1 with an additional **$3,702,000** deferred revenue that is not added into 2020's numbers because the service in return has not been completed yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](qek8u3y6o9171)\n\nSo even in the worst year where companies cut of their costs drastically Sonasoft managed to reach **over 10 million USD in revenues**. This also happened when they were building up their AI platform to become market ready. **The AI bots that's already contributing the revenue will be bringing in recurring revenues when they are fully ready before the end of Q3 this year.**\n\nBesides promising numbers everyone was curious about hearing the direction for the current management. Back in March, a couple of us reached the company and asked for a better PR channel and transparency. Company responded immediately and for the first time they organized an Investor's meeting with all of the top officials.\n\nI'll share two short videos with CFO Rob Baumert and CEO Mike Khanna answering questions from investors. \n\n# Sonasoft CFO Rob Baumert explaining potential company value\n\n![video](wddgstujo9171)\n\nTo reiterate, the company valuations are typically 20x-100x in AI industry.   \nAt $0.10 share price and about $50 million market cap with about $10million revenues Sonasoft is a massively discounted AI company at this stage. That is mostly because their flagship product is not on the market yet and they are still a OTCQB company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \"What is the revenue potential of Saibre AI?\" Sonasoft CEO answers. \n\n![video](jfz4wyybp9171)\n\nSonasoft signed a revenue share agreement with Fidelity National (FIS) back in 2020. According to Mike each bot will bring in at least 180k upto 500k and more and with partnerships like FIS they will be reaching thousands of clients who will be creating multiple bots. **The recurring revenues that he's talking about is not per company, it's per bot!**\n\n# Nasdaq listing \n\nAlmost all the penny stocks promise to be on Nasdaq or higher level markets one day, but maybe less than 10% of those really become one. This wasn't something that I'd take serious unless there were some solid steps towards that direction and the CEO announced a new addition to the team, Paul Schlosberg. I'm not sure if he will be an advisor or a board member but something sticks out in his Resume \"**He enjoyed over 10 years as a member of The NASDAQ Stock Market Listing Qualifications Committee in Washington**\"\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulschlosberg/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulschlosberg/)\n\nIf the requirements haven't changed $3 minimum share price is required to uplist. So there you go, people who ask what's the price target is for this, the first PT is $3 and I think this will happen earliest  between Dec 2020 and Aug 2021. Given that they hired this person for it. All the other requirements are already met for Nasdaq.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What else?\n\nThey also gave a detailed demonstration of their SAIBRE platform. I'm a UI designer and from my point of view they created a product that's really well thought, easy to use and efficient. \n\nHere are some screenshots of SAIBRE where they were creating new bots to go through and learn massive data in minutes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](vrihp69pw9171)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](raxzo5fqw9171 \"Bots mature as they learn\")\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here are some highlights from the meeting**\n\n* AI platform patent application submitted at the end of 2020 .  \n* Replacement of Nugene with Saibre.  \n* NuGene reached limits, not enterprise scale. It was not built with easy of use which is a huge differential. Container model was causing hesitations with clients. \n* Saibre in contrast is easy to use, scalable, efficient. Anybody can use Saibre, there's no tech leakage, customers can deploy a new bot with a single click. \n* Company did an internal audit for engineering and sales. \n* Developed agile approach to respond customer needs efficiently.  \n* OEM partners, last few months, ramped up work.  \n* Before the end of q3 bots will be ready. \n\n**Rob Baumert CFO:** \n\n* Big book of sonasoft is written.  \n* Significant changes to financial structure.  \n* Impact of discountinued operations. Econnect and Sonavault were loss makers and not part of AI. They were a drag. So they let them go. Cost savings are much more.  Now more focus on AI success. \n* They looked at spending during 2020 reduced costs greatly during this period. Monthly cash burn is half now.  \n* 2021 coming with growth and recovery. \n* Core team is strengthened.  \n* Increased AI expenses, FIS parnership strengthened. AI segment rev increased 15x. \n* Secured their financial runway with funding. \n\n **Max Lee Head of AI :** \n\n* Saibre is a complete AI bot solution.  \n* We're on the shoulders of giants. Learned from previous systems. \n* Nugene was a jack of all trades.  But required manpower and scaling was hard. Custom coding was a problem. \n* Took the best parts and built Saibre. \n* This AI is getting built to challenge all AI projects. Thousands of images are required to separate a dog picture from a cat picture for an AI. All need to be labeled and requires a lot of data. Other models requires vast amounts of data. If the data is noisy or mislabeled system can't learn. \n* Current SSFT IP is like a young child. You give a child one example and the kid learns from a single experience. \n* Kid understands that its a ball even if he partially sees the ball. The new IP is working similar to that. \n* Future algorithms will take advantage of this basis.\n* Max is also getting inspiration from biology and neurology. \n* Less time to deploy with less resources\n\n**Caroline Zaborowski - VP of Data Science:** \n\n* All AI systems need datascientists. And Datascientists need efficient, easy to use and flexible systems\n* Current systems are time consuming. Saibre is reducing time to value. \n* They redesigned the workflow, less time is spent on data cleaning, reusing the components and more collab between data scientists which is really important. \n* Can be used by experienced data scientist and a regular user. \n* SSFT AI solution is far more adoptable by clients. \n\nSo there's still a lot to talk and tell about Sonasoft. The story is long.\n\nThe future of this company have 2 possible directions in my view.\n\n1- Will become a one stop platform for AI solutions that all size of enterprises can use. AI is not for the most sophisticated or the most wealth and big anymore. They are bringing it to the masses.   \nThey will be listed in Nasdaq and keep on growing from there into a multi-billion dollar company.\n\n2- As soon as they are listed on Nasdaq, with a working product and massive potential they will be acquired by giants.\n\nBut If you are ready to invest for your future with optimum risk/reward, SSFT share price has found it's bottom at $0.10, has been here for a while but not for so long. Buy it and HODL guys. \n\nMy first target is above $5 but I wont be selling it all at that level. We're only at the beginning.\n\nNow go!",

        "selftext": "I saw some concerns on twitter about $STIC / $BARK performance once the deal closes.  I did a quick review and wanted to highlight the following for folks.  \n\n* [$STIC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24STIC&amp;src=cashtag_click) / [$BARK](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BARK&amp;src=cashtag_click) there's been some concern voiced about holding [@barkbox](https://twitter.com/barkbox) through merger. A few things to note.  \n* First, Fidelity and Federated are long only anchors in the $200M PIPE.  They will likely be net buyers post closing\n* Second, not only has Fidelity anchored the PIPE, they BOUGHT a 15.6% position in the SPAC before the deal has closed.  This is VERY bullish as they rarely do this (see $SKIN) \n* Finally the PIPE subscriber agreement did not restrict investors from shorting and boxing their positions. Similar to [$GENI](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GENI&amp;src=cashtag_click) and [$IPOE](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IPOE&amp;src=cashtag_click), any fast money hedge funds in the PIPE have likely already boxed their shares and won't be shorting at deal close.\n\nI would love to see an updated shareholder list to see if more long only money has come in... but at least the factors above are positive.  Hope this helps.  Good luck to all and caveat emptor. \n\nDisclaimer: I'm not an investment advisor, do you own due diligence.  \nDisclosure: I have no dog in the hunt!",

        "selftext": "* A few thoughts as we head into the shareholder vote this Friday 5/28 for the deal:\n* Finally pulled together a valuation comparison of Barkbox vs. its pet services peers:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 2rqahcuhid171...*\n\nLooking at revenue multiples, I think a stock price of $13-$15 is justifiable.\n\n* While Barkbox has not yet scaled to profitability, it has pretty high gross margins of 58-60% vs. CHWY 26%, FRPT 42% and TRUP at 16% (pet insurance)\n   * Barkbox's higher gross margins could support a higher valuation \n* Reiterating deal closing considerations from my earlier post:\n   * Fidelity and Federated are fundamental long only anchors in the $200M PIPE. They will likely be net buyers post closing\n   * Not only has Fidelity anchored the PIPE, they BOUGHT a 15.6% position in the SPAC after the deal was announced. This is VERY bullish as they rarely do this. In $VSPR/$SKIN, they anchored the PIPE and also purchased a 13.2% position in the SPAC after the deal was announced. \n   * $STIC's PIPE subscriber agreement did not restrict investors from shorting and boxing their positions. Similar to [$GENI](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GENI&amp;src=cashtag_click) and [$IPOE](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IPOE&amp;src=cashtag_click), any fast money hedge funds in the PIPE have likely already boxed their shares, which should remove some of the potential selling pressure at deal close.\n\nBased off of these factors and the Barkbox's solid quarterly results and ongoing positive credit card spend data trends, I decided to take a small position the commons today and picked up some warrants a week ago. Good luck to all.  \n\nDisclaimer: I'm not an investment advisor, do you own due diligence.\n\nDisclosure: I now have a dog in the hunt.  I am long 20,000 commons and 8,355 warrants",

        "selftext": "-\ud83d\ude80Mexico/US P3 trials and Price outlook \ud83d\ude80-\nNvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days probable, end of June worst case) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July-August for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent or close to Moderna.  Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects)  Chart on Contracts nvax has and what future prices/MC is expected to be is down below in the \"DD literature section\" at the bottom\n\n\n\n-\ud83d\ude80 Intro to Protein and mRNA type Vaccines\ud83d\ude80 -\nProtein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...\n\n             \n                           \n-\ud83d\ude80Differences how Protein vs.mRNA vaxs work\ud83d\ude80 -\nImagine if the whole spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize it to understand the whole picture, and helps modify your Messenger RNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates  one piece of that picture it can still recognize the virus due to being able to see various other parts of the picture. In the mRNA method using one portion of the picture as virus mutates,  it becomes easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine ... that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. .... And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein.\n\n\n\n-\ud83d\ude80 Safety, Side Effects, and Adjuvenants  \ud83d\ude80-\n Every vaccine uses what's called an adjuvenant. This basically boosts the vaccines effectiveness. There's different kinds, and every company uses one in their vaccine. Not all are created equal. What makes Nvaxs adjuvenant (called Matrix M) so special is its the only plant based (soapbark tree) adjuvenant out there, and is the least irritating. This adjuvenant has been tested on pregnant women in the past and pases with the flying colors. mRNA adjuvenant vaccines use common molecules found in viruses and bacteria that stimulate our immune system. This approach has not been fully tested on pregnant women long term. One of the most common types that were used in the past were aluminum salts. They were found not to be \"harmful\" but we also didn't know enough about them and how they affect us on a grander scale. A lot of anti-vaxxers are against aluminum salts and giving it to the children. This is why Nvax will be the perfect solution for anti-vaxxers, children and the eldery that want something completely safe. Just using the term plant-based in a vaccine adds a good connotation, let alone the stronger protection/immune responce it provides. As far as what the virus is grown in,  Nvax uses a moth based formula. So it's insect and plant-based. Sounds like the Karen's will love this! Ultra safe. \n\n\nAdjuvenants work by creating an irritation/inflammation at the injection site, This in turn helps the vaccines be more effective apon administration. This is what makes you feel sore after getting a vaccine and specifically amount of adjuvenate that being used.  NVAX only needs to use 5mM vs  mRNA type vaccines use anywhere from 50 to 100 mM of adjuvenant. Therefore when getting a mRNA type vaccines you get a much stronger side effect due to the large amount being used. This is proof how effective nvax is because they need to use so little to be to get a strong immune response. Hence why they have the best data and we're called a first in class vaccine. In conjunction with how much adjuvenant is being used you can also say it directly alters the safety profile. Use too much and you get too many bad reactions. This is why Nvax has one of the best safety profiles out there.Hands down \ud83d\ude4c Bottom of my post is a link with a lot of the data charted out that includes all the side effects of each vaccine charted.\n\n\n Lastly because the amount of ajuvenant used in mRNA type vaccines can only fit one maybe two strains max before throwing off the safety profile and risking not getting approval.  If they do use two strains they have to use less adjuvenant for both to combine them, meaning you're not going to get complete protection for each strain from the vaccine.  Nvax does not have this problem because of the such small amount they use, they could combine up to five different strains without an issue.... And right now with it being so clear that covid strains are going to keep mutating we need vaccines thay can cover multiple strains and give full protection on each one. Sometimes one strain can cover multiple strains but depending on where the strain mutates, a bad mutation will require addressing each strain individually and putting them together in one vaccine. Since you can't get four strains in one mRNA vaccine this puts us out at a clear advantage down the road when people need to do booster shots, and don't want to get multiple vaccines through the year.  So all in all it's clear Nvax adjuvenant separates itself from the pack and performs much better then other kinds on Safety, Effectiveness, Coverage of all strains and convenience of less shots in a given year.\n\n\n-\ud83d\ude80 Logistics and Storage.\ud83d\ude80 -\nNvax can be stored in a regular refrigerator, and can be left out to sit out in room temperature for a while while you're vaccinating people. A special ultra low temp freezer is needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers. This is a majority of the world, not to mention the intricate ways you got to handle it so increases your distribution cost because you need special warehouses, dry ice etc. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.\n\n                 \n- \ud83d\ude80 Scientific conclusion \ud83d\ude80  -\nSo far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). As of now Nvax elicits the strongest immune response out of any vaccine with the highest efficacy. Another thing that's really important to know is every trial is not built the same. Every company creates different end points for their trials. Some are looking for severe disease, some are counting everything mild, medium and severe. Nvax counted every single possible infection whether it was mild medium or severe. Case in point j&amp;j didn't have very good efficacy in South Africa so what they did was they only counted the most severe cases so they could say that their vaccine works. (Great you won't die but you'll get so sick you wish you did).\n When looking at mild cases their vaccine didn't work very well. This is why it's always hard to tell apples to apples when you look at efficacy numbers because every trial is different. So you have to look at the devil in the details. \n\n\nIt's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines. This puts other competitors far behind us, giving nvax a economic moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing! They teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy which of P3 is the same it's good enough for approval). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine, and phase 3 is already complete and now they're moving on for approval. They will running a trial on their flu and covid combo vaccine, and once launched they could double the price of current covid vaccine due to being a 2 for 1. Moderna and Pfizer are also looking at a combo shot but they haven't even started trials yet. The problem is they can't even finish their trials because flu is non-existent right now so be very hard for them to get trials done for a long time. \n\n\n\n -\ud83d\ude80 Investment Thesis &amp; Financials  \ud83d\ude80-\nNvax is pretty much de-risked at this point vs where they were a year ago. Yes you could buy other biotechs that can go up 20x, but they are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up, generally takes years for companies to get to this point if not decades.) They have all successful trials, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for \"operation warp speed\" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment; where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said \" all manufacturing now is done and set in place, there are no more issues or glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success\"\n\n\nThey're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. The before Memorial day weekend on one trading day before market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close.  Representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. \n Fidelity &amp; Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. \n\n\nA link for future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract is at the bottom of the post in DD literature section. It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June, anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. \n\n\n\n -\ud83d\ude80My Positions \ud83d\ude80 -\nAs far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale as well \ud83d\ude48 but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG  (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions with the price chart mentioned above. My screen name on stocktwits is Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvaxz feel free and drop a follow if you want up to date info. But honestly the whole board is worth following there's so much good DD on there, we have a really strong tight knit group of longs that help each other with DD. \n\n\nAlso below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO, where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June, but he said he thinks it could be earlier.  So sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. \n\nI expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.\n\n\n\n -\ud83d\ude80DD supporting literature\ud83d\ude80 -\nI've included a couple messages down below explaining more in detail about what I talked about in case there's any questions.

Also wanted to warn any traders so it doesn't happen to them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, I have some experience trading and used to use Robinhood since I traveled a lot for work. Today I opened up my account and had some positions long still left in there and some cash. I saw a play that I wanted to make on the SPY and bought 4 $410 calls at around 2:15 PM. I was watching the VIX very closely and saw a reason to hold them. I saw the exit that I wanted, went to sell them around 3:20ish and found that Robinhood had already sold my play at the lowest possible point, causing me a loss of 50% in what should have been a 230% gain for my play.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nAfter contacted their support, this is the response I got.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nHow is this even legal?

        "selftext": "* PIPEs are Private Investments in Public Equity. PIPEs were a recent innovation in SPACs that allowed \n   * A) sponsors to raise more capital outside of the dilutive sponsor promote, \n   * B) provide a buffer to meet deal minimum cash conditions and \n   * C) most importantly enable the separation of shareholder vote from redemption feature by addressing the minimum cash condition. \n* Those last two points TRANSFORMED the SPAC market in that redemption-led vote failures became a thing of the past (a regular occurrence back in the day).\n* By utilizing PIPEs, sponsors were able to raise enough capital for the target and give SPAC IPO investors the ability to vote for a deal while also redeeming their shares for $10 + interest. \n* PIPE investors used to consist primarily of capital markets / direct investing / arbitrage desks of hedge funds. The goal of these funds were to make some reasonable return with the lowest possible risk. \n* These investors may have demanded a discount to the $10 trust price, warrant coverage, convertible security, etc. These guys were not looking to take a fundamental bet on the company but were purely facilitators of capital. \n* Valuation of course did matter and PIPE investors helped provide a feedback mechanism of what was overvalued (I'M PASSING ON THIS!) and what was reasonable (OK, I'LL TAKE A PIECE OF THIS DOWN).\n* In earlier years the quality of sponsors and targets was spotty to say the least, however that started to change in 2020 as SPACs started becoming a more mainstream product attracting higher quality sponsors and targets.  As a result of this, the structure and composition of PIPEs started to change. \n* Higher quality, longer-term \"sticky\" money like Fidelity and Blackrock along with strategic investors started to participate in PIPEs. \n* PIPE pricing also shifted from discounts/warrants/structured securities towards straight equity of $10 or even at a premium like $CCIV or $RSVA. \n* Hey these PIPE guys are making a lot of money! Well there is no free lunch for PIPE investors. While they do benefit from being \"brought over the wall\" to diligence potential SPAC targets before they are known to the public (a good source of those pesky leaks) and help set the valuation--as we've all seen, deals fall well below $10 after merger close.\n* Once a PIPE investor makes a commitment to participate in a deal, they are LOCKED and LOADED. That hot EVTOL company they thought would MEME? Well at deal close they have to wire the funds they committed and now they're looking at big losses. \n* This may be fine for longer term or strategic PIPE investors, but for fast money hedge funds they will move quickly to cut losses. Hedge funds will look to short stock when allowed by the subscription agreement to \"box\" their long position and limit downside. \n* When can hedge funds short against long PIPE shares? Check the subscription agreement filed (8-K) at the time of deal announcement.  \n   * It'll either explicitly state that PIPE investors can't short stock until deal close (most deals) \n   * or won't say anything which means PIPE investors CAN short stock anytime ($DMYD, $IPOE). \n   * There are also hybrid structures out there like $MUDS where PIPE holders can short up to 50% of their holdings prior to deal close if $MUDS is above $15. \n* Back when SPACs were all working, these hedge funds may have let positions \"run\" and not hedged their positions. However given the recent market environment they're much more aggressive in locking in profits / mitigating losses. \n* When a deal closes and nears or breaks $10, perversely it forces the hedge funds to short causing more downward pressure. For the smart investor (such as you), you can take advantage of this technical selling to get into selective situations for cheaply. \n* THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS LOCK UPS ON PIPES. PIPE investors are only limited in selling their physical shares because they have to be registered via S-1 process. This usually takes 45-60 days post closing. Once the S-1 goes effective, everyone in the PIPE is free to sell.\n* One silver lining to the hedge funds shorting shares to box their long PIPE position - there won't be any selling pressure from them once the S-1 goes effective because they're already \"flat\" and will close out their short position by collapsing w/ registered PIPE shares.\n* Shorting prior to the S-1 going effective is not without risk. Borrow can get really tight leading to increasingly expensive cost and risk of recall. Just ask the guys that were short NKLA with unstable stock and covered at +$90 - yeesh.  This is why many PIPE investors will seek stable \"term borrow\" and pay annualized rates of 10-30%.\n* PIPE investors are not all committed long-term investors, but they play a critical role in the capital raising function and valuation setting for SPACs. While it may not seem like they are on your side, they are more aligned with you than the sponsors!\n* PIPE investor's role as a price discovery mechanism is part of the reason we are seeing a trickle of deals now... bring us some cheaper tendies please! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, do your own due diligence!",

        "selftext": "-\ud83d\ude80Mexico/US P3 trials and Price outlook \ud83d\ude80-\nNvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days probable, end of June worst case) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July-August for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent or close to Moderna.  Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects)  Chart on Contracts nvax has and what future prices/MC is expected to be is down below in the \"DD literature section\" at the bottom\n\n\n\n-\ud83d\ude80 Intro to Protein and mRNA type Vaccines\ud83d\ude80 -\nProtein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...\n\n             \n                           \n-\ud83d\ude80Differences how Protein vs.mRNA vaxs work\ud83d\ude80 -\nImagine if the whole spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize it to understand the whole picture, and helps modify your Messenger RNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates  one piece of that picture it can still recognize the virus due to being able to see various other parts of the picture. In the mRNA method using one portion of the picture as virus mutates,  it becomes easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine ... that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. .... And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein.\n\n\n\n-\ud83d\ude80 Safety, Side Effects, and Adjuvenants  \ud83d\ude80-\n Every vaccine uses what's called an adjuvenant. This basically boosts the vaccines effectiveness. There's different kinds, and every company uses one in their vaccine. Not all are created equal. What makes Nvaxs adjuvenant (called Matrix M) so special is its the only plant based (soapbark tree) adjuvenant out there, and is the least irritating. This adjuvenant has been tested on pregnant women in the past and pases with the flying colors. mRNA adjuvenant vaccines use common molecules found in viruses and bacteria that stimulate our immune system. This approach has not been fully tested on pregnant women long term. One of the most common types that were used in the past were aluminum salts. They were found not to be \"harmful\" but we also didn't know enough about them and how they affect us on a grander scale. A lot of anti-vaxxers are against aluminum salts and giving it to the children. This is why Nvax will be the perfect solution for anti-vaxxers, children and the eldery that want something completely safe. Just using the term plant-based in a vaccine adds a good connotation, let alone the stronger protection/immune responce it provides. As far as what the virus is grown in,  Nvax uses a moth based formula. So it's insect and plant-based. Sounds like the Karen's will love this! Ultra safe. \n\n\nAdjuvenants work by creating an irritation/inflammation at the injection site, This in turn helps the vaccines be more effective apon administration. This is what makes you feel sore after getting a vaccine and specifically amount of adjuvenate that being used.  NVAX only needs to use 5mM vs  mRNA type vaccines use anywhere from 50 to 100 mM of adjuvenant. Therefore when getting a mRNA type vaccines you get a much stronger side effect due to the large amount being used. This is proof how effective nvax is because they need to use so little to be to get a strong immune response. Hence why they have the best data and we're called a first in class vaccine. In conjunction with how much adjuvenant is being used you can also say it directly alters the safety profile. Use too much and you get too many bad reactions. This is why Nvax has one of the best safety profiles out there.Hands down \ud83d\ude4c Bottom of my post is a link with a lot of the data charted out that includes all the side effects of each vaccine charted.\n\n\n Lastly because the amount of ajuvenant used in mRNA type vaccines can only fit one maybe two strains max before throwing off the safety profile and risking not getting approval.  If they do use two strains they have to use less adjuvenant for both to combine them, meaning you're not going to get complete protection for each strain from the vaccine.  Nvax does not have this problem because of the such small amount they use, they could combine up to five different strains without an issue.... And right now with it being so clear that covid strains are going to keep mutating we need vaccines thay can cover multiple strains and give full protection on each one. Sometimes one strain can cover multiple strains but depending on where the strain mutates, a bad mutation will require addressing each strain individually and putting them together in one vaccine. Since you can't get four strains in one mRNA vaccine this puts us out at a clear advantage down the road when people need to do booster shots, and don't want to get multiple vaccines through the year.  So all in all it's clear Nvax adjuvenant separates itself from the pack and performs much better then other kinds on Safety, Effectiveness, Coverage of all strains and convenience of less shots in a given year.\n\n\n-\ud83d\ude80 Logistics and Storage.\ud83d\ude80 -\nNvax can be stored in a regular refrigerator, and can be left out to sit out in room temperature for a while while you're vaccinating people. A special ultra low temp freezer is needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers. This is a majority of the world, not to mention the intricate ways you got to handle it so increases your distribution cost because you need special warehouses, dry ice etc. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.\n\n                 \n- \ud83d\ude80 Scientific conclusion \ud83d\ude80  -\nSo far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). As of now Nvax elicits the strongest immune response out of any vaccine with the highest efficacy. Another thing that's really important to know is every trial is not built the same. Every company creates different end points for their trials. Some are looking for severe disease, some are counting everything mild, medium and severe. Nvax counted every single possible infection whether it was mild medium or severe. Case in point j&amp;j didn't have very good efficacy in South Africa so what they did was they only counted the most severe cases so they could say that their vaccine works. (Great you won't die but you'll get so sick you wish you did).\n When looking at mild cases their vaccine didn't work very well. This is why it's always hard to tell apples to apples when you look at efficacy numbers because every trial is different. So you have to look at the devil in the details. \n\n\nIt's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines. This puts other competitors far behind us, giving nvax a economic moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing! They teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy which of P3 is the same it's good enough for approval). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine, and phase 3 is already complete and now they're moving on for approval. They will running a trial on their flu and covid combo vaccine, and once launched they could double the price of current covid vaccine due to being a 2 for 1. Moderna and Pfizer are also looking at a combo shot but they haven't even started trials yet. The problem is they can't even finish their trials because flu is non-existent right now so be very hard for them to get trials done for a long time. \n\n\n\n -\ud83d\ude80 Investment Thesis &amp; Financials  \ud83d\ude80-\nNvax is pretty much de-risked at this point vs where they were a year ago. Yes you could buy other biotechs that can go up 20x, but they are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up, generally takes years for companies to get to this point if not decades.) They have all successful trials, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for \"operation warp speed\" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment; where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said \" all manufacturing now is done and set in place, there are no more issues or glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success\"\n\n\nThey're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. The before Memorial day weekend on one trading day before market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close.  Representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. \n Fidelity &amp; Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. \n\n\nA link for future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract is at the bottom of the post in DD literature section. It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June, anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. \n\n\n\n -\ud83d\ude80My Positions \ud83d\ude80 -\nAs far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale as well \ud83d\ude48 but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG  (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions with the price chart mentioned above. My screen name on stocktwits is Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvaxz feel free and drop a follow if you want up to date info. But honestly the whole board is worth following there's so much good DD on there, we have a really strong tight knit group of longs that help each other with DD. \n\n\nAlso below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO, where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June, but he said he thinks it could be earlier.  So sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. \n\nI expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.\n\n\n\n -\ud83d\ude80DD supporting literature\ud83d\ude80 -\nI've included a couple messages down below explaining more in detail about what I talked about in case there's any questions.

I own it across three different brokers Robinhood, Fidelity, and my main broker Merrill Lynch (Edge). Not to confuse anyone, with the screenshot which shows a **$2.33 Million Cost Basis.** (This is simply the broker that holds the majority of the position with an average of $5.98) - *Total shares owned: 400,339*\n\n**This company** is currently the #4 stock with the highest **short interest at 34.53%.** Although this may not be my main motive for this investment; as most stocks have a high short interest for a reason, it's definitely a bonus. It would not hurt to see a short squeeze happen. Anyways, in my personal opinion, I strongly believe this company is being overlooked and trading very low. I don't want to get too into it, but a company like this is not as easy to take down given that they own PP and DC. (They are also the #2 largest company in the field under CC) I also noticed that even with Biden trying to abolish this sector they keep finding loopholes around it. I noticed they keep making \"temporary contracts\", or contracts just keep being continued like recently with Youngstown. And, yes I am very well aware of their high debt but this is a very common ratio within REITs. There are also a few solutions to this. (Which they are currently working on). Long story short, I can see this stock rising a lot as we get closer to the end of the year. I certainly believe it can go above $10 ( even $15 wouldn't be a surprise.)\n\n**In the last 20 years**, we have not seen such high activity on the border either, and no one is talking about it.

        "selftext": "This post kinda goes against the grain of this sub but I'll try and make it fill the mold as well.\n\nA lot of people got into investing through GME and a certain dog-themed investing medium, which is great. I think everyone should be investing their money instead of having it parked in a checking account or under their mattress.\n\nHowever, what I also see is a lot of people trying to get rich quick or treating the stock market more like Las Vegas than a tool to help you manage your retirement and financial health (yeah, yeah, go back to r/investing ya old fart) but *here me out for just a second*.\n\nWhen you look at the stock market and go: \"**Ok dude, there's 5,000+ companies out there what do I even invest in?** **I might as well just follow the crowd of WSB** and invest in whatever everyone else is investing in here.\" \n\n**That's a good start**, but I'd beg you to **ask yourself what are YOU knowledgeable about**? What's **your \"edge\"**? \n\nIf you work in the oil and gas industry you must hear rumors or keep up with the news/know the industry a lot better than someone who works in the biopharmaceuticals industry, right? **Start there.** \n\nFollowing WSB is a good way to dip your feet but in order to really take your investing to the next starting block you want to start digging into companies that compete directly against your employer or look at suppliers/peripheral companies that you know that feed your industry.\n\nThis is heavily, heavily how Peter Lynch invested when he managed the Magellan fund at Fidelity. If Warren Buffet is the \"if you don't know how to pick individuals stocks just buy ETFs\" kinda guy, Peter Lynch is his foil. He wants people to get smart about picking individual stocks. Go check out some youtube videos of him (highly recommend).\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to throw that tip out there. Good luck everyone and HAVE FUN while you do it.

        "selftext": "I started investing (in GME) thanks to one of my male friends last year. I made a little money to play with. Now, to this day, 99% of the people I discuss investing with are MALE. I love my dudes but I plan to have a wife AND a boyfriend and I need to know why so many other females in the world aren\u2019t engaged in retail investing!\n\nI began asking myself the question, \u201cSelf, why are so many of my female friends afraid to engage in retail investing?\u201d  \n\nTo be fair, many of my female friends have money invested in some fashion, either due to their job (401K, IRA, etc., ) or their husband/boyfriend. But when I mention downloading any cryptocurrency trading platform and teaching them (and they always seem interested initally!) \u2013 ultimately NO TAKERS!!I started investing (in GME) thanks to one of my male friends last year. I made a little money to play with. Now, to this day, 99% of the people I discuss investing with are MALE. I love my dudes but I plan to have a wife AND a boyfriend and I need to know why so many other females in the world aren\u2019t engaged in retail investing!\n\nI can see the number is going up overall, but after doing some DD on the topic I came to the conclusion many woman are just more afraid to risk their limited funds (i.e., inheritance, stimulus check, the extra $100 from your paycheck, etc.) engaging in retail investing.  \n\nThe reasons for this are many but if you are a fellow Lady Ape, or just another ape who feels their 2 cents is worth adding into the pot, please comment on these statements and conclusions made and drawn by these (big name) sites in the articles on the most recent research on this topic. I want to know why you \u2013 a female-identifying individual reading this on Reddit!! \u2013 or a male who also has some input here!!\u2013 agree or disagree with the things the \u201cresearch\u201d is saying.\u201d  \n\nAlso, if you are a Lady Ape, generally, why did you start investing and in what? Or why haven\u2019t you started yet (though you\u2019re clearly on r/WSB reading this post!)?\n\nOkay, getting down to the meat of things, here\u2019s what I was able to find (most recent numbers-wise) on this topic \u2026 (quoted text is in **bold**; all sources are listed following the material(s) referenced from said source(s)).\n\n\\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~  \n\nIn May 2019 the CFA Group did a piece which focused on the gap between men and women who invest in the stock market. They basically said more men are engaged in retail trading than women.  \n\nThey concluded: **\u201cBy 2025, there will be no meaningful gender gap in stock market participation in the United States. Why do we believe this? For three principal reasons: The financial industry is shifting to products that women are more interested in; new technology is making it easier for women to invest; and the institutional investing gap will begin to close.\u201d**\n\nConcluding: **\u201cThe investing gap will close much sooner than anticipated.\u201d**\n\n([https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2019/05/22/the-equality-equation-three-reasons-why-the-gender-investing-gap-is-closing/](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2019/05/22/the-equality-equation-three-reasons-why-the-gender-investing-gap-is-closing/))\n\n\\~ \\~ \\~ \\~\\~ \\~ \\~ \\~\\~ \\~ \\~ \\~\n\nIn December 2020 Financial Times looked at this too finding **\u201cWomen are signing up to investment platforms at faster rates than men \u2026 Investors have registered on platforms in record numbers since March and trading volumes have remained heightened since the market sell-off earlier this year.\u201d**  \n\nYea? Well where are all the women I know? Not on these platforms, that\u2019s where.  \n\nSo in essence they are saying that there are fewer women investing overall but there is also a major increase in the amount of women signing up more and more with mobile and online retail trading platforms. Further, that when women invest they tend to be more conservative and take less risk, which can, in the long term, produce greater returns than many of the investment strategies (i.e., riskier ones) taken by males on the same platform.\n\nSo they pointed out that women actually tend to hold more cash than men yet due to other demands of life faced more often by women than men (aka, childcare, house chores, \u201csoccer mom,\u201d etc.) they overall have less time to invest  \n\n\\*(READ: to learn how to invest wisely as a \u201clittle guy,\u201d to be able to take the time to listen to live streams of pertinent folks, to be able to spend time watching the tickets for various stocks, cryptocurrency, etc.)\\*\n\nThey concluded: **\u201cNew accounts opened by women in that group grew at a faster rate than men. These new platforms have created a business out of making investment simpler and quicker, stripping out jargon and putting a priority on ease of use. \u2018The issue of convenience is really important,\u2019 said Ms O\u2019Connor. Ms Hechler-Fayd\u2019herbe said: \u2018Women are really looking for advice that is extremely practical\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009They like to go straight to the point.\u2019\u201d**\n\n([https://www.ft.com/content/36d9d064-d259-4d45-a637-fe2114c630e1](https://www.ft.com/content/36d9d064-d259-4d45-a637-fe2114c630e1))\n\n\\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~\n\nForex drew this conclusion:\n\n\u201c**The most important lesson to be learned is that the primary root causes of unprofitable trading are overconfidence and indecision. It is great to have confidence that you will become a profitable trader, but you need to be realistic about the fact that you will almost certainly have to work through a period of hard struggle to get there.\u201d**  \n\n([https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2018/07/do-women-men-trade-differently/100605](https://www.dailyforex.com/forex-articles/2018/07/do-women-men-trade-differently/100605))\n\n\\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~\\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~  \n\nI also looked into what Robinhood had to say about this (as they were the app a **male** friend of mine first introduced me to a little over a year ago which I used to buy GME, i.e., the purchase that started it all for this here lady ape.)\n\nThey conducted a survey **\u201cto learn more about women\u2019s attitudes, fears, behaviors and goals toward investing.\u201d** They published the findings in October 2020. They found \u201c**almost half of the women \u2026 surveyed (45%) have a favorable view of investing, but there are still barriers that prevent some from participating in the markets.\u201d**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201c**Almost half of the women we surveyed haven\u2019t invested because they don\u2019t know where to start.\u201d**\n\n([https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2020/10/22/the-state-of-women-investors-today](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2020/10/22/the-state-of-women-investors-today))\n\n**\\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~** \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ **\\~ \\~ \\~ \\~ \\~** \\~ \\~ \\~  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally I reviewed an article from Investitopia from January 2021. There they pointed out at the beginning how Janet Yellen was (at the time) positioned to be the first female secretary of the Treasury (she currently holds this position as of the time of posting). And we all know how that\u2019s gone so far \u2026 (need I say more \u2026) \u2026 (can you tell I like ellipses!) \u2026  \t\t\n\nThey emphasize, just like the other sources, how female retail investors remain a minority. They reference a study by CerullAssociates and Phoenix Marketing which found that **\u201conly 28% of \t\twomen own stocks compared to 44% of men,\u201d** and **\u201conly 28% of women want to manage their own investments compared to 38% of men (according to The Wall Street Journal).\u201d** \n\nSpecifically, they mention Fidelity Investment data that shows **\u201cabout 67% of women say they are more engaged in managing their money since the start of the pandemic.\u201d**  \n\nThe article concludes stating:\n\n\u201c*While many of the financial tools and educational resources have existed for years, the COVID-19 pandemic may provide the urgency for female investors to take advantage of them and become savvier, more active market participants and planners for their financial future.\u201d*  \n\n([https://www.investopedia.com/wanted-more-female-investors-5095994](https://www.investopedia.com/wanted-more-female-investors-5095994))\n\nSo, if you are a woman, what got you here? What type of trading do you enagage in and on which platform(s)? If not, why not (and why are you in r/WSB?)?  \n\nOkay, I look forward to comments!\n\n\\-pug\\_mother",

There are also probably employees that have sold shares as well that might have increased the float, but let's assume they are offset by long term holders like Glenview and Fidelity in the SPAC IPO and PIPE.\n* So the math is 12.8M / (41.4M + 17.5M) ....

        "selftext": "Hi there,\n\nI have been pondering selling a \"hot stock\" that is at a peak, because part of it was an RSU (past the 6 month mark so no fees), and I am curious if I should.\n\nI do think it will go down soon, but I also know it is useless to try to time a market/stock. However, I don't feel comfortable with the amount of stock I have in one stock (if that makes sense). So I would like to sell 3k of this fidelity stock, to buy 3k of a vanguard ETF.\n\nI could wait a few months and just add 3k to the ETF in vanguard and not sell any of the fidelity stock, but I worry I will lose some of the free money from the RSU + stock at it's peak.\n\nThis is also the first time I've been in this situation, with a decent emergency fund, maxed 401k, planning to contribute to both mine and my spouse's roth, and HSA maxed end of 2021 (hopefully if no health issues).\n\nSo now I'm wondering if it's worth it to start looking at the stocks and moving things around. But, again, I don't know what I'm doing with stocks, so hesitant to sell/buy any except a couple hundred on meme stocks and basic investing through my job/company match.\n\nTL:DR- Good/bad idea to sell a RSU stock that is at a peak from Fidelity, to take the money and put in Vanguard ETF. Why/why not?",

I realize that this thinking flies in the face of the \"time in the market, as opposed to timing the market\" strategy. \n\nSo, the bulk of my retirement is in a Vanguard Target Date Fund, which I contribute to monthly. I also have a legacy retirement account from a former employer, which earns 4 percent annually. I am considering rolling over those funds to my Target Date IRA though. Thoughts?\n\nI also have 6 figures sitting in a cash reserve account earning a paltry 45 basis points; wish I had been more aggressive in March 2020. Anyhow, my thinking is to invest a portion of those funds in the vehicles below now - taxable account - and leave some dry powder for potential corrections:\n\n- Emerging Markets (FEMKX): I have roughly 5% exposure in my Target Date Fund, but am looking to possibly increase based on future market forecasts. Thoughts?\n\n- REIT's (VGSLX/VNQ): I don't have any exposure here and like the potential, as well as the dividend yield. Thoughts? \n\n- Disruptor Fund (FGDFX): A Fidelity alternative to Cathie Wood's disruptive funds. \n\n- Other: Alternative / Renewable Energy, Cannabis, and Biotech Funds/ETF's: Thoughts?\n\nFinally, any suggestions on lump sum investments in the above (others) now or dollar cost averaging over time? \n\nBig thanks in advance!",

        "selftext": "Hello retards, \n\nI had a question nagging at me ever since Vlad the impaler and old Thomas Petterfy  stopped my flawless dip buy of my favorite stock @ 100 a share on Jan 28th. As I sat there enraged on the toilet slamming my phone screen with my thumbs I was struck with a thought....how do I know that my shares are mine? These shares are actually owned by my broker, and only in my shady ass broker's books does it say I am the owner. is there a way for me to own my shares without having to worry about a broker as a middleman? who does that? why do they do that? what are the pros and cons?\n\nAnd so today, rather than do my work I finally decided to find out.  So I called fidelity and the customer service rep trotted to the back office to ask his smart accounting nerds because he didn't have a fucking clue either.  Turns out becoming a registered share holder is done through what's called a transfer agent, and these agents are selected by the issuing company.  The transfer agent and the registrar (the DTC) handle the registration of shares in the direct registration system (DRS) which is some sort of electronic book keeping system meant to keep track of who owns what shares. He was kind enough to give me the name and phone number of GME's transfer agent:\n\ncomputershare 800-522-6645\n\nI then had a web chat with a saucy looking customer rep named Donna A. who told me exactly how I can transfer my shares from my brokerage account to establish an account with computershare:\n\n*The broker will need to submit a request for a DTC* [*W/T*](https://z1.le.liveperson.net/a/54722259/#W/T) *Transmission. Computershare cannot initiate this transfer. If the broker is unfamiliar with the DTC Transmission process, they should contact their back office for assistance or contact their representative at DTC.*\n\n*The broker will initiate the request through their back office using the following shareholder information:*\n\n*1 The complete name of the Transfer Agent: Computershare Investor Services.*  \n*2 Tax ID Number (TIN).*  \n*3 The exact registration (complete name and address) on the Computershare account. (If the shareholder does not have an existing Computershare account, provide the exact registration as it appears on the brokerage account.)*  \n*4 Exact number of shares to be transferred (whole shares only).*  \n*5 The full CUSIP number of the stock holding company.*  \n*Note: If the registration, address, and SSN match the shares will go into the existing account, if anything is off it will open a new account.*\n\nby \"existing account\" she's referring to an existing account with computershare, which I opened this morning by buying a single share through the directstock purchase program.  this is the second way in  which you can acquire shares in your name, buy them through your account with computershare.  now this process seems less desirable to me. Since buying a share was the only way I could figure out how to open an account through their website (which their phone system directed me to do), I entered my personal info, tax information and a checking account and routing number and then selected how much money I wanted to invest.  I picked $150 for about one share.  I was notified that my purchase will be bought on the market 5 days from now (at whatever price it is), and settled in my account 2 days after (well jesus that's slow).  Donna says they will buy whatever amount of shares they can get for the dollar amount I selected (including partial shares).\n\nIt should be noted here, that to sell the shares through the transfer agent computershare is also an arduously slow process.  you can submit a sell order that gets issued to the market on a predetermined schedule (say 5 days from the day you initiate it). I can also transfer them out to one of my brokerage accounts to sell them.  Fidelity warned me that this could take days to transfer, because it requires the request and coordination of individuals in the two back offices to effectuate (similar to when I transferred my shares from one brokerage to another it took 48 hours or so).   I warned them that I might be retarded enough to casually ignore such a warning and if I ever needed to sell which was highly unlikely, well then those buyers won't mind waiting a couple of days for my shares to clear.\n\nso you may be asking why would someone do this, why would they abandon their broker and restrict their ability to quickly buy and sell their shares. There's a few decent articles if you search Direct registration system (thebalance dot com) in google but essentially it was created for:\n\n* investors who want counter party risk against your stockbroker going bankrupt, your claim is with the issuing company, not the brokerage so you don't have to deal with SIPC or the hassle of getting your account back afterwards\n* removing the middleman from delivering annual reports, 10k filings, proxy statements, voting info etc. since your name and address are recorded directly these materials are mailed or emailed to you promptly as the shareholder of records\n* inability for brokers to lend your shares.  for dividend stocks if your shares are lent for shorting the dividend can become an unqualified \"payment in lieu of dividends\" increasing your tax burden. The brokers don't have your shares, can't use them for collateral can't do shit with them because they are yours\n* I have not investigated yet, but computershare has countries outside the US (Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, United Kingdom) listed, implying that if I ever move to one of those countries I could buy shares in my name and get access to direct voting and dividends and all the other joys of being a real shareholder. \n\nTLDR: I was curious how to own my shares directly, not through some shell corporation owned by a bulgarian vampire, so I found out and decided to share with the few of you retards who can actually read.",

(See down below)\n\n1. Should I take profits?\n2. If so, how much of the position should I sell?\n3. Should I wait till the 25th of this month to wait for  long term capital gains?\n\nThank you all for the entertainment and knowledge, please leave any questions, comments, or concerns down below!",

        "selftext": "**Unknown AR/VR**\n\nEveryone knows that companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Facebook are turning to AR/VR. For instance, we have the Microsoft/MVIS \u201crelationship\u201d, Apple [smart glasses](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-glasses) coming, Google glasses having already been out, and Zuck spending **much** of his $5B R&amp;D on AR/VR. As the sector grows, these mega-companies can either develop their own tech\u2014and many will, in part\u2014or acquire / partner with smaller players. Many will do that too. So the question is: which of these smaller companies do you believe in?\n\n**MVIS Craze**\n\nMany of you have recently been burnt by MVIS. It certainly had an appealing storyline, full of speculation, intrigue, and the promise of a trip to the moon. Maybe things will turn around. But all I know is that **I\u2019m** putting my money elsewhere. After the events of this past week, and after reading this, I wonder if you\u2019ll decide to join me...\n\nBecause Kopin, $KOPN, is fucking underloved here. Why? Well, I think it\u2019s mostly because it\u2019s simply not as well known. But here\u2019s the thing: stocks tend to be unknown until they\u2019re not. And, ideally, you want to buy in before that large scale recognition occurs. See below for an illustration of this very point:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7qmncpk8eww61.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c0f849a53aef7e6a42859ad0178ba757f703f51\n\nSo what *is* Kopin? [Taken from another DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lgdk0p/kopn_and_why_i_believe_it_has_100_upside_potential/):\n\n**\u201cKOPN (Kopin Corporation)** is best known for its display devices for mobile electronics. The company was founded by engineers from MIT and currently holds hundreds of patents that are applicable to \\[Virtual and\\] Augmented Reality. Some of the most promising patents involve wearable technology and voice recognition-based headsets.\n\nIn the past several years, Kopin has contracted with the U.S. Department of Defense to research wearable head-mounted computers for soldiers. They have supplied defense technology for several defense companies including Rockwell Collins, Raytheon, and BAE. But defense is just a fractional part of Kopin's growth potential.\u201d\n\nEssentially, Kopin competes in the same space as MVIS and VUZI. But they\u2019re not exactly playing the same game.\n\n**Tech**\n\nFirst, KOPN\u2019s tech and patents mentioned here are highly promising. I\u2019ll talk a bit more about them, but feel free to check out this cool series of webinars [yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5E4WsPVOYY&amp;feature=youtu.be). Another thing to do is read the linked article; Kopin recently shipped its first batch of OLED [microdisplays](https://www.oled-info.com/kopin-developeds-double-stack-oled-architecture-higher-brightness-oled). They have their own double-stack architecture which enhances battery life and image fidelity\u2014two components that will be key for things like consumer electronics. I believe they will win in this space.\n\nThey also have a chip for voice activation called [Whisper](https://www.kopin.com/audio-solutions/), which they\u2019ve filed over 20 patents for. They claim that \u201cWhisper maintained an accuracy rate of 93 percent in a 95 dB noise environment, compared to competitive products, which maintained an accuracy rate of just 40 percent or less.\u201d Given how people will want to use their smart glasses hands-free, this will be key. And based on the above quote, they will win here too.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s worth mentioning the company\u2019s military connections. Many don\u2019t realize this, but Kopin is the [largest](https://www.kopin.com/military-applications/) supplier of microdisplays for the U.S. military. Think things like thermal weapon sights, night vision goggles and pilot helmet mounted displays for F-35 fighter jets. This is quite a testimonial in my opinion; the military doesn\u2019t play when it comes to technology\u2026\n\nAll of this tech is protected via over 200 wearables-related patents, and 20 patents related to OLED. Their tech advantage is also reflected by their blue-chip customer base, which really speaks for itself:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x3eahi0aeww61.png?width=1712&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04aca0376fa0226a2db864ef9cd8b30895763dee\n\nI\u2019d encourage any technical people to delve more into Kopin and their customers to really understand the power of their patents and product offering. Maybe leave a comment below!\n\n**Financials**\n\nFor every bet, including \u201cinformed bets\u201d like the stock market, there are two key components: the cost of the ticket and the payout potential. What I like about $KOPN is that you are paying *hugely* \u201cless\u201d to bet on the future of AR/VR (at least relative to competitors). Essentially, $KOPN is in a highly appealing financial position, with the potential for \u201chype\u201d\u2014which hasn\u2019t really moved the stock as drastically\u2014serving as a nice call option on the stock. First, check out the Kopin quarterly income statement:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lgodi0yaeww61.png?width=1146&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=478c34aa29ca6398ffce3570102f6e606108c81f\n\nA few trends stick out. First, the company is steadily growing revenues, while maintaining a reasonable GPM. They are also increasing R&amp;D spend, which is important for a company in a burgeoning and highly technological sector. But really, the most exciting trend is that of Operating Income margin, which has gone from negative to positive, along with EPS!\n\nThe company also posted $34.9 million in LTM revenue as of the last quarter. Compare this to MVIS, with $3 million over the same time frame. Now, it\u2019s quite clear that this company presents *at least* an equally attractive financial situation as MVIS, by any standard definition.\n\nFurther, if this trajectory continues and other things hold, the company would continue to post positive EPS\u2014which is something that competitors like VUZI or MVIS simply cannot claim. After the last earnings report, where Kopin flipped EPS positive, the stock reacted extremely well, shooting up over 20%. What will happen if they improve even further?\n\nThe company is also not likely, in my opinion, to undertake any significant dilutive actions, or to go bankrupt. This is because they have an attractive balance sheet with **no debt**. So let\u2019s put it like this: you are getting positive EPS, with a good balance sheet, at an $875 million market cap. Compare this to MVIS at a $3.3 billion market cap, with negative EPS, or VUZI at a $1.5 billion market cap\u2014and also with negative EPS! In my view, you \u201cpay\u201d much less to bet on AR/VR with KOPN.\n\nSo what do you *get* if you\u2019re \u201cpaying less?\u201d\n\n**Catalysts**\n\nFirst, you get access to a market growing at a rather nice CAGR. Since Kopin will be a major player in this market, you can simply check this estimation from the KOPN corporate presentation. Assuming KOPIN gets a mere 1% of this spend, they will be shockingly undervalued here.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dey6u3kieww61.png?width=1346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=add762fbaf92cf4bb5cd9cf01fffa23f2ee1f43d\n\nBut perhaps more excitingly, you get access to a near-term series of catalysts which could see the share price appreciate significantly. Here\u2019s a potential timeline, which doesn\u2019t include the potential for surprise events:\n\n* **May 4th Earnings Call**\n* May 12 Webinar II - Present AR / VR\n* May 26 Webinar III - Future AR / VR\n* June 6-7 Stifel Tech Conference\n* June 7-9 Apple WorldWide Developers Conference\n\nThis presents numerous \u201cshots on goal\u201d for $KOPN.\n\nOf course, ultimately the company\u2019s fate depends on performance, because the ticker has traded largely without hype, at least when compared to MVIS or VUZI. Consider the following comparison of the three companies to get an idea how little followed and undervalued KOPN is. First, the MVIS financial \u201chighlights\u201d:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ll5yanrceww61.png?width=2210&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1332365538f72d4032f63ad5cc06112d577b89aa\n\nNow, VUZI:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o7qop3hdeww61.png?width=1838&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce7c45622355639fe57d46c131c39c4b45539b12\n\nA bit better than MVIS, but still\u2026\n\nAnd, finally, KOPN:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6c9f78ceeww61.png?width=1978&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00bea97b3e6438e79fcfecfc4529168df40f4bc3\n\nNow, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have a million of you reeeing out, telling me how I just don\u2019t understand the tech, and tHat MVIS wIlL gO tO tHe mOOn. That\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not here to convince anyone. All I\u2019m doing is suggesting that you, rubbing together your two brain cells, **look through the above and play spot the trend.** Then ask yourself: as this market grows, which of these companies do you believe in?\n\nPersonally, I believe in the recently newly profitable technology leader partnered with Lockheed Martin, FLIR, and Google.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n**Long $KOPN.** \n\n*Disclaimer: Long KOPN.

Ethereum has made me some significant gains and I\u2019ve been thinking about pulling money from my fidelity and into Webull to buy more Ethereum, but I know that could be very bad..\n\nWhat would y\u2019all do?",

(my estimated date of completion was 05/13 but it completed yesterday 05/05 and shares were available in my Fidelity account when I checked this morning 05/06).\n\n\\- In initiating a full transfer, it seems Fidelity actually paid that $75 transfer fee because **there was a $75 cash debit balance** that was transferred into my Fidelity account **along with my GME shares**.\n\n\\- And now i just had to deposit $75 into my fidelity account (which they're much quicker about) to maintain my account balance without any negative cash debits.\n\n\\- This route was FAR EASIER than having to go about the deposit $75 into Webull, wait for it to clear and then settle, then partial transfer, and wait for the partial transfer to complete...\n\nI think this is a GOOD OPTION for ***those who do NOT already have a $75 settled cash balance in their Webull accounts***...like me, i didn't have $75 in settled cash and to ACH deposit, wait for it to clear, and then wait for it to settle in my Webull account would take about 7-10 days...plus the time it takes to complete the partial transfer from Webull into fidelity......I suggest instead of going through that hassle, to initiate a full transfer as it will only take about 3-4 days (took my friend 3, took me 4 but this could have been due to me initiating the transfer on a Friday evening).\n\n\\- However, if you DO have a $75 settled cash balance in your Webull account, then based on previous posts, my suggestion would be to just initiate a partial transfer through Fidelity as there would be no reason for the transfer request to be held up from Webull's end. This partial transfer, based on previous posts, seems to be completing in \\~2 days as opposed to the full transfer's duration of \\~3-4 days.\n\nJust wanted to shed some light on this as I know there are many apes who are reluctant to transfer their shares into a broker with the assets to back up their positions...but if you're hesitating from transferring from Webull due to the $75 transfer fee etc, then I think this post should help you in getting your GME shares over to Fidelity ASAP based on your individual situation.",

Which I find quite confusing as it has been proven time and time again why they are here and what their true motives are. Sure, their platform is easy and convenient, but is that worth getting bent over and robbed?\n\nI would bet many bananas and guess that most of you apes have not read the RH user agreement. I will admit, I am not one to read through all agreements I come across; however, I DO read agreements when it comes to any and all of my finances.\n\n**Exhibit A:** This is a screenshot of Robinhood's User Agreement (PDF link posted at the bottom).

They are not here to help the retail investor in any way. **They are here to make money.**\n\nThat being said, I leave everyone with this:\n\nLeave Robinhood, preferably choose a bigger named broker like Fidelity, or TD Ameritrade to name a couple. If you don't leave and you choose to stay, that is your choice, but when you get boned, and you will, don't come to the subs to cry and complain.

        "selftext": " \n\njust to clarify, other than this i am a normal teenager, I have a social life, i have a video game addiction, I am studying for my exams, I am just also interested in investing, and eventually financial freedom.\n\nSo i am 16, and am opening my first actual account with fidelity under 18 accounts. my father wants me to do this properly and be aware of the taxes and all that, unlike before (he just bought companies for me with my money) i don't know how much exactly, but my dad is willing to invest a sizable amount ( i suspect in the ball part of 10k).\n\nanyway, we plan to dollar cost average in, buy a few companies and hold long term while learning how to actually judge companies and pick good ones for the long term.\n\nmy objectives are two-fold with this;\n\nuse my skills from school and from this to actually learn about different companies by doing DD, practice reading financial documents, etc. I plan to also have a section of the portfolio be broad market ETF\u00b4s, as That seems like a secure way to go for long-term growth.\n\nhopefully, build up a somewhat sizable portfolio that I can add to during college and can help me with my long term aspirations and financial security (get a head start on compound interest)\n\nbut so far here is my plan: for my first 3 picks:\n\nAMD is currently at quite a discount at 77$ a share. It has good revenue and year after year growth. With A P/E ratio of 33, it is growing rapidly in the semiconductor market and has contracts to produce chips with both Sony and Microsoft. A rather stable company with a bright future and a competitive moat over intel, main competitor, as well.\n\nAAPL\n\nA very big household name with a strong balance sheet and solid growth, Apple seems like a relatively safe bet while still ensuring growth. its FAAANG as well, so that's good.\n\nNET\n\nA more speculative long-term play, but a company that again, has a healthy balance sheet. Growing more than 50% YoY. provides fast internet and also deals in internet safety, with an ambitious vision to build \u201c a better internet\u201d.\n\nI want to make sure i have a good blend of stable picks while also investing in companies that still have room to grow.\n\nthoughts? ideas? suggestions?\n\nman, i realize how nerdy and how I sound like such a recluse. I\u00b4m honestly not.",

        "selftext": "I'm sure many people are aware that the Fidelity app isn't letting people log in on their phones. I found a workaround though that doesn't involve needd to log in at a computer.\n\nOn your phone, turn off your wifi and try to log back in and it worked for me. You can then turn on wifi again and the app works normally. For some reason today, when wifi is turned on, the app won't let me log in.\n\nThey probably pushed some kind of bad update somewhere.",

        "selftext": "I have been experiencing issues with Fidelity Trader Pro platform freezing between market open and the first 5min of trading. This has cost me a lot of money. I reported it to Fidelity yesterday which the tech told me to restart the platform within 5min of market open. He said they have been getting a lot of reports of this. We'll same thing happened today and screwed me out of a lot of money. I called Fidelity spoke with a \"Supervisor\" who told me this is the first they are hearing of this and there is no notes in my account so they can't actually prove I called and reported this issue. I told them they need to make my account right which obviously they declined comment. I know it is not my computer which the Supervisor obviously tried to blame",

        "selftext": "Do not use fidelity. While in the process of making trades I randomly got a message saying I couldn't place or sell orders because a restriction was placed on the account. Totally confused, I emailed them. No response. At the end of the day I called and literally all they could tell me was they didn't know why and someone would call back the next day. No one calls. I call again the next day, they again say they don't know why and someone will call me. Meanwhile I'm losing money on stocks I can't sell and losing money on orders I couldn't execute. Third day I've had enough and tell them I'm closing my account and tell them to liquidate my stocks (at a fucking loss) and wire my money back to my bank. After HOURS of going back and forth on hold, they ask why money was sent to the account from someone else (nothing like this ever happened). They then ask other questions that further led me to believe they had no idea what they were talking about. I tell them they are the worst brokerage firm I've ever dealt with, and the cunts actually refuse to wire my money to my bank. They delay (intentionally I'm sure) and eventually agree only to do an ACH transfer (will take a week) despite the fact they do wire transfers all the damn time. 3 of the 4 people I spoke to were absolute beligerent and argumentative cunts, and it seemed they had no idea what was actually going on. Again, DO NOT USE FIDELITY.",

        "selftext": "Sorry I am somewhat of a noob, put in money I could stand to lose ($1,500 or so) into meme stocks, still holding a small quantity of GME, but traded out a few hundred for about $7 gain (LMAO) from other volatile stocks (TSLA, AAPL, AMZN AND PLTR). I wanted to trade in indexes but it seemed that Fidelity has some limitations to what indexes you can trade and I cannot seem to find out why the limitations or what can be traded on that platform!\nThanks to a recent post by u/ I found VTI and SCHG, can anyone help me find a list? Because I am lost on this one!! (SCHG looks promising though) \nThanks in advance for the help! Or thanks for tearing me a new one!",
